  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fascinating detective story of Lurkmore's wrestling with locks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Roskomnadzor again turned its gaze to the famous site Lurkmore.  Sacred struggle with pedophiles and drug addicts can lead to a new blocking of this resource.  At the same time, the authorities <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/11188/">threaten to ban the entire resource</a> due to the fact that he switched to using the HTTPS protocol.  But he's not used to it.  Let's dive into the exciting story of Lurk‚Äôs confrontation with the supervisory authorities. <br><br>  For the first time, the state was outraged by the presence of Lurka in November 2012 in connection with the mention of drugs in resource articles.  The initiator of the lock made Gosnarkokontrol.  The resource was immediately <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/9446/">added to the list of banned sites</a> , but it was not limited to a specific page of the article, which was not to their liking - they immediately brought the entire ip-address.  The resource quickly changed the ip, and then "took measures to eliminate" unwanted content (put the plugs on the article "Hemp" and "Hemp / Methods of Use"), and therefore it was <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/158423/">removed from the list of prohibited</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All this caused a big stir in the Internet environment, since the action took place shortly after the launch of the blocking mechanism (see " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/189686/">Law against the Internet</a> ").  Ironically, this series of events led to an explosive growth in resource attendance. <br><br>  In August 2013, several sites organized an <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/188556/">‚ÄúInternet strike‚Äù</a> against pre-trial blocking of sites.  In the strike on the rights of one of the victims participated and Lurk.  As you know, the action did not lead to any results.  In the same month, by the decision of a court located in the jurisdiction of the Republic of Adygea, they tried to block the domain of Lurka.  The court was offended by the definition of Adygea as a " <a href="https://lurkmore.to/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F">tomato republic</a> ".  But because of the spelling error in the domain, the resource lock did not take place.

      At the end of 2014, fate again turned to Lurkomorye in the wrong place.  At first, the center for combating extremism <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/society/24/11/2014/54736339cbb20f56375d38c3">meticulously clarified the</a> details of the appearance on the resource of an article about the Molotov cocktail and Ramzan Kadyrov.  The owner of the resource, Dmitry Khomak, said that he tried to explain to the authorities the principle of how the resource works.  Due to the fact that the articles were edited by an unlimited number of persons, it is impossible in principle to identify their authors.  This story has not yet been continued. <br><br>  Then Valery Syutkin accidentally found out that his face was used as a meme calling for <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5">beating women in the face</a> .  The meme works in contrast to the rude appeal and the pretty face of a strictly positive artist.  And since it is impossible to do anything with an Internet meme (see <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4">Streisand Effect</a> ), the singer's lawyers decided to pay attention to the article describing this meme.  The article <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2014/12/09/lurkmore/">is still on the resource</a> , which indicates the failure of a lawsuit. <br><br>  And closer to the end of December, the resource again <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243527/">entered the registry because of articles about drugs</a> .  But this time, the blockers acted more carefully, and did not add ip there - they banned only a few specific pages. <br><br>  Lurkmore is an unusual resource.  It is distinguished by an informal approach, an abundance of irony and sarcasm in articles.  Unceremoniousness and obscene language, however, do not interfere with the creation of really interesting materials.  For example, personally to me, of all the explanations of the general theory of relativity, it seems the most accessible is <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%259E%25D0%25A2%25D0%259E">Lurkovskaya</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377201/</a></p>
