  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why admin ITSM</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/102301/">Windows admin</a> asked me whether to get an ITIL Foundation certificate.  I nodded.  The sleepy networker who was sitting next to him immediately started up, showed the downloaded ITIL v3 pentateuch in a vector (!) Pdf and proudly added that you should know ‚Äúthat's all.‚Äù  Right here nod my head did not rise. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Lyrical digression... </h2><br>  I myself have been in ITSM for a long time, I received all the certificates.  Yes, only in life nothing has changed, My man-hour did not cost more, the profile of work has not changed, there are no gray cells in my head.  In general, the standardization of technology generates a bunch of secondary markets, including the market for certification of knowledge gained by specialists.  Apparently, a certificate of the N-th level is needed to personnel officers and certification centers.  The first is to choose between the resumes with unintelligible words, the most suitable, the second is to build on the mechanisms for pumping money out of specialists.  But does IT certification need this certification?  I doubt it ... <br><br>  It is clear that the library of useful advice of the British is very supportive of the rationality of thinking of any IT person.  In this seemingly related topic lies a big problem.

      The admin sees a huge layer of interconnections above his favorite glands, higher level communication protocols, so to speak.  He feels his strength and is eagerly exploring new levels of the IT system hierarchy, in which technologies that are understandable to him are transformed into IT services and begin to make money.  Hoping that by grasping this metaphysics, he will be able to ‚Äúmake services‚Äù as he did configs.  Well, this is if our admin is a creative person.  And in life, an ITEM for him begins in two cases: when they demand from above or when there ‚Äî above ‚Äî he decided to go himself. <br><br><h2>  And then they flew away and we started ... certification </h2><br>  Outwardly, everything seems to be normal, like with any certification  For the basic exam, you need to know the terms and large strokes of the role-playing games: who, what, why.  Then you choose who you will be - a practitioner or an architect and pass on several logically combined exams.  Gain points.  As a practitioner, you should be able to work out a solution to a problem (in preparation and on the exam, it is - a problem in the form of a case and your solution).  As an architect, the same tasks, only at the exit you have no plan of action, encyclopedic accurate unloading of uniquely interrelated quotes from books.  The implementation plan is no longer your business.  Scored points for the final exam, passed it (mega task for 6 hours) and you are ITIL Master. <br><br>  Great, what's the catch?  Books are muddy.  They are written only for architects.  Practices were not given instructions there.  Even courses consist of pieces of all five books, plus the experience of consultants.  Since the admin is a practitioner, this nonsense kagbe is incomprehensible to him.  And to cover the entire system is about how to keep in mind a five-layer subway map with vertical branching crossings.  You can understand, remember - no. <br><br>  Naked theory is then generally unclear how to monetize (well, you don‚Äôt, in fact, go to a system integrator for an infantry position as a system analyst, in order to optimize the options for processing typical changes for days).  A practitioner can weigh up his resume weighty and at any time eliminate career deflections, extracting the right words and attaching any technology to a single system.  They all go to practice.  And they learn - nothing.  Because there is no technique. <br><br><h2>  You look in the book - you see boobs </h2><br>  What does the admin understand when trying to figure it out? <br><br>  First, his cute servers and scripts are important, but they are important only to him.  There, above, where there is money to pay for its upgrades, new licenses, salaries and beer - think in other categories.  The elegance of technical solutions they do not care there, if only the mail went and the buttons in the interface was smaller.  And the truth is: why should they, users, suffer for such and such grandmothers? <br><br>  Secondly: when its infrastructure becomes part of the service, you need to pay great attention not to studying interesting new products or polishing the skill of sculpting configs, but to accessibility, continuity and performance.  In other words, monitor the status of devices, conduct routine inspections, plan downtime and repairs.  In general, the fuzz is solid.  Boredom.  Routine.  Bue <br><br>  Thirdly, the admin clearly understands that the utilization makes it an interchangeable part in the eyes of the service architect.  The latter takes the requirements for the service and builds a service design package, where it collects resources for it.  And these resources strangely include not only hardware and software, but also a certain number of people with such and such certificates.  Their work has a goal, man-hours are painted - spin, Gadget.  Who would like it? <br><br><h2>  Hacked a window to Europe and saw the same ... </h2><br>  And then the admin has a personal such a small crisis. <br><br>  There is practically no career growth in Russian IT.  Because there is no big business.  Because there is no free market.  Because the state has more and more, and how we love IT there, we all know.  Only sawdust fly. <br><br>  Even in a single business, a mature IT organization rests on the immature organization of the business itself.  And too smart IT people start changing their jobs often for some reason ... <br><br>  In the west, where these standards are invented, a different culture.  They tend to spend less and get more.  There they are ready to change the management ideology, so that the garbage bags at the exit from the conveyor will become cheaper by 6.5%. <br><br>  And our collapse starts right away.  Why in Russia 90% of ITSM implementations end with the introduction of a call management process?  Everything is very simple - after the service desk, the processes from a different culture, from the western one, begin.  Where each participant is personally liable.  In Roissy, which, as you know, first, personally, only point to the door.  There is no teamwork anywhere, all the loner-geniuses. <br><br>  And it turns out that the admin only becomes sadder from such knowledge.  He was not accustomed (as consultants) to make promising presentations, to chop up the dough, to pass the barely warm system into the OPA and dump it.  He builds these systems, tyunit, heals, raises, in general, he exploits.  As ITSMschik would say, it tries to give the expected value. <br><br>  Processes in themselves do not give such value in our country.  More precisely, give, but it is not needed by anyone. <br><br>  Admin at an impasse.  The method is there, it is possible to understand and build according to the instructions, but why?  To start doing the boring part of the work?  To become a cog?  To turn into a goat-consultant? <br><br>  Honest admin refuses. <br><br>  My Windows went to take ITIL Foundation ... <br><br>  Probably, he was tired of being an honest admin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102433/</a></p>
