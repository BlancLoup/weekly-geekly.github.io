Top expert of the Institute for Internet Development (section "information security"). <br>  <b>Luka Safonov</b> is the technical director of Pentestit, the author of numerous reports and studies in the field of practical information security, a speaker at international forums and conferences.  He has more than 10 years of practical experience in testing the penetration of information systems of the state, financial and e-commerce sectors.  Expert of the Institute for Internet Development (section "information security"). <br><br>  Together, Luka and Roman will talk about the types of attacks on the organization‚Äôs network perimeter and network security perimeter. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Stanislav Sidristy - Solutions Architect at Luxoft - will give three presentations at once</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39b/a85/93a/39ba8593a6a24593ae165086b88817cc.jpg" align="left" height="150">  He participated in many projects of the company, was engaged in the development and automation of testing both .NET / WPF applications and Java / Groovy Web applications.  During his work practice he developed for a huge range of platforms: Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, set top boxes, self-written OS.  Supervised both development and testing. <br><br>  Earlier it was noticed at conferences: Application Developer Days, Apps4All Forum, DataArt IT talks, .NEXT, CLRium # 1, CLRium # 2. <br><br>  I will come with three excellent presentations and cover the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Overview and limitations of various types of products on the test automation market </li><li>  Test automation solutions for large, scalable systems </li><li>  Select from each approach "Wishlist" and make the perfect framework </li><li>  Which is already used in a very large enterprise and in which everything is automated.  Where testing specialists practically do not do manual UI testing.  Only if a UAT server is required.  And, having spent a lot of time on this project, I can say with full confidence: we have developed the best possible approach in our teams.  The order of automated UI tests is about 50 thousand, which, running on CI servers at night, allows large companies to save thousands of man-hours per year.  And testing specialists have kilometers of nerve cells. </li><li>  Maximum reuse of test logic.  Most of the test scripts are coded without new steps / sidedings. </li><li>  Unification of the platform, creation of a cross-platform testing language and, as a result, unification of a testing specialist. </li></ul><br>  Further, for each of the platforms I will tell about: <br><ul><li>  Testing WPF Applications </li><li>  Testing WinForms Applications </li><li>  Testing ASP.NET applications (UI) </li><li>  Server side testing (.NET) </li><li>  Testing the server side (Java) </li></ul><br><br><hr><br>  <b>Konstantin Neradovskiy - a functional approach to the development of Java autotests</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/2ab/56c/3c62ab56c3834bf08d145e770c3bd606.jpg" align="left" height="150">  When in one department more than 20 systems are being automated at the same time, the issue of re-usability, quality and support of the code arises very sharply.  We use industry standards, open technologies and open source projects - maven, selenium, cucumber, yandex.allure.  My tasks are the technological development of our auto-testing platform and it is interesting to write auto-tests. <br><br>  The main achievement is that automation has become in demand from the departments and departments of functional testing.  Developed with my direct participation, the new technological platform - BDD autotests, java, selenium, appium, has significantly accelerated the implementation of autotests, reduce support costs and, most importantly, it is convenient to use by manual testers.  If earlier, the regression of individual automated systems took a week, but now it takes place several times a day. <br><br>  Developers of autotests instead of proprietary tools began to use java, maven, selenium.  That, firstly, is faster and more convenient in development and does not bind to a specific tool.  Secondly, it is just much more interesting.  And interest is a very strong motivation. <br><br>  In my report, the discussion will deal with all those practices that led our department to such success. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Igor Shcheglovitov - automated testing with Microsoft</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/681/b8d/d43/681b8dd43ade488f859780a98f9fe862.jpg" align="left" height="150">  Senior Testing Engineer for the Cloud Services Research and Development Team at Kaspersky Lab and Microsoft ALM Ranger.  Experience in testing 7+.  I am engaged in the development of automated tests, as well as test frameworks on the .NET platform.  I also have extensive experience in load testing and performance analysis.  Over the past year he was a speaker at 5 major development conferences. <br><br>  Articles on Habr√© are tagged, and therefore can be easily found: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255Bmstesting%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">#mstesting</a> <br><br>  The report will look at the latest Microsoft tools that can simplify and simultaneously improve your existing testing process.  You will meet with new systems for continuous integration and diagnostics.  Learn how to conduct cloud load testing and create controlled environments for testing and development in Azure.  In addition, we will look at new items in unit testing, in particular IntelliTest (a framework for generating tests).  In conclusion, some tricks will be considered to improve the efficiency of automated testing. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Galya Galkina - calculating the risk category - an approach to managing a regression TM</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41b/ba8/7b1/41bba87b15b94616848bd029e00f1213.jpg" align="left" height="150">  JSC Sberbank Technologies, Quality Department, Head of the Department for Testing Automated Banking Systems.

I also had a little experience as a Project Manager and even a Game Designer.  On this way I gained various knowledge and would like to share it with you.  I was lucky enough to take part in various conferences such as SQA Days, Agile Days, IT Week, IT Subbotnik and EuroStar, including as a speaker.  Now I am engaged in improving the testing processes, including automation in the Epam Life Sciences business unit, developing and promoting our frameworks and solutions and would be happy to help not only my colleagues, but you as well. <br><br>  First talk: "Jedi Power of Model-based testing": <br><ul><li>  An overview of the evolution of the automation tester from Junior (Padavan) to Master (Jedi Master) </li><li>  Brief description of what is testing using models </li><li>  What profits this approach carries and what are the subtleties and problems </li><li>  How to solve them using micro-models </li></ul><br><br>  Second talk: "JDI - Future of UI Automation": <br><ul><li>  About UI Automation and PageObjects Template in Brief </li><li>  Brief overview of the main practices of BDD, KDD, DDT </li><li>  Examples of how the framework allows you to quickly start writing quality tests without dancing with a tambourine at the beginning of a project </li><li>  Additional features freymovrka.

Responsible for testing automation and testing infrastructure stability in the Turn-by-turn Guidance team. <br>  He was also responsible for load testing and monitoring server telemetry in MMORPG Skyforge, was engaged in testing features aimed at combating the load and preserving QoS as it increased. <br><br>  In my report, I will talk about how you can configure Continuous Integration so that you do not have to run after developers with a stick and ‚Äúask‚Äù to fix the build.  In HERE every day we run about 60k builds, most of all tests run for every change in the code.  This is done so that bad code, in principle, could not get into the master.  We use Gerrit, Jenkins, Docker and Amazon cloud services.  There will also be considered scaling problems that we encountered and how we managed to solve them. <br><br><hr><br><br><h1>  When and where? </h1><br>  Registration links: <br><ul><li>  We have opened a <a href="http://qaconf.ru/">great site</a> where you can read about all the speakers, and about all the reports.
