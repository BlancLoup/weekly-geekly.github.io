An example of this is our <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/">next project</a> , which we undertook with our partners from <a href="http://www.shumgam.com/">Shumgam</a> : launching a probe with a video camera into the stratosphere.  Yes, this is the good old launch of the weather probe, but with the difference that it will be accompanied by a <b>live video broadcast</b> to Earth, and everyone can participate in the project, and with several interesting features (we hope).  Details under the cut. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/80/a9/80a95603e8ed5d8c91e2355cf57c79ce.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Speaking with the staff of the Pulkovo Observatory, we learned that in the 1960s, many discoveries were made as a result of the launch of amateur weather probes.  Over time, the equipment developed more intensively, the case completely passed into public hands, then one after another, and the interest in private start-ups began to decline.

      At the same time, amateurs in the Western world continued to develop their passion.  Basic technical skills, ingenuity and a minimum of equipment allowed schoolchildren, students, fathers with sons to launch probes not only with meteorological sensors, but also with photo or video equipment.  The absence of bureaucratic barriers made such launches even more frequent.  As a result, surprisingly beautiful amateur surveys of the Earth from a height of 20-30 km (stratosphere) appeared.  There were an incredibly large number of such launches, especially considering the increasing cheapness of soap trays in zero.  About it wrote and on Habr√© (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/54901/">time</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/89751/">two</a> ).  These included commercial launches (for example, <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-01/25/samsung-space-planes">Samsung</a> ).  Lego went even further, making its launch in 2008 an international project, <a href="http://www.unr.edu/nevadasat/HALE/">bringing together</a> enthusiasts from 5 countries.  These are just a few examples, to list everything - it would be almost impossible. <br><br>  A few years ago, interest in probes was renewed in Russia, especially in 2011, on the anniversary year for astronautics.  Residents of Habr also made attempts ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/119425/">one of the last</a> ).  Before, I remember, there were a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4/">few more</a> .  Probably the most famous example of private launches is the April launch of the Garnelis family.  Just a <a href="http://nightnat.livejournal.com/170563.html">work of art</a> .  In the same month, our current partners ‚ÄúShumgam‚Äù in St. Petersburg launched their probe from the roof of the planetarium.  Preparing for six months, but it turned out successfully and very beautifully. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/24396000&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgU4v16EKxalqdssJp6DmzdUBdSuA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Project Mahiko: reach out to space" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  What is special about our launch </h4><br>  Since history already knows so many examples of launching a probe, it would seem, why launch another one, and even talk about it loudly.  When we embarked on this project, we thought about that and diversified it. <br><br><h5>  Live broadcast </h5><br>  As far as we know, this will be the first amateur attempt to conduct a live broadcast of such filming.  Usually, the video is extracted later, when there is a probe itself (if there is one).  We want to equip our unit with a system from a radio receiver and a radio transmitter, which will allow to transmit a video signal up to a height of 2-5 km, and if it is lucky, it will be higher.  Even with minimal efficiency, it will be possible to see the whole of Moscow, and not only live.  Just in case we have a plan ‚ÄúB‚Äù - signal transmission via WiFi.  We are pleased to devote a separate article to a detailed description of the work of both models. <br><br><h5>  Scientific component </h5><br>  We plan to use weather sensors to measure temperature and barometric pressure and a Geiger counter.  That is, our probe should be a weather probe in the classical sense. <br><br><h5>  Different angles </h5><br>  Usually only one camcorder is used.  However, for a better video, several angles are needed.  Therefore, in the flight we send not one, but 2 cameras (maybe in the end it will turn out more). <br><br><h5>  Collective approach </h5><br>  Despite the fact that our team has experience in assembling and launching probes, we decided that it was necessary to attract as many people as possible to this process, therefore we launched a <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/zond/konkurs/">competition</a> for the best idea in terms of design and / or design.  Regardless of experience or technical knowledge, anyone can make their investment in the project and subsequently call it their own. <br><br><h5>  Mass Astronomical Event </h5><br>  One of our popular events is the <a href="http://www.4glaza.ru/G-project/doa-msk/">Day of Open Astronomy</a> (sidewalks, open astronomical observations).  Usually the observations take place in the evening, but on the occasion of the launch we will conduct them during the day, pointing telescopes at the Sun, with special equipment and - again - broadcast on the screen.  By tradition, the observations will be accompanied by a couple of lectures on the topic (one of them is the history of the <a href="http://selenokhod.com/">Selenokhod</a> ). <br><br><h5>  Collective probe searches </h5><br>  When the ball begins its return to Earth, we will organize an expedition to search for it.  The winner of the race, who delivered the probe safely and securely, gets a telescope with auto-aiming. <br><br><h5>  Official status </h5><br>  Usually, the probe starts without permission.  It is believed that if not caught, then you can.  We decided not to do this, turned to the Air Traffic Control Department, and ... well, this is a very difficult, or rather, a long journey through state institutions, but we intend to go through to the end (we can, if the readers want it, highlight under this topic a separate article). <br><br><h4>  The design summary </h4><br>  The basic design is standard and is based on the Shumgam-1 probe. <br><br>  <b>Components:</b> <br><ul><li>  box (20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm); </li><li>  2 HD Hero GoPro camcorders; </li><li>  GSM GPS tracker and GlobalSat tracker; </li><li>  radio receiver and radio transmitter; </li><li>  self-opening parachute; </li><li>  balloon (filled with helium, volume - 2.5 m). </li></ul><br>  <b>Weight:</b> 1.5 kg. <br>  <b>Approximate flight time:</b> 2 hours; <br>  <b>Approximate altitude:</b> 20-30 km; <br>  <b>Approximate landing radius:</b> 200 km. <br><br>  However, you can make changes, which we will do based on suggestions from the Internet audience. <br><br>  The principle of operation is simple.  The balloon filled with helium raises the box with the equipment in height, flies along a curve of 20-30 km.  Reaching the critical point, the ball is broken under pressure.  At this point, the parachute opens, and the structure is lowered to the ground.  During the flight, the camera continues to shoot.  The built-in GPS tracker allows you to determine where the device has landed. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  We hope everything goes well.  We still have 2 months to plan and organize the event.  We are looking forward to comments, tips, questions and criticism from the Habr community. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> all proposals for the technical implementation of the design, regardless of the complexity or ease of execution, are welcome as official bidders. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120207/</a></p>
