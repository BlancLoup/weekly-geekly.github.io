We make for the business visual reports on marketing, sales, finance, logistics based on the leading analytical platforms Qlik Sense, Power BI, Tableau. <br><br>  In BI platforms, the visual component is very important.  If you have watched dozens of demo reports of BI systems and you don‚Äôt like how this or that platform looks like, then most likely you will not implement it, even if you are satisfied with the price and technical specifications.  Based on this, it is necessary to see the same data in different analytical platforms, so that you can compare. <br><br>  And it is desirable that the data were interesting ... :-)

    <h2>  Where did the idea to make this report come from? </h2><br>  Several years ago, the Higher School of Economics published an article about pricing the services of girls of low social responsibility in Moscow.  These were aggregated analysis data of 1,800 questionnaires.  We found the data that is behind these findings of HSE sociologists interesting.  And we decided to work on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Key ideas: <br><br><ul><li>  Show not only the conclusions that lie on the surface, but the data on which they were built; </li><li>  To enable those who wish to independently analyze the patterns, put forward a hypothesis and test it. </li><li>  Elaboration should include a large sample of questionnaires to increase accuracy; </li><li>  Show not only the "market offer", but also the demand based on statistical data in search engines; </li></ul><br><h2>  Data sources: </h2><br><ul><li>  SQL database of questionnaires *, formed on the basis of one site, included in the TOP 3 rankings in Yandex and Google search engines. </li><li>  Excel-file with relevant ** queries on the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãanalysis. </li><li>  Excel file with the historical frequency of queries in the Yandex search engine. </li><li>  Excel file with the frequency of queries in the Google search engine. </li></ul><br>  * A parser was used to collect information.  Data parsing was done once. <br>  ** The tool for the selection of relevant queries was <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> <br><br><h2>  Business roles &amp; USER-story </h2><br>  In normal projects, we always specify who will use the analytics and which questions (direct or indirect) a person wants to find answers. <br><br>  But that's bad luck - this project has no customer.  Therefore, we had to invent three roles and their questions. <br><br>  So the roles we have the following: <br><br><ol><li>  Low social responsibility girl </li><li>  Site administrator with profiles </li><li>  Property owner </li></ol><br><h3>  The girl with low social responsibility </h3><br>  "Indie" Elvira is 25 years old.  Looks good, familiar men estimate her age in the region of 19-20 years.  Goes in for sports, attends a solarium, a healthy diet, a good manicure and everything.  She used to live well, not really deny something.  But such a lifestyle requires a lot of money.  Office work, she believes, is not for her.  She loves sex and does not see something shameful in this activity.  Economic education and analytical mind pushed her to approach the process of determining pricing, the list of services provided with a pragmatic approach.  Elvira decided to analyze the data using the BI platform. <br><br>  Objective: to identify key points to be competitive and earn more. <br><br>  She is interested in the following questions: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  For what value do ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù with similar parameters (height, weight, chest, age) sell their time in the Elvira residential area?  Does it make sense to find an apartment option in another Moscow District for the same money, but with a higher average check or less competition? </li><li>  Should I overestimate or underestimate my age in the questionnaire? </li><li>  Does it make economic sense to increase the 2nd breast size to 4th and how quickly will the investment in the operation pay off? </li></ul></blockquote><h3>  The owner of the site with profiles </h3><br>  Meet Felix Albertovich - the owner of the site with profiles.  Imperious, 45 year old charming man, with good communication skills, rich previous marketing experience and more.  I was able to fill the site with many questionnaires of different girls, to ensure good attendance of this resource through SEO promotion.  At the moment, he earns on the paid placement of profiles on the site. <br><br>  Objective: to understand the needs of society, to identify promising areas of work with your site. <br><br>  Turning to the business intelligence agency, he expects to receive the following answers: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  What is the portrait of a typical "indie"? </li><li>  What queries do users do in search engines? </li></ul></blockquote><h3>  Entrepreneurial self-employed citizen who rents an apartment </h3><br>  Mitya is an adventurer, keeping up with the times, with a solid approach in business.  I'm used to be guided by statistics and facts.  Mitya has an apartment in the Central Administrative District of Moscow.  He wants to find how to make more money on his assets. <br><br>  Purpose: to find a new, more efficient model for using your apartment <br><br>  Main questions: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  If you rent an apartment to a girl of low social behavior, not for a fixed amount, but as a% of income, can you earn more with this approach? </li></ul></blockquote><h2>  Administrative findings of Elvira </h2><br>  Elvira saw that ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù with similar parameters for age, breast size, height and weight offer the same prices - 4080 - 4930 rubles / hour.  With the exception of areas "Western" and "Central". <br><br>  Competition is minimal in the "Moscow Region", only 20 forms, and the cost of renting housing is almost two times lower than in any administrative district of Moscow, while maintaining the level of cost per hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db9/e0b/8a7/db9e0b8a769af9b16ae7f761850a39f3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, Elvira would like to sell services more expensive over time, so she created a duplicate of the questionnaire, indicating the location in the Western District and work only on leaving for the night.  If there are enough offers, she will move to the area. <br><br>  Age indicated its real - 25 years.  Since  I saw that the maximum price per night is shown in the questionnaires in the age group from 25 to 30 years.  A filter has been installed on the priority service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cae/ad9/e35/caead9e355cbcbc2ee6802c2273eac2e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Regarding the feasibility of breast augmentation from 2 breast size to 4, Elvira counted: <br><br><ul><li>  The average cost of an hour increases by 1.190 (7.060 - 5.870 = 1.190). </li><li>  Breast augmentation surgery costs 300,000 rubles. </li><li>  Thus, an investment in breast augmentation will pay off 252 man-hours.  With a loading of 5 hours per day, this amounts to 50 working days. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/924/d13/f61/924d13f617dc315e1081f0ffb199f936.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Management conclusions Felix </h2><br>  Felix Albertovich first decided to understand the typical portrait of "indie."  So he saw: <br><br><ul><li>  Middle age: 29.8 years </li><li>  Wed  breast size: 2.8 </li><li>  Wed  height: 168 cm </li><li>  Wed  weight: 57 kg </li><li>  Wed  clothing size: 44 </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95b/28a/df3/95b28adf3537b5d1d6059b3445babc02.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Felix Albertovich further decided to analyze requests in search engines.  Previously, he has already systematized key queries into groups; we lacked an understanding of the weight of each keyword, the statistics of its queries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82c/44e/516/82c44e516a8011df2c4964eb7814bb76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the analytical report, Felix saw a steady increase in the number of requests.  In 2018 compared to 2017, the number of requests increased by 60% (from 9.99 million to 16.59 million). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8b/6d5/cf5/e8b6d5cf569a90a9c528cc6e4b5d4fa1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As expected, most requests are related to location.  In second place are the general inquiries, the third is the price classification.  This prompted Felix to use dynamic content on the site, depending on what search term the person came to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff4/aa6/65b/ff4aa665bf37602e16228c92b16901e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  He also drew attention to the significant predominance in searches of requests from mobile phones - almost three times.  Therefore, instructed the programmer-maker of his site to check the quality display on the mobile phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66d/8bd/6ac/66d8bd6aca22b5e7b2e7e2946a6948a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A curious thing is that individual groups of requests grow faster than others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/534/510/c04534510ca167d626ddcc1ed3a0f287.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, ‚ÄúPrice Category‚Äù - the ‚ÄúCheap‚Äù Subcategory increased by 74% (against 60% growth on average).  Also, the individual keywords ‚Äúcheapest *****‚Äù increased by 113% and ‚Äú**** Uzbechi‚Äù increased by 120%.  But Felix is ‚Äã‚Äãlooking at this data taking into account not only the percentage ratio, but also the quantitative one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bc/5d9/fc3/7bc5d9fc3f128560166f95ffaf586eb6.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Mitya's management findings </h2><br>  Mitya has an apartment in the Central Administrative District of Moscow and he wants to pass it.  "According to the market" such an apartment surrenders for 100-120 thousand rubles.  But he would like to earn more.  Therefore, I decided to rent an apartment "indie" for% of income.  For them, there is less risk of an undesirable reaction of the apartment owner, for him, more income from an apartment. <br><br>  Mitya hypothesized that the girls, who sell their time more expensive, will bring him potentially greater income.  He has an apartment in the Central Administrative District, so he first looked at what budgets the girls usually spend their time in the area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64b/1be/763/64b1be76353e28223b0b97a420a9ae04.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of the questionnaires (206 pieces) sell their time in the CAO from 10,000 rubles.  He further sorted out questionnaires that are not found in the CAO, but sell themselves for a similar price tag.  It is this audience that he will sort on the site, with the aim of calling and proposing a different apartment rental scheme, but in the CAO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b4/783/757/8b47837575ffaff2b8072655bf7909e4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When selling an average of 3 hours a day with a check to this audience, the total revenue per month is: 11.203 * 3 hours * 30 days = 1.008.270 rubles / month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/591/2ed/e23/5912ede23328f2dad35ed5c66406498f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, if he will receive 20%, then the apartment will be sold for more than 200.000 rubles / month. <br><br>  In the calculations Mitya did not take into account the income at ext.  services: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4c/fa8/305/f4cfa83052a20bf23f25639440836256.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In conclusion of this article, I would like to note that the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãanalysis is quite controversial.  Certainly this topic is a problem of society.  We deliberately wrote this article with humor, and the ‚ÄúAdministrative conclusions‚Äù were constructed with a bit of absurdity, so that the information was easier to perceive, but we hope will make us think about the trend. <br><br>  In this regard, an analytical platform like nothing else allows you to see the real picture, just numbers, followed by the right human actions. <br><br>  In this example, we have shown that any topic or business, its indicators can be analyzed, to build their hypotheses, relying on facts.  This is especially true when there is a lot of data, when they are in different sources and it takes a lot of time to put together a single picture.  This is true for marketing, sales, finance, logistics, commodity accounting.  If there is a need, write, we will be happy to discuss a possible solution. <br><br><h2>  Microsoft Power BI Screenshots </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/722/217/a75/722217a75baa7f02fd628d66569829cd.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/296/4ed/96d/2964ed96da5e9fd7d46c52c07a95745e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Tableau Screenshots </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cea/917/be5/cea917be5c476e8cc359d6c4c43e709a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e7/2b2/e4f/9e72b2e4f5cacc21a4975217f31aff91.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Qlik Sense Screenshots </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/071/ad8/70a/071ad870a1e51aa6b012b078ef665a68.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76b/a25/e4d/76ba25e4d602ab0ed8b831220f2ebbb6.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443808/</a></p>
