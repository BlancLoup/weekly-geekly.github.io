Originally conceived more as electronic notebooks, social networks quickly mastered the segment of entertainment services and, relatively recently, began to expand from the virtual world to the real world, which is only getting stronger every year.  Today, without exaggeration, we can say that for millions of users the social network has already penetrated so much into their lives that it has become an integral part of it.  Could you imagine, for example, 20 years ago, how will the development of personal computers and Internet technologies affect the communication between people ?!  Obviously, in very general terms, and not all.  But what, after all, is a social network?  Just a means of communication in the 21st century or a qualitatively new stage in the development of social relations?  Or, perhaps, the threshold of creating a global system of control over each person?  Of course, all this and more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To date, many fundamental human problems, which in the recent past have been devoted to numerous volumes of books, have sharply worsened and their solution is no longer urgent and cannot be implemented at the expense of future generations.  Here are some of the problems that underlie many other problems: <br><ul><li>  Fundamental, ideological problem: who are we, where did you come from and where are you going?  The answer to this "eternal" question predetermines many relationships in society and is closely related to the falsification of world history. </li><li>  The problem of overpopulation.  It follows from the first problem, describing its scale.  Key questions: what determines and how to control the population of the planet? </li><li>  The problem of depletion of natural resources.  Obviously related to the previous problem, aggravated by lack of knowledge about the world. </li><li>  The problem of environmental pollution.  Directly connected with the previous two, causing and exacerbating them. </li><li>  Social problems: falling levels of upbringing, education, management, exacerbation of relations in society, etc. </li></ul><br>  How are the problems currently ‚Äúsolved‚Äù?  The worldview problem is through the institute of religion, which has in its basis the concept of "faith", replacing true knowledge.  Science here cannot be regarded as a way of solving a problem, the opposite of a religious one, since it plays the role of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù at the other, atheistic, end of the ‚Äústick‚Äù.  The problem of overpopulation is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù through wars, a ‚Äúcultural‚Äù revolution, alcoholization of the population, drug addiction, vaccination, the use of transgenic (interspecific) crops in food production, etc.  The depletion of natural resources is hardly solved at all by the private exception of the use of transgenic technologies in agriculture, as an attempt to compensate for the increasing losses from deteriorating natural conditions and the growing number of insect pests.  But in terms of the overall effect, this approach is more sabotage than a solution to the problem.  The solution of social problems seems rather to their deliberate aggravation, the purpose of which, apparently, is to further aggravate and complicate the situation.  When using such "solutions" it is difficult to imagine that in another 100 years, if not earlier, something human will remain in the person. <br><br>  At the same time, the rapid development of Internet technologies, which made it difficult to manipulate people, is, apparently, indirect evidence if not for breaking the vector of human degradation, then at least its slippage.  Despite the misconceptions in science about the origin of man and the ancient history of mankind, thanks in large part to inquisitive lonely researchers and the possibilities of the Internet, many people now have access to information that shows that the real history of mankind is fundamentally different from the official point of view.  The presence of these processes suggests that the time of the old anti-humane structures that defined society and governed it for centuries is over, and their methods, based on violence against man and nature, stop working.  However, the inertia of negative processes is so great that in the coming decades the world will be shaken by unabated social conflicts, permanent revolutions and local wars, and how it will be in 10-20-30 years is an open question.  In this regard, in the coming years and decades, it is extremely important to create an environment and conditions conducive to the formation of a humane and holistic worldview among future generations who can show a different way of life and the development of society in the coming decades.

      The purpose of this work is to try to show how social networks can help solve existing problems in society, bringing people back to their true nature.  This task seems to be solvable, since the keys to solving all the problems are in the person himself, and in order to use them, it is only necessary to create the appropriate conditions. <br><br><h3>  Social network - a new form of communication </h3><br>  Denoting the subject of further consideration, we will give it a definition: a social network (or social network for short) is a means of organizing and displaying social relationships in a virtual Internet space that satisfies the following requirements: having personal user profiles, the ability to transfer various information between users (photos, music, videos, messages, etc.). <br><br>  The emergence of social networks was predetermined by the general trend of development of communication methods.  Compared to the previous means of communication and information transfer (letter, telephone, fax, audio and video tapes, disks, etc.), the costs of searching and transmitting information between people in social networks are orders of magnitude less.  The speed of information exchange is many times higher.  In other words, through social networks, it became easier to share information with each other. <br><br>  The opportunity to share photos, movies and music, find old and new acquaintances, carry on correspondence with them, unite in interest groups, and quickly receive news - all this and much more determined the success of the development of social networks.  In the end, it was the presence of these opportunities that led to a big rush (especially among young people) and an explosive growth in the number of users of the first social networks.  This required a quick revision of the existing functionality and the development of new features that were added based on the wishes of users and current trends in society. <br><br>  As social networks developed, attitudes towards them in society changed.  The starting development model ‚Äúto find longtime good friends‚Äù worked well in the first stage, giving a rapid increase in attendance.  But later it turned out that the initial charge of inspiration from the ability to find friends, see their photos and videos from the next holiday, as well as play a wide variety of games passes quickly.  Just as the implicit hope of users is that the social network, as a new form of communication, will somehow change their lives.  Of course, there are vivid examples of change, but they are rare and do not change the overall picture. <br><br>  It must be said that the very fact of the presence of a mass flow of people into social networks at the initial stage of their development speaks of the existing dissatisfaction in society.  That is why at that time, young people aged 20-30 years were en masse registered as the most disoriented and undecided part of the society.  But as the starting model for attracting users was exhausted, a new one, designed for other sectors of society, was required.  Therefore, the success of the first social networks and the understanding of the limitations of their development model after some time led to the emergence of new social networks aimed at narrow layers of society ‚Äî social networks began to divide the market.  So, after social networks aimed mainly at finding people ( <font color="gray"><i>Facebook</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>VKontakte</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>Odnoklassniki</i></font> ), social networks for entertainment appeared ( <font color="gray"><i>MoiMir</i></font> ), for finding work and employees ( <font color="gray"><i>MoiKrug</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>LinkedIn</i></font> ), for professional circles (IT specialists, scientists, businessmen), as well as social networks specializing in working with one type of media content: video (‚Äú <font color="gray"><i>youtube</i></font> ‚Äù), photo (‚Äú <font color="gray"><i>instagramm</i></font> ‚Äù), music (‚Äú <font color="gray"><i>lastfm</i></font> ‚Äù). <br><br>  Leaving out of the scope of consideration specialized social networks (although the proposed innovations can also be used in them), let us consider the development of mass (public) social networks in more detail.  In spite of the fact that in the following years their functional was improved, a qualitatively new idea (model of their development) was not proposed.  Therefore, the current development of such social networks can be considered spontaneous.  As a result, this led to the fact that along with the problems caused by the social network itself (the existence of personal pages of people who did not register on the social network; hacking of personal pages; the leakage of personal information through the vulnerabilities of the social network itself or through service personnel; hidden access to restricted information by law enforcement agencies and etc.), it went into the problems that exist in real society.  Often, social networks turned out to be and continue to be in the center of scandals related to the spread of drugs, psychotropic substances, pedophilia, pornography, etc. <br><br>  Communication in the social network itself had, rather, the opposite effect.  After all the friends were found, and their photos were scanned for the tenth time, users realized that they were in the same state and had the same feelings of dissatisfaction and loneliness, which they brought to the social network.  The social network, which, according to the ideas, would have had to bring people closer together, did not bring them closer, but, on the contrary, even distanced them.  The understanding came that the social network is just a new form in which the old content is reflected, i.e.  everything that was already well known, what they knew, but didn‚Äôt say much, but it was now even more clearly manifested in the light of new opportunities.  This is well understood by adults and poorly understood by young people.  Therefore, today it is not a secret for anyone that young people disappear for days on social networks.  But even for adults, their own social networks and various portals with elements of social networks are being created - the process of filling the niche of the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù where the role of the means of enrichment is given to a person continues.  In the end, instead of being a real helper to a person, a social network, in particular, and the Internet, in general, makes him addicted, akin to a drug addict.  When a person does not have success in real life, he goes into virtual life.  This well-known idea, but against the background of social networks, it acquired even more tangible features. <br><br>  It would seem, already one awareness of the current situation is enough to understand in which direction it is necessary to develop social networks.  But the social giants <sup>1</sup> are unusually slow in this matter.  And this, of course, is a sad testimony of the consumer attitude towards a person being transmitted to society, using his natural needs and the most sincere aspirations.  As a result of this attitude, various kinds of projects (including social networks) do not cease to appear on the Internet, which offer fast and practically free enrichment, but in fact ruin its members, thereby killing the hope for the best.  Projects with the pyramidal principle of organization, where they promise financial independence, hiding behind ideas of global reorganization of the world, have become especially numerous recently. <br><br>  <sup>1</sup> Large social networks: VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, My World, My Circle <br><br>  At the same time, awareness of the impasse in the direction of movement of modern social networks and the understanding that this tool can help people not only communicate, but also solve their real problems, problems and tasks of collectives, various communities and society as a whole, changing their lives for the better side, makes you look for other options for applications of social networks.  And such options with varying degrees of socialization (using the functionality of social networks) are already emerging.  For example, ‚ÄúS-Mira-Po-Thread‚Äù <sup>2</sup> , ‚ÄúDomosayt‚Äù <sup>3</sup> , ‚ÄúDemocrator‚Äù <sup>4</sup> , ‚ÄúReport‚Äù <sup>5</sup> , ‚ÄúROI‚Äù <sup>6</sup> , ‚ÄúLift to the Future‚Äù <sup>7</sup> , ‚ÄúPedsovet‚Äù <sup>8</sup> , ‚ÄúHealthy Russia‚Äù <sup>9</sup> and etc.  In addition, recently projects that are implementing joint funding (crowdfunding) and the use of joint resources (crowdsourcing) are gaining popularity.  This indicates a growing understanding in society that serious and large-scale problems do not resolve themselves, and their solution is impossible without uniting interested people. <br><br>  <sup>2</sup> ‚ÄúS-Mira-Po-Nitke‚Äù, <a href="http://smipon.ru/">smipon.ru</a> is a platform that helps to organize the collection of funds for the implementation of various projects. <br>  <sup>3</sup> Domosayt, <a href="http://domosite.ru/">domosite.ru</a> is a platform that allows residents to automate the management of their homes in close cooperation with management companies. <br>  <sup>4</sup> ‚ÄúDemocrator‚Äù, <a href="http://democrator.ru/">democrator.ru</a> is a platform for registering citizens' appeals to officials and monitoring the implementation of decisions made. <br>  <sup>5</sup> ‚ÄúSo. Notify.‚Äù, <a href="http://xn--80abzraq3d.xn--p1ai/">So. No.</a> , of the All-Russian Complaint Book - a portal for dialogue between citizens and officials, an analogue of the ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù. <br>  <sup>6</sup> ‚ÄúRussian Public Initiative‚Äù, <a href="http://roi.ru/">roi.ru</a> - a platform created by decree of the President of Russia, for posting any citizens' proposals with a view to their further consideration at the level of expert groups (with the number of signatures under the initiative from 100 thousand) and their possible adoption at the legislative level . <br>  <sup>7</sup> ‚ÄúLift to the Future‚Äù, AFK ‚ÄúSistema‚Äù, <a href="http://lifttothefuture.ru/">lifttothefuture.ru</a> is a platform with elements of a social network and a curatorial institute that helps young people determine the direction of their studies and contribute to their future career. <br>  <sup>8</sup> ‚ÄúPedsovet‚Äù, <a href="http://pedsovet.org/">pedsovet.org</a> - a platform with social network elements for professional workers in the field of pre-university education;  ‚ÄúThe mass media created by the efforts of educators themselves, acting as civilian journalists.‚Äù <br>  <sup>9</sup> ‚ÄúHealthy Russia‚Äù, <a href="http://takzdorovo.ru/">www.takzdorovo.ru</a> - a platform that helps monitor your own health and lead a healthy lifestyle. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the understanding of the potential opportunities and advantages of social networks is now actively taking place in large companies.  For example, <font color="gray"><i>Google</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>Cisco</i></font> and <font color="gray"><i>Apple</i></font> have implemented their corporate social networks, which allow them to preserve the accumulated materials and knowledge (blogs, wikipedias, training courses), contributing to their better transfer and development, as well as help more effective interaction between employees.  Therefore, in the future we should expect an increase in the number of companies with their own social networks. <br><br>  Unlike corporate social networks, the existence of which has a clear and understandable goal, new mass social networks are created outside the framework of the implementation of some global ideas or concepts.  Therefore, their appearance is rather adventurous and often looks like the attempts of their creators to capitalize on the problems of society <sup>10</sup> .  The reason for the lack of a unified concept of creating Internet projects with varying degrees of socialization is the lack of a generally accepted idea, within the framework of which their existence would be expedient <sup>11</sup> .  Even on the contrary, there is another idea that, as they say, is in the air, is to get maximum profits with minimal costs, when instead of clear goals for the development of the country, it is proposed to increase some indicators and reduce others, the value of which is secondary.  Within the framework of such an approach, the economic model of a country's development is optimized by these two parameters, and all other imbalances in the economy and society are compensated by super-profits, it does not matter where it came from: whether it is the sale of its own natural wealth, the plundering of the second-third world or its citizens .  Therefore, Internet projects arising within the framework of such an ideology have virtually no effect on society, and the existing social networks reflect reality only in that part and to the extent that they allow them to make a profit.  At the same time, the reverse effect (positive feedback) of social networks on society is negligible and does not have a systemic and structural nature.  Although they can and should become an instrument for changing the life of society and the life of each person for the better. <br><br>  <sup>10</sup> Some exception here is the project ‚Äú <font color="gray"><i>Elevator to the Future</i></font> ‚Äù, originally created to identify capable young people and their training in those areas of knowledge in which project sponsors who are interested in solving their strategic tasks in this way are interested. <br>  <sup>11</sup> For example, in Russia, the fundamental reason for this is the lack of a general life-affirming ideology of state development, which is enshrined in the constitution in law (see clause 2 of article 14 of the RF Constitution: ‚ÄúNo ideology can be established as a state or mandatory‚Äù). <br><br>  Despite the situation, individual groups of enthusiasts are offered various projects (including those without social networking elements) and organize all sorts of movements to develop the country and society.  For example, the project ‚ÄúRussia 2045‚Äù <sup>12</sup> , which, apparently, was created under the influence of scientific and technical achievements over the past decades.  The goal of this project is to create a human cyborg who is not afraid of death (consciousness can be transferred from an old body to a new one) and illness (an outdated or diseased organ is replaced with a new one, grown specifically for the patient).  The portal of public action for the development of the country "Project State" <sup>13</sup> , where everyone can offer their project to solve existing problems in society or take part in existing ones.  Numerous communities for the creation of ecological settlements, as a protest against the existing way of life and an attempt to return to the harmonious coexistence of man with nature.  How to understand which option is correct and will not lead to even greater dissociation in society or even its death? <br><br>  <sup>12</sup> ‚ÄúRussia 2045‚Äù, <a href="http://www.2045.ru/">2045.ru</a> is a social movement, the main scientific megaproject of which is aimed at ‚Äúcreating technologies for transferring personality to a more advanced non-biological carrier and extending life up to immortality‚Äù. <br>  <sup>13</sup> ‚ÄúProject State‚Äù, <a href="http://proektnoegosudarstvo.ru/">proektnoegosudarstvo.ru</a> - portal for joint participation in the life of the country through its development projects. <br><br>  A society, like a house, can be built on a different foundation: rules, principles, codes, laws.  The latter are based on the value base, which directly depends on the nature of man and his connection with the outside world.  Thus, knowledge about a person lies at the basis of a scheme for building a society.  But if we take the example of a modern person in order to understand who he is, we will very quickly come to sad conclusions.  It turns out that in its mass it is a frightened, closed and partially formed being.  Society is convinced that such a state of man is naturally from nature.  For weight, a scientific point of view about a person‚Äôs descent from a monkey is attracted, based on which, they believe that any person‚Äôs actions and his desire for community are only manifestations of behavioral programs determined by his animal instincts, and therefore his actions do not carry any other meaning, except how to survive in the "wild" nature.  Obviously, such an approach limits its ‚Äúadepts‚Äù in the knowledge of human capabilities, determining their methods of building society and organizing relationships in it.  Therefore, for a better understanding of the foundation (idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person), on the basis of which it is proposed to make innovations in social networks, let us turn to the past. <br><br><h3>  Forward to the past </h3><br>  In recent years, there has been a wealth of information about the cultures and civilizations of the deep past.  And today, a rare person does not know about the great Egyptian pyramids, pyramids in Mexico, megalithic structures in South America, Ikki stones in Peru, hundreds of pyramids in China, underwater structures near the island of Yonaguni, about a great flood that occurred about 13 thousand years ago at the end of the war the gods between themselves, and many other things.  From this information one gets the idea that ancient people, unlike modern ones, were more valuable, because  his life was spent not only in the material world, but also in the world of the spirit.  In the esoteric sense, this means that he was more balanced in the feminine and masculine energies, respectively.  This allowed him to see the multifaceted interrelation of the processes of nature and live in harmony with it.  At the same time, life could last for several hundred years, and a person left life of his own accord, when the task for which he was called to Earth was completed.  Understanding that each person is a manifestation of the omnipresent Spirit - the Creator in the Universe - was even forced to treat the enemy with understanding, without malice, helping him to change for the better, move along the path of growth of the spirit. <br><br>  Such "supernatural" abilities as telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation, levitation, clairvoyance, organ repair and many others were natural for the ancient man.  Being able to see subtle energies in the surrounding world, it was not difficult for him to understand the causes and effects of the processes.  Lies were recognized instantly.  Therefore, then it was almost impossible <sup>14</sup> .  At the same time, any events were instantly reflected in the general information field and could be easily detected.  In this sense, the Internet (social network) is an analogue of the information field of society, in which every person is from birth, but not everyone is able to work in it.  At the same time, this ability is incorporated in human nature and can be developed.  In ancient culture, its development occurred naturally as one grew older.  But over time, the circle of its owners was reduced, until it was limited to only representatives of the priesthood. <br><br>  <sup>14</sup> As for the edification of modern civilization in India, descendants of the Toda tribe have survived, in whose culture there are no concepts of ‚Äúuntruth‚Äù and ‚Äúlie‚Äù. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Work in the information field is incomparably more effective work through social networks or through any other electronic systems. Probably the example of Nikola Tesla, the Serbian inventor and humanist, can be the most obvious example of work in the information field. The entire process of designing its many devices and devices Tesla first performed in the mind, literally seeing them in detail, and only then turned them into reality. This approach does not require numerous drawings, computer models, numerical simulations, etc. The construction of an object, its characteristics, modes of operation, and behavioral patterns under various conditions are all modeled in the local information space of the mind, organized by the person himself. Only after the object has passed all tests and debugging in the mind,it is implemented in the "gland". This example, on the one hand, shows how strongly modern man has forgotten his nature, and on the other hand, indicates the minimum level to which he should strive. Another example can be found in ancient texts, which describes the process of creating life on Earth, the so-called Masters (or, in other words, the Demiurges) - entities capable of creating the thought forms of living organisms with their power of thought, then weaving them into a single terraformation process.Masters (or, in other words, the Demiurges) - entities capable of creating the thought forms of living organisms with the power of thought, then weaving their embodiment into a single process of terraforming.Masters (or, in other words, the Demiurges) - entities capable of creating the thought forms of living organisms with the power of thought, then weaving their embodiment into a single process of terraforming.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Modern design of buildings, equipment, various devices and much more represents a similar design, but only performed in the information space of computers, which thus act to the modern man in the role of "crutches" for the mind. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same crutches are the ability of people to communicate with each other on the Internet (including through social networks), which is a reflection of the lost possibility of telepathic communication of people among themselves at any distance.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Integral consciousness - the basis of a harmonious society </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In order to build a bridge from knowledge of the past to what a new social network should be, let us ask ourselves: how can one learn to work in the information space and how to recover lost knowledge? A person cannot be full-fledged (and the society cannot be harmonious), being unable to consciously work with all the energies (fields) of nature, since in this case, only partial (one-sided) control of its processes is achieved. Therefore, in its present state, a person cannot solve the fundamental questions of his life support in the right way. At best, he is a passive (weak-willed) participant in the natural course of life, and at worst, he destroys the natural balance, endangering his own existence and existence of life on the planet as a whole. Therefore, the solution of modern problems is impossible without a person acquiring integrity,giving the ability to work with subtle fields of nature.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The ability to see energy (spiritual vision), to understand their relationship with each other, their manifestation in the objects of the material world is inextricably linked with human consciousness. The more it is harmonious and less fragmented, the more this ability can be developed. And vice versa: the more the consciousness is split into parts, the faster this ability disappears. Therefore, for a modern person it is important to gain the integrity of consciousness, which is possible to achieve through the establishment of a normal living environment using the well-known formula: Being determines Consciousness, and Consciousness is Being.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The creation of such a harmonious living environment is proposed on the basis of the universal principle expressed by the Lemivian maxim from the story "Solaris": "Man needs a Man" (in the words of Andrey Tarkovsky). Man is understood here in a broad sense: as an embodied idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Creator, as a key element in the building of Being, as an instrument of knowledge of the Universe, being in the esoteric sense its reflection. This Man is Man-Cosmos, Man-Demiurge, Man-Creator of Worlds, Creator. We can do anything, strive anywhere, but all this is just a desire to find ourselves, to know ourselves and to understand ourselves. And only another person can help, and even better - congenial.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Considering from this position any aspects of human life and society, the relevant rules, laws, regulations, approaches and codes can be deduced in a natural way. If we imagine a society where lies and hypocrisy are the norm, then, obviously, the Man in it will not strive to communicate with the Liar Man and the Hypocrite Man. Such a society is doomed to decay. In the antipode of this society, where honest and sincere relations are the norm, Man‚Äôs desire to communicate will be natural, since it meets its nature and ensures the sustainable development of society itself.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Realizing the mutual connection between the living environment and the integrity of human consciousness, one can say what the mass social network should be: in such a way as to maximize the development of the individual and society. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is obvious that modern social networks extremely poorly satisfy this requirement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, they reflect only social ties existing in real society and the function of exchanging various information is implemented. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, relying on the Lemov maxim, let us try to imagine what needs to be added or changed in this ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù for the mind to become the very medium of sincere communication that will help the disclosure of talents and abilities of a person, the restoration of his true nature.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Social network - a tool for the development of man and society </font></font></h3><br>  One of the most important functions of a social network immediately follows from Lemov's maxim: helping a person find another person who is close in <font color="gray"><i>spirit</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>views</i></font> , <font color="gray"><i>interests</i></font> and <font color="gray"><i>activities</i></font> .  Is it implemented in existing social networks?  Currently, there are special fields in the user profile, where he indicates his <font color="gray"><i>interests</i></font> , by which he can then find other users with the same interests.  However, as follows from the attitude of users to this possibility (everything is entered into the field that only pleases), searching through these fields is ineffective.  Another more detailed approach, implemented on various dating sites, does not save the situation.  Rather, on the contrary, over the past years of the development of dating services on the Internet, society has developed an understanding that such an acquaintance has more disadvantages than advantages: in fact, a person often turns out to be different from what he describes himself in the network. <br><br>  The next opportunity to search in social networks is realized through the creation of interest groups.  But their diversity, even within the framework of one interest and the absence of any systematization of them, makes the search for the group really necessary for the user difficult and discouraging - after a couple of unsuccessful attempts, the user abandons the further search.  From the point of view of time and effort, communication in such groups is also doubtful: it is possible to sit in them for months, but not to establish useful contacts and not advance one iota in solving a vital issue. <br><br>  Note that we were talking only about the <font color="gray"><i>interests of the</i></font> person.  And if his <font color="gray"><i>views</i></font> can manifest themselves through his <font color="gray"><i>interests</i></font> and, thus, indirectly taken into account in social networks, then it is difficult to speak about finding a person who is close in <font color="gray"><i>spirit</i></font> .  Although this search is the most fundamental in the hierarchy of searches, but it is precisely this that turns out to be unrealized. <br><br>  What does "congenial" mean?  It means supporting the same dreams, ideals, values, lifestyle, etc.  People may have different <font color="gray"><i>views</i></font> on life based on their cultures, different <font color="gray"><i>interests</i></font> and <font color="gray"><i>activities</i></font> , due to acquired knowledge, social environment, life circumstances and the surrounding nature, but at the same time they are united in their <font color="gray"><i>values</i></font> , expressed, for example, in the desire to live honestly and fair.  There is no such function, which would unite people at the level of their <font color="blue"><i>aspirations</i></font> , <font color="blue"><i>dreams</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>desires</i></font> , in modern social networks. <br><br>  It seems that there are two ways to realize the unification of users, which would contribute to their mutual development.  Pursuing one goal, they also have fundamentally different approaches.  The approach of the first method is based on the integration of users within the existing processes in society, the second - the association of users to create new processes (project activities).  For simplicity, the first approach can be called the exchange of experience and knowledge between users and, thus, it performs a conservative role in society.  The second approach aims to create a new one and implements an innovative role.  Everything is the same as in nature: female and male components, respectively.  Consider each of the approaches separately, in order to understand what the social network must have in order to implement them. <br><br>  The main task of the first method is to help the user or group of users to acquire the knowledge, skills or experience necessary for them that will help them to solve their tasks.  It is proposed to carry out its decision through the organization of educational processes for interested users.  The social network acts here as a platform on which participants, expressing their interests, find each other, organize joint events (lectures, master classes, familiarization meetings), share the results achieved, etc.  In the existing social networks, this task is indirectly solved through the communication of users in groups, but, as will be clear from the foregoing, such a solution for this task is unsatisfactory. <br><br>  One could argue that there are public institutions designed to help a person in solving various problems.  However, firstly, their assistance is always limited both in appearance and in scope.  Secondly, due to their historical development, they, as a rule, regulate various kinds of relationships between people, and do not work with a specific person.  And even the education system, which works one-on-one with a student, teaches it for the state, and not for the student himself.  In other words, an educated citizen is needed first of all by the state and only then by the citizen himself.  And, thirdly, it is impossible for state structures to cover all human needs.  Otherwise, it would mean the absence of a private life as such and would develop in the person luster and shifting the responsibility to others. <br><br>  For successful development of a person and society, it is important that a person be able to independently search for and find solutions to emerging problems.  This means having an unformatted, creative mindset.  In fact, it is this idea that must lie in the foundation of any educational system.  But, unfortunately, if we talk about the educational system of Russia, then the trends of its development cause serious concerns for the future of the country.  If we compare it with the education system of the Soviet Union, then in the latter it was an integral part of the socio-economic development of society.  A variety of clubs, clubs and sections during school allowed the younger generation to better navigate the choice of their future profession.  Planned economy allowed to manage the requirements for the quantity and quality of specialists produced by universities and specialized institutes.  After graduating from a university or college, the state arranged for a young specialist to work, which ultimately helped a person in some way to find his place in life.  In modern Russia, the education system has become a body that provides some educational services, which, by the way, is natural in the absence of a coherent development goal of the state, and, accordingly, a lack of understanding and understanding of which country needs specialists, what quality, but more importantly, what should be the man himself.  If in the Soviet Union, the education received was adequate to future work and was determined by its laboriousness, now the presence of higher education is required everywhere, regardless of the complexity of work, i.e.  became a bureaucratic formality.  At the same time, the education received is often in no way connected with the future work of a graduate.  Leaving beyond the scope of further comparison of the two educational systems, we note their common shortcoming: the educational process is considered complete after the end of the educational institution, since then, as expected, there is professional growth. <br><br>  However, a person constantly faces various tasks or problems for which he may not have the necessary knowledge and skills.  Of course, he can contact the relevant organizations.  But what to do in the situation of a lack of sufficient resources, but at the same time there is an opportunity and a desire to acquire the skill, to learn so that you can solve the problem yourself?  Or, for example, what to do in a situation when there is a change of technology and some personnel have to be reduced?  Someone can be retrained, but what to do dismissed?  Probably, some of them will be able to find work, where they are still using the old technology, but replacing it is a matter of time.  It turns out that retired employees must be trained in another specialty.  All this constitutes the problem of the lack of an effective education system that allows a person to acquire additional specialties or skills and helps to adapt to new living conditions.  Therefore, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe first approach is to ensure that a person has a constant opportunity for continuous education (including self-education) at any age.  And the social network here can help the user in finding and organizing the learning process, provide the necessary contacts, and provide the necessary services for this. <br><br>  To solve the above tasks in a social network, you must create a system that can be called " <font color="purple"><i><b>Education</b></i></font> ".  It would allow the <font color="gray"><i>user-teacher to</i></font> tell and show other users what he can teach them, and organize the learning process.  From the part of the <font color="gray"><i>user-student</i></font> - to help in finding interesting lessons for him.  Having entered the ‚Äú <font color="purple"><i>Education</i></font> ‚Äù section on your page, the user, as a student, could find courses, seminars, lectures, trainings, etc., that other users spend as teachers.  Note that this is not about ordinary events for which existing social networks already have functionality (through the organization of events), but about events where the educational process is expected: <font color="gray"><i>the student user</i></font> completed the task that was evaluated <font color="gray"><i>by the teacher user</i></font> .  What <font color="gray"><i>the student-student</i></font> will learn, how his success will be assessed, what conditions and training schedule are all described on the <font color="gray"><i>teacher-user</i></font> page that corresponds to the learning event.  On the same page there can be a list of users with their achieved <font color="green"><i>results</i></font> , who have already been trained.  The <font color="gray"><i>student-student</i></font> can control his learning process through the appropriate section on his page, where he sees which courses or seminars he has already passed, which ones he participates in now, and which ones he may be interested in in the future (which the social network prompts him).  All the <font color="green"><i>achievements</i></font> that the user will acquire during the training will be accumulated using the ‚Äú <font color="green"><i><b>Results</b></i></font> ‚Äù system (more about it below) and in the future can serve as practically ready material for the compilation of the summary. <br><br>  The same applies to employing organizations that could, through this system, tell users about their achievements, opportunities and prospects for working in their companies.  For example, a production company describes its personnel needs (in fact, by publishing vacancies), clearly describing what experience the applicant will acquire, what to learn, what tasks and prospects await him.  Through a social network, a company can organize familiarization meetings, presentations, sightseeing tours, conduct internship programs, and master classes.  Such close contact of companies with interested users would contribute to both parties more mutual understanding and more effective job search - for users, and the search for valuable employees - for companies. <br><br>  From this point of view, it is not surprising when such projects appear as <font color="gray"><i>Lift to the Future</i></font> , where potentially the future employee is taken from the school bench.  But if such companies can afford such projects, then what about small organizations?  It is here that the role of the social network, as a platform for contacts of young people (and not only) with the real sector of the economy, as well as with various public organizations and movements, would be invaluable.  On the one hand, there are people (or companies) who would like to share their knowledge (respectively, find an effective employee), on the other hand, tens of thousands of undecided young men and women who spend time on social networks all day long.  Undoubtedly, among them there are those who are ready to try themselves in various fields, to learn and learn from experience and knowledge.  Therefore, it is extremely important to create conditions where both parties concerned could find each other.  This task and assumes a new system " <font color="purple"><i>Education</i></font> ". <br><br>  Now imagine a situation where a user (or user group) has a desire to create something new, but he did not find the right organization, interest group or person on the social network.  Or a situation when it is necessary to find partners to work out the idea and its possible realization, or to find like-minded people to make the <font color="blue"><i>dream come true</i></font> .  In such cases, the social network could help users to express their <font color="blue"><i>dreams</i></font> , <font color="blue"><i>desires</i></font> , <font color="blue"><i>aspirations</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>ideas to them</i></font> .  It would help to find <font color="blue"><i>like-minded people</i></font> , provide a platform for joint discussion of ways to implement their <font color="blue"><i>ideas</i></font> , provide them with information and service support in subsequent <font color="red"><i>project</i></font> activities, help preserve and enhance their accumulated <font color="green"><i>experience</i></font> and <font color="green"><i>knowledge</i></font> , as well as support successful projects.  All of the above are the main objectives of the second method of bringing people together.  For clarity, let's try to imagine what the corresponding functionality of a social network could look like. <br><br>  The user manages his aspirations and dreams through the " <font color="blue"><b><i>Dreams</i></b></font> " section.  It lists his <font color="gray"><i>dreams</i></font> in which it is composed.  Next to each <font color="gray"><i>dream, there</i></font> are a number of <font color="gray"><i>like-minded</i></font> users, discussion groups and active <font color="gray"><i>projects</i></font> (more on this later).  Also in this section are invitations to join other <font color="gray"><i>dreams</i></font> .  It is possible to find a <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> that, perhaps, someone from the users have already voiced (created in the social network).  When searching, the social network automatically gives hints with close wordings, allowing the user to better navigate the information space of the <font color="gray"><i>dreams of</i></font> social network users.  If there is no suitable <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> yet, then the user creates a new one.  At the same time, the <font color="gray"><i>dream is</i></font> not tied directly to the user who created it and therefore is a free object of the information system.  Users who support it, can join, becoming <font color="gray"><i>like-minded people</i></font> . <br><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Dreams</i></font> can be very different.  For example, the user has a dream to build comfortable, high-quality and low-cost individual houses, to develop the construction of low-rise settlements.  Or, for example, there is only the idea to develop an environmentally friendly and economical transport to replace the existing one.  It is better when the dream will be formulated simply as a generalizing image, as an idea.  For example, the same construction of individual houses is not an end in itself, but is part of a certain larger scale image.  For example, " <font color="blue"><i>Happy residents</i></font> ."  And the desire to create a new type of transport is part of the ‚Äú <font color="blue"><i>Clean City</i></font> ‚Äù image.  At the same time, other dreams, such as <font color="blue"><i>Healthy People</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>Safe Food</i></font> , could be subordinated to the image <font color="blue"><i>Happy People</i></font> .  Similarly, a social network would form a single image of society, which would show what it lives and what it seeks, and would also symbolize the value basis on which it stands.  Each part of such a single image will represent one of the aspects of society.  One aspect of Man. <br><br>  The combination of users at the level of their <font color="gray"><i>dreams</i></font> and <font color="gray"><i>aspirations</i></font> in itself already gives a positive organizing effect and what is called ‚Äúthe feeling of the elbow‚Äù.  The user sees and understands that he has <font color="gray"><i>like-minded people</i></font> who support his dreams.  This gives a natural reason for organizing group discussions or meetings, networking, coordination of common events.  A social network through the ‚Äú <font color="blue"><i>Dreams</i></font> ‚Äù system will help the user to find <font color="gray"><i>like-minded people</i></font> in his city, to see what the city dreams of, what to strive for, what activities in it are being carried out or planned as part of the realization of a <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> .  At the same time, the pages of companies, through communication with common <font color="gray"><i>dreams and aspirations of</i></font> society, would reflect their missions, which would allow them to better position themselves in the single information space of the social network, and users to navigate faster. <br><br>  In the space of a <font color="blue"><i>dream</i></font> , her <font color="gray"><i>associates</i></font> will have her various ideas and understandings and, accordingly, different ideas and views on her realization.  All such presentations are voiced and disclosed by users on the <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> forum.  For some, the fulfillment of the dream " <font color="blue"><i>Happy people</i></font> " means the construction of high-quality and affordable housing, for others - the arrangement of recreation parks, for the next - changing the form of teaching in schools, etc.  For some, the dream ‚Äú <font color="blue"><i>Healthy Children</i></font> ‚Äù means, first of all, arranging children's playgrounds, for others, having enough places in kindergartens, for the third, providing all necessary children's homes, etc.  Therefore, in an obvious way, many <font color="gray"><i>like-minded people</i></font> will come up with a lot of proposals for its realization in reality, which will lead to the creation of various <font color="blue"><i>groups</i></font> in the social network subordinate to the <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> - the process of aspecting the <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> will begin.  In these <font color="gray"><i>groups, it</i></font> will be discussed in detail how to implement a specific aspect of the <font color="gray"><i>dream</i></font> .  At this stage, again, various options for its implementation are possible, and it is here that it will be determined: who of the users knows, is able, has experience, can help and is ready to provide, what management, material, financial and other resources will be needed, etc.  In fact, in this way, the working process of developing a future <font color="red"><i>project</i></font> will be carried out, which will result in a clear understanding of further actions and their organization.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Creating a </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">project</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in a social network will mean the presence of a clear organizational structure, the distribution of roles, responsibilities and responsibilities. And, again, there </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">may be several </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">projects</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> subordinate to one </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">aspiration</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . For example, </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">projects</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> broken by territory. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The project management and control of their participation in them the user carries out through the section " </font></font><font color="red"><b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Projects</font></font></i></b></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ". It will display a list </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">of the</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> user's </font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">projects</font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with a brief description of the current state of each of them, as well as invitations to other projects are displayed. On the same page, the user can create his </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">project</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , automatically becoming his</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">supervisor</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . As a manager, he ties the project to the appropriate</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> dream group</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , where the discussion took place and the decision was made to create it, assigns and assigns roles, invites users to them, determines the project‚Äôs goal, stages of its implementation, and controls its implementation. The user-participant of the project through his page manages the progress of his work area (tasks, schedule, subordinates, etc.). All users involved in the project are</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> colleagues</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probably in the course of the</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> project</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">need to attract additional resources or find the missing specialists. In this case, the project manager can issue a corresponding application, which will be visible, firstly, to all related project groups, subordinate to the </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">group</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , secondly, to all </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in the </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">group</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> who do not participate in the projects, and, thirdly, to all </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people.</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> to which the </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">group</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> is attached </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Also, using the capabilities of a social network, it will be possible to carry out a targeted distribution of such applications to users who have the necessary competencies, or make them open to the outside world.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Project work is far from easy work. Moreover, in Russia there is no culture of mass collaboration (because people are used to relying either on themselves and their close circle, or on the state). Therefore, at first, most of the projects will be completed without reaching the goal. But as project activities develop, the share of successful projects will steadily increase. To evaluate the experience gained in the ‚Äú </font></font><font color="red"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Projects</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù system at the closing of any </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">project, the</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> manager will describe the reason for the closure and publish material on the </font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">result</font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> achieved</font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">which could be, for example, a technology, product or service. The general result is not only the above, but also the knowledge and skills acquired by the project participants. On completion of successful projects, the social network will be obliged to inform all </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the relevant pages of </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">groups</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">dreams</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information management about the gained </font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">experience</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , acquired </font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">knowledge</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">skills</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that a user has mastered, having completed training in the ‚Äú </font></font><font color="purple"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Education</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù system or taking part in </font></font><font color="red"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">projects</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , is implemented by the user through the ‚Äú </font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Results</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚Äù system.

From here, the user controls the availability of this information.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another possibility provided to the user in this section is the subsequent promotion (implementation) and improvement of the achieved</font></font><font color="green"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> result.</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. In the case of, for example, a product, a social network would help organize its advertising.

Purpose: to promote the comprehensive development of the user through knowledge and co-creation with other users. The system allows the user to organize their educational processes, in which he can be both in the role of a</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> student</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and in the role of a</font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> teacher</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . In the role of a student, he is trained by another user, and in the role of a teacher ‚Äî he trains other users. As a user, there can be both a person and an organization. This system is key in the social network, since it functionally integrates the social network with the real society, and structurally penetrates into the other three of its systems. The system can operate independently of the rest.</font></font><br><br> <font color="blue"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dream management system</font></font></b></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Purpose: to help the user in the search, formulation and realization of their dreams, study of various aspects of the dream by creating initiative groups, where it is discussed between </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The main results of such discussions are a clear understanding of the essence of the dream of all like-minded people and the formation of initiative groups (the most interested user groups) who are ready to take on the realization of one or another aspect of the dream. The end result of the work of the initiative groups is a documented plan specifying the stages of the realization of the dream. In the ideal case, such a plan should be a pre-project documentation that can later be used to create a project by other interested groups of </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people.</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. This approach ensures the preservation of the accumulated material and the exchange between interested users. </font></font><br><br> <font color="red"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Project Management System</font></font></b></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Purpose: to help users in project management. This system is a tool that allows </font></font><font color="gray"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">like-minded people.</font></font></i></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: create projects based on a prepared plan (forming an organizational structure, determining material and financial support, assigning responsibilities and responsibilities, adapting documents to existing conditions), manage projects (preparation: planning stages, defining deadlines and criteria for evaluating their implementation, assigning performers and execution: the rapid exchange of information between the participants, monitoring the implementation of the tasks of each participant and the project as a whole), complete projects ( and implementation of the project: successes and failures, tips and suggestions to other groups that are interested in implementing similar projects). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Currently, there are a lot of software products offering various possibilities in the field of project management </font></font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">15</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Therefore, it seems reasonable not to reinvent the wheel, but to adapt the most suitable ready-made solution to the social network. The system also needs to include two subsystems, due to its use in the social network: crowdfunding (co-financing) and crowdsourcing (shared resources). The first subsystem should provide an opportunity for the project manager to attract monetary and material resources of social network users, keep their records, provide transparent management and control of expenses. The second is to attract specialists who have the necessary specialization, education, work experience and skills. </font></font><br><br> <sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">15</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> For example, </font></font><a href="http://boomstarter.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">boomstarter.ru</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><a href="http://bootb.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bootb.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><a href="http://kickstarter.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">kickstarter.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , </font></font><a href="http://symbid.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">symbid.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ,</font></font><a href="http://advanta-group.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">advanta-group.ru </font></font></a> <br><br> <font color="green"><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">result management system</font></font></b></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Purpose: preservation of acquired knowledge and experience by users, assistance in publishing and promoting their results. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The result here is understood in a broad sense. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This knowledge and material products obtained in the course of the educational process. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The achieved goal of the project, which can be expressed in the development of a new technology, or in the organization of a new production, or in improving the efficiency, efficiency and environmental friendliness of existing technologies, as well as the acquisition of practical knowledge and skills by each project participant.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Expected Result </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Why does all this work? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because man, by virtue of his nature, strives for the best. The proposed innovations in the social network will enable him to quickly and effectively find people close in spirit, views and interests that are worth a lot. Be trained by participating in interesting and useful activities, find answers to your questions and train other users. Dream together with other users, set common goals and objectives, create and implement projects, achieve common and at the same time personal success. In fact (and not in empty conversations on the net), you will know what the user himself is capable of, what abilities and talents there are, as well as what his like-minded people and colleagues have, which will allow him to better understand and appreciate the people around him. And at the same time enjoy the pleasure and satisfaction of the effort.All this sets a certain basis for the personal growth of the user and his future success.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The personal direct contact of participants in such an environment creates the conditions for productive and full-fledged acquaintances as opposed to today's ‚Äúnodding‚Äù acquaintance. Education, teamwork of people of different ages will contribute to intergenerational dialogue, their mutual understanding, strengthening of culture and harmonious development of society. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Participation in educational processes and projects will allow the user to get the most diverse experience and acquire various skills, developing a careful attitude to work. At the same time, the use of personal time by the user will be as efficient as possible (which is especially important for young people), since participation in interesting projects in itself creates conditions when the desire to waste time on games and empty pastime disappears.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awareness of the user that he is not alone, that there are people who are ready to help him in finding answers to questions and realizing his aspirations, will further stimulate him to further comprehensive training and creative work. On the other hand, users who provide training and share their experience get satisfaction from the realization that their work is not in vain, but accepted by worthy students, supporting their views and aspirations. All this will fill life with meaning and will give a feeling of confidence in the future.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Celebration of successful completion of training or a project, implementation of the achieved result and replication of successful projects will give the user an important inner feeling of confidence in himself, in his abilities and in the ability to change himself and with him to change the world around him. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Awareness of this feeling in the group of users will produce the effect of ‚Äúself-induction,‚Äù which will even more unite the well-organized project participants and charge them with faith in the success of participants in related projects who are striving for one dream. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Users will share real success, not virtual success. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this will give invaluable feelings of universal support and help build a creative outlook on life.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The place and role of the new social network </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Understanding the benefits of the introduction of various elements of social networks, now forces large companies to develop their own closed social networks. In other words, more and more companies are building their social worlds in the common information space. Open mass social networks are located in this space separately from companies' social networks, but the interaction between them will only increase in the near future (for example, search for employees, search for work, holding various events).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A new social network is a public system of social development and design, in which not only each user can take part, but also each object of the information space (closed social network, company, government agency, etc.). It is designed to connect all the objects in the information space with each other, setting the relationship between them and offering them universal tools of teamwork, which results in a unified structure of goals, aspirations and missions.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main goal of the proposed innovations in the social network is to help people in knowing themselves. Other goals are to help search for people close in spirit and opinion and perform a unifying role in the system. As a result of the realization of these goals, the atmosphere of relations in society and the normalization of living conditions will be improved. Better mutual understanding in society, people's awareness of common goals and joint work on them will inevitably reduce the number of various stresses, fears and experiences, having a positive effect on the general health of society. Restoration of a creative atmosphere will stop the loss of human time and energy, which will allow redirecting them to harmonious development and creativity. Inevitably, such an environment will contribute to the education of children with an expanded and harmonious perception of the surrounding world.This, in turn, will open up new technologies that will change the life of society in the direction of harmonious coexistence of man with nature and nature with man. This process will occur in stages and at a rate that depends on many factors. It seems that in the present conditions for the emergence of people capable of consciously working with the energy fields of nature, it is necessary two or three generations (40-70 years).need two or three generations (40-70 years).need two or three generations (40-70 years).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A natural consequence of the ongoing changes in man and in society will be the understanding by man of the immediate goal and meaning of his life at a given time and his overall role in the life of the universe. New understanding and attitudes in society will restore forgotten knowledge about harmonious life, restore communication with the source of life (Being as such), which will provide answers to the ‚Äúeternal‚Äù questions and will give direction to the further development of humanity as a whole. Once such a connection is revealed, religions and various beliefs will go into the past in a natural way. The relationship between the sexes will change radically, their true roles will be restored. Understanding that the birth of a child is not just an act of the emergence of a new person into the world, but caused by the challenges facing society and humanity as a whole, will change the relationship between a man and a woman,their attitude towards conception and childbirth, which normalizes the population and solves the problem of overpopulation. In itself, a harmonious relationship to nature will reduce the burden on the environment and environmental pollution. Gradually changing environment will lead to a change in human consciousness, which will inevitably affect all spheres of human activity. And after some time in the new generations, the forces of the universe will be manifested, which, having become worthy leaders of humanity, will complete the process of transformation of modern civilization.that will inevitably affect all areas of human activity. And after some time in the new generations, the forces of the universe will be manifested, which, having become worthy leaders of humanity, will complete the process of transformation of modern civilization.that will inevitably affect all areas of human activity. And after some time in the new generations, the forces of the universe will be manifested, which, having become worthy leaders of humanity, will complete the process of transformation of modern civilization.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, as it was said earlier, a social network is just a ‚Äúcrutch for the mind‚Äù, which over time will not be needed by a person and then by society. This will happen for natural reasons and mainly due to the fact that in human nature there is absolutely everything that a social network can provide. At the same time, it cannot be said that humanity will completely abandon various engineering devices, machines and equipment, if only because they allow us to shorten the time of terraforming and settling of new planets - the creation of new worlds - by orders of magnitude. The phased process of creating life, using only the field effect on matter, requires much more time.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Contrary to their impressive capabilities, IT-technologies and, in particular, the social network are only ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù for the mind, while all the opportunities provided by them are potentially embedded in the person himself and can be developed by him. There are already quite a few confirmations of this and their number will only increase over time. The author is convinced that the available technologies are only a pale shadow of the technologies that a person possessed in the past. Also, one should not have high hopes that the emergence of any new technology can drastically change the life of society for the better, as engineer Alfred Nobel, the inventor Nikola Tesla, the Wilbur and Orvil Wright brothers and many other geniuses of science and technology naively believed. New technologies are changing the shape of relationships in society, but the relationships themselves are extremely weak.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, 3D printing technology, the excitement around which has only recently been growing, with all its potential possibilities will inevitably provoke the emergence of black markets for 3D printing: weapons, internal organs, food, household items, etc. It will be necessary to tighten legislation, change the rule of law, rewrite regulatory instructions, etc. Therefore, what will be more from the new technology: good or harm is a question of who will control them. Such technologies, like the social networks themselves, can be used, like any other tool, both for solving problems and exacerbating them. Therefore, I don‚Äôt want everything to be the same in 10‚Äì20 years: the older generation doesn‚Äôt see that over the past 20‚Äì30 years, most people have changed for the better (or rather, vice versa)and with caution looks to the future that is prepared for their children and grandchildren. At the same time, young people sincerely do not understand them, i.e. All the same problem "fathers and children."</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many of the issues raised in the article are not revelations and are well understood by most people. At present it is difficult to imagine that social networks have adequate and worthy alternatives for solving them. If we talk about state institutions, it is precisely because of the lack of real interest on the part of the state in solving the pressing problems of society that using social networks seems to be the most optimal and effective way for self-organizing society and solving its problems. If we talk about numerous public organizations, then in order to consolidate their efforts and effectively interact with each other, they, first of all, lack a single ideological, conceptual space, which is proposed to be created in a new social network.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Concluding, the author thanks the explicit and implicit participants who inspired writing the article, hopes that the article will arouse a keen interest in readers and a discussion of the proposed innovations, and is ready to take an active part in their further development. </font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361807/</a></p>
