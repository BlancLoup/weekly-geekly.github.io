Big, huge, and no one in the world is really completely unnecessary.  Then the first "persones" began to appear.  The benefits that he began to bring for office work do not even need to be explained - everyone understands very well that this is a cheap way to do a little automation (and an expensive way to implement greater optimization). <br><br>  For home use, he was little needed, so at home, often, he was among children who warmed up their own interest in writing games on computers.

      The emergence of ubiquitous low-cost Internet gave the goal to have a computer at home, even if it is not needed for work or for games.  Often, it is idle and turned on to search for film shows or home appliances.  Dusting. <br>  Many have not bought a hospital at home, or got rid of it, after the collapse in prices for laptops.  Nout a lot of space is not necessary and dust wash order more convenient. <br><br>  So the forecast for the first section: <br><ul><li>  Stationary PCs are needed in offices.  And no ipad from it will not expel. <br>  Development of computer games, development of applications for films, 3D graphics, development of production lines, industrial design, design, architecture, writing computer tools for the first category, mathematical modeling, forecasting, creating documents will be only on stationary computers <br>  At most, they will move from the stationary to the laptop version if the latter is simply cheaper. </li><li>  Gaming computers are likely to move away to another world.  Already, it is logical not once to buy a computer for games.  Uncomfortable, expensive. </li><li>  The server PC market will not shatter the tablet. </li><li>  Laptops are unlikely to fall much in sales, although they will slow down the wild growth rate of recent years.  The tablet does not cancel the laptop. </li><li>  Tablets will definitely develop.  If they still fall in price, then many will have it for reading all webs of the web, for small games for killing time.  Most likely they will take away a niche from laptops from those who need a computer to surf and kerchiefs. </li><li>  The computer market itself will continue to grow. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Web </h4><br>  Initially, the sites simply described the information.  No interactive.  But first chats, then forums, then social networks and a large number of online stores climbed into our lives.  And since the Internet allows you to enjoy information at any time convenient for you, image sites have also appeared, which, along with advertising on more traditional media, give a very good result (and / or with viral marketing). <br><br>  Also, the Internet is not only B2P, but also B2B.  And Internet mail is one of the oldest and at the same time leading tools.  And now added to the site for advertising, selling services, and even trading on stock exchanges. <br><br>  Now the network is divided: it is services for entertainment, for work, for commerce and so forth.  To say that it will lose relevance - do not delve into the essence of what is happening now. <br>  The web is used for completely different purposes.  This market has long been divided, and each of its parts has long lived its own life. <br><br>  So the forecast on the web: <br><ul><li>  From the first point it is clear why browser games are what they are now.  They play mostly office staff.  And they are not going anywhere.  On the tablet, oh, how soon some 1C accounting will not appear, and working in the office on the tablet is less comfortable.  To prevent it from being in the offices, there is enough of what kind of keyboard there is - for 8 hours you obviously cannot sit on it. <br></li><li>  Many small companies will really have no reason to launch their website on the Internet, especially if there are pleasant and convenient platforms for advertising and describing their services.  And every year, these sites are improving. <br>  But this does not mean that the word "site" will start to lose meaning.  I think that everything will also be very strong in the direction of image sites for movies, stocks, music CDs, games, social networks and other small entertainment (Forums of radio amateurs, discussion of technology, medicines, football, trends). <br>  And such sites will work fine on tablets, because releasing a tablet with <i>any</i> API = release a tablet with a browser.  If they don‚Äôt build themselves, there will always be some Opera. <br></li><li>  CMS-ki will not go anywhere.  It‚Äôs just that over the next 5 years the market will mature, and the most unfortunate options will fall out of it, which generally happens in any new market that has passed its ‚Äúnovelty boom‚Äù.  There will be good proven tools and even paid ones.  Will develop a paid CMF. </li><li>  The WWE stagnation will not be the next 5 years.  Newspapers, television and radio, too, seem to live on the same model - advertising.  But you will agree, the Internet has many more models in store for profit.  WWW will grow and change and adapt to the platform and hobbies.  He will increasingly provide our lives, not only leisure, but also life. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Electronic ink </h4><br>  This is a completely different type of screen!  Do you understand how convenient the subtractive screen system is?  She does not have an additive model where she is used, but this is not required. <br>  I think that in five years' time, the technical level will give us a chance to see such screens where we did not expect to see them at all. <br>  This technology is a dark horse, and so I would not simply write it off from accounts. <br>  Winking cigarette packs, indicators on laptops, live sea posters, live photos. <br>  If not after five, then in ten years exactly. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Once again, tablets, touch screens, electronic ink - will not close the old markets.  They will discover new ones.  And comprehensive computerization, getting closer and closer. <br><br><h6>  ps Internet in the TV will be.  But I am not sure that it will be massive in five years. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96374/</a></p>
