    </i>  <i>All this time I live with such a feeling that someone should have something: parents have the opportunity to be proud of their son, wife a worthy future and stability ... And I want to break free from the imposing miserable little world and finally breathe deeply.</i>  <i>But the sense of responsibility, as well as a complete lack of understanding of people close to me, who believe that a sense of duty to the family should prevail over their own interests, hinders.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Yes, and I am absolutely not confident in my abilities, in the possibility of earning money from my work.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I have written several stories and a dozen two poems.</i>  <i>Now I have a choice: to devote myself completely to literature, or to find myself temporary work in my specialty.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It does not seem possible for me to combine work with normal earnings and literature - there is simply no time and energy left for this.</i>  <i>So I am thinking about creating a site where I could post my work and try to make money on it.</i> <br><br>  Greetings and thanks for your frankness. <br><br>  So the first thing: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Get rid of the words "impossible, probably, probably."  The leader clearly understands that he can achieve everything and is not afraid of difficulties.  Therefore, it is difficult to stop him when he goes to the goal. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Your family can be understood.  The fact is that I once worked at work, which occupied all my free time, but I wanted to do something for myself, to do what I like.  And you had to read and learn a lot.  I just cut an hour or two from my sleep every day.  I went to bed after midnight, and in the morning I got up for work and went and worked, and in the evening I learned again.  Several years have passed and I learned a lot, if I made a choice in favor of sleep, now I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting at home and working, receiving many times more than my previous job, staying at home with my family.  Therefore, regarding the combination of work and literature, I will tell you this: come to a compromise, find a job that will bring a steady income to your family and allow you to combine creativity.  Example: a guard or a watchman or a taxi driver or a loader (when we were students, we announced the unloading of a wagon brigade and all that, we had a lot of extra time and a lot of free time). You can write your own works on this job, not to mention loose dumps and weekends.  The taxi driver who sits in the car can write poems or stories, and in addition he constantly meets interesting characters and gets into different non-standard situations.  You understand my point. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Begin to join the community of writers and artists.  There are a lot of talented people on lib.ru, regular contests are held, people actively communicate and share experiences.  You do not need to wait at the fate of gifts.  You just do what you have to do.  Communication with colleagues and like-minded people is the greatest opportunity.  Show yourself as a good person and you will be noticed, remembered, there you will find friends and acquaintances.  And who knows, perhaps one of them will offer you to participate in a project. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Try to get feedback whenever possible, gratefully accept criticism.  If you were told no, this is not a reason for frustration.  Abraham Lincoln to 40 years was considered a loser, he could not manage to organize something worthwhile, for whatever he took.  How many talented writers have been told ‚Äúno‚Äù - hundreds of times, but they still wrote and did something.  Even this letter and possible comments in the post is the beginning of your journey.  Whatever they are, the words of people, they should not stop you, but just the opposite, motivate. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> I advise you to read motivational books: Joe Vitale, John Kehoe, Napoleon Hill, Rhonda Byrne, Jack Canfield, spouses Hicks, Charles Enel, and others.  You will see that many people achieve their goals not because of chance or coincidence, but only because of work, dedication and concentration.  And almost all successful people repeatedly received their bruises and bumps like all other people.  They succeeded because they did not stop and did not betray their dream. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> As for the site.  I do not think that you need it first.  It will take a lot of power - tech support, add.  spending on hosting, domain, service.  You can make your page in LiveJournal or a blog, post your works there, using them as a repository, especially since there are many of your like-minded people.  Now there are a lot of people writing poems and stories.  You need to become familiar in your community.  Something stand out.  As an example, Artemy Lebedev.  I do not presume to judge him as a designer, but, you see, first of all he made himself as an individual, design is secondary.  He - Lebedev, and then the designer. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69161/</a></p>
