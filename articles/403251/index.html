As a result of the accident, one person, a factory employee, suffered.  He was hospitalized, as far as can be understood, nothing threatens a person‚Äôs life. <br><br>  Part of the staff was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/tesla-gigafactory-idUSU5N12D01E">evacuated</a> .  According to Storey Joe Curtis, the director of emergency situations, the problem is that several barrels with an ‚Äúunidentified cleaning agent‚Äù turned upside down in a section distant from other workshops.  In addition to the employee placed in the hospital, six others felt unwell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the factory has a special service that deals with cleaning the contaminated area.  There are no threats to the adjacent regions and their inhabitants.  Company spokesman Dave Arnold argues that there is no longer any threat to the life or health of company employees.

      According to the plan, which was previously presented by Musk, the annual production of Tesla batteries at Gigafabrika should soon exceed the global production of Li-Ion batteries in 2013.  In a year, the corporation plans to produce as many batteries as necessary to create 500,000 Model 3 electric vehicles. By 2018, production will be increased up to 35 GWh.  This is about half of the global battery production. <br><br>  In addition to the batteries for electric vehicles Tesla, the company also produces elements for Powerpack and Powerwall - energy storage devices in private households or in small enterprises.  Such systems can serve as an independent unit of the energy infrastructure of an apartment or house, or work together with Solar Roof panels, which Mask recently talked about. <br><br>  By the way, Musk himself calls the production, which is still under construction in Nevada (the factory is not operating at full capacity) as ‚ÄúGigafarm of accumulators No. 1‚Äù.  It may well be that after some time the company will start building other factories, possibly with the involvement of partners.  Ilon Musk built his first production with Panasonic.  ‚ÄúIn the future, we will need many gigafabrik.  Many companies will implement similar projects on their own, ‚Äù <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/249924/">said</a> Musk. <br><br>  An incident that occurred in production is unlikely to affect the growing business of a battery creation mask.  This is still an isolated case, and not the largest one.  In the world of such incidents - a large number.  Most likely, no one would have paid attention to this accident if the accident had not occurred at the Tesla plant.  The more attentively the Mask needs to keep track of its enterprises - from a small problem the companies opposing it can make a large-scale incident. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403251/</a></p>
