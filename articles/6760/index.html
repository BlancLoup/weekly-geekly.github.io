But, of course, at the same time we feel the need to supplement this with a full-fledged real life.  Therefore, we go to each other for a visit, crossing half of the continent, we gather in already completely ordinary companies at a completely ordinary table.  What is it?  What is the reason, what leads to? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Overcoming the boundaries of virtual communication, fans of creativity and legends about vampires, knights, werewolves and the twilight world in just a few years turn into groups of people who are able to offer each other beneficial jobs in many corners of the globe, articles like-minded people in everything that concerns them virtual world.  They rallied so much that many real weddings took place between the players. <br><br>  Online projects with such a large number of players themselves do not stand still, but develop at a rapid pace.  For example, the managers of the project ‚ÄúDozory.  Forbidden Game ‚Äù, created on the basis of the famous trilogy of Sergey Lukyanenko, strongly encourages the unity of players, constantly conducting and sponsoring quests and meetings in many countries.  Prize funds for winners of real contests Others reach several thousand dollars, but players fly even overseas not only for this.  Las Vegas, Israel, Moscow and many other places become a place of pilgrimage for those who no longer think of themselves without real friends acquired ‚Äúin virtuality‚Äù.  The last of a series of extraordinary, but becoming not at all rare, events can be seen in the video reports presented today.  These are videos taken in Moscow during a quest in reality on April 7. <br><br>  <a href="http://rutube.ru/playlists/play/427.html" title="Patrols: Video from the quest in Moscow on April 7">Patrols: Video from the quest in Moscow on April 7</a>

      ‚ÄúAbout 200 people gathered at Pushkin Square at 11 am to once again try their luck by completing the quest.  On April 7, the weather changed from snowfall to warming sun.  However, the weather did not become a hindrance and problem for the passage of tasks.  This is not one quest.  The organizers of such events each time come up with more sophisticated and interesting tasks, which can not please us ordinary players.  In general, everything went very fun and interesting, and even the weather played its part, slightly complicating the passage of the quest, ‚Äùsays one of the participants. <br><br>  Nowadays, even the most serious TV channels begin to talk about the future of mankind through the prism of online games and those who are interested in them.  Despite the fact that the question of whether sovereign virtual states will arise, while for the most part only causes a smirk, it is necessary to understand: real communities of ‚Äúvirtual people‚Äù are already playing and will play a huge role in shaping what our tomorrow will become.  These people, held together by game communication, are stronger than even we, active players, now we can imagine will become more and more and their influence cannot be ignored.  We know that the games have long become not the lot of the elect, but a place and means of communication for all kinds of people, from deputies to housewives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6760/</a></p>
