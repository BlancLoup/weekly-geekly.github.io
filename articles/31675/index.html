  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reasoning on "MacBook Touch"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past week, a lot of speculation has appeared on the topic of a device baptized by the people as a <a href="http://timmmm.habrahabr.ru/blog/47605.html">MacBook Touch</a> .  Yes, we are talking about a laptop with a multi-touch screen, which, according to some rumors, is being developed by Apple.  Let's turn to the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jul2008/tc20080728_737280.htm">reasoning BusinessWeek</a> regarding this device. <br><br>  As it has been repeated more than once, assumptions about the Apple product [ <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/story%3Fid%3D5443989%26page%3D1">1</a> , <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/21/apple-hints-at-a-product-transition-and-a-new-product-soon/">2</a> , <a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/17942/">3</a> , <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/%3Fp%3D2046">4</a> ...] began to appear immediately after the telephone conference on the financial results, at which Peter Oppenheimer noted that Apple was preparing new products.  It also became known that Apple is going to squeeze its profits to 30% by the fiscal year 2009 (from the current 35%).  What conclusions does BusinessWeek journalist <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bios/Arik_Hesseldahl.htm">Arik Hessendal</a> draw from this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Options for action </h2><br>  As you know, there are two sure ways to achieve lower profits: lower the prices themselves, or increase the cost of production by improving the product itself.  From a recent analysis of Gartner, it is known that the share of the US personal computer market for Apple grew by 2.1% over the year.  At the same time, the company could easily increase this percentage by reducing the prices of their computers.  But given that Apple usually keeps the prices of its products in certain ranges, the company will add functionality rather than lower prices to reduce profits. <br><br>  You should also pay attention to the time frame, which Oppenheimer spoke about.  The end of the last fiscal quarter falls in September.  At the same time, the season of academic discounts Apple.  In the past two years, a third of the Mac has been sold this season for the entire year.  From these conclusions, you can begin to make assumptions about Apple‚Äôs plans, which journalists were doing this week.

      Arik Hessendal offers the answer to the legitimate question: why everyone is talking about adding to the MacBook line as a new product. <br><br><h2>  Rumors of a new MacBook </h2><br>  Sales of Apple laptops account for about 60% of all sales for the fiscal year 2007.  But even though laptops snapped up like hotcakes, many people understand that the usual period for updating models is expiring.  The latest update was at the end of February, and Apple usually releases new models every six months. <br><br>  Already <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/macbook/615">there were rumors</a> about the redesign of the MacBook Pro, whose appearance has changed slightly over the past seven years.  At the same time, Peter Oppenheimer's words about working on products that are ‚Äúmore valuable to our customers‚Äù also suggest changes in the line of laptops.  And what is the expected change first to come to mind?  Of course, the wide multi-touch screen "like on the iPhone and iPod Touch."  Maybe not everyone knows, but Apple‚Äôs patent for a multi-touch interface also suggested its use in Mac OS X, and not just in iPhone OS. <br><br><h2>  Big screen on a small laptop? </h2><br>  However, according to <a href="http://www.isuppli.com/">iSuppli</a> analyst Jennifer Kollgrove, Apple is likely to first use multi-touch technology in a device with a size smaller than asking for a MacBook Pro update.  Her colleague Sveta Das agrees with her, adding that the integration of a multi-touch screen in a MacBook Pro will significantly increase the cost of the display - according to some calculations, from 50% to 80% of the real price.  Thus, we conclude that this may be a <strong>sabnotebook with a 9-10-inch screen diagonal with a multi-touch interface</strong> .  According Kollgrov, this screen size is the best option in the ratio of size and cost.  And, of course, an eeePC-like mini-Mac with a full keyboard and multi-touch screen will find its market. <br><br><h2>  Breakthrough again? </h2><br>  Imagine how convenient it will work on a laptop with a multi-touch screen.  Suppose if there is an opportunity to scroll through the contents of the windows with your fingers, zoom in and out of the desktop, switch between the Spaces screens ... This should compensate for the screen size (let it hide what it is, and then it will be all in the prints). <br><br>  There are also arguments against a mini-laptop.  The most obvious - the output of such a product is unlikely to have a good effect on sales of the popular MacBook Air.  But Apple can compensate for this, say, a small amount of hard disk.  In such a laptop, you can place a small SSD (as was done in Asus eeePC), which will positively affect the portability of the device.  And most importantly, this device may well be sold for <em>less than $ 800</em> , which, along with functionality, will surely attract attention. <br><br>  Perhaps multi-touch screens will sooner or later find their application in other Apple devices: laptops and iMac.  Maybe someday we will get so used to the multi-touch interface that we generally forget about the mouse? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31675/</a></p>
