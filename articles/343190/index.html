Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/c6/sk/zfc6skhdznohbkynnp4zuj0joew.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  - Now I will consider your business processes! <br>  ‚ÄúDoesn't that hurt much?‚Äù <br>  - It depends on your business processes. <br><br>  In any company there are employees who will tell you for sure: how much money is on the cash register and on the current account up to a penny (cent) or how much and where in the organization of stools, tables, computers and telephones up to a thing and with an access number on each "object of accounting".  However, it is very rare when someone can answer the question: how many business processes are there in a company, what are their account numbers, who participates in them.  Why? <br><br>  The fact that a company has business processes is usually not questioned, nor is the importance of the Business Process Management (BPM) process itself.  However, practical, simple, but effective approaches to their inventory and classification can be considered as missing.  Let's try to see what the inventory / classification of high-level processes might look like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1 Classical approaches to the classification of processes </h2><br>  In order to calculate something, inventory it, put it on record - you need to first identify this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù, ‚Äúsee the object of accounting‚Äù (it is better to touch it).  If this is about HR, then the accounting objects are employees.

      With employees, everything is simple - they can be built and counted "over the heads."  Computers, monitors, mice, stools and bank accounts are also easy to count and count, and you can always get one correct result (if there are no problems with arithmetic). <br><br>  The company's business processes are similar to x-rays ‚Äî they are not visible ‚Äúto the naked eye.‚Äù  The technical means of their observation, measurement and identification (devices of visibility of processes, heat process-visors) have not yet been invented.  The ‚Äúfluorography‚Äù of the company to identify the processes cannot be done, as yet there is no such special apparatus, like an X-ray one. <br><br>  Over time, such devices will be invented, but for now one has to be content with intuitive perceptions, speculation, which more resembles magic and astral, rather than a scientific approach. <br><br>  For example, if cashiers and supply managers change, then the counting of their accounting objects (money or stools) remains unchanged, but if the head of a department changes, then the list of business processes of the department (and the entire company) can change, although all the subordinates both worked and continue to work "in the old manner." <br><br>  Only the manager's outlook on processes has changed, nothing more: the manager‚Äôs subjectivity (not to mention ordinary employees) on the perception of (his own) processes lies (so far) at the heart of the classification and accounting of the company's business processes. <br><br>  The projection of the same processes on the "skull box" of different chiefs - rarely gives not that the correct, at least the same value.  Periodically, even the same person changes the opinion about the composition of the surrounding business processes, although the processes themselves do not objectively change.  Only his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthem is changing. <br><br>  Consider two classic approaches to the formation of a classifier of business processes. <br><br>  <b>First "On a whim"</b> .  A methodologist, a specialist in BPM, or simply an employee ‚Äúwho was commissioned‚Äù by his own opinion (after reading something and somewhere) forms a list of high-level processes.  Further, the list is agreed with the heads of departments and approved by the director. <br><br>  <b>The second "By analogy."</b>  The general (interbranch) or industry classifiers (reference, reference) or vendor (automation companies) are analyzed, and the company's working classifier is built on their basis. <br><br>  You can find examples of other companies.  Sometimes an external consultant is invited to develop a process classifier, who brings ‚Äúhis‚Äù process classifier, but formed on the same approaches. <br><br>  Thus, there are no ‚Äúmeans of objective control‚Äù (identification) of processes, as long as they are all exclusively subjective. <br><br><h2>  2 Parable </h2><br>  A cartoon plot for business process analysts trying to count business processes based on stories from the Internet and books on BPM - alchemy. <br><br>  Old and no longer fashionable programs: doubling the GDP, high-tech production, modernization, import substitution, and the country's elementary industrialization are forgotten, and the zombie fan is blowing the new slogan ‚ÄúDigitization of the whole country‚Äù puffing up his cheeks!  As there was no development of the economy of capitalist Russia - no. <br><br>  Therefore, the government decided on a cunning "knight's move": if it does not work out to develop a simple economy, then we will develop a digital economy: <a href="http://static.government.ru/media/files/9gFM4FHj4PsB79I5v7yLVuPgu4bvR7M0.pdf">"Digital Economy of the Russian Federation", Order No. 1632-p</a> <br><br>  If we can‚Äôt afford the development, we need to try ‚Äúdigital development‚Äù.  The government has given a new course: on the ‚Äúdigital transformation of the economy‚Äù, on the ‚Äúecosystem of the digital economy‚Äù.  The entire population of the country only now deeply realized that the country needs ‚Äúdigital enterprises‚Äù and ‚Äúdigital business‚Äù.  Obviously, one of the first steps to this: the digitalization of business - processes of enterprises. <br><br>  But the old one arises - the old question is what ‚Äúdigitalization‚Äù is and what is the ‚Äúbusiness process‚Äù.  But nationwide, such private and stupid questions are far from the main ones.  The truth says: ‚ÄúThe main thing is not the result, the main thing is the process!‚Äù <br><br>  A year later, the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) obliged all polled legal entities to submit a register of business processes of the company and its structural divisions involved in them. <br><br>  Providing inaccurate data provides a huge fine and criminal prosecution.  The law was adopted to develop the concept of ‚Äúdigitalization of business processes‚Äù and the transition from the ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù paradigm to ‚Äúknow your business process‚Äù. <br><br>  Reporting on business processes has become crucial compared to accounting, tax, IFRS, management and the rest.  During planned and unscheduled inspections, all supervisory and not-so-supervising bodies, first of all, recalculate the business processes of the organization and compare the ‚Äúcalculated‚Äù data with the data for the last reporting period. <br><br>  The organization should keep a book of open and closed business processes (similar to accounts).  The accounting of digital business processes and ‚Äúnot very digital‚Äù is kept separately, and thus the ‚Äúdigital transformation of business processes and business‚Äù is evaluated. <br><br><h4>  Typical situation in a typical company </h4><br>  - Colleagues, in accordance with the requirements of the legislation in our economy, it is necessary to conduct an obligatory audit check - to calculate all the business processes of our company.  The director looked up from a sheet with the resolution of Rosstat and looked around the gathered top managers - that is, to conduct a complete inventory of ALL the company's business processes.  Do we have them?  Yes, what I ask, of course, is, how can it be without them? <br><br>  - Nobody knows how to count business processes in our company, in the country, on the planet, and maybe in the whole galaxy anyway, so it was decided to entrust the case to Kozlok.  He recently received a certificate of CBOK, and the fact that Kozlenok can count only up to ten - maybe even for the better. <br>  - And if we have more, these most - business processes?  - asked one of the tops. <br>  - Then we write down ten.  Only confirmed data can be entered into the results. <br>  - We will count business processes one by one, using the rules of arithmetic.  This should not be very painful.  The procedure is short, so the owners of business processes, please do not diverge.  Goat, start! <br><br>  The goat, proud of the honor rendered to him, made an intelligent face and patted the Talmud lying next to them. CBOK: Now, now - we will count them all, no one will hide from me! <br><br>  - The number one business process is ‚ÄúBusiness Process Management‚Äù, i.e.  Business Process Management (BPM).  And the owner of such an important business process is me!  Professional connoisseur with a CBOK diploma.  All approvingly boomed: everyone was pleased that their processes are considered such an authoritative expert. <br>  - Now let everyone call his business process, let's start from left to right, no, not right, the processes are rightly considered right and left.  So, the first gentleman on the right - what is the business process in the unit entrusted to you?  You, as a business process owner, have you ever seen this business process (of this beast), where did his ears stick out? <br>  - No, I did not see it, but I know for sure that it is.  I have received a quarterly award for optimizing my business process, and the following year, the new KPI approved ‚Äúto optimize its previously optimized business process for exactly two and a half times‚Äù. <br>  - Excellent, following your logic, the process is called "The process of optimization two and a half times."  Beautiful and clear name. <br><br>  - Mister HR, and you, what business process you manage? <br>  - We fired half of our employees last quarter, so I‚Äôm not mistaken if I call our process: ‚ÄúStaff optimization‚Äù.  By the end of the year, we also want to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù a couple of employees. <br>  - What is your progressive staff optimization method!  To optimize business processes the same should be used.  Total already counted three processes.  Following!  Have you seen your process?  Where and when? <br>  - Yes, I saw yesterday.  I look out the window - and it rains outside the window, two students, and after them my production process.  One student went to the coat, the second to the movies, and my process went limping, but according to the schedule. <br>  - Where did they all come from? <br>  - The first student got off the bus, another one lost his temper and for this they put him in jail, and my process went after him - he also lost his temper, but who will put him in prison?  He is a "process" (he is a monument)! <br>  - Yes-ah, there are difficulties with the name of your process.  Therefore, we call it simply "Process number four." <br><br>  - Slonikov, Udavkin transferred to you yesterday a large and critically important business process for Martyshkina, where are you doing the process?  Lost? <br>  - It seems lost, sorry.  Yesterday, he seemed to be, but today he is no longer there - the Elephant men said sadly, twisting both pockets for authenticity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/3_/_r/km3__rsz8c2qrkzwagv6xhflorq.jpeg"></div><br>  - So I‚Äôll point out in the report: ‚Äúplus one lost business process‚Äù.  Total already five, and tomorrow we call the lost and found office, maybe someone found the process and picked it up.  Although I know from experience that the "Business Process" is such a thing that if you lose it, then it is better not to look. <br>  Following! <br><br>  - We have a business process, we constantly stumble over it.  Long and collapsed right at the entrance, we even measured it with the new Business activity monitoring system, it turned out 38 parrots.  We measure all processes in parrots and we always get exactly 38. <br>  - I write down: a business process with the name "38 parrots".  Go ahead. <br><br>  - Who else saw your business process? <br>  - I saw, however, only in a dream: the process was beautiful and incomparable. <br>  - Where and how was the process going? <br>  - The process had no legs, so he crawled on his stomach, so slowly. <br>  - Poor business process, in how it has managed.  I heard from friends that they also need crutches for many business processes, especially for automated ones. <br>  - Write down and my process, but it is very long: the tail of the process is not even visible.  Sometimes I doubt: does he even have an end. <br>  - Is it all right with your head?  Yes, not the owner, and the business process. <br>  - And do not forget about my business process, it ‚Äúwas once a strange nameless process‚Äù ... Previously, my process went by itself, and then I realized that the process had to be managed and given a unique name (process identifier). <br>  The process is the same as a ship: as you call a ship, it will float.  Only the ships do not float, but go, therefore they called the process ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù, now the process is in full swing, across the Atlantic ... <br><br>  - I am ashamed to admit, but I have a very, very correct business process, honest at all its stages. <br>  - If the process is fair, then the owner of this business process is stupid.  Honest processes only in the Soviet Union were needed, and we have developed capitalism.  Head of HR - look, please, for the owner, - he is a candidate for "optimization". <br>  ‚ÄúWhat other processes?‚Äù  We don‚Äôt need to hide them, count them in an amicable way.  He who conceals it will be worse. <br>  - I have a manual process.  Initially, we introduced it - wild, but we tamed the process.  Now we are being offered to automate it or, what is even more inhuman, to digitize, but we feel sorry for it.  Do not let him offense! <br><br>  - Mr. Director, what is your business process?  Ah, I know, they taught, he remembered: Strategic management, strategic management, strategic development, strategic ... and if in one word ‚ÄúStrategic everything!‚Äù. <br>  - Another process is forgotten, the most subtle: "The Forgotten Process."  Are there any other processes?  There is!  Enough already, it's time to finish the inventory.  The last will be the process with the name ‚ÄúThe rest of the process‚Äù or better the ‚ÄúOther process‚Äù.  All remaining there and call.  But why?  There are more than ten of them, and so we write down ten. <br><br>  - At the end of the report, you need to give an overall assessment of the processes we considered.  I will write this: The business processes of our company are calculated, the most optimal, extremely efficient, good and very correct. <br>  They comply with the best ‚ÄúBest Practice‚Äù, all laws, sub-laws and super-laws of the state and its owners. <br><br>  The presence of such excellent and ‚Äúdouble digital‚Äù business processes in our organization became possible only thanks to the efforts of the Prime Minister and his magic program ‚ÄúDigital Economy of the Russian Federation‚Äù. <br>  Thanks to them for thinking of us.  Point.  Signature: Commissioner for the inventory and audit of business processes, ‚ÄúThe Kid‚Äù. <br><br>  - Goat, why are you in the report "bullshit porem", the processes we have are not the same?  We do almost everything with our hands, the automation coefficient is zero, the operational risks go off-scale, no optimization.  Our day-to-day business processes are not to be found, where they only hid to consultants of knowledge. <br>  - You do not understand anything: the audit of business processes is an independent assessment - Kozlenok answered - This is my professional judgment. <br><br>  Collected based on the m / f "Goatling, who counted to ten", "Hello monkey" and <a href="http://marks1975.livejournal.com/33177.html">this</a> <br><br>  <b>Attention.</b>  Section number two ‚ÄúParable‚Äù is a fiction (satirical introduction), all possible matches are random.  So far, there has been no such order from Rosstat!  And some of those who have read it - with horror ask me for the details of the Rosstat resolution and the form for filling in the report on the audit of the company's business processes. <br><br><h2>  3 Conclusion to introduction </h2><br>  The parable was inspired by articles and books on the classification of business processes.  Different classification, common phrases, not a single practical example of a detailed classifier (not referential), at least 200 positions. <br>  BPM theory and electronic waste paper on the Internet is a dime a dozen, but there is nothing to use for practical tasks.  Next, we will try to give our own recipes for compiling a classifier of high-level business processes. <br><br>  If anyone still has links to competent classification methods for both high-level and detailed business processes - send, consider, check, it will be very curious to learn about such. <br><br>  <i>To be continued (unless of course karma is enough).</i> <br><br>  PS: repeated corrected publication, the reference to the known classifier of processes is excluded </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343190/</a></p>
