The instigator of the party was a Spanish designer and artist <a href="http://hectorayuso.me/">H√©ctor Ayuso</a> .  Hector himself calls OFFF not just a festival, but a way of life that is constantly changing and evolving. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/acronis/blog/303278/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/379/065/fd9/379065fd904342fab44bddd132b7c10a.JPG" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The festival is not about how to work and solve problems in the processes according to the instructions.  He is absolutely about the opposite - about how to always love what you do, feel free to be open and not be afraid to make mistakes when trying new things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My interest in OFFF was born quite recently, after the Russian version of the festival, which was made by the guys from Spawn.  That was the first time I learned how crazy <a href="http://www.joshuadavis.com/">Joshua Davis was</a> in terms of mixing the analog and digital worlds.  I saw with my own eyes that it is not for nothing that <a href="https://www.ideo.com/">IDEO is</a> considered one of the greatest innovators.  And at the afterparty of the festival for a long time I tried to make "Igor Nikolayev" from <a href="http://www.akqa.com/">AKQA</a> drink for love.

      And then six months later, I realize that I am standing in line for registration at the original OFFF near <a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/museudeldisseny/">the Design Museum of Barcelona</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31b/87b/f5f/31b87bf5ffff47b0982864b285a1ac31.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  They put a bracelet on my arm to enter, give Archetype a book about the participants of the festival to the other and don‚Äôt give a T-shirt, which were intended only for those who bought tickets to the festival a year (!) Before that day. <br><br>  A little bit about how we spent time during the breaks.  They drank satanic coffee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/540/b14/4e0/540b144e056c4523a26605542371c9ac.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  We walked in the neon corridors of the hotel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5a/f1c/83f/d5af1c83fe57491cb6748c4c359cbc1c.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  OFFF in Barcelona is something.  Cool atmosphere, more than three thousand participants and masters of different types of art, who stand in line with you in line for burgers to the old Citroen truck, in which they are prepared (burgers, not masters!).  Here are Denis Kortunov, along with Yura Vetrov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/154/a94/31e/154a9431ee7349288b01e3d32592bd64.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The queues, by the way, have always been huge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdb/825/7e9/fdb8257e91b54535b16f934c06abd106.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Those to whom the hotter Barcelona sun was closer than a huge cool room inside the Design Museum, sat outside and watched the live broadcast on the big screen in the food area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/823/962/6fb/8239626fb3c54e078402000d76472afb.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In the meantime, almost all the seats were filled in the hall, and those who wanted to sit closer, but did not manage to take a seat, settled right on the floor between the rows.  We also did this many times, by the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bf/a08/4f0/9bfa084f071e4df88066f36f77390663.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The first impression from the speakers - people are absolutely not afraid to be themselves, sincere and open up to the most personal topics.  Many have said that it is extremely important to love what you are doing, because it is then that you can do your best and do really good things that you will not be ashamed of later. <br><br>  A little more about those performances that I liked more than others.  And in case you want to read more about the speakers, I will enclose links on the subject. <br><br><h2>  Teaser and opening credits </h2><br>  The festival has a very cool tradition.  Each time, specifically for the festival, one of the participants makes opening credits and main credits, which are shown on the last day.  This time there was an incredibly cool and bright teaser, which the authors described something like this: ‚ÄúWe wanted to show what each organizer and OFFF participant feels every year: an incredible mixture of pure insanity, hard work, adventure, nerves and fun!‚Äù: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/158860371&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKi38qmht9zntcrtPuWS2ZBxmZBg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="OFFF Barcelona 2016 TEASER!" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The teaser was made by students of <a href="http://www.lawebdelatelier.com/">Atelier, an</a> independent design school located in Barcelona.  Thanks to them appeared not only a teaser, but also opening credits.  And the whole corporate style of the festival, including T-shirts, was also made by them. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/168162641&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhJ_wE51_zHqnsWT875r1DSdCiPeg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="OFFF Barcelona 2016 Open Titles by Atelier" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the opening credits, the guys talked about how they came up with and brought to life a teaser with captions, experimented with branding for the festival and at the last moment changed the format of the book to fit everything they wanted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/790/2a9/3217902a94a74be0a0a982ef881d6d7a.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  It's funny that the characteristic joke from the world of Russian design ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too expensive and my son can do this on his laptop in 15 minutes‚Äù is characteristic of all world design, judging by the quotes from the Atelier guys. <br><br><h2>  Ustwo </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07e/ddd/dda/07eddddda81142559628325de66bbccc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The studio was represented by two people who talked about the same thing as Mans Adler in Russia.  If you were not at Strelka last September, I advise you <a href="http://www.strelka.com/ru/magazine/2015/09/23/mans-adler-ustwo">to read the interview</a> .  The guys are famous for what they did Monument Valley, which earned 14 and a half million dollars in two years after the release.  And a day after they accidentally lit up in the House of Cards - 40 thousand dollars! <br><br>  Do you know what guys led to success?  Here's what: ‚ÄúDo not care about this your marketing, monetization, and so on.  Let's just make the game the way we want it! ‚Äù  And it perfectly reflects their inner motto ‚ÄúJust F # @ king Do It‚Äù. <br><br>  A little about the processes of the company.  Everybody works in sprints, including designers, and the ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù Test ‚ÄùLearn‚Äù cycle is in the order of things for them.  Ustwo remind you of important things: always work together, forget about your ego and remember that people evaluate the result of your work for the part that is the worst done. <br><br><h2>  Creativeapplications.net </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e6/169/41d/0e616941dcfd4a1196047500a4ad38e5.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  A little blurry story, but still interesting.  Among the good thoughts is that you should look for inspiration in nature and revise your experiments from the past.  If you do not know who these guys are, then be sure to visit their <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/">website</a> - they tell about many projects at the intersection of science, technology and art.  A very interesting project is a <a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/news/momentum-interactive-framework-for-creating-visuals-from-body-movement/">framework</a> that allows you to generate sounds and visual effects based on the movements of the human body.  The theme of mixing analog and digital is super popular at the festival - it was most clearly revealed by Joshua Davis and Rama Allen, but more on that later. <br><br><h2>  The mill </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/93e/7c4/c8193e7c499f4c4a9d5b9ee1bcdc99e9.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The coolest masters of special effects and visual technology from New York.  <a href="http://www.themill.com/">The Mill was</a> represented by Rama Allen, creative director of the studio.  Rama talked about "magical thinking", the essence of which is to find your ritual that brings the most results.  In his case, the simple way works (it also helps me, by the way): you need to pick up a special playlist, plug in the headphones and go out for a walk outside the office. <br><br>  Among the projects of the studio there are several works with biometric data in addition to ‚Äúordinary‚Äù commercials for monsters of the market and special effects for films.  Let me show you the story of the creation of the project that I liked the most: the most elegant mixture of analog (mascara, oils and alcohol) and digital (generating the sacred geometric patterns framework and flower, changing the look of the music): <a href="http://www.themill.com/millchannel/731/red-bull-music-academy-%25E2%2580%2598a-night-of-spiritual-jazz%25E2%2580%2599-installation">article</a> and video for those who don‚Äôt wants to read a lot of letters: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/167431634&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIbTtnhE_YtWGh9nFrP_gFE3GdGg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Red Bull Music Academy - A Night of Spiritual Jazz" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Signalnoise </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f34/fd3/863/f34fd38634df4223ae9fe6f2c109056c.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Stylish and very fine niche Canadian James White and his studio <a href="http://signalnoise.com/">Signalnoise</a> .  James talked about how his children's drawings on the theme of comics and various sports icons of the time grew into what he does now.  And he is crazy abruptly beats the increasingly popular themes of the eighties: neon noir, multi-stage bright gradients and illustrations on the theme of retro pop culture of the 80s.  He rightly mentions his slogan ‚ÄúDo not try to ignore a stupid idea‚Äù and continues to do ‚Äújoint projects with himself‚Äù after 30 years. <br><br>  James made the credits for last year's OFFF, and I'll show them to you: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/129531286&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjRVK31_cBkwXl8vkZlaqTUYuVivA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="OFFF Barcelona 2015 Main Titles by Signalnoise and Onesize" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Since James (like many other speakers, by the way) lived in the same hotel with us, I managed to catch him and take a picture together: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/456/aad/eb8/456aadeb80dd41c1b6c6f299d89cd9f8.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  And James reminds us that you shouldn't be afraid of showing others what you are doing.  Who knows where it will lead you: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/36e/6c3/ae736e6c3a6942628c1673fb809db114.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Joshua Davis + Kiran Gandhi </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/62c/a06/e3d62ca065194ab9bbd3c2b97ef50657.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  My unconditional favorites of the festival.  <a href="http://www.joshuadavis.com/">Joshua Davis</a> is a man who has been doing what I want for a long time, but I can‚Äôt find the time to learn.  Wonderful generative art, mixing analog and digital.  But then he moved him to a new level in my mind: this time Joshua performed with the beautiful drummer <a href="https://kirangandhi.com/">Kiran Gandhi</a> .  Kiran is in itself a very interesting figure - an activist-feminist who proves her views with deeds and does not build an offended and disadvantaged girl.  Just see how talented: Kieran acted as drummer for MIA and just recently received an MBA degree.  He is engaged in art and improves his professional knowledge. <br><br>  Video of the first minutes of the speech, which I took, sitting on the floor between the rows: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/170465234&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiGDeV5O6TNjpDdvnLfGN3YpD6Ulw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Joshua Davis w / Kiran Gandhi @ OFFF 2016" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Towards the end, the entire hall danced and applauded.

I did not know, but it turns out they already spent 60 thousand hours on development!  If you are not familiar with this project, then you should know: this is very cool music mixed up with visual effects, but in the simplest and most accessible shell.  The guys even made a special version for OFFF, poke a little into the keyboard: <a href="http://offf.patatap.com/">offf.patatap.com</a> . <br><br>  So the guys are experimenting with the search for sound: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PdoXgToXcg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhheoaCbYY77k0IBk4gHBrh0b64t8g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And they have a very interesting project about how the words sound.

The whole story can be fully <a href="http://kitchen.johnnycupcakes.com/story/">read on his website</a> . <br><br>  Johnny emphasizes the importance of user experience from delivering the product to packaging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e5/cd3/06d/8e5cd306d8154f7086e1e86c2e539e3f.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  He positions himself as the world's first "T-shirt bakery".  Of course, this is connected with a bunch of funny stories about how people came to his store, hoping to eat cupcakes, but left disappointed and post displeased reviews after that online. <br><br>  An interesting approach with limited series - for example, the ‚ÄúBreakfast special‚Äù series, which could only be purchased during breakfast hours.  Johnny had a special promotion for distributing T-shirts: within 20 minutes after he posted an ad on Instagram, anyone who caught him got a T-shirt. <br><br><h2>  Mr Bingo </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/c05/a6b/4e3c05a6b63b42d4bf9a74481eb344bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another favorite of mine, but now in the flow and courage of the product.  Incredibly cool storyteller, brave and crazy just as much as everyone should be.  When <a href="http://shop.mr-bingo.org.uk/">Mr. Bingo</a> was going to launch a campaign on Kickstarter called Hate Mail (be sure to rate the degree of madness at the link: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrbingo/hate-mail-the-definitive-collection">www.kickstarter.com/projects/mrbingo/hate-mail-the-definitive-collection</a> ), he asked himself: why should you shoot a boring video, which is in every other campaign on Kickstarter?  You can after all make cool, one that no one dared and remembered!  That is how the rap rap video was born, which he shot together with his friends: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/133778865&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjeEri9QHruFlAp3tNrltN02rmcBg" width="560" height="280" frameborder="0" title="Mr Bingo - Hate Mail" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We did not fully watch his performance for a good reason: Denis choked me at the Adobe Stock stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b49/13e/10a/b4913e10a2c6468b8e8806043b959fa4.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Timothy goodman </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/b09/cdc/01eb09cdca68439f9efa586d7f898c69.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://tgoodman.com/">Tim</a> talked about how he built his career thanks to the fact that he wrote the usual Sharpie marker and about his projects that were supposed to help him and other people become more humane. <br><br>  Among what he did, I liked the project about human relations most of all, <a href="http://fortydaysofdating.com/">40 Days of Dating</a> .  Here's how Tim and his best friend Jessica describe the experiment: ‚ÄúThey say that a person needs 40 days to get rid of the habit.  Therefore, in trying to study each other and get rid of fears, Tim and Jessica will go through all the thorns of a relationship in these 40 days.  Can they learn how to help each other?  or will they stay with their habits?  Will they destroy their friendship?  Or maybe fall in love with each other?

But from magic OFFF I can not move away until now.  Incredible atmosphere and energy event, which normally gives you a kick in the ass and says, ‚ÄúAnd you cho relaxed finally?‚Äù.  It was at the end of this festival, standing knee-deep in the cold Mediterranean Sea when I experienced an almost forgotten feeling when it became sad that something had ended. <br><br>  Do not forget that your future determines what you do in your free time, go crazy and make your own projects.  And do not brake and go ahead for tickets to the next OFFF: <a href="http://tickets.offf.ws/events">tickets.offf.ws/events</a> .  It's worth it! <br><br><h2>  Thanks </h2><br>  Our trip could not take place at all if it were not for the encouragement of our company Acronis.  This is incredibly cool when the company understands the value of such conferences, where they do not talk about processes, methods and instructions (these are also very necessary events!), But fill them with real inspiration. <br><br>  Special thanks to Yura Vetrov for taking a 14-block walk to the trendy Danish brewery Mikkeller.  It is thanks to that evening that many now know that trying Chipotle Porter is a big risk and danger. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303278/</a></p>
