She makes them think what they would like to do with their property before asking them to compile a catalog of everything they own.  This is a standard process in the making of a will.  Now Yip has added another item to that process - customers need to take inventory of digital assets in order to determine the future of their digital heritage. <br><br>  I had a great friend in LiveJournal, whom I had never seen, but had been online for many years.  And once he was gone.  Unfortunately, it can happen to anyone.

      Let's talk about what will happen to our pages after death. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/203/91f/a2a20391fda93ab6afe86ce72bfd2774.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, not every person makes a testament indicating the logins and passwords from social networks.  But the services themselves have long understood that something needs to be done.  In Facebook, if the network stops growing, in 2065 the number of accounts of dead people will exceed the number of live ones: in the first 8 years of the network‚Äôs existence, there were 30 million accounts of the dead in it.  One of the employees of Facebook after the death of his close friend realized that the social network needed functionality that would allow a person‚Äôs relatives or friends to access the account. <br><br>  After the death of the user, Facebook offers to set a memorable status for the account or remove it from the social network without the possibility of recovery.  In an account in a memorable status, friends and family members of the deceased can share memories of a person.  At the same time, posts created by the deceased can be saved in his account and are accessible to the audience according to the initial settings.  In the upper right corner of Facebook, select Settings =&gt; Security =&gt; Keeper.  Here you can set up contacts or choose the final account deletion. <br><br>  But among the problems associated with the memorable status, developers from Facebook cite the fact that not everyone knows about this feature.  And if a person has died, and he has no custodian, then nothing can be done when contacting a social network - because it goes against the rules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ee/a35/a24/9eea35a24122d9584579e18fc0980e9f.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2013, Google added the item <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/account/inactive">‚ÄúGoogle just in case‚Äù</a> in the privacy settings.  In it, you can configure a period after which the account can be called inactive.  When this period passes, Google notifies the user via SMS and email.  Having received no response, the system will either delete the account or transfer it to the previously added proxies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/625/8ef/7e1/6258ef7e13f316d63271210bf5370000.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In Odnoklassniki there is no such functional.  Because Muscovite after the death of his daughter had <a href="http://mir24.tv/news/society/13604669">to sue</a> the social network, demanding to provide the password from the girl‚Äôs personal page.  The administration can provide access to the data if there is a court decision confirming the right to inherit the page, and can also delete the account after submitting the application and death certificate of the user. <br><br>  Twitter has a <a href="https://support.twitter.com/forms/privacy">special form</a> that allows family members or representatives of the deceased to deactivate an account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/050/ca6/525/050ca65255a2c8272ae97b85b2923022.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12350/~/deceased-linkedin-member---removing-profile">LinkedIn</a> has a Twitter-like form.  It was only partially translated into Russian.  In the screenshot - only <a href="https://ru.help.linkedin.com/app/ask/path/ts-rdmlp">half of the entire form</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/161/b09/60b/161b0960baa632623c590b73a7aa2aa0.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  After the death of the owner of a LiveJournal account, his relatives <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/support/submit/">can write a request</a> with the heading% username% acct memorial, after which the account can be closed, translated into a ‚Äúmemorial‚Äù status with the ability to comment or just read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbe/914/fac/cbe914facfbfea7fcf84b4548548861d.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Have you set up your accounts in case of death or have prepared logins and passwords in your will?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371935/</a></p>
