  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our way through the thorns to the stars. The history of past greatness and dreams of the future ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The last time on the Web increased fermentation around space exploration.  And this is understandable, then new solar cells were invented there, with surprising efficiency, here microsatellites were standardized and Arduino was launched into space, then this and that.  And when Curiosity successfully primarilsya and began to transmit images, here God himself ordered the public to explode in discussions. <br>  And it is natural, already overdue, so to speak.  It hurts too much time passed from the flight of the first satellite, the first man and the landing on the moon.  And things, as they say, and now there.  Radically new in the space industry, nothing happened, no loud breakthroughs, only improvements and improvements ... Hence the heightened interest in the topic, people feel that the time has come for new accomplishments. <br><br>  <i>Further I ask under kat, there will be a lot of emotions and photos.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... And I feel it.  And looking at 10 foreign successes, we have one domestic, and how one of our failures accounts for up to five of ours ... and how all this is then exaggerated with gusto in the media, and how Roscosmos, enterprises, science, scientists ... and people ... And what a sin to conceal, I myself often scold Roscosmos.  Well, there is simply no more strength, well, how much can you roll down. <br>  To roll down from year to year, when we already had everything.  We were the first, and sought further not only because we were <b>obliged to</b> be the first.  And because we so wanted, we needed it, we needed stars!  And we were ready to give them to everyone.  We sought them and called for the rest.  And they were happy and purposeful in their zeal. <br><br>  And when I once again blinked our Roskosmos, then with sorrow I caught myself thinking that we all remember the past greatness, but we don‚Äôt have a common memory bank of our achievements.  And this is amazing!  Much with great pleasure, people prepare lists of our space failures, build beautiful graphics and carefully compare with competitors in order to then shake their heads meaningfully and sigh "Yeah ... everyone pissed off ...". <br>  But this is wrong.  After all, these snot lead to nothing!

      But let's remember better than we are rich.  Let's look at <b>our achievements</b> , all at once, comprehensively. <br>  Everyone has a memory of some achievement from the past, but they are all scattered, in the media, on the web, between people.  I propose to combine them.  To isolate from the general course of events and show separately from the list of our failures. <br>  I am sure that the result will be directly opposite to the one that causes a simple comparison of our achievements and them, our failures and them, which is so popular now, which is in trend, so to speak. <br>  And yes, you guessed it, the post will be devoted to the popularization of astronautics in our homeland. <br><br>  I invite you to look at the achievements in the space industry of a single enterprise - VNIITRANSMASHA. <br>  And only a narrow slice of advances in the development of planetary rovers. <br>  And I assure you that in such a view you will have a different look at our national science, and its past, and its future. <br><br>  I took the Chronology of Space Development available on the VNIITRANSMASHA website.  But according to the author‚Äôs strange idea, it‚Äôs impossible to get to this page from the site of the enterprise itself.  I once managed to reach it only by reference from a search engine ... you must admit, the creator‚Äôs non-trivial approach. <br>  Then I tried to fill the material with good photos and the maximum number of links, revealing the importance of each individual development.  It is possible to be or not to be a visual, but we get 90% of the information through sight. <br>  And although it was not possible to find additional information or photographs for all products ( <i><b>modern time mercilessly erases from memory everything that does not have an equivalent in gross profit, including people ...</b></i> ), in my opinion it turned out very well. <br>  The main thing is that I solved the main task I had set myself - I made one cell of our achievements bank (forgive me for pride and pomposity), a small cell limited only by rover and only one enterprise, but the CELLULAR. <br>  Let not very professional in terms of web designer, and not very correct in terms of links to foreign articles and resources.  But I am satisfied with my work.  In my heart, an article causes exactly the feeling that I wanted to feel - pride, the power of opportunity and the desire to go forward. <br><br>  And who decides to improve my thought (for I will regard any constructive criticism as an improvement), so I will only be happy, so the topic has found its reader and I chose the right way)) <br><br>  So: <br><br><h5>  Chronology of space research VNIITM </h5><br><ul><li>  1963.

And we had everything - the possibilities and the desire. <br>  And it seems to me that the time has come to finally sober up from the 20-year-old dope of the market economy and take a step BACK, for there is nowhere to step forward after the ideology of ‚Äúbought cheaper - sold more expensive‚Äù, there is a bottomless abyss and silence ... <br>  Take a step where people were ruled by ideas and a fiery heart, not a consumer basket and fear. <br>  But do not confuse my call with the call to return to the communist past, I‚Äôm not talking about it at all, and not even about the political system in principle, because the ideal system on Earth does not exist now and will not exist until monetary relations are higher than social and spiritual.  I urge you to carefully read at least the last hundred years.  We have already tried all the rakes and in all poses in which it is only possible to do this with a rake.  And we already have more than enough baggage of experience and knowledge to finally start living and working in a Human way, to be happy, and to make happy people around us ... <br><br>  And as a modest contribution to the excursion into the past, links to additional resources (some have already been used in this article as sources of good photos) for this very narrow (almost through the eyes of a single enterprise), but very interesting and significant topic, the topic of space research. <br><br>  A man always looked at the stars, and sometimes he did it more than well: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://bcam.spb.ru/ib/tech/vtm/index.htm">Wheel planetary robots VNIITM;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://bcam.spb.ru/ib/tech/vtm/part2.htm">Other development VNIITM;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.vniitransmash.ru/MENU/ACTIVITY/activityip.html">An alternative list of developments VNIITM with those.</a>  <a href="http://www.vniitransmash.ru/MENU/ACTIVITY/activityip.html">characteristics;</a> </li><li>  A documentary film about the <i>"Object E-8"</i> ; <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/breztPLXWSk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiywV_AhBtqxIji4ZpDmecORwyGdg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></li><li>  The documentary film <i>‚ÄúFrom the Moon Rover to the Mars Rover‚Äù</i> (I <b>strongly recommend everyone to watch this very rare film in English, but everything is clear</b> ); <br>  <b>Part 1</b> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nF2gU3_9WC4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhQTp4TCYzyxp9pyV-ZwrsO2l5kSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Part 2</b> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/970qGmm0Y9Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYnGNF9pYNd3NqIYnPujZQH0CDwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></li><li>  A separate film about the device from the second part - <i>‚ÄúVenus X-VD-2‚Äù</i> ; <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqx85kCGais%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhheqCjdEagJcFDaO0xam80rgXVvYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  ; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mentallandscape.com/V_Venus.htm">History of the development of Venus by the Soviet Union (in English);</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://danielmarin.blogspot.com/2011/09/construyendo-una-nave-capaz-de.html">History of the development of Venus by the Soviet Union (in Spanish);</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/meet-the-very-first-rover-to-land-on-mars">A small article in 2012 about the <b>very first Rover on Mars</b> .</a>  Thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/hydralien/" class="user_link">hydralien</a> and his article: " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150420/">Soviet rovers</a> "; </li><li>  And the very <i><a href="http://www.vniitransmash.ru/MENU/WE/kosmos.html">"Chronology of the space theme"</a></i> , which I took as a basis and, as it seems to me, filled with some new meaning, with your permission ...)) </li></ol><br>  <i>In conclusion, I repeat once again, now we are rolling down.</i>  <i>And not by their own will, but by their lack of will.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But we already had everything, and we have everything to go up.</i>  <i>And this main ‚Äúall‚Äù is our people.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>This is us.</b></i> <br><br>  PS <br>  If anyone has good comprehensive links to the achievements of the domestic space industry, in any language, please send a good addition to the list. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150169/</a></p>
