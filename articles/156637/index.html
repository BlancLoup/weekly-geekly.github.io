      But seriously, Mine is a site where people communicate through their stuff.  Finally you can: <br><ul><li>  Join the club of the penknife owners </li><li>  Tickle your fat materialistic ego </li><li>  Publicly confess a touching tenderness to your laptop </li><li>  Show everyone what you are worth (literally) </li><li>  Find the female geek on the White Harley and with the prefix dandy </li><li>  Watch for the owner of a new Vertu at night at the entrance!  (to chat) </li><li>  Openly hate the owner of 7 iPhones!  (etc.) </li></ul><br>  Why do we think that such a seemingly easy-thinking idea can become a strong link in the global e-commerce market, why shops should get in our queue and a couple of strategic secrets - under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Context </h2><br><br>  Hi, we are Vova, Petya and Lyosha. <br><br>  Quickly tell what we have been doing here for a couple of years. <br><br>  There is a huge e-commerce market where Amazon and Ibei rule the ball.  But you already know all this.  On it there are also (now numerous) aggregators of consumer likes - sticky services such as <a href="http://pinterest.com/">interest</a> , <a href="http://thefancy.com/">fancy</a> , <a href="http://svpply.com/">svpply</a> .  But all this is happening in the primary market, i.e.  like and discuss the proposed products for sale.  And the niche about which we are going to talk now is the sticky potential of the secondary market. <br><br>  Not every interesting thing is sold, but it definitely belongs to someone.  Thus, Mine is not about preferences (likes), but about <i>real, accomplished purchases of</i> people - i.e.  that they actually choose and what they own. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Appeal to the user. </h2><br><br><blockquote>  <i>Dear friend!</i>  <i>You have already developed the Pavlovian reflex: duck lips in the mirror - instagrams, clever thoughts and jokes - twitter or blog.</i>  <i>Where to go when you have cool stuff?</i>  <i>(clothes, masl car grandfather, great-grandmother's ring) - to you on Mine.</i>  <i>Here in the spotlight - things.</i>  <i>Unique, popular, new, old, any.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  The site is definitely primarily for entertainment.  But at the same time there are positive side-effects, which is not a sin to mention: <br><br><ul><li>  Finding your double is priceless.  By adding a thing, you are contacting all its owners.  Somewhere there probably sits a person with whom your tastes completely coincide, or with which you have the same hours that you got from your grandfather. </li><li>  Interesting people, hobby colleagues and local trendsetters.  Follow them and enjoy the ‚Äúraging unity of souls‚Äù. </li><li>  If you are looking for a certain type of person - it can sometimes be calculated by the objects characteristic of him. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb2/615/f1a/eb2615f1ad343e225093564c4e814642.png" alt="Mine: Guess the owner"><br></li><li>  Gift selection tools for friends.  All user stuff in sight.  See what you already have, what you like and what you don‚Äôt give.  In addition, the internal ‚Äúwishlist‚Äù - Like and Envi buttons show that a person likes and wants </li><li>  Recommendations.  It's one thing to read something on the Amazon, another thing is to see what else the person who buys the goods owns.  You can determine the relevance of his advice or his choice for you.  Need more information?  Just ask him. </li><li>  What socks Jessica Alba wears, and what deodorant Johnny Depp uses, you will find out as soon as they register on the site (we are working on it) </li></ul><br><br>  The profile is made on a flash (this is a necessary measure, not a revolution of common sense) in the form of an intricate "Tree of things".  Here is one of the real <a href="http://mine.is/tree/162/">profiles</a> , for example: <br><br> <a href="http://mine.is/tree/162/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a6/50e/0c2/7a650e0c24308a0a794d88e2be339fde.jpg" alt="Mine tree of things"></a> <br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br><h2>  Some strategic secrets: </h2><br><br><h3>  Monetization. </h3><br><br>  We have several potential sources of income: <br><br><ol><li>  Affiliate Clicks.  Every thing is a potential product, and may have a link to the store.  Third-party services such as skimlinks can turn links from ordinary to affiliated on the fly. <br></li><li>  Access to advanced API.  Having valuable data about things and their owners, we can act as a back-end for other sites that can benefit from this data.  Example: look at me, lookbook.nu, any shopping and material communities (including interests), owners clubs, drive2.ru etc. </li><li>  Selling data.  Again, data can be explored and built analytics.  Aggregated preferences of people, their dynamics - are of interest to participants and market researchers. </li><li>  Advanced paid accounts for brand / store representatives, with whistles and pyrotechnics </li></ol><br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br><h2>  And the most important secret </h2><br><br>  Only shh.  Seriously. <br><br>  The secret plan to capture the Internet through the introduction of (free) widgets on the post-checkout pages of online stores. <br>  At the moment, they (shops) are almost unrelated to most of their customers and know little about them.  You bought something and disappeared.  And they want to be friends with you, so that you come back, so that you are loyal.  And they spam you.  Well, who does that? <br><br>  Here we arrive such supermen, iii ..: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e96/ad3/499/e96ad34993ba8bdce64a5a6ac157538b.png" alt="Order recieved, Mine offer is shown"><br><br>  The buyer, unsuspecting, clicks on the "add thing".  Fly trapped.  Now the store can: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Get to</b> know <b>him</b> : where else does a person make purchases, what does he buy, what are his interests, what is his network of influence. </li><li>  <b>Increase loyalty</b> by creating a long-term relationship with the buyer.  If we are talking about a cool product (new, unusual, bright), which they will gladly tell friends, be ready to publicly announce that they <b>bought it from you</b> - then you should not miss this opportunity.  There is such a thing as endorser, something like a loyal brand supporter.  In fact, each buyer is invited to become such a supporter. </li><li>  <b>Create a micro community</b> , the club owners of each thing.  All customer comments, their thoughts on this product, their photos are collected on the aggregated <a href="http://mine.is/things/910">product page</a> .  Now you can follow the communication channel of this particular product and even communicate with them directly. </li></ul><br>  In the end, it is called <b>dried media marketing</b> .  After all, what happens on the Main?  People tell other people about the goods.  Isn‚Äôt it something that (most often in vain) any SMM man is trying to achieve? <br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br><h2>  Count of things. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa6/7a6/44a/aa67a644aa68d079d0bacccc0e7c64b0.png" alt="Count of Things" align="right">  As expected, our project has a big mission, a dream.  We want to become a world graph of things, aggregating all the information that one has to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the Internet of things through access to our API.  This means that our core value is in high-quality content and links. <br><br>  Now, to maintain the quality of links and content, we use UI-tricks, promotion of high-quality content with the help of ratings and points, and moderator tools that can turn the fifth iPhone into green peas in the blink of an eye (as customs officers). <br><br>  But to create a high-quality graph this is not enough, and we face a large number of conceptual forks.  For example, the current system includes only one type of communication.  Ideally, the owner of a MacBook Pro 15 "should be associated with all owners of MacBook Pro, but at the same time his relationship with the owner of 15-inch models should be stronger than with 13-inch models. But improving the quality of information complicates the process of adding things , which is a critical "no-no" on the User-generated-content-site. <br><br>  And there are dozens and hundreds of such forks, but at the moment we are focused on improving the UX, because  Without a quality product that users like, no ‚Äúglobal‚Äù will happen. <br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br><br>  Think what you have, characterizing you.  What objects surround you, personal, intimate, everyday, dear to heart, rare, expensive? <br><br>  <a href="http://mine.is/">http://mine.is</a> - We warmly invite you to go and get a couple of things.  Because besides, of course, the most targeted audience, Habr are IT people who are not ashamed of sincere and undisguised criticism, will find shoals, share their thoughts with their colleagues in happiness.  What do you think? <br><br><br>  Yours truly <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/petergreen/" class="user_link">petergreen</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fuzz/" class="user_link">fuzz</a> and Lesha </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156637/</a></p>
