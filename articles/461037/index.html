      And we also have a mission.  Loud, colorful.  Even written on badges. <br><br>  And with all this, I am ‚Äúreal‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I don‚Äôt want to build my own business: I will turn from a good programmer into a mediocre businessman.  Yes, I‚Äôm not even tearing into managers.  I am in my place.  I solve problems that require at least my qualifications, and I have received it for decades.  ‚ÄúThese were difficult years, I do not regret them‚Äù (c). <br><br>  And representatives of "real" professions use the result of programs that I wrote, even if they do not realize it.  Builders, doctors, teachers, if they do not use them themselves, then at least use products that are made using products that are obtained using programs that exist thanks to my programs ... And this is my ‚Äúreal‚Äù contribution.  Even if it is not momentary, even if it is not visible immediately.  Even if I can‚Äôt come to my sister and say: ‚ÄúBut I helped to treat your husband.‚Äù <br><br>  We have a dining room, it has a ‚Äúreal‚Äù cook, can you imagine?  And he cooks me food with his own hands.  He spent 5 times less time learning his profession than I did learning his own.  I am able to somehow fulfill his tasks, he is mine - never.  But without him, I would have been meaninglessly spending several hours of my ‚Äúhighly qualified" time.  Therefore, I consider his contribution to my work significant.  We work at the same time!  In the cooperative theory of games, ooooooo much is devoted to how to evaluate his contribution to my work in money ... But I'm just a little grateful to him for making my life a little easier.  Thousands of millions of users of our products are grateful to me, even if they don‚Äôt know who to personally thank. <br><br>  At family gatherings, I have little to tell, especially from work: my problems are not understandable to many, and the jokes are professionally deformed.  But for some reason, everyone considers me smart anyway ... A riddle.  And relatives and friends want to spend time with me.  And when, at some point, I found myself wanting to see my father more than now ... I found the ChGK club in the regional center.  He assembled a team to which he called his father, three classmates and a colleague from work.  You will be surprised, but my father travels 40 km from the suburbs every week to play.  And it's not that we play well ... But we have a great time, and we also always have a common interest, which you can always talk about.  Although our professions do not even intersect. <br><br>  A mission at work is a fantastic thing.  I am so glad that we have it.  It is like a lighthouse in the sea: when it is not clear where to swim, sail on it.  Sometimes it seems to me that the mission is not for employees.  It is for the ‚Äúhigh" managers themselves, as a reminder of where they are striving.  We had a couple of disputes about constructive solutions, in which I trumped that my solution was consistent with the mission, and the alternative was not.  You will be surprised, but it worked ... <br><br>  And once I wanted to share my accumulated.  I went to a university, asked for the opportunity to teach ... And they gave it to me.  We recorded roofing felts at half-rates, roofing felts less, but the schedule for my classes was as convenient for me.  And I taught for more than five years, can you imagine?  From school special courses to advanced studies in the magistracy.  All weekend I prepared lectures / practices, spanked at the university early in the morning, and after classes for the main job.  Nothing stopped me: neither the main work, which took the car of time and effort, nor the financial component ... <br><br>  By the way, the penny that I received for teaching, as a rule, I spent back on students.  There was a task to write logic for a soccer game, which I piled on my knee in a couple of days ... I bought all sorts of chips and cola, and together with the students we watched the student logic tournament.  For an extremely complicated lab: ‚Äúanalysis of the tonality of utterances from Twitter in Arabic,‚Äù the student with the highest score got a reader.  The second is the player.  Why not?  And for the school special course, I ordered all sorts of different things from China and not only.  So that my students don‚Äôt hand over some arduino, but solder something of their own. <br><br>  Due to the move, I left the university very far, and now I am lecturing informally via Skype.  Because they periodically ask for something ‚Äúclearly explain‚Äù.  And because doing is better than dreaming. <br><br>  And here I am ‚Äúreal‚Äù.  I do useful things at work.  Out of work - useful.  I have something to talk about with friends and relatives.  Any rule or its absence at work I use to the fullest.  It‚Äôs not difficult for me to tie a tie if they ask me.  I look great in a suit, although I don‚Äôt like to wear it. <br><br>  And you - stay "fake."  Cry to the public, as fate has offended you by a highly paid, incomprehensible profession.  Dream of working at school.  Pity yourself more. <br><br>  And the world has changed slightly, along with the concept of "real."  There is no longer a subsistence economy: what he raised, he ate.  I can spend tens of years qualifying to do something complicated.  I know that ‚Äúreal‚Äù builders will build me a house, and ‚Äúreal‚Äù doctors will help me live long.  And ‚Äúreal‚Äù scientists, who have a chain to the final product and ‚Äúutility‚Äù even more than mine, will upgrade their qualifications.  And I will benefit the world in its place.  It seems that in the smart books that you read, this should be called the "division of labor"? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461037/</a></p>
