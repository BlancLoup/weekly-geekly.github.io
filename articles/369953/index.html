  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quantum entanglement and wormholes are probably one physical phenomenon.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Physics is full of incredible theories and ideas.  One of the most interesting is quantum entanglement and wormholes.  The first, predicted by quantum mechanics, describes the mysterious connection between remote elementary particles beyond the framework of standard interactions.  The second ones, predicted by the General Theory of Relativity (GTR), are ‚Äútunnels‚Äù connecting remote parts of space-time.  Recently, works have appeared (in particular, Juan Maldacen from Princeton and Leonard Susskind from Stanford University), proposing the equivalence of these two, at first glance, completely different phenomena. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ed/270/bcb/7ed270bcb28f4a43b4406bf196e4d228.png" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's remember what wormholes are.  They are of two types - passable (Maurice-Thorn), which require the presence of exotic matter with negative energy density (preventing wormhole collapse), and classical impassable (Einstein-Rosen bridges), predicted by the decision of the GTR in 1935. The wormhole is a hypothetical object nontrivial topology of space-time, which is easiest to present in the form of a ‚Äútunnel‚Äù connecting different areas of space.  The entrances to the "tunnel" are formed by spherical mouths, which can be connected by a curve (intraworm wormhole).  Such a wormhole collapses faster than through it could be passed. <br><br>  Decades later, a physicist at Princeton University, John Wheeler showed mathematically that the wormhole necks are well suited to describe what we mean by black holes.  The entrances to the wormhole are the external parts of the black holes, and their internal parts (areas beyond the event horizon) form the wormhole.

      Quantum entanglement is no less interesting.  In 1935, the work of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen was published, known as the EPR Paradox.  This paper deals with the phenomenon of quantum mechanics (Einstein himself called it rather a mental experiment), according to which by measuring the quantum state of one of the particles of common origin, we can accurately determine the quantum state of another particle without measuring it.  That is, we are talking about an unknown force acting instantly (that is, faster than the speed of light) on remote particles of general origin.  Later the phenomenon received the term "quantum entanglement", and the particles began to be called "entangled".  How does she work?  Imagine that you forgot one glove at home.  Until you reach the pocket, you do not know which glove you have, which home.  The probability that with you the right or left glove is 50% and we have a superposition of two possible options.  But as soon as you see that the right glove is with you, you instantly know that the left one is left at home.  The same thing happens with elementary particles.  The entangled (prepared in a special way) particles separated at any distance seem to retain some connection between them ‚Äî if we measure a quantum state (for example, spin) of one of the particles, we will know exactly the quantum state of the other particle.  Today, quantum entanglement is confirmed by numerous experiments and is even used, for example, in cryptography. <br><br>  But back to the possible connection between wormholes and quantum entanglement.  Earlier, we presented the wormhole as two black holes connected by an Einstein-Rosen bridge.  Black holes are also good because they are the only objects to which both GTR and quantum mechanics can be applied.  That is, we can take black holes for quantum objects.  Maldacena and Susskind proposed a non-trivial theoretical construction.  Let's take, they say, all Hawking radiation particles from the original black hole A and put them together, creating a black hole B. The black hole particles A and B are entangled among themselves and we can talk about two tangled black holes connected by a wormhole.  These black holes can be removed at any distance, but their quantum states will correlate with each other.  Having transferred this theoretical construction to the world of elementary particles, we have the right to say that quantum entanglement is not at all ‚Äúan eerie action at a distance‚Äù, but quite a physical phenomenon in the form of a real bridge in the space-time geometry connecting remote particles and not requiring speeding. light by some mysterious interaction carriers.  Today, this theory has already received its name - ‚ÄúER = EPR‚Äù (that is, the equality of the concepts of the Einstein-Rosen bridge describing the wormhole and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox describing quantum entanglement). <br><br>  And although ‚ÄúER = EPR‚Äù today lies exclusively in the field of theoretical physics, entire teams are working on finding methods for experimentally confirming the theory.  Further development of ‚ÄúER = EPR‚Äù can be a real breakthrough in reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity and will bring scientists closer to creating the theory of quantum gravity, the Grail of modern theoretical physics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369953/</a></p>
