Earlier this week, the car <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275706/">crashed into a cargo trailer</a> when the driver left the car on the side of the road in front of the trailer and turned on the automatic parking function.  Tesla showed the telemetry data and explained that the driver did not ensure the safety of the car during automatic maneuvers, did not observe the parking and was not ready to press the ‚ÄúStop‚Äù button, as it should be in terms of beta testing this experimental function. <br><br>  Now there was another accident.  A girl named Arianna Simpson (Arianna Simpson) <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/another-driver-says-teslas-autopilot-failed-to-brake-tesla-says-otherwise/">accuses the autopilot</a> that he hit the car in front of the speed.

      Again, Tesla Motors had to check the telemetry logs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On April 26, 2016, Mrs. Simpson was driving on I-5 highway north of Los Angeles, turning on autopilot mode in the Tesla Model S. ‚ÄúSuddenly, the car suddenly slowed down ahead,‚Äù <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/another-driver-says-teslas-autopilot-failed-to-brake-tesla-says-otherwise/">says the victim</a> .  ‚ÄúThere was a decent distance between us, so I decided that the autopilot would slow down, because he had to slow down immediately.‚Äù  When it became clear that the autopilot is not going to brake at <i>all</i> , I squeezed the brake.  But it was too late, I still ran into the car in front, while the speed was about 65 km / h. " <br><br>  Tesla Motors has studied the logs and found that the adaptive cruise control system is not guilty of what happened.  Logs show that Mrs. Simpson pressed the brake pedal and thereby deactivated the autopilot and cruise control, which maintains a safe distance in traffic, putting the car in manual mode.  When Mrs. Simpson used the brake pedal, she also turned off the emergency braking system, which was installed in all Tesla autopilot last year with firmware 6.2. <br><br>  Tesla Motors has published a statement: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSafety is a top priority for Tesla, we design and design cars primarily based on this.  We also ask our customers to train safely while using our machines.  Since the release of the autopilot, we have continuously explained to drivers how to use this function, and reminded them that they must remain attentive and always be ready to take control when using the autopilot. <br><br>  The autopilot is designed for practical use to give drivers more confidence at the wheel, improve road safety and make driving on the highway more enjoyable.  The Tesla autopilot is the most advanced of the existing systems, but it does not turn the car into an unmanned vehicle and does not relieve the driver of responsibility. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Arianna Simpson said she was overwhelmingly at Tesla and ‚Äúunmanned systems in general,‚Äù but expressed displeasure with the company's attitude.  She believes that Tesla lacks empathy for human drivers. <br><br>  Experts believe that in the near future we will hear about many such incidents.  Drivers still do not fully understand how they can rely on the autopilot, how to respond to the numerous warnings that tesla car shows, and when to take control.  Drivers do not want to admit their guilt and all the time they will say that the car was driving independently and it was she who was responsible for the accident. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372239/</a></p>
