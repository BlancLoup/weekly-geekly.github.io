  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 new Xiaomi for all occasions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  Recently, Xiaomi never ceases to please us with new products.  The company successfully <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/284644/">debuted at CES 2017</a> , after that it launched a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286226/">number of new devices</a> on the market - and this is in addition to what the Chinese giant already offers.  For many devices, users have found use in their homes, the blessing with Xiaomi's home accessories is all right - from rice cookers to air humidifiers.  In fact, the variety is such that you probably missed something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/743/290/877/7432908779c420a99af53fd5fa51e662.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here, for example, one of the coolest nishtyakov from Xiaomi - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_615275.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">smart portable IP-camera</a> , which is shooting in 1080p.  The company announced the device not so long ago - this is one of the representatives of its own line of Mijia, and not the fruit of joint creativity with YI Technology.  In fact, this is an intermediate model between the camera with the ability to rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees and the "cube" of Small Square. <br><br>  The new camera is equipped with optics with a viewing angle of 130 ¬∞.  Eight infrared LEDs (940 nm) with a backlight range of 10 meters provide high-quality shooting, even in low light conditions.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c7/fcc/620/0c7fcc6203f9cf084648109f44df2fad.jpg"><br><br>  The tilt angle is adjustable with a universal stand.  Of course, the camera is equipped with a motion sensor, but it is considered ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, for example, you can reduce the sensitivity in a certain area so that the sensor does not respond to pets or what is happening outside the window.  And if you have a Mi Band 2 fitness bracelet on your arm, the camera will automatically suspend shooting, recognizing the landlord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b11/7d5/4a5/b117d54a559377e562dad59344293b98.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about pets - the built-in speaker and microphone will help to communicate with your beloved dog - they provide two-way communication with the household through a proprietary application.  A nice bonus was the support for Wi-Fi in two bands (2.4 and 5 GHz).  You can save videos to both the SD card (up to 128 GB) and NAS storage. <br><br>  And how many times have you been in a situation where you seem to have settled comfortably in a bed, and have you forgotten to turn off the lights in the corridor?  No need to buy a set of "smart" light bulbs for 100-200 dollars, it is much easier to get one of the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/alarm-systems/pp_610096.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">switches Xiaomi</a> (do not forget the coupon QBKG03LM when ordering, valid until May 31).  You won't have to get up with them - they opened the familiar Mi Home application and turned off the light directly from their smartphone.  You can even customize scenarios in which, for example, the light will turn off automatically as you leave home, or vice versa.  For the system to work, it is imperative for the switches to have a device called <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344667.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">XIAOMI Mi Smart Wi-Fi Multifunction Gateway</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f94/70a/2a9/f9470a2a91ce21412f898a753b88a2a1.jpg"><br><br>  Devices operate on the ZigBee wireless protocol.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/alarm-systems/pp_610095.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">The simpler version</a> cannot work over the wire (it operates on a 2.4 GHz network), but it will be cool to adapt it as a doorbell that your favorite tunes can play.  Both switches are now available with excellent discounts, do not recommend to miss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09a/2d8/519/09a2d8519a58effe1a65792a8ac196db.jpg"><br><br>  But not all sit at home, right?  In case you want to get somewhere, Xiaomi released the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_621510.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">action camera Mijia 3.5K</a> .  The latter is equipped with two Sony IMX 206 16-megapixel matrixes and lenses with a viewing angle of 190 ¬∞, f / 2.0 aperture. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aee/a22/ea8/aeea22ea800051660d528106504dc92e.jpg"></div><br>  The camera is able to take panoramic pictures with a resolution of up to 23.88 megapixels, and also records video as 3.5K at a frequency of 30 frames per second.  Four shooting modes, including using only one sensor, allow you to choose the best one for a specific life situation.  And the electronic stabilization system provides a smooth picture. <br><br>  The device has a metal frame, it weighs 108 g. Since this is still an action camera, it was not without protection from dust and water according to the IP67 standard.  The built-in 1600 mAh battery provides continuous video recording for 90 minutes.  Supports microSD memory cards up to 128 GB.  Video bloggers note - tripod included! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09e/126/62f/09e12662f71468e15ba17326b1cf36c9.jpg"></div><br>  Pre-order for the new Xiaomi action camera is <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_621510.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">already open</a> (and here is the promo code for it: <b>GBCE</b> ).  By the way, with all the hot deals on Xiaomi cameras you can <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/top-brands/yi/91.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">see here</a> - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/top-brands/yi/91.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">there</a> are a lot of profitable options. <br><br>  Together with the camera Mijia 3.5K, Xiaomi also recently introduced the long-awaited <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_621635.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Mi Pad 3</a> tablet.  Despite the fact that the new model looks similar to the past generation of the device (Mi Pad 2), it is equipped with a six-core MediaTek processor and a battery with a capacity of 6,600 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed9/77f/f24/ed977ff243897e79bd5d8bec4ad3b329.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet is slightly heavier than its predecessor (328 g), but the display remains the same - a 7.9-inch screen (IPS-matrix) with a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536 pixels.  The processor, as we already said, is six-core: here MediaTek MT8176 is responsible for the ‚Äúcore‚Äù, which includes two Cortex-A72 cores with a frequency of 2.1 GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores with a frequency of 1.7 GHz.  Imagination Technologies PowerVR GX6250 is responsible for the graphics, and the system performance provides 4 GB of RAM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96f/c79/3a3/96fc793a31b1ea33b8395ca059b37a84.jpg"><br><br>  Fans of taking pictures and taking pictures on a tablet (although the idea is rather dubious) will be satisfied - the main camera of the Mi Pad 3 is 13 megapixel with f / 2.2 aperture and support for recording FullHD video, the front one is 5 megapixel.  As for battery life, here Xiaomi promises up to 12 hours in video playback mode or 867 hours in standby mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1d/610/9bc/e1d6109bc4a1fe522121a7eb9d6d4951.jpg"><br><br>  Pre-order the Mi Pad 3 is <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_621635.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">already open on Gearbest</a> !  A version with 64 GB of internal memory is available, Android 7.1 Nougat with MIUI 8 shell. <br><br>  Of course, this collection would be incomplete without a Xiaomi Mi R3P router.  In essence, this is a simplified (and inexpensive) version of Mi Router HD, which we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/284644/">wrote about</a> earlier.  Like the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, Mi Router Pro supports Wi-Fi 802.11ac data transfer at 2.4 GHz at 800 Mbps (at 5.0 GHz - 1733 Mbps), has one USB 3.0 port and three gigabit LAN ports .  And yes, there are already four antennas here - so that no corner of your home is left without the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/800/a24/2bb/800a242bb9c44af97881a98a31ebab0d.jpg"><br><br>  Of the features of the filling, it is worth noting that Mi Router Pro is based on the MT7621A MIPS dual-core chip, which operates at a frequency of 880 MHz and has 512 MB of RAM.  Alas, you will not place the drives in the device itself - most of the internal space is used for cooling, but the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/wireless-routers/pp_605932.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">price is appropriate</a> , which will be much lower with the <b>Xiaomir3p</b> promo code.  Yes, and nothing prevents the "pull up" to this router external drive USB 3.0 and use it as storage for backups, and control with the help of a proprietary application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/377/283/9a0/3772839a00a8eec66e8c46d1b8f4b530.jpg"><br><br>  As a bonus - a couple of words about another product, not peculiar to either Xiaomi or Geektimes.  Nevertheless, he is from Xiaomi :) Let's not keep the intrigue for a long time, this is ... a towel!  Natural cotton without impurities, antibacterial coating, also absorbs six times more moisture than a regular towel (Xiaomi handwriting can be seen immediately, isn't it?).  Also in two sizes: for a face (34x76 centimeters, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/towels/pp_614374.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">you can</a> pick <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/towels/pp_614374.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">it</a> up <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/towels/pp_614374.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">here</a> ) and bathhouses (140x70 centimeters, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/towels/pp_621904.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">follow this link</a> ).  The latter, by the way, can be <b>collected</b> at a discount with coupon <b>XMZSH</b> .  By the beginning of the beach season is the most! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a27/c2a/d43/a27c2ad436d74b73060718d10a71205f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e85/872/183/e858721838b238854731b7ccafb6af70.jpg"><br>  It seems that Xiaomi will soon reach all home accessories in order to ‚Äúbrand‚Äù whole houses with its devices and accessories.  Not to say that this is bad - the device is beloved by many Chinese company produces interesting and high-quality, from which you can assemble a full-fledged ecosystem.  And yes, without towels in it anywhere. <br><br>  Previous posts about Xiaomi in our blog: <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/285092/">These things from Xiaomi pump your home in full</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286756/">Check Connection: handheld radio from Xiaomi</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286552/">News from Xiaomi: two smartphones and ... a processor?</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/286226/">Xiaomi nishtyak: the new Redmi Note 4X and something else</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/284644/">New Xiaomi at CES 2017</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403031/</a></p>
