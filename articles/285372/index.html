  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a PHP programmer work in Sweden?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  I have to make a reservation - I have never worked as a programmer in Russia or any other Russian-speaking country.  Before that, he lived in Poland for 10 years and now, now, a year and a half in Sweden in Stockholm.  So, how does PHP-Developera work in a small Swedish company (25 people), in which the development team consists of a designer, a programmer (actually me) and another remote system administrator.  I especially emphasize that the firm is small and not geared towards the development of websites or programs. <br><br>  The company has 3 sites, each of which is devoted to a specific product.  One site has about 1000 unique users per day, the second - 300-400, the third - 100-200.  The team - the national vinaigrette, the official language in the office - English.  In Swedish, by the way, I do not speak at all.  Products that we sell are also international, customers are scattered around the world;  Sites, of course, in English. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Working time </h5><br>  There is no strict regulation.  On average, you need to be in the office 8 working hours per day.  You can come at 7 am, you can at 10;  add 8 hours to work, an hour for lunch, it turns out the time when you can theoretically go home.  I write "theoretically", because  if you need to go 2 hours earlier - no problem.

      Vacation - 30 working days.  You can take at any time and break it into any number of parts.  I once thought that if you decompose it for the whole year, you will get almost 2 calendar months of vacation per year.  We have a google spreadsheet, which all employees have access to, there you allocate days for your vacation at any time - and that‚Äôs all, during this time you have a vacation. <br><br>  One interesting swedish detail.  In principle, you can call any day and say that you will not come to work today.  Do not need any certificates from the doctor and so on.  (according to law).  If you really got sick, then up to a week, a doctor‚Äôs certificate is again not needed.  For example, a slight cold for 4 days.  Just lying at home in bed and that's it.  The hospital does not pay only the first day, for each of the following you get 80% of earnings. <br><br><h5>  Working environment </h5><br>  Office in the coworking center.  There are about 10-15 companies in it.  Shared kitchen, 2 konferets hall, dishwasher, coffee machine, microwave, refrigerator, dishes, furniture.  Another Swedish item is that there is a fridge with Coke in the kitchen, there is a piece of paper on it: ‚ÄúEach can of Coke costs 10 kroner‚Äù, on top is an ordinary deep bowl for coins.  And surprisingly, everyone who takes drinks pays.  For reference, 10 kroons = approximately 1 euro. <br><br>  A lot of people, coming to work, change shoes for slippers or just walk barefoot.  By the way, I prefer barefoot. <br><br>  There are no free lunches, but once a month something like a small office is organized at the expense of the company: beer, chips, stronger alcohol.  I heard from friends that they have free fruit, but this is definitely not in every company. <br><br><h5>  Direct duties </h5><br>  The main thing is that everything works.  Since I am the only computer programmer, I have to solve all the problems with any electronic device: computers, printers, telephones, the network, etc., of course. This, of course, is a little frustrating, since professional development significantly slows down. <br><br>  Swedes love all kinds of meetings.  I have to attend at least 2-3 meetings every week.  It does not matter, I need it there or not.  If the topic even remotely affects my part, it should be there.  By the way, the decision-making process is unusually slow.  Everyone can speak, all need to carefully listen, discuss, suck, turn this way and that.  Then think a week or two, then get together again and all in a new circle.  But, if the decision has already been made, it will be made iron. <br><br>  So, the duties.  Suppose you need to make a new category on the site.  They ask me how long it takes.  I estimate approximately, I answer.  When the decision is made - give the green light to develop.  At the end I have to make a presentation for the whole team, explaining how and what works.  I listen to the wishes, amendments, then I deal with them. <br><br><h5>  Finance </h5><br>  On average, in Stockholm, PHP-Developer earns 1,500-2,700 euros.  Really cool comrades (with experience of more than 7 years, with large projects behind them, knowing a bunch of frameworks, JavaScript, Linux, etc.) earn more than 3000. To assess the level, I would say that rent a 2-room apartment in Stockholm + buy food for costs about 1000 euros per month. <br><br>  Good luck and good money to all! <br>  <i>I have not written in Russian for a long time, so errors are possible.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285372/</a></p>
