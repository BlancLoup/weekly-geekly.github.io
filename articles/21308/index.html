  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The alphabet ... reflections on the topic ... Complete on the personal.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  1. Alphabet.  Associative links. <br><br>  So much has been said about the alphabet that for a start I will quote Karl B√ºhler's Theory of Language <br>  ‚ÄúThe alphabet is an associative chain (mechanical sequence), and nothing more;  but everyone has learned and knows it.  Therefore, mapping sequences of any objects on the alphabet is a convenient correlation.  We constantly use it in practice to organize.  It would not be difficult to prove that in the system of signs that make up a natural language, there are many associative chains and interweaving, which from a psychological point of view are at the same level with the alphabetic chain, and which provide us with the same service in the comprehensive task of streamlining our knowledge about objects and the communication of this knowledge to others. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, each element of the alphabet can and should be assigned a value (which is actually done now) and close this question.  However, not all so simple.  It is logical to assume that the set of associations is an alphabet. If i is not equal to j and ai and aj: A, then AI is intersected by AJ = empty. <br>  The mapping T of the set of characters S (objects of the class Symbol) to the alphabet in the language l: L (where L is the set of languages) is denoted by Tl.  They (signs) are a kind of source of associations (through the relation Tl).  The set of associations generated by the mapping of the signs of Tl will be denoted by Al (the alphabet itself of the language l).  The set Al is finite, it can be numbered, which will be the association or alphabet code, but it will be categorically incorrect to call it the sign code.  The association generated by the sign s in the language l is denoted by Tl (s).  It is clear that Tl (s): Al.  Multiple characters can generate the same association.  For example, a large letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù and a small ‚Äúa‚Äù give rise to the same association.  So there may be s1: S, and s2: S such that Tl (s1) intersected with Tl (s2) is not empty.  This is one moment.  And the second point is that this association depends on the environment or for each language its own set of associations.  Those.  in English, French and Russian environments, the same sign can cause different associations.  Usually, to implement the Tl mapping, it is enough to build the table of associations (it is also the Tl relation), but more complex algorithms can be used, such as, for example, in musical notation, cartography, or in the construction of electrical circuits. <br>  . <br>  2. Grouping characters. <br><br>  However, not all categories of characters have the need to build their own table of associations.  There are signs that cause associations common to all languages.  True, even stronger is the statement: Different associations in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãcause only objects that we usually call letters.  To emphasize this property we will unite them in the Letter group.  And since the division into groups has already happened, we divide the set of characters into several more groups. <br>  The group number (Digital group) in which signs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 are included causing obvious and identical associations in all modern languages. <br>  Control character group (Command group) in which all control and format characters are included.  In modern standards, associations of this group are used, but signs are not provided that are mapped directly into control associations.  For some strange logic, the display of T characters of this group is absent, and for a graphical representation, characters using an empty association are used and only in the reverse display is an empty association a character imitating the corresponding control association.  Those.  the sign that is mapped directly to the ‚Äúline feed‚Äù association (code 10 in the KOI8 standard) is missing, and the sign depicting the line feed is displayed by the ‚Äúsign association‚Äù code 182 in the KOI8 standard. <br>  The Mark group includes brackets, quotes, commas, and more.  The principal difference between this group of characters is that they do not participate in lexical analysis, but are independent lexemes.  Those.  they do not form a lexeme by participating in some sequence of characters, but participate by their own presence ‚Äî by the absence of directly in the syntactic analysis. <br>  The letter character group has another feature, which is the main purpose of the characters in this group; the sequence of these characters forms its own association, which we call the lexeme.  Lexemes are separated from each other by signs of other groups, one of which is a space. <br>  After the division of characters into groups, one can accordingly divide them into corresponding groups of their association.  Note that for any i and j: L, if s: Letter, then Ti (s) = Tj (s) = As.  This fact allows for the signs of these groups to create a single table of associations for all languages.  And besides this, for all groups except Letter, the register property (big, small) does not make sense.

      3. Data entry. <br><br>  All the above listed groups are united by one controversial quality; all of them can be entered from the keyboard.  In order to invent the keyboard, as well as standards for character encodings and keyboard layouts.  We emphasize here that it is characters that are entered from the keyboard, not associations.  And attempts to adjust the keyboard codes and association codes to conformity encounter stubborn resistance of the real state of affairs.  But to provide for the introduction of all the signs necessary in practice, of course, is not possible.  Therefore, we simply must expand the capabilities of the keyboard.  The purpose of the keyboard is to directly match the key being pressed to a character, but to do so would always mean increasing the size of the keyboard to not reasonable.  Therefore, the method of combining keys is used (simultaneous pressing of several keys) is convenient for the control group of characters.  And then the question arises, is it not time to expand the standard of signs for functions that have already become standard (copy, delete, etc.) and add new signs for editing (new section, note, etc.)?  I think quite real.  And for this to come up with a graphic image for each of them (which is often already invented).  The combination of characters is possible even with special sequences.  The so-called compositional signs.  This technique is widely used for emoticons (a sequence of colons and parentheses) or the ¬Æ sign and so on.  Application for entering characters of composite characters provides ample opportunities for custom characters and emoticons. <br>  I consider it a good idea to change the correspondence of signs and keys of the keyboard depending on the environment.  Lebedev's keyboard capable of changing the image of characters on the keys is in good agreement with our principles. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21308/</a></p>
