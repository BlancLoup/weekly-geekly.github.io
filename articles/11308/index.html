  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did RUpay start?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, new business partners asked me how the RUpay business started.  I did not participate in the foundation of the company, but, of course, there is a corporate history about this: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt all started a long time ago (5 years ago), when electronic payment systems were just emerging.  They knew about these systems in Russia, but people in the regions did not have real access to depositing money into these systems.  Therefore, only residents of megacities became users of EPS.  And we got the idea to make the system accessible to all.  We were then young and full of hope.  Energy was more than enough.  So we rushed into battle with great optimism and endless enthusiasm, which was rewarded in full.  :) <br><br>  Who created the company?  A group of Russian economists and marketers united by a common idea: to create a new generation business.

      Interestingly, there were no bureaucratic obstacles, as happens when opening a business in other industries.  There were the usual difficulties associated with opening a business.  There was no one to consult about the business that is so new for Russia.  Everything was done by trial and error.  Something worked out.  Something not.  There was in all this drive, interest in the new.  And the most difficult thing was to find IT specialists for the company.  That was the real problem.  But we coped with it successfully.  By the way, even after five years, the hunger for personnel in the EPS branch remained :-) <br>  There were difficult moments, but we never despair.  And I do not advise anyone to despair.  Look at E-gold: they are going through hard times now, but they don‚Äôt even serve the species.  Keep well done.  As in any business, rumors have a big role in the success of EPS, unconfirmed information, and it is very important to treat it as unverified information and nothing else! <br><br>  We were lucky.  When opening a business, many supported our initiative: friends, family.  Now in business it is not so often the case.  Usually, they are first considered the black sheep, and recognition comes much later. ‚Äù <br><br>  What kind of corporate legends do you have? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11308/</a></p>
