The interviewer speaks about the prospects for further development, taking into account the characteristics of your personal professional experience. </h4><br>  If the interviewer tells you about what tasks the company faces and how they can solve them with your help, then this is very valuable.

    <h4>  2. The interviewer asks if you are interested in working for the company. </h4><br>  If your opponent really cares about your interest, if, during an interview, he occasionally stops and asks you about what you think on a specific question, this is clearly a positive sign. <br><br><h4>  3. The interviewer asks about your job opportunities. </h4><br>  If the interviewer asks if you have already been interviewed at any other company or have already made some suggestions to you, this indicates his desire to find out what his chances are to get you as an employee. <br><br><h4>  4. The interviewer engages you in conversations on free topics. </h4><br>  If during an interview you are asked questions about your experience, it most likely means that they want to talk to you at a less formal level. <br><br><h4>  5. The interviewer refers to you by name. </h4><br>  This usually eludes attention, but nevertheless, such a message suggests that they see you as a potential colleague. <br><br><h4>  6. The interviewer introduces you to other decision makers. </h4><br>  Be sure that everything goes just fine if the interviewer begins to introduce you to people who should not be present at the interview. <br><br><h4>  7. The interviewer is interested in your recommendations. </h4><br>  Usually, it does not reach the recommendations until you are specifically interested, and accordingly, you can regard this as a positive sign. <br><br><h4>  8. The interview lasts longer than expected. </h4><br>  Usually, all interviews with applicants for the position of an employee of the company are embedded in the work schedule between other scheduled meetings.  So if the interview lasts longer, it clearly speaks in your favor. <br><br><h4>  9. The interviewer gives you a clear time frame. </h4><br>  While some companies define a strict period of time for which they need to find a new employee, others focus on finding the right person, even if the search continues for a long time.  If the Interviewer, when finishing the interview, tells you exactly when you should be called back, you can be sure that this is a good sign. <br><br>  Read about the questions that are meant to bring you down during the interview <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/3-voprosa-kotorye-mogut-sbit-vas-vo-vremya-sobesedovaniya/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290884/</a></p>
