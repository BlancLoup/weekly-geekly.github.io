Perhaps someone it will be useful. <br><br><h4>  Small introduction </h4><br>  About 6-7 years ago, when there were over one million people in our city, it was possible to go on the Internet only by dial-up, the author just purchased a modem for this purpose, and the Internet cost ‚Äúunreal money‚Äù, at least for a student-student. <br><br>  Once, in a conversation with an online comrade after complaining about the lack of money in the account, I received three lines in private ‚Äî a phone number, a password, and a login.  Comrade commented on this gesture with the phrase - ‚Äúthis is a free-of-charge Internet, keep it, don‚Äôt give it to anyone‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, I was not in a hurry to transfer it to anyone, and I did not hurry to use it either.  But in the end, I still took advantage of the ‚Äúgift of fate‚Äù several times.  For example, when I bought cards for downloading something voluminous, megabytes of 50, or even all 100, and the time on the cards ended at the wrong time.  Or just check your mail.  Common sense told me - "You should not use this account."  But for some reason I did not listen to him, the only thing in which we agreed with him was that when using it you should not be too impudent. <br>  A couple of months passed, and accounting stopped working.  And then I forgot about her safely the first time.

    <h4>  Secret becomes clear </h4><br>  After half a year, the call was broken by the silence in the apartment, the caller introduced himself - ... <br>  He did not comment his call, and only asked - "Do you know why I am calling?".  To which I for some reason replied - ‚Äúyes I know,‚Äù although this was not true, I didn‚Äôt imagine what my person was interested in ‚Äúorgans‚Äù.  After a brief telephone conversation, I was scheduled to meet at the office. <br><br>  In the department, I learned that the ‚Äúgift of fate‚Äù belonged to a large oil refinery.  And that I "specifically hit."  And now, firstly, I will have to compensate for the damage, as much as 280 rubles (I wrote that I practically did not use this account), and secondly, write an explanatory and sincere repentance that I am such a bad person, KNEW whose account is, I KNEW that with my actions I cause damage, but I repent and ask me to amnesty (at that time there was an amnesty for minors).  On the second point, of course, I was indignant, because I did not know whose account was, and I would not write such an explanation in my explanatory statement.  To which he received the answer - ‚Äúlook yourself, no matter how worse it is.‚Äù <br><br>  As a result, my explanatory letter looked like this: ‚ÄúI received the account from such someone, who did not know which way I was taken control of, but I repent of my deed.‚Äù  And of course I did not give consent to the amnesty, refused to sign the paper.  After that, I compensated for the damage caused to the plant.  By the way, when I made money in the cash register of the plant, I found out that there are several dozen people like me, and that my 300 rubles is zilch.  The first line of the list was occupied by a person who ‚Äúperched‚Äù on a modem for 30 thousand rubles.  After that, I took a photocopy of the payment receipt to our ‚Äúinternal organs‚Äù, filed a piece of paper in a thick folder and let me go to all 4 sides.  And after that, I forgot about this whole story a second time, now for 6 years now.  For which I managed to work in many IT and around IT companies, in various frivolous positions, combining this with study. <br><br><h4>  Effects </h4><br>  And here is the most interesting part of the story.  In the summer of 2011, when the dissertation was almost ready, I began to look for a permanent job (help desk, system administrator or service engineer) in advance.  At first everything went quite well, I often went for interviews, sometimes the companies themselves invited me.  But in the second month of such wanderings, I was worried that even though I go through all the stages of interviews, the last final stage (communication with the gene director, paperwork) is constantly disrupted.  The situation cleared up only after I went to get a job on the recommendation of a friend, and again I had an interview, quite successfully.  But after a couple of hours, this very comrade called me and asked, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I warn him that I appear in the database as an amnestied person?‚Äù  Comrade was very surprised by this fact, but I myself was just shocked.  How can this be?  Was it really condemned and amnestied without my knowledge, is that a joke ?! <br><br>  A week after collecting my thoughts, I decided to write a letter addressed to the Minister of the Interior, yes, yes, you heard right, and complain that my constitutional rights have been violated.  A copy of this letter was sent to the prosecutor's office, which they (for some reason) sent again to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <br><br>  Soon, I received an answer.  The following content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4b/b8b/5e6/f4bb8b5e679a4e41e02bb24de1573496.jpg"><br>  <i>A copy of the response from the Ministry of Interior (I apologize for the quality)</i> <br><br>  That is, there was no court, and there is a record in the database about me for the simple reason that, on the basis of the amnesty, it was denied to initiate criminal proceedings.  Although I did not give a written consent to this.  And the articles themselves imply something different than accessing the Internet under someone else‚Äôs account.  And finally, they didn't even bother to notify me about all this! <br><br>  By the way, with this answer, I also went to an interview a couple of times, but the presence of this paper had a rather negative effect. <br><br>  Thinking again, it was decided to try to appeal this decision to the district prosecutor's office of the city.  No sooner said than done, a complaint was made, a copy of the response from the Ministry of Internal Affairs was attached to it.  After that, the reception of the prosecutor, his words that he agrees that the acts were incorrectly classified, that most likely at my expense someone drew the sticks in the plan. <br><br>  After an anxious wait, I finally got an answer (the case file has not yet been destroyed, although the storage period is 6 years), the decision is annulled, and an audit is scheduled based on the results.  Information from the database will be deleted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a37/9fb/b12/a379fbb124a2785e4aadd834d6f3961d.jpg"><br>  <i>A copy of the answer from the Prosecutor's Office page number 1 (I apologize for the quality)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2e/87c/ba8/f2e87cba8b07eed5e72e49f754c1becc.jpg"><br>  <i>A copy of the response from the Prosecutor's Office page number 2 (I apologize for the quality)</i> <br><br>  After that, the policemen came to me a couple of times, offered their apologies and offered to sign the papers, which now means ‚ÄúTo refuse to initiate a case, for lack of corpus delicti.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  I don‚Äôt think that they came home to me because something was changed with the renaming to the police, most likely they were given a trite cap.  And the stick system is still alive ... <i>(This is my personal opinion, based on my own experience</i> ). <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> <br>  Be careful friends, free cheese - only in a mousetrap.  Well, if the organs on you are still excited, keep the matter under control, do not relax and be interested in the course of the matter - keep your finger on the pulse.  And if it seems to you that your rights are being violated, do not be afraid to appeal the decision.  And here I would like to forget about the whole story for the last time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284708/</a></p>
