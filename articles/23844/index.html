  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The evolution of blogging. part II</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ad28/39887.html">previous post,</a> I told you about those bloggers who strive for optimization and use microblogs and tlogs for this.  But is it possible with the offer of 120 characters to convey all the colors of your summer trip, or evening Moscow?  Would you appreciate the talent of the singer if you just read his song?  If <br>  the dancer, in brief detail, would describe to you what he gets up on stage.  I think the answer to this question is NO and no again.  As you may have guessed, it will be about photo audio and video blogging. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Photoblogging</strong> <br>  For the most part, a photoblog is the same regular blog, but the main content in it is a photo.  There are also posts with a title and perhaps a brief description, comments - so that readers can appreciate the quality of the work of the author.  Sometimes photoblogger <br>  allows you to rate photos.  As usual here is an archive. <br>  All this is easy to implement on the Wordpress engine or another blog engine, without resorting to additional plugins, but especially for the most captious there are ready-made solutions: <br><br><img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ddf3pb2d_45fwd5hxsd_b.jpg" alt="undefined"><br>  <a href="http://www.pixelpost.org/">Pixelpost</a> - PHP engine sharpened specifically for photoblogging.  Simple and easy (612 KB) Pixelpost is suitable even for a spoiled photoblogger, because you can find localization in 11 languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the site (including <br>  <a href="http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/languages/russian-translation-to-pixelpost-v17/">Russian</a> ), <a href="http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/templates/">65 templates</a> for your photoblog as well as 119 various <a href="http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/addons">add</a> - <a href="http://www.pixelpost.org/extend/addons">ons</a> - all this will help you to turn a regular gallery on the site into a professional photoblog with comments, ratings and stylish design. <br>  There is one more <a href="http://www.photostand.org/">photostand</a> engine, but I didn‚Äôt find any additions or topics for it on the official website, as well as a working forum.  A search in Google issued only exploits and bugs of this engine, which already causes suspicion ... <br>  If, however, you do not have enough money for your domain and hosting is also not a problem, there are a huge number of sites that are just a paradise for the photoblogger - <a href="http://flamber.ru/">flamber</a> , <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> , <a href="http://zooomr.com/">zooomr</a> , <a href="http://fotodia.ru/">fotodia</a> , <a href="http://www.smugmug.com/">smugmug</a> .  All of these services, in addition to free hosting of photos (see restrictions on sites), will give a strong community ready at any moment to evaluate your work and point out shortcomings. <br>  It is also worth paying attention to the <a href="http://www.mopoto.com/">mopoto</a> site designed specifically for mobile photoblogging. <br>  Also, having decided to start a photoblog, I recommend to look at <a href="http://www.photoblogs.org/">photoblogs</a> - this is one of the largest catalogs of photobloggers in the world, and of course, its Russian equivalent <a href="http://www.photoblogs.ru/">photoblogs.ru</a> . <br>  In general, any little malomalski amateur photography on the Internet is where to turn it would be a desire.

    <img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ddf3pb2d_46d39fs9f5_b1.jpg" alt="undefined"><br>  <strong>Audioblogging</strong> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">A podcast</a> is a blog where the post is based on an audio file, most often in mp3 format.  In this file, the author of the podcast tells about events that happened in his life or deserve his attention.  As a rule, in each post of such audioblog, there is a flash player, so that anyone could listen to the file directly from the page, as well as a link to the file, for those who want to listen later. <br>  Podkasters, in contrast to the photoblogger, except for a podcast site, just need to have a special program for recording podcasts, because listening to a Bubnezh tape recorder when your dog barks or a child cries in the background ( <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D129">Hello to colleagues</a> ) or something else , sometimes terribly do not want.  This will help you <br>  <a href="http://www.wildvoice.com/Pages/WildVoice_Studio.aspx">WildVoice Podcast Studio</a> (Registration required).  In addition to the usual functions - cleaning noises, adding background music, changing the volume, <a href="http://www.wildvoice.com/Pages/WildVoice_Studio.aspx">WildVoice Podcast Studio will</a> also <a href="http://www.wildvoice.com/Pages/WildVoice_Studio.aspx">upload</a> your podcasts to your server or save to mp3, this is if you do not want to use the built-in podcast terminal in the program. <br>  Speaking of terminals, these are the sites on which podcasts are laid out.  But of course, you can again use your hosting and wordpress with the addition of &lt;a HREF= that <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress/">wordpress.org/extend/plugins/podpress</a> \ podpress, but at the initial stages I recommend trying them ... <br>  &lt;a <a href="http://rpod.ru/">href</a> =ri rpod.ru <a href="http://rpod.ru/">\</a> rnf Rpod (also referred to as russianpodcasting) is the largest Russian podcasters portal, except <br>  Friendly community, ready to help at any moment, the site has a user-friendly interface and fast speed.  Also pay attention to &lt;a HREF= up <a href="http://www.playcast.ru/">www.playcast.ru</a> \ play&gt; playcast and to &lt;a HREF= that <a href="http://podfm.ru/">podfm.ru</a> \\\ podfm (Before you go read &lt;a HREF = " <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D19">ad28.ru/?p= 19</a> \ "&gt; opinion of our editor on their account). <br>  Most likely you will want to listen to other podcasts (however, you are not going to listen to them all the time through the browser) in this matter. <br>  the program will help you &lt;a HREF= po <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">www.apple.com/itunes/download</a> \ iTunes&gt;.  She herself will download new podcasts to your computer, and, if desired, to the player. <br>  As an alternative to &lt;a HREF= <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">www.apple.com/itunes/download</a> \ iTunes, I recommend &lt;a <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php">HREF</a> = it <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php">juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php</a> \\\ Juice, it weighs less and all the program‚Äôs activity is aimed only at one thing on <br>  podcasts. <br>  Podcasting in Russia is developing at a moderate pace, although all you need is a microphone, a recording program and a little time - perhaps in a week your speakers and speakers will sound not only in Russia, but throughout the world.  The main thing - do not be afraid to start and worry about possible shortcomings in sound quality.  Try recording the first issue.  By the second you will already have a little understanding of the process and will be able to improve the quality of the issue.  Good luck! <br><br><img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/ddf3pb2d_47gdhjgjhg_b.jpg" alt="undefined"><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog">Vlogging</a> <br>  Information in this blog is provided in the form of a video clip, which the author recorded using video or web camera, as well as from a mobile phone.  This method has become widespread, with increasing speed of access to the Internet and the quality of this access. <br>  In Russia, to be honest, video blogging is only gaining momentum; for this, detailed instructions, guidelines for action, find <br>  almost impossible, although they are not very necessary.  As I said earlier, you only need a video camera, and a place to put it.  And places in the Internet in bulk!  The same <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">youtube</a> and its Russian analogue <a href="http://rutube.ru/">rutube are suitable for blogging</a> .  Of the alternatives, I recommend paying attention to the RBCs <a href="http://smotri.com/">smotri</a> , by the way such large portals as <a href="http://video.mail.ru/">mail.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/">liveinternet</a> <br>  also provide video hosting.  The main problem for video blogs on these services is video compression. <br>  Often, a site squeezes video so much that it is simply impossible to watch it.  In such situations, you can <a href="http://video.google.com/">try video.google</a> .  It compresses less rigidly than others, and also do not forget about <a href="http://rpod.ru/">rpod</a> , because besides podcasts you can also <a href="http://rpod.ru/">upload video casts</a> there. <br>  The trend in the development of network video content, pushes to the thought of the imminent boom of video blogging.  Pay attention to <a href="http://woho.tv/">woho.tv</a> , <a href="http://www.rouxbe.com/">rouxbe</a> will suit for lovers of tasty cooking and eating <br>  <a href="http://foodtube.net/">foodtube</a> , <a href="http://www.imcooked.com/">imcooked</a> , and even lovers of play will not stay aside, for them there is your YouTube - <a href="http://www.wegame.com/">wegame</a> .  Teachers will choose <a href="http://www.teachertube.com/">teachertube</a> .  If you wish, you can always create something like this.  Nobody forbids you to put wordpress and upload a video of the quality that you need, the benefit of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php%3Fq%3Dvideo">plug-ins</a> to him abound. <br>  As you can see from this article, blogging is developing fast! <br>  Someone chooses <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ad28/39887.html">optimization of time-consuming</a> , and someone chooses the variety and quality of content.  In what format to submit information to your readers, only your own business.  Maybe you start Vlog or Photoblog or you like podcasts.  Perhaps you decide to use everything at once, including microblogging and a blog - the most important thing is that you have enough time and effort for it ... <br><br>  Author <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ice_dog_as/" class="user_link">ice_dog_as</a> ice_dog_as <br>  via <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fcat%3D11">AD28.ru</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23844/</a></p>
