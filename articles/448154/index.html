<br><br>  - the height of the Bereshit apparatus is about 1.5 meters, the diameter is 2 meters (2.3 meters between the landing supports); <br><br>  - weight 530 kilograms with fuel (fuel weight - 380 kg), 150 kg without fuel; <br><br>  - main engine: modification LEROS 2b; <br><br>  - the main element of the on-board computer: Gaisler HiRel GR712RC dual-core processor; <br><br>  - six 8-megapixel cameras Imperx Bobcat B3320C with Ruda optics; <br><br>  - scientific instruments: magnetometer, an array of corner laser reflectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a4/6e4/761/0a46e4761e7b91013d68017d539cda7c.jpg"><br><br>  The Bereshit device was developed by SpaceIL organizations, which is mainly supported by private investors, including American magnate Sheldon Adelson and billionaire Morris Kahn, who are also co-determinants of Amdocs (DOX), one of the largest companies in Israel. <br><br>  By force and by means of only one small private company, it is impossible to send the lunar apparatus into space, but with the help of the international space community it is possible to turn an idea into a fully-fledged project that is currently being implemented. <br><br>  <u>Project participants involved in the mission "Bereshit":</u> <br><br>  - a team of young Israeli scientists and engineers from the company SpaceIL, <br><br>  - NASA (USA) <br><br>  - ISA (Israeli Space Agency), <br><br>  - IAI (Israel Aviation Industry Concern), <br><br>  - company Spaceflight Industries (USA, organizer of the launch of the Bereshit apparatus into orbit), <br><br>  - SpaceX company (USA, Falcon 9 booster rocket), <br><br>  - Swedish Space Corporation (Swedish Space Corporation), <br><br>  - Cobham company (Sweden), <br><br>  - Company Ramon Chips (Israel). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/xv/hn/cpxvhnmhptq6k22n3d-u2q9gb00.jpeg"><br><br>  After all, SpaceIL is a small organization by world standards, its staff includes about 200 people, and most of them are volunteers, scientists and engineers who ‚Äústrive to promote the development of technological and scientific progress in Israel.‚Äù <br></div></div><br>  <b>What happened when the Bereshit device landed on April 11, 2019?</b> <br><br>  In fact, problems with the Bereshit device began almost immediately after the start. <br><br>  February 2019: <br><br>  <i>Sunlight by the sunbeams of the position sensors of the apparatus (the sensors rendered them very sensitive to such ‚Äúblinding‚Äù) may affect the orientation of the apparatus in space.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Solution: software compensation was performed to process the data from the sensors and reduce their sensitivity; additional repeated checks of new data from the sensors of the device were made.</i> <br><br>  <i>At the preparatory stage, before performing the second engine maneuver, the onboard computer of the Bereshit device unexpectedly rebooted, and the stage of the maneuver was automatically canceled.</i>  <i>SpaceIL and IAI engineers began to analyze the situation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On board, there was a problem that limited the maneuverability of the device.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Solution: SpaceIL and IAI engineers eliminated the failure in the computer system of the Bereshit apparatus, now the Bereshit apparatus continues its flight to the Moon in the normal mode.</i> <br><br>  <u>Further, SpaceIL did not announce any new problems or problems with the Bereshit device</u> , however, before the lunar maneuvers, there was a slide in the report where there were more than one reboot / failure in the work of the BC - several and even more than engineers expected , and because of the tough space environment. <br><br>  Problems and solutions that were in space (it turns out, there were many reloads of BC): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u_/p4/gx/u_p4gx71awtxyg9qsfagxovrggs.png"><br><br>  Thus, it could be expected that after 1128 hours of flight (47 days), problems with the internal components of the Bereshit device can become fatal, and their correction is impossible in case of failure of elements or their abnormal work under serious load and influence of the space environment. <br><br>  Landing the device on the moon is a complex process in which the on-board computer performs a large amount of tasks: managing engine operating modes, analyzing telemetry and sensor data (position, altitude, speed, landing, etc.), adjusting the current position of the device, according to the landing path and actual coordinates, adaptive fuel consumption, data transfer using a communication system. <br><br>  And if an abnormal situation occurs with one or several sensors during landing, then this moment can be compensated for automatically, if there is a backup scheme, or by restarting (reloading) the on-board computer system, if there is time for this process. <br><br>  In the manual mode and in real time, the engineers at the MCC did not control the Bereshit apparatus; the on-board computer conducted the landing after the apparatus left the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù, when it only remained to perform the landing procedure, the commands of which were received earlier by the on-board computer. <br><br>  But to take into account the situation and compensate for problems when several elements fail in a cascade, and then due to their failures, shutdowns of the main components of the device (engines, telemetry system, on-board computer) will begin - it is difficult for a device of this level (without redundancy of control systems ), as shown, is impossible. <br><br>  <b>What else is known about the hardware and software components of the device "Bereshit"</b> <br><br>  - one (1) engine 430N and eight (8) shunting engines 25N.  Shunting engines used in landing to help the main; <br><br>  - the temperature of the electronics is maintained in the range of -10 ¬∞ C to + 40 ¬∞ C.  Most of the electricity is spent on heating the electronics (no cooling system); <br><br>  - on-board computer one (1), not duplicated; <br><br>  - the star sensor for orientation of the Bereshit apparatus is equipped with a black cone for absorbing third-party beams, however, when separating the Bereshit apparatus from satellites after launch, it turned out that the cone had become contaminated, the engineers coped with this problem, found out what angles of reflection did not occur and made adjustments to the software algorithm for processing data from the sensor (using software patches); <br><br>  - there were several reboots of the computer during the flight to the moon; <br><br>  - program control code, commands and work with the on-board computer - in C; <br><br>  - due to the fact that the computer is only one, when you restart, all updates (patches) are erased and they need to be additionally downloaded again into the system; <br><br>  - data transfer rate is low: one high resolution photo (from 8 Mpx camera) loads 40 minutes; <br><br>  - DLR (German Aerospace Center) conducted testing of the landing mechanism of the Bereshit vehicle. <br><br>  <i>Team SpaceIL: Most of them are aeronautics engineers and physicists.</i>  <i>But the IDF's satellite operations unit.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Hardware systems "Bereshit", the failure of which could lead to abnormal execution of the steps of the landing procedure and the fall:</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <u>Engine apparatus "Bereshit."</u> <br><br>  The engine of the Bereshit device is a special adapted (for the Bereshit mission, its refinement was made by shortening the nozzle and increasing thrust) a chemical rocket unit of the LEROS family (for use on satellite platforms) - a modification of LEROS 2b on hydrazine (monomethylhydrazine) with a thrust 45 kgf (441H), which is slightly more than its standard characteristics of 41.5 kgf (407H). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q_/tf/vl/q_tfvlxldtkaulz32cmntklvgiy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/se/lf/bvselfjvpuy9js6n3g-d0couwf0.jpeg"><br><br>  There is an assumption that this engine was not designed for multiple inclusions and it is not throttled, although during the mission ‚ÄúBereshit‚Äù there were multiple inclusions of the main engine for several minutes, and during landing ten minutes. <br><br>  The total thrust of shunting engines 8 * 25H = 200H (half of the main).  That is, when the main engine is disconnected, there will be a threefold drop in thrust, which was observed during landing. <br><br>  Also recorded off the engine during landing: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.camras.nl/en/blog/2019/moon-landing-tracked-with-the-radio-telescope/">Doppler curve landing-fall</a> apparatus "Bereshit", around 19:19 inhibition almost ceased: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/804/e9b/1ac/804e9b1acaf07088b364bdc2a4e7e68f.png"><br><br>  <u>On-board computer.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fl/k7/vs/flk7vsjtbli-n2ese9ssdx-blj0.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.cobham.com/advanced-electronic-solutions/news/cobham-processor-on-its-way-to-the-moon/">Cobham Gaisler's HiRel GR712RC processor</a> <br><br>  The main element of the on-board computer in the unit ‚ÄúBereshit‚Äù uses <a href="https://www.gaisler.com/doc/gr712rc-productsheet.pdf">a Gaisler HiRel GR712RC dual-core processor</a> from Cobham. <br><br>  Technologically, the chip is based on LEON SPARC and is manufactured using a unique radiation-resistant silicon technology. <br><br>  The SpaceIL company became the <a href="https://www.gaisler.com/doc/gr712rc-datasheet.pdf">first customer of this processor</a> and SpaceIL engineers wrote special software for it before the actual delivery and sweep on the Bereshit device. <br><br>  <i><a href="https://www.gaisler.com/index.php/products/components/gr712rc">The GR712RC is a LEON3FT SPARC V8 dual-core processor</a> .</i>  <i>It can operate at a frequency of up to 125 MHz in the entire range of military frequencies.</i>  <i>This provides up to 300 DMIPS and 250 MFLOPS peak performance.</i>  <i>Integrates advanced interface protocols, including SpaceWire, CAN, SatCAN, UART, 1553B, Ethernet, SPI, I2C, GPIO, and others.</i>  <i>It has high-speed interface buses for external SDRAM / SRAM / PROM / EEROM / NOR-FLASH memory.</i>  <i>Proved radiation resistance - up to 300 krad.</i>  <i>Low power consumption.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bg/x6/ff/bgx6ffi-0lbe-8ubmfumqwaxceu.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/h1/w0/wmh1w0ntcvvpsgtb0btytpjhxya.png"><br><br>  According to the specified data, this processor was produced using the most common commercially available technology (TowerJazz 180 nm, made in Israel), about the same as the controllers for electric kettles do.

Main engine does not appear to be operated properly. <br><br>  The last 4 seconds of the life of the device according to the data center (from 678 to 149 meters reduction): <br><br><img

data completely ceased to arrive. <br><br>  Previously, the problems started at an altitude of 14 km, the main engine shut down during the landing process, and after it was restarted it was too late ‚Äî the device could not brake correctly, this problem led to a hard fall at high speed and from a height of 150 meters to the Moon. <br><br>  <u>Inertial orientation block (inertial measurement unit - IMU1, IMU2) - the nodes are duplicated.</u> <br><br>  But this is interesting, since here two blocks were used and their data were very important for the onboard computer. <br><br>  Already earlier, due to the failure of such modules, there were accidents - as with the Sciaparelli apparatus on Mars in 2016. <br><br>  <i>It turned out that the fatal error in the work of the Schiaparelli software was due to problems in the work of the ‚Äúinertia meter‚Äù (IMU), a device that measures the rotation speed of the module around its axis.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/news/2016/11/23/666657-modul-schiaparelli">The data from this device</a> , as the engineers explain, was taken into account when processing data on the flight altitude coming from the Schiaparelli radar.</i>  <i>At one point, the IMU failed to function, as a result of which it ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù the abnormally high speed of rotation of the Lender, which went beyond the limits of permissible values.</i>  <i>Such failures are the norm in the work of inertial sensors, and usually to suppress them, scientists "smooth out" the signal and compare the data for the current moment with the results obtained at previous points in time.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But in this case, the IMU transmitted data to the Schiaparelli main computer for an unexpectedly long time, for a second, which ‚Äúdeceived‚Äù the software of the module and made him consider these measurements to be real data, and not an anomaly.</i>  <i>Incorrect values ‚Äã‚Äãwere taken into account when calculating the module height, as a result of which the Schiaparelli on-board computer received negative height values.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The module considered that it was not even on the surface of Mars, but beneath it, which made him, at a height of 3.7 km, initiate the final stage of the landing procedure, separate the parachutes and turn off the engines.</i> <br><br>  In the device "Bereshit" used such a module IMU: <a href="https://www.sensonor.com/products/inertial-measurement-units/stim300/">STIM300</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zl/ja/3c/zlja3cu4sxs3kf7xwqagwmvv5cu.jpeg"><br><br>  This module does not have a high level radiation protection characteristic, so the use of such devices on the Moon may be even more thoughtful by SpaceIL engineers further in new missions. <br><br>  Since there was a statement from SpaceIL after the accident: <i>‚ÄúProblem in one of Beresheet‚Äôs inertial measurement units.</i>  <i>Ground controllers lost telemetry. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Did the module (or both modules) of the Bereshit IMU give out incorrect data (including the measurement of angular and linear accelerations it became impossible) for the on-board computer and for what reason it is still being investigated by SpaceIL engineers <br><br>  However, for the time being it is clear that the Bereshit apparatus had a technical failure in the operation of one of the components, which led to the shutdown of the engines, which did not allow the apparatus to reduce the rate of descent to the lunar surface. <br><br>  When the engines were restarted, they were no longer able to complete braking, it turned out that the speed of the vehicle was too high, and the height to the surface of the moon was critically reduced, and a destructive collision occurred. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bc/420/492/6bc42049278505be80ec9d81cc23062a.png"><br><br>  The last photo from the Bereshit device also baffles a bit.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since it is visible on the lunar surface of 1000 km from the planned landing zone in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãClarity. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The last frame (officially published) from the Bereshit apparatus (from a height of 8 km):</font></font></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/7e6/c8c/e367e6c8c9320d4bfc788466a768dd19.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thus, it will be very difficult to find at least something from the Bereshit apparatus, since the search area is very extensive: </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed7/8b7/262/ed78b7262c60370c2f0f214e13421ff8.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although it is a little clear where to look (200 km to the landing zone "Apollo 11"):</font></font><br><br><img

src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6m/lq/7h/6mlq7hybkvs1n9nw-d2fvxrqcju.jpeg"><br><br>  NASA plans to survey the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Bereshit apparatus with the help of an LRO probe, in the hope that the elements of the array of laser corner reflectors have not collapsed and will be located on the lunar surface. <br><br>  Reflectors were fixed on the upper part of the apparatus and, if it fell, could bounce, fly apart, roll over and dig in the lunar soil.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> But even if only part of the reflector is available to reflect the light pulse - this will be fixed by the LRO. </font></font><br><br>  The LRO laser altimeter (NASA lunar orbital probe), designed to compile an altitude map, will send laser light pulses to the corner reflector at the site of the Bereshit apparatus, and then measure how long the light takes to go back. <br><br>  Using this technique, NASA and SpaceIL engineers plan to be able to locate the remains of the Bereshit vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17f/4c5/68e/17f4c568ee35c9426354352f8ca94224.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although it‚Äôs also interesting here, in SpaceIL there are still photos of the fall, but they don‚Äôt publish them: </font></font><br><br><font

from Beresheet?
