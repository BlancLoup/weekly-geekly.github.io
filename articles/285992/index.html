  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Or maybe you are an entrepreneur? 7 signs that you need to do a startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63a/f4d/7fa/63af4d7fa0fa44f29fc04be52a204908.jpg"><br><br>  I thought about what signs an entrepreneur might give you.  That is, that you can go through the exciting, cruel and life-changing process of founding your own company. <br><br>  Yes, you must have passion, endurance and all that jazz.  But you need less obvious qualities.  For years, talking with entrepreneurs through Hootsuite and working with them about my foundation The Next Big Thing, I noticed the common properties that they had.  So, without further ado, you can be an entrepreneur if: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) You are restless, and any achievement does not seem sufficient to you.  When most people reach the goal, they think, ‚ÄúI did it!  You can relax and enjoy it. ‚Äù  The entrepreneur thinks: ‚ÄúGreat, what's next?‚Äù.  Take for example Coco Chanel.  She started with hats, then took up clothes, and then switched to jewelry, accessories and perfumery.  By the time of her death in 1971, she had not only left the brand icon, but also a business empire with an annual income of $ 160 million.  Entrepreneurs like her do not stop at what has been accomplished, they always want to find and compete for the next achievement.

      2) You like to control everything.  All my life I‚Äôm torn between wanting to control my business and give the reins to talented people.  And so it happens with many.  It is good when a CEO penetrates into all the details, but when he has to participate in all levels of a company‚Äôs work, it hurts her.  It also harms employees - they are needed precisely so that the CEO does not have to deal with everything at once.  Some consolation can bring the, that Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates showed love to control over all. <br><br>  3) You are a masochist.  The entrepreneur loves pain and risk.  75% of all startups disappear.  Only a masochist will work with such chances.  You are trying to make money, you work many hours a day, you are lonely, because everyone else is hanging out or sitting in a movie ... Serial entrepreneurs running one business after another are even more masochists.  They know what awaits them. <br><br>  4) You love and hate money.  Entrepreneurs from an early age love money.  Warren Buffett still in school delivered newspapers, selling everything from golf balls to chewing gums, stamps and magazines.  I started by washing windows and selling snacks on the paintball fields. <br>  But then entrepreneurs begin to love less money and more - the excitement of starting a new business, freedom and control over it.  Already in college, my addiction began to change.  I got the degree of a lawyer and a well-paid job, and I left school and opened a pizzeria because it was a challenge and I could do my business according to my own understanding. <br><br>  5) You are an outcast.  Many entrepreneurs describe that they do not fit into the crowd.  Many even threw traditional training.  Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Lee Ka-shin, Richard Branson, Ray Kroc (McDonald's) - all dropped out of college or college, and achieved success.  It is not easy to be an outsider, but the ability to look at the world in another way can help advance society and make innovations. <br><br>  6) People think you're crazy.  Entrepreneurs think differently, their ambitions look ridiculous - before they are realized.  For example, Ruth Handler, who created Barbie.  In the 1950s, she was met with doubts and criticism (including her husband) when she offered a doll that looked like an adult, and not like a child.  She did this when she saw her daughter playing with paper dolls that look like adults.  She, of course, did not depart from the idea, and the result is known. <br><br>  7) You are an introvert.  To run a business, you need to be sociable and look like a seller?  Not necessary.  4 out of 10 executives, including Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg, are introverts.  Studies say that introverts create a better team atmosphere in the workplace, and they are better able to listen - and this is a very under-appreciated quality of a good leader.  A small part of the businessmen I know are loud and aggressive, especially in large groups or at meetings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285992/</a></p>
