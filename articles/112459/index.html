  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How in the Ulyanovsk region "selected" the Minister of IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Last year there was a competition for the position of Minister of IT.  There was a lot of noise about this.  How progressive it is!  Any fellow could send a resume and win this position in a fair fight. <br>  The media <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/205979/">quickly picked up</a> this nano-modernization news. <br>  But the IT minister was appointed, <a href="http://www.russia.ru/video/diskurs_11495/">enthusiastically reported</a> , and many of the evidence as it happened on the Internet erased.  So what was it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all began with messages in the news and in the blog of the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Ulyanovsk Region <a href="http://openysheva-sv.livejournal.com/112201.html">Openysheva</a> . <br>  More than a thousand resumes were sent and only the best ones remained. <br>  But let me dwell only on one person, who became the IT minister of the Ulyanovsk region - Elena Balashova.  Nothing personal, just facts :) (I am absolutely not interested in the person, so, the critic from the side). <br><br>  Almost the entire process of passing the contest was written in the LiveJournal by the deputy chairman of the government of the Ulyanovsk region.  From <a href="http://openysheva-sv.livejournal.com/131974.html">LJ</a> Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Ulyanovsk Region: <br>  <i>Passed the next stage of selection of candidates for the post of Minister of Information Technology</i> <i><br></i>  <i>openysheva_sv</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>On November 8, a meeting of the expert commission on the selection of candidates was held.</i>  <i>The commission included representatives of the Government of the Ulyanovsk region, higher educational institutions of the region, as well as representatives of large IT companies.</i>  <i>37 applicants reached the fourth stage.</i>  <i>At the meeting, members of the commission reviewed and <b>evaluated the projects submitted by them for the development of the IT cluster of the Ulyanovsk region and the innovative capabilities of space and geo-information technologies for the socio-economic development of the region</b> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The second indicator, assessed by the commission, was the active and <b>informative discussions in the LiveJournal personal blog</b> .</i> <br>  Two key factors are highlighted in bold - the draft presented (until recently, projects were posted on the regional government site, but then disappeared) and activity in LiveJournal (yes, this is ridiculous, but what to do if the governor is a forced fanatic of official blogs; therefore, also a factor in the fight).

      At the time when I drew attention to this competition, all the information was available and I became interested in the winning Balashova.  Just in case, then saved the analytical note and presentation.  With each of the finalists in the LiveJournal Openysheva a session was held where anyone could ask a question and get an answer from the applicant.  As the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper wrote (a good PR was, very many media outlets wrote about the precedent): <i>For each candidate, a post was created.</i>  <i>About three thousand network users could communicate directly with potential ministers, read their discussions on the proposed topics and ask clarifying questions.</i>  At the moment, the message with the Balashova session has been deleted, but it can be partially found in the <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache:NyzTvhfJTfUJ:openysheva-sv.livejournal.com/118389.html%2Bopenysheva-sv.livejournal.com/118389.html%26cd%3D1%26hl%3Dru%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dru">Google cache</a> .  For some reason, the question and answer sessions with other candidates were not deleted (In the Openysheva blog from October 16 to October 25, 2010).  I propose to enjoy the answers Balashova, cut taken from the <a href="http://www.ulyanovskcity.ru/forum/topic.php%3Fforum%3D2%26topic%3D227%26p%3D1">Ulyanovsk Forum</a> : <br><br>  <i>Balashova Elena, 35 years old I live in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area.</i>  <i>Married, two children, daughter 16 years old and son 4 years.</i>  <i>I work in the municipal authority, the head of the department for information resources, information security and communications.</i>  <i>Passed the stages of pre-selection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Your vision of the impact of educational institutions (Ulyanovsk region) on the development of IT technologies in our country and the world.</b></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Balashov</b> : A global question!</i>  <i>If there is such an IT community in UO, which is represented in Svetlana Vladimirovna‚Äôs blog, if they live and work, people like Ruslan Fazlyev and many other talented IT professionals, I think that the IT minister and the UO Government should create all the conditions for the normal development of ICT , as closely as possible to work together.</i>  <i>Now it‚Äôs not the influence that is more relevant, but a simple person who walks the streets and understands very little what is happening in our sphere.</i>  <i>I am a very down-to-earth person and therefore I will not argue for a long time.</i>  <i>Let's develop ICT in a specific place at a specific time, of course, considering how all this will fit into the all-Russian ICT development policy.</i>  <i>The ‚ÄúInformation Society Development, ICT Use, Improving the Quality of State (Municipal) Services in the MA for 2010-2012‚Äù OTS ‚Äùis a worthy program that needs to be worked out and implemented, and the results will have an impact on the development of ICT technologies in our country.</i>  <i>Let's limit ourselves to the borders of Russia.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>" <b>Mind Russia does not understand</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i><b>Yard common not to measure:</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i><b>She has become special -</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i><b>You can only believe in Russia!</b></i>  <i>"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A lot of problems that need to be solved roll up their sleeves.</i>  <i>And you can rant as much as you want.</i>  <i>It is necessary, gentlemen's husband, <b>not to flirt with questions and answers, but to work by trial and error and go towards the goal</b> .</i>  <i>And one goal is to improve our quality of life.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Reply) (Parent) (Thread) (Expand)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Helena,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In one of the earlier topics, you were asked for links to specific projects that you have implemented at your current place of work.</i>  <i>Can I still look at these projects?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Why did you decide to apply for this position?</i>  <i>As far as I understand, you are now doing similar work in your region.</i>  <i>Why do you want to move to a foreign region, and not continue to work for the good of his?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As far as I understand, the minister will have to work 10-12 hours a day.</i>  <i>How are you going to combine this with caring for a 4-year-old child?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Elena Valerievna, deign to answer these questions:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1.

They were removed from the site of the regional government (and were not even placed in the Archive), but the Analytical Note and Presentation from Elena Balashova <a href="">were preserved</a> on public computers.  Actually, why were they saved?  Yes, because the ears copy-paste from the Internet can be seen very well and such traces for a long time can not remain not erased on the official sites. <br>  Here are just a couple of examples: <br>  Take a quote from the Analytical Note: <br>  ‚ÄúTo build the system, an approach is used in which the data structure is projected on the basis of the natural spatial model of the territory.  The system stores data in the form of objects (parts of a territory) and their characteristics, and not documents that contain this information.  Thus, the system does not depend on the type and structure of documents used in the work. ‚Äù <br>  We search in search engines.  We find a <a href="http://www.ugi.ru/services/gis/municipal-geoinformation-system">similar text</a> . <br>  Take another quote: <br>  ‚ÄúIn general, the IT cluster should become a catalyst in promoting information and communication technologies in all spheres of activity, serve the public sector, business structures and the population of the Ulyanovsk region and, with favorable development, enter the market of neighboring regions.  ‚Äû <br>  It is very likely taken <a href="http://info.tatcenter.ru/74261_print.htm">from here.</a> <br>  I took only a couple of quotations at random.  Perhaps she has her own ideas in the text, nothing can be ruled out :) But isn‚Äôt the future leader of the IT field able to afford student essay pranks? <br>  As for the presentation, it <a href="http://openysheva-sv.livejournal.com/134410.html%3Fthread%3D1662986">‚Äôs</a> stated <a href="http://openysheva-sv.livejournal.com/134410.html%3Fthread%3D1662986">in the comments to the blog entry of Openysheva</a> that it was also ‚Äúreworked‚Äù to some extent. <br><br>  Now to the blog Balashova, because it is also a factor in the competition.  Now <a href="http://balashova-ev.livejournal.com/">it is removed</a> and a <a href="http://balashova-elena.livejournal.com/">new blog has been launched</a> .  At the time of the end of the competition, I was watching an absolutely empty magazine (a screenshot, unfortunately I did not think of doing it), possibly with a couple of spamming friends.  I suspect that the blog in LiveJournal was started specifically for the competition. <br><br>  Total facts: <br>  - interview with the IT public was.  In places boorish, in places with "water" <br>  - the interview was deleted (only its interview was deleted) <br>  - on the website of the regional government there were materials of the submitted projects - an analytical note and a presentation.  At least in places copy-paste <br>  - materials submitted projects removed <br>  - LiveJournal of the current IT Minister of the Ulyanovsk region at the time of the end of December was empty and with a very high degree of probability did not contain ‚Äúinformative discussions‚Äù <br>  - FaceBook was deleted <br><br>  I specifically read the opinions of the Ulyanovsk IT community and nowhere did I find Balashov among the leaders, it was considered as an obvious outsider in the competition. <br>  Those.  Initially, this whole project of choosing a new minister was conceived as open and presented as something new and modern.  But in fact it happened as always.  They pulled out an absolutely closed bureaucrat bureaucrat, but not a reformer-leader.  And was it worth it to plot and pull at the hope of many worthy people, if it was possible to simply appoint any other bureaucrat in a quiet way and no one would even squeak.  Or can I be calm for the Ulyanovsk region and it is this worthy person who will create another Skolkovo in the region? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112459/</a></p>
