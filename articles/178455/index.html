To become her student, you need to answer the questions in the <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/admission/mathematics/">test</a> , pass exams and pass an interview.  Classes, as always, will be held in the Yandex office in Moscow, as well as in <a href="">Yekaterinburg</a> , <a href="">Kiev</a> and <a href="">Minsk</a> .  In St. Petersburg, there is a branch in the <a href="http://compscicenter.ru/">Computer Science Center</a> .  If you live in other cities, you can study with us in absentia: communicate with teachers by e-mail and watch video lectures.  Schooling is free. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/178455/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac8/a2b/063/ac8a2b0631a381dfee0185349aa2c120.jpg" width="700" height="269" alt="Audiences of the School of Data Analysis Yandex"></a> <br><br>  The SAD is taught by leading Russian scientists - both those who live in Russia and those who work abroad.  For example, the theory of machine learning is conducted by <a href="http://www.ipu.ru/node/12141">Aleksey Chervonenkis</a> , a professor at the University of London and one of the founders of the Russian school of data analysis.  The author of the data analysis course and the scientific director of the database is the professor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University">Rutgers University</a> Ilya Muchnik, who was once the academic director of Arkady Volozh. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  The school of data analysis appeared largely due to the fact that in the 2000s it was very difficult to find the specialists we needed.  And although the fundamental base was with a large number of guys, few could use it in industrial programming.  Even VMIK or Mekhmat of Moscow State University did not give sufficient knowledge to solve problems related to data processing (texts, images, music, voice).  It was necessary to revive the scientific environment and grow a new generation of programmers.

      The training program is divided into three types of courses: theoretical ("Discrete analysis", "Combinatorics", "Probability", "Theory of complexity"), practical ("Teaching programming in C ++", "Java", "Parallel and distributed computing" ) and mixed (‚ÄúAlgorithms and data structures‚Äù, ‚ÄúMachine learning‚Äù, ‚ÄúComputational linguistics‚Äù, etc.). <br><br>  As a company in which tasks related to big data are solved every day, it was important for us to combine theory and practice in the course.  The program of the Computer Science department was developed including Ilya <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/iseg/" class="user_link">Iseg</a> Segalovich, technical director of Yandex.  And among the teachers of the ShAD there are our brilliant programmers who have won in international student programming competitions and prepared others for them. <br><br>  And despite the fact that this is the School of Yandex, its graduates will be able to solve not only the tasks that we have.  The training program is determined primarily by the presentation of its authors on the most relevant areas of modern computer science. <br><br><h4>  Studying proccess </h4><br>  There are two departments in the ShAD: data analysis and Computer Science.  Their <a href="">program</a> intersects in mixed courses.  For example, both departments study ‚ÄúAlgorithms and Data Structures‚Äù and ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù.  There are general specs, including game theory, learning C ++, introduction to linguistics, image and video analysis, etc.  In 2011, the School also established a bioinformatics department, which became <a href="http://bioinformaticseminar.com/ru/">an independent academic structure</a> this year. <br><br>  Classes are held in the evenings, so students can simultaneously study somewhere else or even work.  But it should be noted that about 15 hours a week will go to the classes themselves and about 12 hours to prepare homework. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/c62/3e3/0afc623e3f08455230bc781abb7fb48c.jpg" width="700" height="357" alt="Lesson at the School of Data Analysis"><br><br>  Training is divided into four semesters.  After graduation, students who want to work at Yandex will be able to complete an internship with us.  This is a great chance to put into practice the knowledge that they gained in the School.  All graduates of the ShAD are awarded a certificate of completion.  The best graduates have the opportunity to get a diploma of professional retraining in the direction of "Data Analysis" MIPT. <br><br><h4>  What you need to do to enroll? </h4><br>  The school is designed for students and graduates (graduate students and young professionals) engineering and mathematical specialties.  To cope with the introductory tasks, you must have a certain base: knowledge of mathematical analysis, linear algebra, combinatorics, probability theory, as well as programming skills.  All this is taken into account in the <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/schad_programm.pdf">program for admission</a> . <br><br>  If you want to become a student of SAD, you need to do the following: <br><ul><li>  until May 20, fill out a questionnaire and perform a <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/admission/mathematics/">test task</a> ; </li><li>  May 26, June 2 or June 9 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Kiev or Minsk to pass written exams; </li><li>  from June 10 to July 1 to have an interview in the same place.  If you enter the correspondence department, it can be done via Skype. </li></ul><br>  In the five years of its existence, the School of Data Analysis has released more than 170 people.  We hope that they will contribute to the development of Russian science.  And we are very glad that more than 100 of our graduates have remained to work at Yandex.  All the details about the School can be found on <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/">shad.yandex.ru</a> .  If you have any questions, ask them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178455/</a></p>
