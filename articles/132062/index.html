In this issue, we‚Äôll tell you that the European market is already comparable in volume with the United States;  about the opening opportunities for those who want to make money on advertising in their applications;  about the growth of the mobile advertising market on the Android platform. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Not united America</b> <br><br>  After a long period of stagnation, the European mobile application market finally began to catch up with the United States in the distribution of smartphones, in application downloads and in terms of profit margins.  In the first six months of 2011, the number of downloads on the iPhone, iPad, Android in Europe has greatly increased: on average, the figures have doubled.

      A recent study showed that the size of the markets of the most important European countries is comparable to the size of the US application market.  So, in August 2011, 702 million downloads were registered in the USA and 668 million in Europe.  This is a summary of iOS and Android platforms. <br><br>  European iOS and Android users are now downloading more than 500 million applications per month.  This is about two-thirds of the US market, and these numbers continue to grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/039/24f/3f3/03924f3f323143684b51c8f7c39a4220.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting the tendency to introduce in-game purchases into paid applications.  Nevertheless, Android users to paid applications are rather indifferent: less than 1% of all downloaded Android applications are paid, while in the App Store this figure is 20 times more.  And, despite the fact that in most cases, publishers of freemium applications sell them all over the world, developers for local markets are more likely to lean toward the paid model, while releasing free ‚Äúlite‚Äù versions. <br><br>  <b>Always prime time</b> <br><br>  According to a study by <b>Flurry Analytics</b> , an audience of iOS games can be compared to a television audience in prime time: more than 19 million people spend an average of 22 minutes a day every day on iOS games or on social networks using their iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch.  The total number of users exceeds the audience of broadcasts of American football on Sunday evening or another top show.  For comparison, only 4 million people watch the issues of the American Idol Star Factory edition.  Of course, it is quite difficult to compare the audience of television and iOS applications - after all, they are quite different.  In addition, while the audience of a single mobile game could not even come close in terms of audience coverage to rating television shows - Flurry speaks of the total audience of applications. <br><br>  But unlike TV, the audience reach does not depend on the day of the week and is about the same 365 days a year.  This is very important for advertisers and developers who motivate their products by advertising.  According to IDC, the mobile advertising market will reach $ 500 million this year.  In 2009, this figure was estimated at just $ 250 million. <br><br>  To get the full picture, Flurry data on audience coverage of iOS applications was combined with the schedule of Michael Zimbalist (vice president of research at the New York Times).  The result was a graph of comparative hourly coverage of television, Internet, and iOS applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa1/0f6/951/aa10f695119979ce4171226b9af8ed62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>More than a third of mobile advertising is on Android</b> <br><br>  According to the mobile advertising network <b>InMobi</b> , which conducted a study of the mobile market in the third quarter of 2011, iPhone 4 remains the most common device in Europe with a share of 7.2%.  This is followed by the Samsung GT-i9000 (4.9%) and HTC Desire S (3.1%). <br><br>  Nevertheless, Android accounts for a third (33%) of all mobile advertising in Europe - more than two times more than iOS (14.9%).  Android has demonstrated growth over the past nine months and for the first time became the leader in the third quarter. <br><br>  James Lamberti, vice president of global research and marketing at <b>InMobi</b> , commented: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúConsumers have adopted a mobile platform, and over the last quarter we have witnessed a tremendous jump in mobile use.  The trend of active growth, noted by us from quarter to quarter, has not changed, which underlines the need to implement effective mobile advertising campaigns, especially on the eve of Christmas. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <i>According to the materials of the portal <a href="http://app2top.ru/">App2Top.ru</a> specifically for Habrahabr.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132062/</a></p>
