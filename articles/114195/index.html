Among the 10 applicants are 6 shaggy characterless animals standing on their hind legs (including a dolphin).  Warning Zoich did not affect the opinion of the jury.  Then there is the completely infantile: Sun, Fiery Boy and Snowflake, and even Santa Claus.  That is, there is simply nothing to choose from. <br><br>  I think that these nine members of the jury were selected specially so that there were no competitors left for the <a href="http://talisman.sochi2014.com/">dolls</a> .  Matryoshka dolls are made of white plastic, like an innovative I-Pod.  Apparently, the sports committee has already decided everything for us, and the competition was created so that we did not forget that we live in a democratic country. <br><br>  In this situation, being in the company of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2587">Zoich</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/turbomilk/blog/108022/">Mittens</a> is just worthy.  I propose a third option, about which I understand in advance that he had not and no chance.  This is: Tetris! <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Tetris is more popular all over the world than Cheburashka </h2><br>  This is true - Tetris is over 25 years old.  It has grown more than one generation.  What does it all people in active age. <br><br>  By the efforts of the Chinese industry, tetris were played in all countries of the world. <br><br><br><h2>  Tetris author - Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov </h2><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/thumb/5/5d/Amiga_Tetris.jpg/220px-Amiga_Tetris.jpg" align="left">  I think this is important.  If we declare to the whole world that we are for innovation, then it may be worth emphasizing, with what respect we regard the fruits of Russian creators of modern brands? <br><br>  And if <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Aleksey Pajitnov</a> is also paying for the use of the brand, in this way we will thank him.  After all, the homeland must remember its heroes! <br><br>  Moreover, in spite of the internationality of Tetris, the whole world knows it, like the Russian game. <br><br><br><h2>  Tetris is a game </h2><br>  So what that computer?  Did someone cancel character and intelligence in Olympic sports? <br><br>  Cheburashka's spinelessness is one of the main drawbacks, as a mascot of Olympic sports.  What have I done here without claims to Ouspensky and Norshtein, they created an image for children of preschool age.  The question is to those who decide who to be a talisman. <br><br><br><h2>  Tetris looks good graphically. </h2><br>  Screensavers will require screensavers.  Tetris can be played in animation.  You will need logos for sports.  Tetris, in spite of its squareness and pixelness, will look good graphically.  And stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27d/e8e/0aa/27de8e0aaa34407d4483427fa7a2148f.png"><br><br><br><h2>  On decision making at the aesthetic level </h2><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Marat Gelman</a> <a href="http://www.gif.ru/cult/guelman/">wrote</a> in 2000: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn today's Russia, a research institute, as an institution in art, is being bullied - our rulers are building their relationship with art on the principle of favoritism.  If the president or the mayor chooses the chief artist, or the chief musician, or the chief writer, then these institutions are no longer needed, as it were. ‚Äù <br><br>  Moscow Mayor has changed, and the President, too.  And the method of decision making in art and aesthetics remained. <br><br><br><h2>  Results of the competition </h2><br>  My theory was not correct - the matryoshka lost.  I had a very good opinion about the taste and style of the organizers. <br><br>  Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin on the eve said at a meeting with students in Sochi that he likes Leopard.  On February 26, 2011, it was Leopard that won the largest number of votes. <br><br>  In principle, if it helps the revival of the population of rare animals, then God is with him.  In the end, it's just a talisman.  The Olympics will end and the talismans will be forgotten.  And the business on these talismans in Russia would still not be able to organize. <br><br>  In addition to the leopard, the polar bear and the hare also won.  The jury decided to leave also a ray and a snowflake.  Vinigret turned out to be one more: a ray of light will melt a snowflake, a leopard will eat a hare, a polar bear will immediately go to the North Pole to eat cold as ice of sushi. <br><br><br><h2>  Authorship </h2><br>  The author of the text is Vadim Galkin.
