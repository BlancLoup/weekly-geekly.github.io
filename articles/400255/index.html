We are all so used to inscriptions like Dolby 7.1 and others that the opinion of an organization like ESL should not be taken into account when making informed decisions.  Let it pleases the eye with a sticker on the box. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/284122/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31a/478/390/31a47839071b7eb304ea8e5f75fdfe93.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bf/8bf/e1d/7bf8bfe1d17ae9a0fcdb4590a197fa38.jpg"><br><br>  A drop-down microphone, a wire of optimal length, a large upper arc with a soft and elastic rim - as I found out later, with a ‚Äúhanging headband frame‚Äù.

The usual 3.5-mm jack is also present, and the filling of the console really works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/898/9b3/e3a8989b3a29f6a4966c15e57a676e86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47a/98e/d58/47a98ed5891a2ec1c6bf697063dfa7fd.jpg"><br><br>  But seeing their colleagues on the desktop at the time of searching for something in which I can comfortably conduct Skype calling in a noisy office, there was no choice.  Frankly, I did not get deeply acquainted with the work of Plantronics, but I treat the quality and convenience of individual audio production with sufficient rigor. <br><br>  What characteristics does the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/igrovye-naushniki-plantronics-rig-500hd-203803-05-50044090">RIG 500 HD have</a> ? <br><br><ul><li>  Manufacturer: Plantronics; </li><li>  Model: RIG 500HD; </li><li>  Black colour; </li><li>  Material: plastic; </li><li>  Speakers: 40 mm with low-frequency resonators; </li><li>  Speaker frequency range: 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz; </li><li>  Resistance: 32 Ohm; </li><li>  Maximum input power: 40 mW; </li><li>  Volume control: none; </li><li>  Type of acoustic design: closed; </li><li>  Fastening type: headband; </li><li>  Connection type: wired; </li><li>  Connector for connection: USB; </li><li>  Microphone: one / retired; </li><li>  Directivity: Unidirectional; </li><li>  Microphone frequency range: 100 Hz ~ 10 kHz; </li><li>  Resistance: 2200 Ohm; </li><li>  Microphone sensitivity: -45 dB ¬± 3 dB; </li><li>  Weight: 200 g </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91b/05f/300/91b05f30036853958f7b1848ce866bbf.jpg"><br><br>  And when you talk to other people, you want to be heard well first of all.  The headset did an excellent job with this task - I even had to turn down the volume with the usual one in the case of voice sessions, as the interlocutors immediately noted the clarity and volume of my voice.  Again, it was only later that I learned that the headset microphone has a noise canceling function, but I felt its presence from the first minute of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc1/e82/e59/cc1e82e59b48c06ba848e76eecbbb10a.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone headset is retracted so that it is not visible even with lateral vision, and in the working position does not cause any discomfort, the distance between the face and the microphone is decent (in my case - 5 centimeters), thanks to the soft end of the microphone it is possible to adjust within large limits, which allows fine tune the sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e8/ac8/ffd/5e8ac8ffd38dff3537482a8936e5ffd7.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone is non-removable and, by the way, has a rather pleasant function of the hardware mute of the microphone, which is in the folded position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef9/283/0f7/ef92830f761198f79e89b95cf05d1f12.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones fit very well on the head thanks to a competent combination of two important factors - a soft strap of connection and fixation on the head, a frame, and volume and rather elastic ear cushions.  Three holes in the frame for mounting cups allow you to more flexibly adjust the location of the headphones, taking into account individual features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/467/43a/a5946743a76424efa142d6a798cf889a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1aa/84e/29a/1aa84e29af835838010b3258cfc99415.jpg"><br><br>  The cups themselves are made competently - they have hiding rods, which allow conveniently, without strong pressure, to change the location of individual headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/593/e46/ae1/593e46ae1ee8f94a1b459997b9ce7366.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the construction, the insulation is not very good, but we must understand that this device is primarily for home use, and not for listening to music on the train.  Although, in principle, the headphones are suitable for office use - if you do not constantly listen to them at maximum volume, then you will not disturb much of those around you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1d/119/e48/b1d119e48bcf14bda86ab2ad36d6ba5f.jpg"><br><br>  Again - the sound quality and volume left a very specific, but good feeling.  I am used to the fact that most modern individual equipment (various headphones, portable speakers, and large audio complexes) are designed primarily for the production of low-frequency "vibrations." <br><br>  In the RIG 500, I was able to meet a completely different combination of qualities: a clear predominance of the main, mid-frequency scene, but with quite good implementations of peak low and high frequencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8bd/32e/a0a/8bd32ea0a8547179c23e33b9b624b8d2.jpg"><br><br>  In short, the headphones do not create the feeling of a vacuum characteristic of the technique that only ‚Äúpumps on bottoms‚Äù - the sound is very pleasant, everything is audible, exactly when you listen. <br><br>  I tried to unscrew the sound to the maximum in terms of connecting to a laptop and I can say that the maximum volume in principle already gives the ultimate sensations.  Louder and not necessary, otherwise, it is possible, unwillingly, you harm yourself or technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e4/ea4/6b5/8e4ea46b5dd1d7fb29cd4e92a153c386.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the Dolby button on the Mac did not take any action, although compatibility is stated in the specification, and in the settings the device is displayed quite clearly.  The PC was not at hand, unfortunately. <br><br>  But opening one of my few games, I experienced a pleasant surprise - Surround really works and is very cool.  The simple rotation of the camera around it gave me a completely new sensation - the sound passes from one earphone to another very imperceptibly, the sensations ‚Äúbehind the back‚Äù deserve the highest praise.  When I was killed - I was scared, despite the fact that I play MMO for a very long time. <br><br>  The angle of deviation of the headphones at the attachment point is not very large, it feels like 7 degrees, but this is quite enough for them to sit comfortably on the head.  As I already mentioned - in combination with a soft mix, the sensations are more than comfortable. <br><br>  As a result, I spent a lot of time with the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/igrovye-naushniki-plantronics-rig-500hd-203803-05-50044090">RIG</a> for a week, primarily because of their comfort and high microphone qualities, since I make several long calls every day and it‚Äôs important for me and the other person to hear each other in the best way possible. possible. <br><br>  As a stationary or home headset with good 3D sound for average money, the RIG 500 HD was more than convincing. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400255/</a></p>
