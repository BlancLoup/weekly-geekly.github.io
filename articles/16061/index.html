      <strong>Why did you sell your share in the project Bobrdobr.ru?</strong>  <strong>Do not agree on the direction of the project?</strong> <br><br>  At the start of the project there was a serious technical failure, after which I had serious doubts about the competence of the programmers who worked on the project.  My partners, who were responsible for the technical component, did not agree with this.  A dispute arose, which, omitting the details, ended with my leaving the project and selling that half in a project that belonged to me.  Although, rather, it was not a sale, but a compensation for the funds I invested.  That is, the profit in this transaction was not actually discussed. <br><br>  <strong>The next, similar project Memori.ru you already did as the sole owner?</strong> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <strong>The essence of the services of Memori and Bobrdobr is the same, but what are their details?</strong>  <strong>How is memori different from beaver dobr?</strong> <br><br>  Since I was initially in charge of the development of both services, Memori became ‚Äúwork on the mistakes‚Äù and inaccuracies that I made at BeaverGov.  Doing the same product principle a second time is easier and, as a manager, you see more details.  In my opinion, Memori turned out to be more convenient to use, more functional, more understandable. <br><br>  <strong>You have created several successful projects that can be called advertising platforms.</strong>  <strong>How do you plan to profit from them?</strong>  <strong>Only through the sale of advertising?</strong>  <strong>Maybe you create projects for their subsequent sale?</strong> <br><br>  Of course, advertising can be sold on any project.  If only he was visiting.  But in particular, the earnings model for each project is different. <br>  Do we create projects for sale?  Including.  So, Memori was originally planned as a project that will develop with any strong partner, having a significant number of visited sites, where Memor buttons and banners will be installed.  In this sense, by the way, the proposal of RBC that arrived soon after the start turned out. <br><br>  In the future, we plan to create projects both ‚Äúfor ourselves‚Äù and for further sale. <br><br>  <strong>As a rule, large projects are those that were created only for personal use.</strong>  <strong>Did your projects originate as well, or did you want to offer something such to users?</strong> <br><br>  Maybe I don‚Äôt really understand the question ... I didn‚Äôt plan to do anything.  The beginning of work on the creation of each project is preceded by reflections, search, analysis.  It happens, what an unexpected idea and try to implement it.  In general, the emergence of a project idea is a creative process, and making a decision about investing money in it and starting work is a managerial question.  After all, any project is more or less a risk. <br><br>  <strong>Is your School of Life project designed for absolutely everyone from a child to an elderly person?</strong>  <strong>No matter how old you are, as long as you are alive, you can learn anything.</strong>  <strong>Approximately is the principle of your project?</strong> <br><br>  SchoolLife.ru is an easy-to-read magazine.  The age of readers there really can be very different.  We do not seek to create a community of consultants and experts there, as many think.  This is a good quality reading magazine. <br><br>  <strong>How can you characterize your production center Roiber?</strong> <br><br>  Mina ticking.  :) <br><br>  <strong>Why Roiber?</strong> <br><br>  Just enjoyed it.  It sounds noble in Russian, aggressive in German. <br>  <strong>R√§uber translates as robber.</strong>  <strong>Whom rob?</strong>  :) <br><br>  Indeed, R√§uber is a German rogue, predator, villain.  In general, this is a joke for those who understand.  In Russian sounds beautiful and euphonic, in German - aggressive and tough.  We have both of them :) <br><br>  <strong>What goals do you set for yourself: to help in the creation and development of successful projects or just to earn money in this occupation?</strong> <br><br>  We like to combine both. <br><br>  <strong>How did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project Successor 2008 come about?</strong> <br><br>  Unexpectedly :) We were offered another idea related to politics.  We even bought it.  And in the process of understanding what emerged ‚ÄúSuccessor 2008 ‚Ä≥. <br><br>  <strong>The prize to the winner of elections is designated in the form of 150 thousand rubles.</strong>  <strong>Are you planning any special rewards?</strong>  <strong>For example, meeting with the new president of Russia</strong> :) <br><br>  If the new president expresses such a desire, we will be happy to support him.  Although, something tells me that ... he is unlikely to express it :) <br>  <strong>From the new features of the project that will soon appear?</strong> <br><br>  Let it be a secret for now. <br>  <strong>Maxim, do you create and produce only venture projects?</strong> <br><br>  In a sense, any undertaking, especially in the Internet - venture. <br><br>  <strong>If you turn to a person with a desire to create a successful web project, for example in the field of mobile services.</strong>  <strong>How much does the customer have to pay you to create a project that brings real profit?</strong> <br><br>  There is no universal answer here.  Each case is a separate story. <br>  <strong>Good.</strong>  <strong>How will you evaluate the future prospects of the project?</strong>  <strong>What stages will the project have to go from the stage of creation to the stage of success, profitability?</strong> <br><br>  If to describe in detail - this is a topic for a huge article, if briefly - I will evaluate it in many ways intuitively, relying on my experience and ideas about the development of the market. <br><br>  <strong>What lessons have you learned during your time in the internet business?</strong>  <strong>What advice would be given to Internet figures in order to avoid possible mistakes?</strong> <br><br>  We must experiment and try :) <br><br>  <strong>Maxim, do you live in Germany now?</strong>  <strong>Why did you choose this country?</strong>  <strong>Why not live in Russia?</strong> <br><br>  In Germany, I found myself a couple of years ago out of curiosity, but I would not say that I ‚Äúchose this country‚Äù.  It can be said that now my family lives there and I often am.  But almost as often I am in Petersburg and Moscow. <br><br>  <strong>In connection with the beard-dressing tradition of my blog, your wishes to Internet users.</strong> <br><br>  Be healthy and whenever possible happy :) <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://miku.ws/20071111/interview-with-max-spiridonov/">Miku Blog</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16061/</a></p>
