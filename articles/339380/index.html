Customers from the USA placed 2.6 million projects, and from India only 0.1.  And at the same time, there is a distinct trend in America in Gig Economy - an otvyazku from the usual methods of work for the salary in the office and the transition to remote options.  Over 10 years, the number of "alternative" workers has grown by 66%. <br><br>  Taking into account the factor ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/unolabo/blog/339194/">Next Billon Users</a> ‚Äù - a fairly quick appearance on the network of a billion more people, to whom the mobile Internet only reaches, - definitely, a new market opens here.

      We have been preparing for this since 2015, but then the project had to be put ‚Äúon the table‚Äù because of the insufficiently correctly converging stars.  And now, it seems, everything is going as it should. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, that's what we thought up: <br><br><ol><li>  Since unemployment is the main problem for these people, they will use the Internet to look for work. </li><li>  Since their work is amazingly cheap by the standards of Europe, the USA and Australia (the latter is important because it is located near the main residence of the next billion - Asia and Oceania) - they will be hired for a variety of simple works that can be performed remotely. </li><li>  These people will be difficult to use the usual freelancing exchanges because of their complexity.  And a little different positioning. </li></ol><br>  The bottom line is that we were considering a freelance exchange for ‚Äúnew people‚Äù.  But they came to a more interesting model.  We do not need another exchange as such, we need infrastructure that allows us to quickly and easily enter into labor transactions.  It's like an ad site for ease of learning - and a lot of technology around. <br><br>  The most difficult and unnecessary place in the world of freelancers in the stock exchange is the centralized control of transactions.  The experience already proven by many states shows that it is extremely convenient to store transactions between individuals in the blockchain using smart contracts.  This reduces the commission of the system, speeds up the process of making a deal and gives about the same level of control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/d2/59d5d2e83379f636126751.png"><br><br>  Hence the use of the blockchain.  A couple of years ago it was not the mainstream, and the project with these words looked like suspicious, somewhere on the edge of the law.  Today, almost everyone even understands us (especially after Gref‚Äôs speech) that this is the future, and there‚Äôs no way out of it. <br><br>  The second aspect is that they will not have bank accounts (many) and the usual education of the Internet user.  They have never seen desktops, and the first and most popular application of them is one of the instant messengers.  Therefore, we seriously thought about the messenger-style interfaces.  And they tried to simplify them to the limit.  Everything in the prototype is built on ‚Äúsoft registrations‚Äù and gradual refinement of the data, if required by the user.  Here is an example: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/d2/59d5d2e84c8ee874894868.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/d2/59d5d2e85b725604641183.png"></div><br>  A serious drawback of the blockchain as the underlying technology is the impossibility of tracking the correctness of the execution of a contract by purely technical means.  We had to invent a new arbitration system.  The solution is as follows: <br><br>  1. Each user has a reputation (as Karma Habra): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/d2/59d5d2e87882b164915118.png"></div><br>  2. Users with a high reputation in the region and skills have the opportunity for a small part of the payment of the amount of the transaction to become judges in the dispute.  That is, when a contractor or customer suddenly decides that one of them is wrong, they can first exchange offers - they say (20% less payment - and forget it).  If after 3 sentences to and fro they did not agree, about a small percentage of the transaction amount to pay for ‚Äúarbitration‚Äù is withdrawn. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/d2/59d5d2e884979882708007.png"></div><br>  3. The arbitration is as follows: three random experts are appointed in this matter.  The higher the rating of the expert and the more often he agreed to judge - the higher the chance to choose him.  Then each of them determines the distribution of money between the parties - for example, they can decide that the shares will be 0/100, 40/100 and 90/100.  As a result, the performer will receive an average - in this case, about 40% of the payment (without taking into account the commission would be 43.3%). <br><br>  These two points - the smart contracts and the autodispatch system - form the basis of the system.  There are a lot of whistles and fakes around like auto-exchange of any payment to Kritotoken and back, moderation of drug trafficking by specialists within the system, and so on. <br><br>  But all this is a complete zero without the speed of distribution in the markets of Indonesia, India and the Philippines.  Most importantly, we received one more final step as a result of all this - the opportunity to give local people, in fact, options for their promotion in local markets.  This is the so-called bounty system, well known to those who follow the bitcointalk.  The story is very simple: if you do something for the project, you will get a token, the value of which directly depends on the success of the project.  That is, there will be a certain fixed price for the work - and a chance to hit the jackpot if the project shoots.  As practice shows, the second aspect allows you to work wonders in local markets.  Remember at least the speed of propagation of Uber - and after all, there was only a free trip through the referral code. <br><br>  In the end, it seems to me, the puzzle has developed.  Of course, I may be wrong and not see some obvious threat, but it seems to me that such a service is simply necessary.  If the details are interesting and you want to break my building to ashes - here is a bit more data: ( <a href="http://ico.unolabo.io/tpl/docs/WhitePaperUnlbTokenSale.pdf">WP</a> ). <br><br>  And the most important, of course, is the risks.  But about their analysis - a little later. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339380/</a></p>
