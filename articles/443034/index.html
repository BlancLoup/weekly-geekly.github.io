If we talk about Tesla, the official electro-gas stations are only in the United States, Europe and some other regions.  And in a number of countries there are 1-2 charging stations, which do not really fix the situation. <br><br>  The second problem is the low charge rate.  To get energy, which will be enough to overcome hundreds of kilometers, we had to wait several tens of minutes before.  Over time, this issue is resolved.  Especially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18253618/tesla-supercharger-250kw-v3-specs-location">Tesla tried</a> - its charging of the third generation can extend the range of an electric car for 120 km in just 5 minutes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tesla Inc for several months worked on improving charging, until it achieved the desired.  We are talking about charging stations Supercharger.  The new generation is able to replenish the battery capacity of an electric vehicle by 250 kW, which is enough for 120 meters of the way.

      Deployment of third-generation stations will not begin until April. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/c63/748/821c637486dc07a82a409c1ee0dd4fed.jpg"><br><br>  So far, only one such station officially operates, it was opened in Fremont (USA) for a limited group of Tesla electric vehicle owners who have the status of members of the early access program.  In April, a new firmware is released and the Supercharger 3 is being shared. Previously, people in the United States will be able to try out the new product.  At the end of the year Supercharger 3 will appear in Europe, as well as the Asia-Pacific region. <br><br>  According to company representatives, despite the accelerated pace of battery replenishment, new cables will become more flexible, so it will be more convenient to use them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F-SZ7FgK1KA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to representatives of the company, the third generation of charging significantly improves the capabilities of electric vehicles, especially if we consider what the second-generation charging stations offered.  However, they will also be updated in order to become more powerful. <br><br>  Unfortunately, only the owners of Tesla Model 3S electric vehicles will be able to take full advantage of the Supercharger 3, all thanks to the special chemical composition of the car batteries.  Well, Model S and Model X will work in the old mode, with a power limit of 120 kW.  In the next few months, the company plans to improve the situation, although representatives of Tesla and do not report how much power will increase after the update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53c/f9f/b00/53cf9fb000b75189d76de1f8b753644c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the new generation of charging stations, the company also <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/287280-teslas-quarter-megawatt-supercharger-v3-enables-fasts-model-3-pit-stops">introduces a</a> new feature that allows you to warm up the batteries when approaching charging stations.  According to experts, this step makes it possible to reduce the average charging time by 25%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/931/0ba/d2a/9310bad2a54aa9d97ff94fcf5ba73c36.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, Supercharger solves another electric car problem.  Namely - in the usual situation when several electric vehicles are connected to the same gas station, its power may fall.  This does not always happen, but it happens.  Supercharger does not change the characteristics of the supplied current when connecting multiple machines.  Moreover, the company changes the built-in heat removal system using a liquid refrigerant.  He simply does not allow stations to overheat and work in a freelance mode. <br><br>  Ilon Mask promised to increase coverage of Europe with a network of charging stations by 100% already this year.  The head of Tesla Inc <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434592/">said</a> that the Supercharger network, which allows you to charge an electric car battery by 80% in 40 minutes, will soon be deployed ‚Äúfrom Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey.‚Äù  Due to this, according to the entrepreneur, almost all owners of Tesla electric vehicles will receive similar stations in their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence. <br><br>  In principle, the entrepreneur gradually fulfills his promises.  The only thing - there is a backlog from the schedule, and it is quite noticeable.  For example, in 2018, the number of charging stations was supposed to reach a level of 18,000. But at the end of December 2018, this figure was only 11,853. Nevertheless, the number of electro-gas stations is steadily increasing.  By 2020, the entrepreneur promised the appearance of stations in Africa, although it is unclear how much. <br><br>  In general, gradually the problems with charging electric vehicles are solved - as the vehicles that run on electricity themselves become larger, the number of electric fuel stations for them increases.  This concerns not only Tesla, but also charging stations from other manufacturers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443034/</a></p>
