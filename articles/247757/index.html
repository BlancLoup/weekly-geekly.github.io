  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to promote your business in 2015 with maximum efficiency? 10 marketing predictions you should know about</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c28/dce/96b/c28dce96bd9a4d14bf776882e794289e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2015 promises to be interesting for entrepreneurs.  Based on many years of experience and all the changes that have been observed in recent years, we can confidently say one thing: in the new year, big changes await us. <br>  Those who think about the strategy of effectively promoting their business on the market should read the article before making plans.  Information is known to be the main weapon, including in the marketing struggle for a place in the sun.  For you - a few secrets about how things will be in this area in the new year.  And also - a few tips, following which you get a chance to beat the competition.  So, <b>10 marketing predictions for 2015 from Neil Patel</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Prediction number 1.</b>  <b>Links in guest posts will lose effectiveness</b> <br><br>  If you develop an SEO business, you probably regularly post guest posts to increase the volume of external links.  Why?  Because it is the most effective method of promotion. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And even despite the warnings of the search engines, you continue to engage in guest posting, inspired by the results, proving that this tactic works.  However, it should be remembered that large companies, such as Google, take time to analyze and improve the search algorithm.  That is, sooner or later, search engines will taste your trick. <br><br>  Over the next 12 months, Google will update the algorithms, with the result that most of the links posted in guest posts will depreciate.  This does not mean that your site will be completely excluded from search engines (provided that anchor links are used wisely), but these links will no longer help you in raising the ranking and promoting your resource. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 2.</b>  <b>Website optimization will be even more challenging</b> <br><br>  Everyone remembers how much noise in the SEO sphere Google has done (Panda and Penguin) a few years ago.  However, Google didn‚Äôt stop there, the algorithms are being updated, the only question is what the new brainchild will be called to, which will further toughen the principles of ranking sites. <br><br>  Do not rush to panic.  While Google is working on updating the algorithms, start working on the quality of the content - improve your website, focus on creating a better product, think like a marketer, and not as an SEO optimizer. <br><br>  Does this mean that optimization can be completely abandoned?  Definitely not.  Just the opposite: it's time to pay special attention to website optimization now that most competitors start investing in contextual advertising, instead of bringing SEO to mind. <br><br>  <b>Prediction number 3.</b>  <b>Linkbuilding: old school at the peak of popularity</b> <br><br>  Manual formation of reference mass when working with thousands of sites is not the newest methods.  Such link building is a good old old school, effective, like many years ago, again at the peak of popularity.  Why?  Because these links need to be earned and difficult to manipulate. <br><br>  In 2014, it was possible to observe several companies that created special teams specializing specifically in link building according to the methods of the old school.  In 2015, even more firms will pick up the trend. <br><br>  <b>Prediction ‚Ññ4.</b>  <b>Promotion in social networks will be the main method of promoting blogs</b> <br><br>  Have you ever wondered why some blogs are more popular than others?  Of course, to some extent this is directly influenced by the content - the subject matter, the content, however, in the end, the blog‚Äôs popularity comes down to its promotion in social networks. <br><br>  For example, the number of visitors to a personal blog maintained by NEIL PATEL already reaches 25,000 people per month.  And not at all because the material posted on this blog is somehow better than similar resources, the matter is only in active follow-up - readers share my articles on personal pages in social networks, and then comments, likes and reposts do their work.  By the same principle, you can promote almost any newly created blog of similar subject matter. <br><br>  Very soon, this trend will be appreciated by large companies and will begin to invest huge amounts of money every month in the creation and promotion of accounts in social networks. <br><br>  <b>Prediction ‚Ññ5.</b>  <b>Creative approach will be the basis of marketing</b> <br><br>  Since traditional promotion channels, such as SEO-optimization, contextual advertising and promotion in social networks, will gain momentum, companies will look for an original approach to the presentation of the material. <br>  For example, a successful entrepreneur and marketing guru, Gary Vaynerchuk, posted an ad for his new book all over New York, pointing out the real number of his phone number on posters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbf/7a0/3fb/cbf7a03fb45c4acbbb241f7794c85cfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The action was so successful that Gary's phone was torn from calls, and sales increased several times. <br><br>  Creative marketing does not always guarantee maximum profit and sales soar.  But, as they say, if you don‚Äôt try, you don‚Äôt know, and in 2015 more and more companies will take such a risk, attracting potential customers through original advertising campaigns. <br><br>  Continuation - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/witget/blog/247761/">follows</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247757/</a></p>
