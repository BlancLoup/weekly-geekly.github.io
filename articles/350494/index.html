  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An overview of audience building tools in mobile retargeting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The effectiveness of any retargeting campaign depends largely on the correct segmentation of the audience.  Selection of segments and careful processing of data about users gives you the opportunity to work with each of them separately.  This is unique, because each user sees personal banners, goods in which they are interested.  This approach increases the conversion of a mobile application an unlimited number of times. <br><br>  In the article, on behalf of <a href="http://getloyal.ru/">Getloyal's</a> automated retargeting system for mobile applications, we will look at and compare tools such as AppsFlyer Audiences and Adjust Audience Builder.  If you use the services of these trackers, then additional integration is not needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/b0/6b/smb06bgba0e5ha1s_idtujqhy9c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before proceeding to audience segmentation, some issues need to be addressed.  First, decide how to choose the right <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobio/blog/344528/">audience for retargeting</a> .  Secondly, what tools to choose to quickly create a list of the audience on the parameters that interest you.  Today, many advertising platforms allow you to quickly and easily work with the audience, allow you to download the necessary segments and target specific users.

    <h2>  Adjust Audience Builder </h2><br>  The tracker that allows you to work effectively with dynamic audience segments is the <a href="https://www.adjust.com/adjust-audience-builder/">Adjust Audience Builder</a> .  When creating audiences, you can highlight a variety of conditions for targeting, for example: you can make segments by Ad ID and push token, by device type, country, mobile application installation date, last attribution session, event and so on.  In addition, it is possible to apply different types of use of conditions, such as: include, exclude, less than, fewer / more than. <br><br>  Suppose you selected ‚Äúrevenue event include 14‚Äù, then only users who have made exactly 14 orders will get to the audience. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the Adjust Audience Builder automatically updates the lists of audiences.  At the moment there is an opportunity to automatically push the audience on Facebook, after which the Adjust client has the opportunity to launch a campaign targeting the created audience. <br><br>  Adjust also allows you to create a URL by referring to which the client can download the list of users in the form of a .CSV file.  You can manually download the .csv file to any site or send a link to the retargeting partner file. <br><br>  To work with partners, Adjust also provides an opportunity to split 1 audience into 2 or more, which allows you to parallelize the process of working with partners or, for example, conduct A / B testing. <br><br><h4>  Results: </h4><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  You can customize clear segments for in-app events and time periods; </li><li>  Audiences are automatically updated; </li><li>  Does not require additional integration; </li><li>  The ability to transmit to the audience partners in the form of a ready list </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Integrated with Facebook only; </li><li>  The tool is paid; </li><li>  We need our own resources to launch campaigns. </li></ul><br><h2>  Appsflyer Audiences </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/ru/product/audiences/">Audiences</a> tool provides a functional solution for user segmentation.  You can create audiences based on any events in the application, which are registered in AppsFlyer, event attributes (product type, material, category, etc.), as well as a segment of users who deleted the application (for iOS). <br><br>  You can use different filters by period.  For example: users who put the product in the cart in the last 7 days, but did not buy it.  Or users who installed the app made a purchase but deleted the app for some reason. <br><br>  The period for which the user performed or did not perform the action cannot be chosen arbitrarily, there are strictly fixed values ‚Äã‚Äã(1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 360 days).  You can choose the number of committed actions, for example, bought 5 times in the last 14 days. <br><br>  Audience AppsFlyer integrated with advertising platforms: Facebook, Yahoo, Gemini, Twitter, Inmobi.  In Audiences, you need to perform the setup once, after which the user data will be synchronized with the selected sources and updated automatically. <br><br><h4>  Results: </h4><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  You can configure clear segments for in-app events, event attributes, and time periods; </li><li>  Integrated with popular advertising sites; </li><li>  Audiences are automatically updated; </li><li>  Does not require additional integration. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The tool is paid; </li><li>  We need our own resources to launch campaigns. </li></ul><br>  There are a lot of options to customize audience segments.  It all depends on the specific business, monetization, user base and event tracking.  For long-term work, you will have to constantly update segments (at least once a day) in advertising offices and support advertising campaigns. <br><br><h2>  Getloyal </h2><br>  To optimize the process, you can use the <a href="http://getloyal.ru/">Getloyal</a> automated retargeting <a href="http://getloyal.ru/">system</a> , which will do everything for you.
