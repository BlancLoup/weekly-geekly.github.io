May all your dreams be fulfilled, and the results of your work be translated into the most fantastic new achievements.  Interesting projects, high-quality code, reliable sites and high-tech services.  Let any work bring pleasure and there will be enough time for happiness and comfort in the family circle. <br><br> <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/uploads/images/00/00/01/2014/12/30/24944a.jpg" title="Happy new year, InfoboxCloud" alt="Happy new year, InfoboxCloud" width="600"></a> <br>  Under the cut a brief summary of the year in InfoboxCloud. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Let's sum up 2014</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Regions InfoboxCloud</b> </h5><br>  In the past year, in addition to our own data center in St. Petersburg, we launched new regions in <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/corpnews/45.html">Krasnoyarsk</a> , <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/iaas/115.html">Amsterdam</a> , and <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/corpnews/54.html">Moscow</a> . <br><br>  The data center in Moscow received <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/148.html">the Tier III Operational reliability certificate</a> in addition to Tier III Design and Facility, becoming the most reliable data center in continental Europe and the only one in Russia with all Tier III certificates.  This allowed the use of <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/">InfoboxCloud</a> for the most critical corporate projects and at the same time posting data on the territory of Russia.

      The European InfoboxCloud region in Amsterdam allowed to host international projects targeted at users from all over the world thanks to the excellent connectivity of the data center network with other regions. <br><br><h5>  <b>Reliability and performance</b> </h5><br>  In InfoboxCloud in Moscow and Amsterdam, we switched to using the fault-tolerant distributed storage system Cloud Storage, thanks to which we were able to activate multiple replication of virtual machines.  Failure of a physical cloud server does not lead to data loss or service stop.  This has become a significant advantage of the cloud over dedicated servers (dediki) and other clouds. <br><br><img src="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/uploads/images/00/00/01/2014/12/30/03997b.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  For all users, we activated <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/iaas/203.html">Enterprise SSD ‚Äì caching in the cloud</a> based on PCI ‚Äì Express SSD and SSD DataCenter, which allowed us to obtain the highest performance of the cloud subsystem of cloud servers and successfully compete with SSD servers of leading global cloud providers, while maintaining affordable prices. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, we updated the core of the network, which significantly increased the availability of all services and the speed of the network.  This had a positive effect on <a href="http://infobox.ru/hosting/linux/">hosting</a> and <a href="http://infobox.ru/vps/linux/">VPS</a> .  We continue to improve the main services, increase their performance and reliability of key <a href="http://infobox.ru/">Infobox</a> services. <br><br><h5>  <b>Be simpler, focus on the main thing</b> </h5><br>  This year, we have significantly simplified the control panel of our services.  This is just the beginning. <br><br>  We abandoned non-core services and focused on the main thing. <br><br>  Significantly changed the working principles of technical support and optimized it, which made it possible to respond better to user requests.  The main method of contacting technical support was the creation of an authorized ticket from the control panel, which allowed the request to pass faster through responsible specialists and receive a quality response.  Surely you have met with the fact that the user calls for support or writes to the chat of another company and receives ‚Äúreplies‚Äù simply because the first line of support does not know the answer or does not solve problems, but only accepts applications.  Ticket is better because the user does not need to wait on the line: the ticket will quickly reach the ‚Äú80th level networker‚Äù, ‚Äúvirtualizer‚Äù or vendor, and the issue will be resolved.  We have implemented many other processes that improve the quality of support and will continue to work on improving it. <br><br>  And of course, the magic address of <a href="">feedback@infobox.ru</a> , which is read by the heads of departments and the management of the company, allows you to tell us how to become even better. <br><br><h5>  <b>Our users</b> </h5><br>  Thanks to the changes, the growth of the user base this year was just fantastic.  We barely had time to add new equipment to our services.  <a href="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/blog/corpnews/211.html">More than 15 thousand cloud servers created in InfoboxCloud</a> .  Almost a third of this amount was created in the last 2 months. <br><br><img src="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/uploads/images/00/00/01/2014/12/30/a78447.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  Big clients are appearing, consuming more than a hundred regular customers.  It inspires and allows us to do more for our clients, to work not only for money but also for the idea: to make the best corporate-level service at affordable prices, in which your data cannot be read or analyzed.  A service in which the engineers are your friends and helpers, and there are no indifferent ones.  A service that helps you earn and do more using the most modern technologies. <br><br><h5>  <b>Prices remain the same!</b> </h5><br>  The dollar and the euro is growing.  We accept payment in rubles and receive a salary in rubles.  We understand you!  Therefore, we decided not to raise the price of the <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/">InfoboxCloud cloud</a> due to the December exchange rate fluctuations.  We will work even more efficiently and keep prices the same.  You can always be sure that our services are worth as much as they should, without super-profits.  And, of course, come to us from foreign services :) We are more accessible and more profitable! <br><br> <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/uploads/images/00/00/01/2014/12/30/2ebf07.jpg" width="400"></a> <br><br><h4>  <b>2015</b> </h4><br>  In the new year we will become even more accessible from different regions, strengthen key services and continue the rapid development.  We have a lot of ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù Planned, but let's leave it for the new year.  Our main happiness is happy users.  Therefore, we wish you a lot of happiness and we will strive to achieve this main goal. <br><br>  Happy New Year! <br><br>  Always yours, <br>  Team InfoboxCloud! <br> <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://infoboxcloud.ru/community/uploads/images/00/00/01/2014/12/30/458d93.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247113/</a></p>
