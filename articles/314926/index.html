Company: Sberbank. </h3><br>  <b>Industry:</b> banks. <br><br>  Sberbank uses big data and machine learning in many areas, including credit scoring.  To solve this problem, the company uses not only traditional data, such as socio-demographic parameters, credit history, transaction history, financial statements, but also a number of others.  For credit scoring, Sberbank also uses customer relationship graphs based on remittance data and social network data.  For credit scoring companies use news texts with their mention, for which an automatic analysis of tonality is carried out.  In 2015, the company added cellular data to the models, which made it possible to improve the quality of the classifier by 7 percentage points.  by the Gini coefficient.  A large number of active SIM cards and a small time of their work, small and numerous replenishment of accounts, suspicious geography of calls indicate fraud and reduce the likelihood of approval of the loan application.  For retail customers, the use of machine learning algorithms has improved the quality of scoring models by 4 percentage points.  according to the Gini coefficient due to a more accurate selection of factors. <br><br>  <b>The result: a</b> constant increase in the quality of scoring models, including due to the latest innovations. <br><br><h3>  2. Company: Union Pacific Railroad </h3><br>  <b>Branch:</b> transport. <br><br>  Union Pacific Railroad is the largest US railway company, has more than 8,000 locomotives, and owns the largest US rail network.  Thermometers, acoustic and visual sensors and other sensors were installed at the bottom of each company.  Data from them is transmitted to the processing center via fiber optic cables stretched along the railway network.  The processing center also receives data on weather conditions, data on the status of braking and other systems, GPS-coordinates of trains.  The collected data and predictive models built on them allow you to track the condition of wheels and railroad tracks and predict the collapse of trains from rails a few days or even weeks before a possible incident.  This time is enough to quickly fix problems, avoid damage to the train and delay other trains. <br><br>  <b>Result: the</b> company managed to reduce the number of train convergences from the rails by 75% and to avoid significant losses (previously, losses from one derailment could reach $ 40 million). <br><br><h3>  3. Company: Los Angeles Police Department. </h3><br>  <b>Industry:</b> public sector - police. <br><br>  Using solutions developed by <a href="http://www.predpol.com/">PredPol</a> , Los Angeles police were able to get the most likely time and areas (with high accuracy, about 50 sq. M) of various types of crimes and send additional police forces there to prevent them.  The system uses historical data on time, type and region of crimes, processes them using clustering algorithms in space and time.  Predictive modeling is carried out using mathematical models of point processes ( <a href="http://math.scu.edu/~gmohler/crime3.pdf">Self-Exciting Point Process Modeling</a> ).  No personal data of people in the city and information about their whereabouts is used, which allows them to observe the privacy requirements of private life.  Reducing the number of crimes has led to a reduction in costs in the police, the judicial system and the system of execution of sentences. <br><br>  <b>The result: a</b> reduction in the number of thefts by 33%, a decrease in the number of violent crimes by 21%. <br><br><h3>  4. Company: Entro.py. </h3><br>  <b>Industry:</b> building management. <br><br>  St.  Vincent's is a large Australian network of public and private clinics located primarily in Sydney and Melbourne.
