      how will the silent effect be achieved you ask ... <br>  I will answer.  making the most of the components that can be cooled in a passive mode.  we will not consider a super fancy gaming station.  Computer configuration is the most usual - home ... even slightly outdated already ... but what to do - money for a total upgrade is not yet foreseen - then we will work with what we have. <br>  but there is actually this: <br>  R4 1700 MHz in 478 socket ... <br>  the video card was immediately taken with passive cooling - the FX5200 is why the question is removed from it) <br>  power supply old with 8cm fan - definitely change ... <br>  IDE screw seal barracuda 250GB 7200 - infection is also noisy ... <br>  That seems to be all critical in terms of noise ... <br><br>  so the first step. <br>  buying a cooler for the processor.  the cooler is needed so that it can cool the old 478 socket chute (first releases even without NT) in the passive mode.  that is, purely one radiator - without a fan. <br>  after a long search in the internet, I stopped at this model: <br><br><img src="http://www.scythe-eu.com/fileadmin/images/cpu/mugen/Mugen-package.jpg"><br><br>  Scythe Mugen SCINF-1000 <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scythe-eu.com/ru/produkty/cpu-kulery/mugen.html">www.scythe-eu.com/en/produkty/cpu-kulery/mugen.html</a> <br><br>  the advantages of this model, which the competitors did not have: <br>  1. (and the main thing for me now) - almost all sockets are supported <br>  Intel: <br>  socket 478 all frequencies <br>  socket T / (LGA) 775 all frequencies <br>  AMD: <br>  socket 754 all frequencies <br>  socket 939 all frequencies <br>  socket AM2 all frequencies <br>  socket 940 all frequencies <br>  since now I need to cool the processor in 478 socket, and in the future I plan to upgrade to 775 - this feature is very important. <br>  2. sizes.  for example, the 2-fan model Cooler Master Gemini II would most likely not fit into my case ... and if it did, access to all the hardware would be difficult ... and here everything is fairly standard and compact. <br>  3. availability - I just wanted to go to the store and buy it - and not to order and wait two months later)) ... <br><br>  all this determined the choice.  and I will say straight away - I am not disappointed in him. <br>  This model comes with a 12cm fan.  but on the site I found links to independent reviews, which stated that even the previous model of the Scythe Ninja line was designed to work in passive mode.  so this cooler, I think in the passive should cool at least as good ..)) <br><br>  mount the cooler for the 478 socket is very convenient.  It seemed to me even more convenient than mounting a regular cooler from P4.  however, the power supply for easy installation, I had to remove all the same.  One more detail - when I first installed it, I forgot to tear off the protective film from the copper base of the radiator ... as it happened, I can‚Äôt even remember now ..)) I remember well that I was looking at this film with the inscription REMOVE BEFORE USE and thought - it is necessary to tear it off !. and did not tear it off ...) <br>  in the end, I had a few unpleasant moments when the processor started to heat up to 84C at the slightest load ... I even thought that the radiator did not pull without a fan ... but then it turned out ...) removed the film and now the CPU temperature is absolutely normal - from 26C 48 depending on the load ... in a closed case and without a fan. <br><br>  The first impression is of course strong ..)) <br>  At first, I didn‚Äôt even understand if the computer started ... for so many years with a computer ... when you press the POWER button, you subconsciously already wait for the sound of the unwinding cooler and the noisy air ... but here it isn‚Äôt ... of course, after a while the hearing was adapted ... and I began to hear the fan from the PSU and buzzing screw ..)) <br>  but as they say - this is another story altogether ..)) <br><br>  ps  I just changed the power supply to a modern one with a 12cm fan installed on the bottom wall (and not the back as on older models) - it turned out just above the processor radiator ... in this way - it performs 2 functions at once, cooling it too ... <br>  now I only have 1 fan per 12 cm and noise in my case <br>  from a working computer has become much less. <br><br>  ppt  Already started to think about the Scythe Quiet Drive SQD-1000 HDD Noiseless Case for screw‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19807/</a></p>
