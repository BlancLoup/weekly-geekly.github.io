It was first shown on YouTube in early March.  Christopher Lloyd, Moby, Tony Hawk, and a few other Hollywood stars appeared among the celebrities who participated in the shooting.

      The video caused an explosive wave of discussions on the Web, dividing the viewers into 2 camps - those who believed and skeptics.  The site of the company, which was preparing to release a flying skateboard, explained its properties as ‚Äúthe science of materials, electricity and magnetism, as well as scientists who managed to solve and solve the problems of antigravity‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4vE_vpkr90%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhPOTW9pVjQIr-gPCcU3oK-NekCRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Most of the publications ( <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Fcl4url%3Dwww.lookatme.ru%252Fmag%252Flive%252Fexperience-news%252F201403-real-hoverboard%26lr%3D213%26text%3DHuvr">but not in Russia</a> ) were immediately recognized by the HUVr fake.  It only remained to understand who was behind this action. <br><br>  Thanks to a <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache:laurenbiedenharn.4ormat.com/11872-resume">summary of</a> one of the project participants posted on the network, it turned out that behind the HUVr project was the " <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/huvr_tech">Funny or Die</a> " team, which specializes in capturing parody video sketches. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://huvrtech.com/about.html">http://huvrtech.com/</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Fake - Miracle Machine</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02a/fe3/a95/02afe3a95ad94cd14392e73ef9f98556.jpg"><br><br>  The name is fully consistent with the action produced - the machine turns water into wine.  For the performance of divine functions, you need an iPhone application and a special bottle (it has a heater, temperature monitor, mixer, computer to control all this and Bluetooth) - in the application you choose which wine you want to prepare, it tells you which ingredients to put in the vessel , and further on Bluetooth controls cooking.  It should take three days or so.  Price Miracle Machine was supposed to be about 499 dollars. <br><br>  Recently it turned out that in fact the gadget does not exist, and the project was launched as part of a PR campaign to promote the charity organization ‚ÄúWine to Water‚Äù, whose goal is to provide clean water to people in need around the world.  On the "duck" were led by the mass of domestic media (for example, <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D1364541">Vesti.ru</a> ), including the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215241/">post on Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  Original video of the project: <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/87328466&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhiN0wDhG_RSphK39mNNU6HEHDyVg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="The miracle machine" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video exposing: <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/88846743&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgvp9TNbbu9-fofJUBs81VHxHvd0w" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="The true miracle" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Website: <a href="http://themiraclemachine.net/">http://themiraclemachine.net/</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>Moov Sport Tracker</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/038/2f0/1bd/0382f01bd126594abf3685dc46f064d9.png"><br><br>  In the incredibly competitive market of fitness trackers (and Madrobots estimates there are about 50 different fitness trackers), another new product has been announced. <br><br>  True, the guys from the team Mushroom Labs offer not only the functionality of a fitness tracker, but also a unique approach.  Moov uses artificial intelligence to study the user and provides real-time coaching during training. <br><br>  The gadget has a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer.  When the device is paired with the Moov app, users can receive training tips.  The application in real time will display information about how well the user has done this or that exercise. <br><br>  Based on biomechanics and sports science data from Harvard and Stanford, Moov will provide users with real-time audio and visual instructions on how their workouts can be improved.  The goal of the tracker is to increase the effectiveness of training, while reducing the likelihood of injury due to poor technology. <br><br>  Moov can be pre-ordered on the developers site for $ 69.95.  Delivery promise in the fall of 2014. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExhD6UWEV8I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhyUnUsCPUKprs13SUsiTCkOadxsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Website: <a href="http://preorder.moov.cc/">http://preorder.moov.cc/</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>Healbe Gobe Tracker</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96a/7e3/fba/96a7e3fbadc8167b876b560ff9095af7.jpg"><br><br>  The sensor of Russian developers allows us to estimate the number of calories that the user has received along with food, as well as to estimate the number of calories that the user has spent on ensuring the functioning of the body and physical activity. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zCiXUajPTog%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh1b3LHXefdHhtFwQPsWwKWcmXihw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a result, the user can determine at any time whether he is gaining weight, losing weight or maintaining a stable body weight.  Data from the sensor is transmitted to the user's mobile device and to the cloud service, at any time the user can see the current balance, and data for the time period, including detail on whether it consumes more fat or carbohydrates, exercise intensity, pulse and respiration . <br><br>  For an additional fee, the user can choose for himself the services of a personal trainer, a personal nutritionist, the selection of menus and products. <br><br>  The battery life of the tracker will be approximately three days. <br><br>  The Western media project was delighted that our compatriots offered the world's first fitness tracker, which does all the work for the user.  All that remains for the user is to enter the application from time to time and watch the statistics. <br><br>  The tracker is based on non-invasive glucometer technology, in more detail about the history of technology development can be read on <a href="http://rbcdaily.ru/business/562949990898742">RBC Daily.</a>  About the development team is still very little known.  On March 18, a <a href="http://roem.ru/2014/03/18/gobe94828/">short interview with Artem Shipitsyn was</a> published <a href="http://roem.ru/2014/03/18/gobe94828/">on Roem.ru.</a> <br><br>  According to <a href="https://angel.co/healbe">the Angel List service</a> , in December 2012, the Healbe project was launched.  He attracted $ 550,000 from investors and disappeared for almost two years.  On March 5, the Healbe team launched a crowdfunding <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/healbe-gobe-the-only-way-to-automatically-measure-calorie-intake">campaign on Indiegogo</a> and in the first 2 weeks raised almost $ 700,000. Preorders for $ 125 were quickly bought out and now there is an opportunity to pre-order Healbe for $ 199. <br><br>  We at Madrobots can agree with the development team about a fixed price for Habr users at 6,000 rubles for the Healbe tracker.  In order to understand how interesting this can be, a poll is posted at the bottom of the digest, where you can share your opinion. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://healbe.ru/">http://healbe.ru/</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>The concept of smart watches from the designer Gabor Balog</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24b/ef8/142/24bef8142034899ec574d0fb76d0e92c.jpg"><br><br>  Smart watches do not have to be scary, says a designer from Hungary, they can be beautiful and functional.  When connecting to a smartphone, they can display various information important to the user, without interfering with the voice interface, touchscreen, or extra buttons - all control goes through the standard crown for all watches and the swivel bezel. <br><br><h4>  <b>Glasses Pupil</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d55/347/7d8/d553477d8a64111651d8b7a06221d57d.jpg"><br><br>  Kopin has introduced a new wearable gadget - Pupil, a combination of microdisplay and voice control, which the company hopes will be used to create a wearable display (HUD) like Google Glass.  In reference design, the company shows how wearable computers can be integrated into products that are more familiar to consumers.  While Pupil is not too suitable for use, but in general they are intended to show the fruits of the partnership with Olympus in the field of displays and technology capabilities. <br><br>  With Pupil, developers want to show how small displays can fit in ordinary fashion glasses without turning you into cyborg and without causing suspicious looks.  The main part of the new design is a tiny projector, which is located above the right lens and "shows" a small screen above the line of sight.  Its resolution is 428x240 and, unlike Google Glass, it does not need to be transparent, since it is built into the frame.  The glasses contain an I / O system, and this is the second part of the Kopin project - microphones and speakers.  Two speakers are located in the arms above the ears, the microphones are only in the right - the company has developed a noise reduction system that allows you to fully control the system using voice, even in noisy environments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7M-1BAr47U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiMmiyst84py_f9umna5Ovsugf9kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Review in English: <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/kopin-pupil-hands-on-glass-tech-without-geek-looks-19317484/">http://www.slashgear.com/</a> <br><br><h4>  <b>Lumus glasses</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/beb/07b/d3c/beb07bd3c4acfaf90f6fbc425917a2f9.jpg"><br><br>  Another points from the leader of the military head displays.  A thin lens and a projector create a super-high-quality image by today's standards, and the system itself can be attached to any frame.  The picture points are obtained from the smartphone, the system itself works on Android and it has a built-in camera, so that it can understand hand gestures.  The video is not yet played, but the developers hope to resolve this issue as well. <br><br>  Points so far only a prototype and the company Lumus is not going to put them on sale, however, it assumes to license the technology for the production of the gadget by other major manufacturers.  For example, the company Meta already uses them to release their points. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.lumus-optical.com/">http://www.lumus-optical.com/</a> <br><br>  All comments on the format and design, write to the comments and email info@madrobots.ru <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216297/</a></p>
