      Roskomnadzor, carrying out inspections, primarily controls the implementation of the provisions of the law from a legal point of view, and not the technical part.

Recommendations on the formation of requirements for the NW PD. <br>  2.1.  Terms of Reference for the creation of SZ PDN should display the necessary set of requirements, formed taking into account [6] and [7], including: <br>  - determination of the required level of personal data protection processed in the MI information systems (hereinafter - the classification of the information system); <br>  - identification of information security threats, the implementation of which may lead to the violation of information security in the information system, and the development on their basis of a model of information security threats; <br>  - Determination of requirements for NW PD. <br>  3. Recommendations for the development (design) of NW PD. <br>  3.1.  When designing NW PDN, the following activities should be performed: <br>  - types of subjects of access (users, processes and other subjects of access) and objects of access, which are objects of protection (devices, filesystem objects, launched and executable modules, objects of database management system, objects created by application software, other objects of access) ; <br>  - defined access control methods (discretionary, mandatory, role-playing or other methods), access types (read, write, execute, or other types of access) and rules for delimiting the access of subjects of access to access objects (based on lists, security labels, roles and other rules ), subject to implementation in the information system; <br>  - selected measures to protect information to be implemented in the system of information security information system; <br>  - the types and types of information security tools are identified that ensure the implementation of technical measures to protect information; <br>  - the structure of the NW PDS was determined, including the composition (quantity) and location of its elements; <br>  - selection of information security tools certified for compliance with information security requirements, taking into account their cost, compatibility with information technologies and hardware, security functions of these tools and their implementation features, as well as the level of information system security; <br>  - software settings are defined, including software for information security tools, ensuring the implementation of information protection measures, as well as the elimination of possible information system vulnerabilities leading to information security threats; <br>  - the measures of information protection are defined for information interaction with other information systems and information and telecommunication networks, including information systems of an authorized person, as well as when using computing resources (capacities) provided by an authorized person for information processing. <br>  3.2.  The results of the NW PDS design should be displayed in the project documentation (draft (technical) project and (or) in the working documentation)) on the NW PD, developed taking into account [8]. <br>  Project documentation should contain including: <br>  - analysis of information processing in the designed system; <br>  - descriptions of information flows and the network structure of the object; <br>  - analysis of information resources requiring protection.  Lists of protected information; <br>  - model of information security threats; <br>  - classification of the designed system according to the information security requirements <br>  - list of information security requirements for objects of protection of the designed system <br>  - description of technical solutions for the implementation of information security subsystems (subsystem of protection against unauthorized access, subsystem of antivirus protection, subsystem of cryptographic protection, subsystem of firewall, security analysis subsystem, backup subsystem, intrusion detection subsystem); <br>  - consolidated list of information security tools <br>  - a complex of organizational measures, with an indication of the list of necessary organizational and administrative documentation (PSA); <br>  - set of templates ORD. <br>  3.3.  When designing the NW PD, the operational documentation for the information protection system of the information system should be developed taking into account [7], [8] and [9] and should, among other things, contain a description: <br>  - the structure of the information security system information system; <br>  - composition, installation sites, parameters and order of setting the means of information protection, software and hardware; <br>  - rules of operation of the information system information protection system. <br>  4.

Recommendations for the conduct of conformity assessment (attestation) of ISPDN and putting it into operation <br>  5.1.  Conformity assessment (certification) ISPD should be carried out in accordance with the program and methods of certification tests prior to the processing of information to be protected in the information system. <br>  According to the results of certification tests, protocols of certification tests are drawn up, a conclusion on the conformity of ISPDn information protection requirements and a conformity assessment (certificate of conformity) in case of positive results of certification tests. <br>  Re-assessment of conformity (certification) of ISPDn should be carried out in case of expiry of the validity of the certificate of conformity or increase of the level of personal data protection processed in the information systems of MO.  When increasing the number of threats to the security of information or changes in design solutions implemented when creating a NW PD, additional tests should be conducted as part of the current conformity assessment (certificate of conformity). <br>  5.2.  The introduction of ISPDN should be carried out in accordance with [9] and the legislation of the Russian Federation on information, information technologies and information protection and taking into account conformity assessment (certificate of conformity). <br>  6. Recommendations for ensuring the protection of information during the operation of ISPDN. <br>  6.1 Ensuring the protection of information during the operation of an ISPD should be carried out by the operator in accordance with the operational documentation on the NW PD and the organizational and administrative documents on the protection of information, including including: <br>  - management (administration) of the information system information protection system; <br>  - identification of incidents and response to them; <br>  - configuration management of certified information system and its information security system; <br>  - control (monitoring) of ensuring the level of security of information contained in the information system. <br>  7. Recommendations for ensuring the protection of information when withdrawing from an ISPD operation, or after we have made a decision about the end of information processing <br>  7.1.  The protection of information during the decommissioning of the ISPD or after the decision to complete the processing of information must be carried out by the operator in accordance with the operational documentation on the NW PD and organizational and administrative documents on the protection of information, including including: <br>  - archiving the information contained in the information system; <br>  - destruction (erasure) of data and residual information from computer storage media and (or) destruction of computer storage media. <br><br></div></div><br><h3>  Some technical stuff </h3><br>  Currently, medical and preventive treatment facilities (MPI) use the Unified State Health Information System (EGISZ).  Each health care facility has its own database, it is synchronized with a common database located in the data center (MIAC).  All this happens through the channels protected by PAK ViPNet.  PAK ViPNet were distributed throughout the Russian Federation to organize connection to this system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/5h/w6/0d5hw6k3v8-wkz42dauxnrqb7ji.png"><br><br>  Many details can be found at <a href="http://portal.egisz.rosminzdrav.ru/materials">portal.egisz.rosminzdrav.ru/materials</a> <br><br>  Summing up the results of the ‚Äúbasic informatization‚Äù, the former director of the IT department of the Ministry, Roman Ivakin, noted that it was possible to ensure ‚Äúa sufficiently high level of infrastructure development‚Äù. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAs for the connection of health facilities to the Internet, then, according to our data, this task is 100% completed at the level of legal entities.  Perhaps their local subdivisions, for example, FAPs (first-aid and obstetric points), remained partially uncovered.  But we should not forget that there are more than 40 thousand of such facilities, and the connection work actually began only in June 2012.  For comparison: it took about 1.5 years to connect 52 thousand schools to the network. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  However, even now, not everyone has managed to bring information systems of all subordinate institutions and even more so the information protection system into a uniform form.  Medical institutions can still meet the zoo of medical systems, including self-written software.  Requirements for the technical part largely depend on what level of personal data protection is determined for a specific SPD.  More information about the systems for processing personal data of a special category (information about the state of health), biometric PD, depersonalization, obtaining consent for processing and other features will be described in one of the following articles of our blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343588/</a></p>
