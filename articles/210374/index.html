  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employees of Google, Microsoft, Cisco and Apple went to Twitter, Box and Dropbox</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a0/9be/9d4/8a09be9d43609742bba4f6aa41d1c4ef.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Google, Microsoft, Cisco and Apple lost a significant number of employees in 2013, most of them went to work in start-ups;  These statistics became known from the recent Jobvite press release (a company that develops automation systems for recruitment), which is devoted to the current state of affairs in the industry.  From the document it became known that last year the technical giants lost their former attractiveness for many workers. <br><br>  It was found that Twitter is the biggest attraction for Google and Microsoft employees, Box and Dropbox come second in popularity among the same audience.  All three companies are already quite difficult to call the newly emerged startups, however, it is difficult to deny the presence of ‚Äúthe very‚Äù spirit in them.  But former employees of Apple left at once in small groups, and settled in Airbnb, Hulu, Nest, Spotify, Square, Uber and Yelp. <br><br>  Adam Hyder, CTO Jobvite, adds that ‚Äúnow applicants are not afraid to leave their warm places and go to fast-growing and potentially profitable start-ups, doing this in the hope that there they will be able to do work on something cool and new, and even and with better financial prospects.  Large companies are losing their attractiveness and the ‚Äúbranded‚Äù culture, while the developers do not want to engage in products that bring high income to the company, but are in a state of stagnation. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A major factor that influenced the movement of labor was the change of leaders at the head of companies.  Following the announcement of the departure of Steve Ballmer from Microsoft, the number of people who want to change jobs has increased by 46%.  At the same time, after the arrival of Marissa Mayer at Yahoo, the number of people willing to go to work in startups has decreased by 44%.

      By the way, serious migrations are also observed among workers in the financial, aerospace and defense industries - last year, Citigroup and Wells Fargo workers tried to settle in LinkedIn, Twitter, Gilt Groupe, LivingSocial, Workday, Square and Yelp.  Former employees of Boeing and Lockheed Martin also went in search of a better life to the company SpaceX. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBig companies must cultivate a culture of start-ups and offer their employees challenges that challenge them - otherwise, they will continue to lose their people.  The change of leadership and stagnation in the development of products also doesn‚Äôt lead to good - employees continue to leave, but start-ups, in turn, have a unique opportunity to hire the best of the best - those they couldn‚Äôt dream of before, ‚Äùsays Hyder. <br><br>  Jovbite is engaged in recruiting for 8 of the 11 top IT-companies, while passing through them to 25% of all personnel from the US market.  Therefore, thanks to access to resumes, job vacancies and statistics collected over the years, Jovbite, in its press releases, can afford to expect a relationship, for example, between education and employee experience, as well as assess the impact of other events on the labor market and evaluate industry trends. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dgce55_Mb4eY">"When Jobs was not like this"?</a>  ‚ÄúIf you want to hire the best, you must allow them to make decisions and base ideas on the company, not hierarchy.  Otherwise, the best people will not stay long with you ‚Äù(c) <br><br>  News source: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/24/twitter-box-dropbox-attracting-hordes-of-employees-away-from-tech-giants/">venturebeat.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210374/</a></p>
