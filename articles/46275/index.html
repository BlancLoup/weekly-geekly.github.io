  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pay without any extra movement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lecture by Yevgenia Zavalishina, General Director of <a href="http://money.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Money,</a> for students of the specialization <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/index.html">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù</a> .  The Yandex.Money payment system is one of the most common means of payment in runet.  Convenience in replenishing accounts, withdrawing money and making payments themselves has made many users of the network its customers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe concept of means of payment is closely related to the term‚Äú e-commerce ‚Äù- said Ms. Zavalishina at the beginning of the lecture.  ‚ÄúAt the same time, this term is rather philosophical, and in my opinion it is difficult to define it unequivocally.  But still - what is the ideal payment method? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So the ideal payment method is when the buyer wanted to buy a product or service and immediately bought it, without making any extra movements.  However, there are no ideal payment methods.  Each of them more or less fits a particular situation and may be more or less convenient for a particular case.  The first thing that comes to mind is that banks are the most convenient way to pay.  However, this is not relevant for Russia - because of its huge size and weak banking infrastructure (approximately 3.2 banking offices per 100 thousand people).  It would be possible to solve this problem by introducing Direct Debit systems, but in Russia it is difficult to do because of our legislation.  Sberbank was going to introduce such a system, but due to the crisis, this idea hung in the air. <br>  Before proceeding to the consideration of payment options, consider the concept of "payment".  The first association to this word is the transfer of money from hand to hand.  In fact, payments consist of a number of stages: the presentation of an invoice, the formation of an order, the authorization of a buyer, the transfer of funds, the formation of a reporting document, the reconciliation of a payment. <br>  Banks are not the only means of payment, and further Ms. Zavalishina listed other payment options. <br>  ‚ÄúI can list the following payment options: cash;  bank transfers;  electronic money;  bank cards;  prepaid cards and SMS.  But how many options are needed in reality?  What are the ways ecommerce is needed?  To choose, you need to answer a series of questions. <br>  It is necessary to determine the characteristics of the target buyer: whether he has a credit card, and where he is geographically;  whether it is a spontaneous purchase or a thoughtful payment;  estimate the urgency of the purchase and the expected number of purchases.  In addition, it is necessary to take into account the technological capabilities of your business, especially the organization of delivery, ordering, shipping and the presence of billing. ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, when listing the features of various payment options, Ms. Zavalishina paid more attention to electronic money.

      <br>
      ‚ÄúThe advantages of electronic money include the following: <br>  - Payment details are instantaneous. <br>  - It is convenient to pay, you can "not get up from the couch." <br>  - Delivery can take place through the ‚Äúsame channel‚Äù - that is, you buy goods using the Internet and receive it in the same way.  For example, music, content. <br>  - Can be used with minimal technological integration. <br>  - You can get a marketing bonus. <br><br>  But I know only one minus of electronic money - not everyone has them. ‚Äù <br>  Concluding the lecture, Ms. Zavalishina moved to a small offtopic, which she called "Mobile payments and legends about the fact that they exist." <br><br>  ‚ÄúPeople who talk about mobile payments in our country or abroad often mean and confuse three things.  Payments from the operator‚Äôs account.  For example, Beeline wallet.  It is expensive and difficult to manage risks.  Volumes for this type of payments are small.  Payments using mobile communication as a transport, as a method of communication.  Payments using a mobile phone as an electronic device, an analogue of a credit card.  That is, here the phone serves only to authenticate the user. " <br><br>  During the lecture, Ms. Zavalishina answered a number of questions. <br>  <b>- How long is the payment history?</b> <br>  - indefinitely.  The system has been functioning since the late 90s and we have data stored even from that time. <br><br>  <b>- If as a result of a phishing attack the user stole money, do you return them?</b> <br>  - We try to block cases of using stolen passwords and are quite successful in this.  However, if a theft occurred and we cannot detect the thief, we simply cannot return the money - it is impossible to prove that the user did not make the payment. <br><br>  - <b>Do you struggle with phishing?</b> <br>  - Yes, and very active.  And recently - successfully.  For this we mainly use spam traps. <br><br>  - <b>Banks upon receipt of the amount of more than 600 thousand rubles are required to report this.</b>  <b>Is Yandex obliged to do the same?</b> <br>  - No, Yandex is not a banking organization, and we have no such obligation.  So a large amount can be transferred to your wallet.  Information about this, we must submit only by court order or when conducting investigative measures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46275/</a></p>
