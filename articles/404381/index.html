It is voluminous, and although not very plausible in our opinion, but it completely frightened him.  The film was shot in 1989, but many of the fantasy writers have come true.  Including 3D video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/538/52e/c98/53852ec980724a62a4a99ee5ce0cc1a8.jpg"><br><br>  And about 10 years ago, the first IMAX cinema opened in Russia, where one could see the surround cinema.  From the screen literally floated fish and swam over the audience.

But in 2008, very few directors could afford to shoot expensive movies in 3D, and now for this, two good cameras are enough.  And I decided to try ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  At the end of the article you will find a 3D movie for VR glasses. <br></div></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>3D video technology</b> <br><br>  For a start, a little theory, not to be confused.  There is a stereo movie or 3D, when each eye has its own picture.  And a 360 degree panorama movie.  If you watch the latest in VR glasses, then the volume will not be, but you can look around, as if you are in the center of action.  Examples of this video are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLTTj7cTZATjuNaUPZ_8b8Jpf-w3V-XWDW">here</a> . <br><br>  We are interested in exactly 3D or 3D video.  Consider ways to get such a movie: it can be anaglyph when there is a separation by color.  This method is very cheap, but the chromaticity of the picture suffers, but multi-colored glasses cost a penny. <br><br>  The technology works as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/25b/a74/f97/25ba74f9727042fbb0f2fd3c3f41d298.jpeg"><br><br>  A more serious technology is the shutter glasses and a projector that synchronizes the work of the shutter with a demonstration of a picture for each eye.  These glasses require periodic charging, and the frame rate is 120Hz.  The technology is good, but the screen flicker does not pass without a trace even at such a frequency: the eyes get tired after watching a long movie.  In addition, projectors with support for barrier technology cost a lot of money, so this can be found more in cinema than at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/174/0c9/159/1740c915932244e3ab275cc06b86989c.jpeg"><br><br>  The next way to demonstrate the volumetric frame is the polarization technology.  The picture is shown alternately by the projector, with light waves of different polarization of the light flux being used for each frame.  The glasses are equipped with filters that allow certain light waves to pass through, which allows each eye to receive its own picture. <br><br>  Polarized glasses are a bit heavier than cardboard ones, but at the same time they are much lighter than the slide and do not consume energy.  However, this method of 3D films requires not only special filters, but also a screen with a special coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ec3/2d3/42e/ec32d342efcd4e3c80dd9adf4816b93e.jpeg"><br><br>  Perhaps, all these factors have become in the way of the distribution of 3D films in every home.  Need a device as cheap and simple as possible.  It seems that a solution was found - these are virtual reality glasses or VR glasses.  The simplest models are made of cardboard, and the video can be viewed from a smartphone, since almost everyone has telephones with a large touch screen and a good picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e18/13c/f85/e1813cf85f154045bb752dc405acf8c9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3D video theory</b> <br><br>  The average distance between the eyes of a person is 6.5 cm. Therefore, one eye sees an object slightly on the left side, and the other eye covers it on the right.  That is, each eye sees the object from its own angle.  Thus, two slightly different images are formed - a stereo pair.  The brain merges both images into one volume. <br><br>  This is easy to understand if you look at an object from a short distance, up to half a meter, alternately with your right and left eye.  But if you look at the same object from a distance of several meters, there will be practically no difference, that is, the picture becomes almost flat.  That is why, when shooting the film ‚ÄúThe Hobbit,‚Äù camera operators carried cameras several meters in length when actors were taken at a distance of up to 10 meters from the lens ‚Äî just to get a larger angle and volume of the image. <br><br>  <b>We shoot 3D video yourself</b> <br><br>  From theory go to practice.  Most recently, I wrote about the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ezviz/blog/288995/">Ezviz S5 + and Ezviz S5 cameras</a> .  The older model is capable of shooting video in 4k at up to 30 frames.  Why not take advantage of the opportunity and not to shoot your 3D movie? <br><br>  To do this, we need two cameras and a device for fixing cameras at a standard distance.  Fortunately, such devices on the Internet can be found for every taste.  I took the simplest model with support for GoPro camera mounts.  It must be said that all of the Ezviz action camera mounts are compatible with gopro gadgets, so there were no problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f3e/82c/420/f3e82c4205574e6fa8262766d855d6d7.JPG"><br><br>  Further, to fix the camera, you can use the frame included in the package.  It is needed for land surveys, and a sealed box is useful for underwater.  But we will come back to this later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/062/d14/e4c/062d14e4cab54d58baf93940154c49cb.jpg"><br><br>  It is very convenient that the frame has holes for buttons.  At the same time, pressing the buttons is accidentally excluded, as they turn out to be recessed in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0ec/b07/2a6/0ecb072a662642799661291d977e6ba9.jpg"><br><br>  Next, a couple of cameras are just well fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1df/dae/ed3/1dfdaeed3a434ec98fe8d07d0ebe9929.jpg"><br><br>  And for convenience, when shooting, we use a selfie stick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/540/226/fda/540226fda7e54e7fa142c79129261e85.jpg"><br><br>  It is imperative that cameras shoot at one angle without tilting any camera.  It is easiest to do this by loosening the mounting screws and placing the cameras on the table.  After that, the bolts are tightened tight and you can start shooting. <br><br>  And here comes the practical issue of synchronization of start and shooting parameters.  And if on the installation you can adjust the start of shooting, then what about the camera parameters?  Here, everything is solved simply: in the shooting parameters, we activate ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù and manually set the appropriate parameters. <br><br>  <i>Advice for those who want to shoot such a video: after starting shooting, you need a loud bang or a held object in front of the lens - the easiest way to synchronize video is by sound or image.</i> <br><br>  To create my video in Adobe Premiere Pro, I used a very sensible <a href="https://youtu.be/Ffhb127-5BU">video tutorial</a> . <br><br>  And you can find a lot of 3D video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3D3d%2Bsbs">here</a> or in the words of <u>3D SBS</u> . <br><br>  As for the underwater shootings, the catch came out: the two cameras in the aquabox were simply not mounted side by side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/082/57f/72d/08257f72d3fe47958b3940b922f408b2.JPG"><br><br>  Dive forums came to the rescue and a little ingenuity.  For a couple of hundred rubles, you can assemble a very convenient frame that will allow you to hold cameras under water with one or both hands.  It gathers from plastic pipes and possesses positive buoyancy.  So with an accidental loss of cameras, they will not go to the bottom, but will float to the surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6de/70d/97d/6de70d97de254d7293043132e7fabcec.JPG"><br><br>  By the way, the distance between the lenses is only 7.5 cm, so the video will be very close to what the diver himself sees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4a1/fa2/232/4a1fa22322bc4e62a0c9115931bbc65e.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  It should be noted that it is a pleasure to work with Ezviz S5 + cameras: compatibility with very popular fixings from a well-known company gives a very wide choice.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand ease of installation facilitate shooting.  Well, the process of shooting itself comes down to the fact that it is necessary to move as smoothly as possible and just do not forget where the camera is looking.  I do not pretend to professional cinema, but working with cameras is really easy.  In conclusion, I will add two videos that I managed to shoot.  The first in 4K for owners of screens, televisions and projectors to assess the quality of the picture.  And the second is stereo movie, for viewing in VR glasses.
