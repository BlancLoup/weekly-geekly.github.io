The longer I walk on it, the weaker the hope is to carefully examine at least half of the stands that stand.  Not to mention the possibility of getting around everyone - I think it is simply impossible.  And yet, perhaps, I'll sit down for a while to talk about the first production smartphone on the Intel Atom, and about three meetings with people who know about Intel‚Äôs plans a little more than others. <br>  There is a real crowd around the Lenovo atomophone at the Intel stand.  No joke, no sample with the reference design, but quite a real device, which will soon appear on the shelves.  Why, however, do not say, but, according to insider data, the price tag should be just archhuman.  Everyone understands the importance of first impression.  As for the device itself, it looks like this. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f17/eac/ddf/f17eacddf82146f38e5ecaf6683b595e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fa/02c/612/4fa02c612d09d117b24162acc4bb82db.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f6/a90/dcb/2f6a90dcb866ec770b90cce7f4f6b86b.jpg"><br><br>  I, as the owner of the ThinkPad, cannot fail to note common motives in the design with Lenovo mobile computers.  Someone will say that the device looks brutal, someone will call it angular ... The main thing is not to be indifferent.  But for me personally (for me personally) I prefer the reference design of Intel, the photos of which I published in a previous post with CES. <br><br>  As for the central theme of CES 2012 according to Intel, ultrabooks, there are not just a lot of them at CES, but VERY much.  So much so that I will not torture you with photographs of each of them - suddenly I miss someone and, therefore, undeservedly hurt?  I confine myself to only one - under the brand Brand.  As far as I understand, this model is specially sharpened for local manufacturers, which will replace this talking name with their own.  By the way, Russian companies are already working hard on their own ultrabooks, and in the spring several of them should appear at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50a/d76/b7c/50ad76b7c4488857c05912dccdc94c86.jpg"><br><br>  Back in Moscow, I arranged an interview with Renee James, vice president of Intel and the general director of the Intel Software and Services Group, responsible for software development and the Intel Software Partner program.  When at the agreed time I came to the booth, the first to meet me was Paul Otellini.  The head of the corporation easily walks on the stand, jokes with employees and even the badge on it is exactly the same as on mere mortals.  It is a pity that in the IT business it is not customary for stars to take autographs :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f16/9ff/ef9/f169ffef96327b3259781843c99840b5.jpg"><br><br>  The conversation with Rene turned out to be quite long, and I will completely decipher it in Moscow.  Here, only the main theses.  As you might guess, the conversation revolved mainly around smartphones and ultrabooks.  I asked Rene - how does software development for ultrabooks differ from what is done for ‚Äújust computers‚Äù?  According to my interlocutor, at the moment there is no fundamental difference.  However, very soon ultrabooks will not only acquire touch screens, but will also acquire various sensors and additional modules - a gyroscope, a GPS receiver, light sensors and ambient temperature ... Previously, there was nothing like this on a PC (at least in the mass segment).  And those developers who are first given to use the new hardware capabilities to the delight of users, can get all the laurels supported by various financial support.  The latter, apart from, in fact, software sales, implies some bonuses from Intel.  After all, the 300-million fund created to support ultrabooks, extends not only to the hardware component. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a4/ddf/dea/7a4ddfdea96e03682362dddf72ce198b.jpg"><br><br>  I also showed Rene my Nokia N9 smartphone on MeeGo, complaining that the most interesting developments of this very charming (otherwise you can‚Äôt tell) model have virtually sunk into oblivion.  Rene consoled me with the promise that soon there will be smartphones on the Tizen platform, incorporating the best features of MeeGo.  I have, however, gloomy suspicions about the compatibility of the software, but let's see, we will see. <br>  At the end of the conversation, Renee once again urged to more actively connect to the <a href="http://www.intel.ru/partner">Intel Software Partner</a> program, because at the end of the wire there are quite a few Intel specialists ready to help with almost everything.  I myself, unfortunately, not a programmer, but when ‚Äî out of pure curiosity ‚Äî I registered in the program, they called me back in just an hour, and still send all sorts of interesting offers, which ‚Äî again, unfortunately ‚Äî I cannot use for all wish ... <br><br>  We also talked with Merlin D. Kister, one of the main people at Intel, who are responsible for promoting ultrabooks.  True, I immediately started a bit with a different topic.  The fact is that a couple of years ago, Intel already showed prototypes of smarfon on Atom, and also said that it was just a little more.  Will something like this happen now?  Merlin expressed confidence that this time there would be no failures.  Soon after, Lenovo will release its Motorola smartphone to Atom.  Further - everywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/071/9a1/c11/0719a1c1161a1fa803030f6766110640.jpg"><br><br>  And then I remembered how the day before the conversation I went to the Sony brand store.  As you know, in the States, the prices for equipment are quite humane, and that is why our people are taking it away with terrible force (in the main Apple Store in Vegas, the iPhones have already run out and now the people are getting the latest MacBook Air).  So in this store the VAIO Z series mobile laptop stands (hold on to what you are sitting on now) $ 4,500.  The laptop is gorgeous, delightful.  But in the store, on the contrary, there are ultrabooks for $ 800-900 with similar characteristics and, perhaps, a slightly lower level of delight.  I asked Merlin - how did Intel manage to push manufacturers towards such a noticeable reduction in the price of truly mobile models? <br><br>  Merlin said that before each ultra-portable laptop was a piece-work - with its own internal organization, non-standard components (from the case to the battery), with specially developed energy-saving mechanisms and so on.  Of course, the result cost, respectively.  In ultrabooks, Intel is very helpful to manufacturers in the unification of components.  The already mentioned 300 million fund was used, for example, to develop the technology for mass production of metal cases for ultrabooks.  Availability of ready-made solutions in combination with large print runs allows manufacturers to dramatically reduce margins - to the joy of you and me. <br><br>  On the sim again I bow out, so that on the last day before flying to Moscow I still have a little more run around CES.  Feel free to ask questions in the comments: as in the Intel Software Partner, there are smart and funny people who will be happy to answer you :) I myself will also try to keep the conversation going, but please do not forget about the 12-hour time difference.  When you have noon, I sleep soundly in order to catch a plane in the morning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136115/</a></p>
