      It turned out a fairy tale. <br><br>  Characters: <br>  The future owner of the site is a person who considers himself a super-businessman and is sure that he knows everything better than others; <br>  A webmaster is a novice layout designer, programmer, designer who believes that installing a free CMS with a standard template and dropping all that content left from the client‚Äôs printing materials on it is site development; <br>  SEO is a shirt guy who read a couple of books on optimization, mastered the exchange of links and registered three months ago on the forum of optimizers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Imagine summer, a large sunny meadow - the birds are singing, fresh air ... Beauty! <br><br>  The future owner of the site is walking in the clearing, chewing candies ... The wrappers are dumped in a pile in the middle, spitting and leaving. <br><br>  A webmaster appears on the clearing after a hearty lunch.  He sees that in the center of the glade is already trapped.  Comes, sits down and falls off, sorry, a huge pile of shit. <br><br>  It takes a couple of days and a positive SEO is appeared on the glade.  He enjoys the sun, fresh air, tears off a beautiful flower and suddenly notices a bunch of shit wrapped in sweets in the center of the clearing.  Podtantsovyvaya, comes to the heap and inserts a flower on its crown. <br><br>  And now a little bit about the meaning of this theatrical act.  A huge part of the sites that are on the top positions in search engines, looks like this very pile of shit with a flower in the middle.  And precisely because of the fact that many sites that are completely out of place are displayed in the TOP, the attitude to pure SEO is sharply negative.  This is probably true. <br><br>  There is one more disadvantage in this from the point of view of working with clients.  When a frank UG is in good positions, the future owner of the site does not want to hear about the quality design, selling texts and the notorious refusal rate.  He does not want to understand this.  He perfectly sees that with a cheap poor website you can be the first. <br><br>  And he needs to be first.  In many cases, to boast to competitors and friends in the bath.  Because even the statistics of visits on his website is not maintained. <br><br>  Understanding comes only after the site owner starts counting income, not expenses, and tracking the result ... <br><br>  Thank God, search engines now monitor the behavior of visitors to the site and take into account the quality of Internet resources, which generally leads to the fact that the threshold for entering the site promotion area is much higher, and companies that are engaged in Internet marketing offer a wider range services - from the development of sites to the SDL level to the media and contextual advertising. <br><br>  And it's great! <br><br>  In connection with all this, such a comic was born. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/53eacf2a/4013f660/822b9277/b99f7a52.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112468/</a></p>
