One of them is e-sports. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/ico_eloplaycom_ru">I</a> have already reviewed the <a href="https://t.me/ico_eloplaycom_ru">eloplay.com</a> team: for example, <a href="https://golos.io/ico/%40itsynergis/eloplay-nachalo-bolshogo-analiza">on Golos</a> .  But today I will try to look not through the prism of my own 4K methodology, but more broadly - through understanding the concept and understanding it within the framework of general trends. <br><br>  So, cybersport is not just alluring games with large prize pools, but a whole movement of fans, amateurs and just those present: the audience alone numbers <b>more than 300,000,000 people</b> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/13/59db132e78191154286808.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You need to understand that the entertainment of eSports is a concept that you need to understand: lovers devote hundreds of hours to watching streaming, and this is not the time that can be ignored. <br><br>  So, on the one hand, we have a growing society that is fascinated by this sphere, on the other - monopolization at the expense of large budgets and necessary expenses.  And here the Eloplay project appears in the arena, which not only solves the question of the relationship between quality and quantity, but also does it technologically - through smart contracts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/14/59db14e5e14ce928326019.jpeg"><br><br>  I must say that there are more than a few publications on the project: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://vc.ru/23037-eloplay">An article on vc.ru</a> with the saying title ‚ÄúEloplay - a platform for duels and tournaments in popular e-sports games‚Äù </li><li>  There is also <a href="http://playua.net/eloplay-com-spravzhnij-kibersport-u-tebe-vdoma/">material on playua</a> ‚ÄúEloplay.com - you have a reference for your sport‚Äù </li><li>  <a href="http://shpil.com/2016/12/arena-eloplay-put-k-uspeshnomu-kibersportivnomu-budushhemu/">On the Steeple</a> with a description in the stele - ‚ÄúEloplay Arena‚Äù or ‚ÄúPath to a successful cybersport future‚Äù </li><li>  Of course - <a href="https://forklog.com/blokchejn-pokoryaet-industriyu-kibersporta/">forkloh</a> with a pretentious, but still fair statement "Blockchain conquers the industry of eSports" </li><li>  And others (see details on <a href="https://ico.eloplay.com/ru.html">ico.eloplay.com</a> ) </li></ol><br>  But all this is a general description.  I would also like to take a closer look at the main thing - the essence of technology. <br><br>  Positioning on the main one sounds like this: ‚ÄúEloplay creates cryptocurrency for eSports.  More details - ico.eloplay.com ", - I do not think that this message reflects the essence of the platform.  At least <a href="http://gamecoin.global/">http://gamecoin.global/</a> - does roughly the same with the promise: ‚ÄúAll the games of the world.  One currency.  Gamecoin  Choose GMC. <br><br><blockquote>  This is a separate message, which is aimed at the gaming audience, because  players know little about the blockchain and smart contracts - we decided to make a common message for them, in order to show the essence of what we offer.  But of course for the blockchain and technical audience the main message remains the same - smart tournaments, since they are the core of the system </blockquote><br>  In particular, if you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dbnn0rPXJKak">official video</a> , or even better - read the <a href="https://ico.eloplay.com/docs/en/eloplay_whitepaper_en_1.pdf">White Paper</a> , you can pick out much more interesting things. <br><br>  Firstly, players can participate in tournaments on the principle of equality: it does not matter whether a team is professional, if it has any experience and even more so - the right amount of money.  The main thing - the desire to play and win.  For me it is very important, because  It is this approach that gives not only formal equality, but also equality of meaningful (actual).  In addition, it opens the door to opportunities for beginners: of course, this does not cancel the status of professional champions, but blurs the boundaries of entry and opportunity. <br><br>  Actually, this is where the social decentralized ecosystem is laid, when the players themselves form the necessary budget (prize fund), which will be distributed in proportion to the winners. <br><br>  As noted in the WP project, the blockchain will be involved more than just in the creation of p2p tournaments: ‚Äúthe use of blockchain technology and smart contracts opens up new opportunities for the development of a cyber-sports platform.  After the introduction of smart contracts for tournaments and advertising on the platform, it is planned to introduce this technology stack into new modules (this may take more than 24 months).  <b>The introduction of smart contracts will primarily affect</b> analytics, statistics and analysis of game preferences of players, as well as ladders, the talent scouting system, the player‚Äôs contract system and their transfers between teams, the winner forecasting system, and the betting module. ‚Äù <br><br>  Again, this approach develops the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecentralization and takes it to a new level, because  Today blockchain is most often used either for finance (stock exchanges, exchangers, etc.), or for some very specific things, while the potential in it is huge: from working with medical data (a description of projects will soon be on the blog) to changes in state registries, as it already is in Georgia and Ukraine. <br><br>  In particular, the <a href="https://t.me/ico_eloplaycom_ru">Eloplay</a> token can be used in the following ways: <br><br><ol><li>  Tokens - reward on created tournaments </li><li>  Purchase inside the platform </li><li>  For the banal, but you need to trade on the stock exchanges </li></ol><br>  To make the potential of the technology clearer - a few more words about smart tournaments, the scheme of which looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/20/59db20f8740ce955989462.jpeg"><br><br>  That is, the issue of trust and in fact - the creation is given to an outsourced technology, which was originally created for those systems where the mediator is needed only to prove the obligation to execute the action after reaching a significant event: in this case, victory. <br><br>  The most interesting thing for me personally is sponsored smart tournaments.  They work like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/db/22/59db221286dae811377274.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Why is the most interesting?</b>  Yes, because many people think that the blockchain "kills all intermediaries."  In fact, he does exactly that, but with unnecessary intermediaries who do not bring any significant benefits, for example, for most cases such a definition fits credit organizations and especially banks. <br><br>  As we can see from the example of sponsored smart, without exaggeration, tournaments - it is quite possible to apply the scheme bitrad.io, bitwalking and similar projects, when the money for advertising immediately goes into the user's pocket, and in eSports: moreover - I see that this is the future, because  it's not just more honest, but in many cases more effective.  Calculation of leads, conversions, CTR, etc.  in this case, it will become much more approximate to reality: it will be a qualitative leap that Internet advertising has made in its time regarding conventional advertising (TV, offline banners, etc.), since the automation of indicators allowed us to bring the knowledge of the target audience to a new level, its behavior and other parameters important for the profession that is not the most beloved on Habr√© - marketers. <br><br>  Of course, eSports develop other projects: the same Gamecoin.  I will try to study them, but for now - the questions below and comments under them.  Up to the third part! <br><br>  PS By the way, while the <a href="https://t.me/ico_eloplaycom_ru">team is relatively young and open</a> , I recommend communicating with them, because  they know a lot, as it turned out, about the industry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339646/</a></p>
