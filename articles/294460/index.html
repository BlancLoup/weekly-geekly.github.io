According to the Kommersant source, MTS had a conflict with these retailers: Samsung continued to ship the goods to the MTS retail network, which since April has been dumping in the mobile technology market.  MTS itself ceased cooperation with Euroset and Svyaznoy due to the fact that they allegedly give preferences to competing cellular operators.  Despite the current situation, for the period from July 26 to September 6, Samsung increased the market share in revenues from sales of smartphones (by 3‚Äì4 percentage points (p. P.) And in the number of units sold (by 4‚Äì5 p. P.) , the Vedomosti newspaper <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/09/11/608439-samsung-uvelichil-dolyu-v-rossii">reported</a> , citing several sources. According to the newspaper, the South Korean company remains the undisputed leader in Russia in terms of the number of devices sold. <br><br>  Some RBC sources link the rise in prices for Samsung products with the depreciation of the ruble.  According to another interlocutor, Samsung "often follows in the pricing policy for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple</a> , so that the actions of a competitor could" provoke "the current rise."  On September 10, it became known that prices for Apple tablets and laptops <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2015/09/10/appleprice/">increased by</a> an average of 15-20%. <br><br>  After updating the price of iPad Air 2 costs 40,990 rubles, that is, 22% more than before.  The iPad mini 4 appeared in the range. The device is sold for 32,990 rubles (26% more than the previous model).  Presented in 2015, the Macbook is now 18% more expensive (106,990 rubles).  On the same percentage, MacBook Pro without a Retina display went up in price.  Now its price has reached 89,990 rubles.  The price of the set-top box Apple TV increased by 32% and reached 6590 rubles. <br><br>  The previous change in the cost of the manufacturer's gadgets occurred in December 2014.  Then Apple explained that the rise of the dollar. <br><br>  "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19280/">wrote</a> that according to the results of exchange trading on September 9, Apple shares fell immediately by 1.9%.  Analytical company BTIG Research reported that over the past three years, Apple quotes during the presentation and after it fell.  The average drop rate is 0.4%.  According to experts, this situation is due to the fact that users expect very much from new Apple products, and, as a rule, these expectations are not met. <br><br>  Over the past three months, corporate quotes have decreased by 14%.  Nevertheless, Apple remains the most expensive company in the world with a capitalization of $ 628 billion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294460/</a></p>
