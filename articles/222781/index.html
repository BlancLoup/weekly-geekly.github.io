  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imagine Cup debut</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After learning about the contest <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/microsoft/imaginecup/">‚ÄúMy Story Imagine Cup‚Äù</a> , I immediately understood what I would like to tell you.  How we have developed and presented our game at an international competition.  About your feelings, dreams and hopes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Prehistory </h5><br>  From my very childhood I had a dream - to create a computer game based on my fairy tale ‚ÄúMagic Cat Traveler‚Äù.  As time went on, I slowly wrote fairy tales, stories, poems ... But the cherished dream remained a dream, since there was not enough experience and knowledge.  After school, I entered the university in a technical specialty, tried to learn as much as possible in programming, creating games.  After some searching, I stumbled upon the Unity3D game engine, and decided to try it in action ... <br><br>  By happy coincidence, at the same time, our university told that in a month the international competition <b>Imagine Cup</b> will take place, where it will be possible to self-realize, present your project, and even win valuable prizes!  With classmates we actively participated in various events and decided to participate in this competition. <br><br>  We were inspired and were determined to create something that would take your breath away!  The idea was born of itself, and we started to implement a full-fledged game that was supposed to win the hearts of many people.

    <h5>  The essence of the project </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd4/341/ccd/fd4341ccdf7d46cd7442043fe73e905d.png"><br><br>  Our project <b>Hold base!</b>  is a game that combines the genres of Shooter and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defense</a> , in which the main character will have to protect the peaceful agrarian planet from the invasion of militant invaders.  <i>‚ÄúTheir base ship was able to shoot down in low orbits, but it managed to enter the atmosphere, and even a wreck did not completely destroy it.</i>  <i>Now only you stand between a handful of civilians and legions of alien armored vehicles ... ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Our acquaintances looked at us with surprise when we tested the next version of the game.  Few people believed that we would succeed.  We have chosen <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> as the engine for the relationship between ease of development and the capabilities provided.  The scripts we wrote in Visual Studio in C # - this language really turned out to be easy to learn.  We really wanted to introduce additional features, such as the strategic planning mode, the choice of heroes, achivki, but the time was terribly short, we had just a few days before the competition.  Stormy discussions, sleepless nights - we quickly finished the functionality, interface, caught bugs ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/395/8dd/b18/3958ddb1800c9307de18a63679d0e8f1.png"><br><br><h5>  Regional final of the Imagine Cup </h5><br>  And then, finally, the time came for X. We were ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to be the first to speak.  On the one hand, this is, of course, great, but on the other - we have never had to perform in this way.  We did not have the opportunity to look at the performances of previous participants, to understand what the jury was most interested in and adjust its output accordingly to prevent ridiculous mistakes in their performance.  But we accepted the challenge of fate, and went out to defend our project. <br><br>  An unforgettable atmosphere reigned in the hall.  I managed to notice that in some teams initially there was no sense of cohesion, but as the performance went on, some people miraculously became a team due to the fact that they tried to make every effort for the benefit of the team‚Äôs common cause, and as a result, for the benefit of all mankind.  The spirit of team play was vital everywhere, all participants tried to look confident, even if not everyone succeeded. <br><br>  At our presentation, we showed a presentation and demonstrated a prototype.  The reaction of the audience was ambiguous.  Someone was surprised and showed every interest, someone just listened, someone watched without expressing any emotions.  But all this was very interesting, and not only because we performed for the first time in this format.  The process of the speech itself was remarkable, when we could feel both the speakers and the advocates of the project at the same time, and at the same time get an indescribable pleasure from our release. <br><br>  Having received our dose of applause, we began to listen to the speeches of other participants.  At the same time, I did not calm down for a minute trying to catch the main points, and at the same time analyzing what we did right and what didn't.  Imagine Cup gave not only positive emotions, but also a great experience in terms of performance, the ability to present your project to the public. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  Debuting in the competition Imagine Cup, we did not take prizes, but we did not count on it anyway.  But we managed to get a lot more: <br><ul><li>  Firstly, we got the opportunity to participate in a competition of international scope. </li><li>  Secondly, we received a charge of cheerfulness, felt an unforgettable atmosphere and gained experience and knowledge. </li><li>  Thirdly, we managed to put together a team for the next year with an equally interesting project.  But that's another story ... </li></ul><br>  <b><i>And most importantly - I feel that my childhood dream is beginning to come true ...</i></b> <br><br>  From the whole team, I express my deep gratitude to Microsoft for the opportunity to participate in such an interesting event.  And also thanks to all those who supported, encouraged and believed in us! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222781/</a></p>
