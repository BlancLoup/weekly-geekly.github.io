  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parallels Plesk Panel 11.5: what has appeared in the new version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  The new version of the control panel for hosters Parallels Plesk Panel 11.5 on the air.  Previous versions have been discussed here more than once, and we closely followed all comments.  As a result, the new version of the wishes of users were taken into account to the maximum.  So what has changed in 11.5? <br><br><h4>  <b>Php</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ For each site, you can now choose any version of PHP installed on the server and registered in Plesk - your build or downloaded from the repository.  We were asked to do this, because different websites often require different versions of PHP. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúHybrid Web Server‚Äù mode appeared, when part of PHP scripts can be run using nginx while the rest are working on Apache.  Hybridity is setting up a domain, not a server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/568/a5a/0e1/568a5a0e1bf4ad57fc71f6522198fbc2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>PHP configuration on the site settings page</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Security</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Secure FTP support - now all traffic (including passwords!) Is transmitted over encrypted protocols. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now you can get additional administrators on Linux (previously it was possible only on Windows);  for them, as well as for users, password generation works. 
      <br>

      <br>
    <h4>  <b>Migration</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ In previous versions, we made a mechanism for preliminary checking the conditions of migration, which identifies all possible problems and limitations.  But now we inform the user about these bottlenecks in advance and give convenient handles so that many of them can be quickly corrected (include the necessary services, add disk space, etc.) BEFORE the migration starts, not after it stopped due to an error in the middle of the process a few hours after the start. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8af/569/c53/8af569c53e2a2abd3ebea3a8c4df72dc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here's what it looks like.</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The user is no longer bombarded with numerous warnings about errors of the same type during the process - adequate error prioritization has appeared, and we ‚Äústick together‚Äù all the information into one message.  Also, all the corresponding logs for each migration are collected in a separate folder with the date and time, for example, / usr / local / psa / PMM / logs / migration-2013-04-10-19-39-22-557 /. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can migrate sites with remote (remote) databases (without the risk of errors like "The database already exists," which happened before).  Just be careful: do not delete the old site along with its database, it is better to simply suspend its work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ To shorten the backup time, we began to use the multi-threaded version of gzip - pigz (= ‚Äúparallel implementation of gzip‚Äù), which uses all available processors and cores to the maximum during data compression.  As a result, according to our tests, backup is done 3.5 times faster on real servers.  Archive pigz can be deployed and gzip-ohm. <br>  ‚Ä¢ For Windows: deferred file transfer is introduced - this reduces the migration time and the required additional space - free space is needed for exactly one largest subscription, and not for everything together. <br>  ‚Ä¢ For Windows: mail data can be migrated in the native mail server format (IceWarp, Smartmail, MailEnable) - we have abandoned slow IMAP.  Also, the backup tool built into MS SQL is used (because of which the database recovery speed doubled). <br><br><h4>  <b>Heading "You are very requested"</b> </h4><br>  Many users of older versions of Parallels Plesk Panel were frustrated because they were not given enough control in the system.  You are welcome: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Database users now have access to multiple databases from the same account. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Passwords for users are automatically generated (in one click). <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can quickly give access to the panel to the mail user - when you create it, simply check the corresponding option in the panel.  You can enable the ban on changing the username in the system (some use for FTP access). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mail queue can be cleaned directly through the interface. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now we give more data on disk usage, which removes earlier questions like ‚ÄúWhat did it take 10 gigs for ?!‚Äù <br><br><h4>  <b>Interface</b> </h4><br>  Parallels Panel users have always had many questions about the interface.  He was overloaded, the user was often confused and forgot where the function he needed was.  Now the user sees only the necessary (the unwanted / unpopular we have removed in the appropriate tabs).  Therefore: <br>  ‚Ä¢ All important (but not daily needed) information (such as system data, Plesk versions, etc.) was taken out of the home page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúWebsites and Domains‚Äù tab with all the tools became a homepage.  On it all your sites are immediately displayed, moreover in the form of an active list.  Here is what it looks like now: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79d/be6/d2b/79dbe6d2ba2d51694d5dddf50172dc0a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>It looks like a rolled plate with a site in the active list, when the site is empty</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e69/c75/5d0/e69c755d08238649658477cbd37019a7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>So - if you click on the arrow at the bottom of the plate</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In the active list on the plate of each site the most popular functions are displayed.  If the site is empty, the panel itself will offer to create content using the Parallels Presence Builder designer, install web applications (the same Wordpress), download files and / or create a database.  If the content is already there, a link will be displayed on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be9/14e/820/be914e8209a7e9ae6a5d766d0fccafe3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>And this is what a rolled-up dash looks like at the site, inside which there are files and a database.</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If there are many sites, the active list mode may be inconvenient.  Then you can return the table view. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The settings are hidden, since changes in them are required no more than once a month. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Instead of a dozen incomprehensible system folders on the user's home page (this is exactly what caused genuine pain to those who worked on older versions), now only 3 are needed with a clear purpose. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We divided the settings for the site and the settings for PHP so that there is no confusion.  At the same time most of the parameters of Apache, nginx and IIS can now be configured directly in the panel. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Changed the file manager interface - to a more familiar one: with a folder tree and without ripples.  You can upload files via drag &amp; drop, upload multiple files at once, preview, unpack archives, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f8/332/bf2/3f8332bf27586a32abfb85971b711a1a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>New file manager interface - with folder tree and tidier</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>SEO</b> </h4><br>  We made it possible to manage the PHP settings and the web server for SEO optimization, namely: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aliases and www-prefixes of domains can be configured according to SEO requirements, including a custom canonical name for the site, with or without www. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The same for domain forwarding - you can choose from two types of redirects (permanent 301 and temporary 302). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Made a correct suspension of the web server.  If the site is suspended, the code 503 is issued, if closed - 200 (previously, in any case, it was 200 and the default page).  For those who are not in the subject, - earlier the search bot could decide that the site disappeared (default page) and the search engine "lost" all the accumulated useful information about it. <br><br><h4>  <b>Applications and Licenses</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation of applications (now there are more than 200 of them - both free and commercial) can now be launched in one click: the user is no longer annoyed by numerous questions, and all parameters are configured by default. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Users are notified that an update for the application has appeared, and can enable automatic updating.  Do hosters have the opportunity to put a forced update of all applications on the server in case they are ready to prefer the risk of application failure to the risk of hacking the server through the old version of the application. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Search for applications: you can filter both paid and free (as before), and also sort by popularity, see the number of applications not only in categories, but in each subcategory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/831/358/6a5/8313586a5a572880e4c21dacfc8dd10c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Pleasant change - the number of applications in each subcategory</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ You can install a specific version of the application yourself (for example, to avoid problems with plug-in compatibility). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Added support for APS Mail Aspect, which makes it possible to integrate some Email applications (such as Open-Xchange). <br><br><h4>  <b>post office</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ The manufacturer of our old webmail client has discontinued support, so we switched to the popular Roundcube (in the Linux version), and Horde has been updated to IMP 5.0.  The last, as we know, is important for you - for this, many have transferred the production of the server to the preview. <br><br><h4>  <b>Command line interface and admin convenience</b> </h4><br>  For many years, we concentrated on the graphical interface, but realized that it should also be convenient to work with the CLI.  Therefore: <br>  ‚Ä¢ A universal utility has appeared that allows you to run all CLI utilities on Linux for access to tools, logs, configurations and administrative databases.  It supports autocompletion. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Special utility cfgmon allows administrators to track all changes made in critical configs and roll back to the previous version - in fact, it is a version control system for some configs. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTolerance‚Äù and support for connected third-party repositories, for example, Atomic and Remi. <br><br>  Thanks to all those who send their comments and suggestions (though - thanks).  If you want to advise us what exactly we should do in the next versions, go <a href="http://plesk.uservoice.com/">here</a> (please, in English - so that the whole world community can support your idea). <br><br>  Download Parallels Plesk Panel 11.5 <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/download/plesk/installer/">here</a> . <br><br>  As always, comments are welcome and read by developers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186034/</a></p>
