Seasonal sales, special conditions, discounts on sets of goods - all this must be carried out, otherwise buyers will go to competitors.  We list the main promotions that make fashion-retailers lure us to stores. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Bonus loyalty program </h2><br>  Today there are almost no clothing stores that will not offer you to join their loyalty program.  For the personal data of the buyer, they will be ready to provide special conditions: discounts or, for example, earlier access, as compared to mere mortals, to things from new or limited collections.

      <br>
      It is clear that the most profitable for buyers: this is a discount loyalty system.  That is, you buy a thing and immediately get a discount on it. <br><br>  But what is beneficial for the buyer is not always financially justified for the seller.  Therefore, most retailers, including clothing stores, eventually switched to loyalty bonus programs.  They work like this: you get bonus points for the purchase.  With them you can pay part of the next purchase. <br><br>  The loyalty program mechanics loyalty every retailer customizes.  Someone with points can pay only 10-20% of the purchase, others increase the percentage of benefits to almost 90%.  In some, the points are stored on the card almost forever, in the second they are burned after a fixed period of time. <br><br>  Usually, all marketing campaigns, which we will talk about further, are considered by stores as an addition to the bonus loyalty program. <br><br><h2>  What are the discounts </h2><br>  One more important point on which we will stop.  Everyone knows that there is such a thing as a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù, but what is it like in terms of fashion retailers?  Typically, clothing stores divide discounts into two types: <br><br><ul><li>  price; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  quantitative. </li></ul><br>  The first is a discount on the purchase amount, which can be simple and stepped.  Simple does not depend on the amount of the purchase.  In the case of a stepped buyer receives a discount depending on the amount of goods purchased.  For example, you chose clothes for 5,000 rubles and received a 3% discount.  And if you increase the size of the purchase to 10,000 rubles, your discount will increase to 5%. <br><br>  Quantitative discount does not depend on the amount of the purchase, but on the number of items in the basket.  For example, a rule in a clothing store can be established: a person who buys five shirts receives one of them as a gift. <br><br>  It is important to take into account that at the time of the promotion the retailer will sell the goods at a changed price.  Here lies the technical complexity: it must be recorded in the check and transferred to the tax.  The price can change dynamically depending on the conditions of the action, or it will have to be changed manually for the duration of the event. <br><br>  Most of the cash register programs that are common on the Russian market do not allow the price to be dynamically changed.  In our <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/catalog/programmnoe-obespechenie/profi-t/">cash program "Profi-T" the</a> price of promotional items is calculated automatically, which is much more convenient for stores. <br><br><h2>  Promotional action "N + N" </h2><br>  The N + N promotion is the most popular in clothing stores.  Its mechanics are very simple, but it may differ slightly in different stores - it all depends on how the retailer adjusts the conditions of the promotion. <br><br>  In general, the N + N promotion encourages the buyer to purchase goods for the future at a reduced price.  For example, 2 + 1 - three products for the price of two - implies a 33% discount on goods (Fig. 1).  That is, buying three t-shirts, you pay only for two of them.  As a gift, usually the retailer gives the goods with the lowest price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/n3/52/cbn352mucnnai196xkzl1orglo4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>one</i> <br><br><h2>  Promotion "Gift from the list" </h2><br>  Sometimes a clothing store needs to sell out products or focus buyers on a category.  In this case, he holds a promotion "Gift from the list."  From the point of view of marketing tools of our Profi-T cash program, it works as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  the retailer creates a list, which includes products that will be issued as a gift.  At the same time there are no fixed conditions for choosing a gift - the buyer can choose the one he needs; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  when making a purchase, a gift can be included in the commodity part of the check at zero price, or specified in the additional data of the check. </li></ul><br>  In our example, when purchasing a swimsuit, the buyer chose a beach tunic as a gift.  Information about this is placed in the additional data of the check (Fig. 2). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m9/68/fs/m968fssfwfglqq5c_rd6pd8wkcs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2</i> <br><br><h2>  Promotional campaign "Set of goods" </h2><br>  Surely, you have come across cases when a discount is given on a certain set of goods: for example, buy pants, a jacket and a T-shirt with a Punisher for 2500, and not for 3000 rubles.  It would seem all elementary.  But when creating a stock, a retailer has a technical difficulty: how to calculate the price of goods with a discount? <br><br>  In our ‚ÄúProfi-T‚Äù the promotional price is calculated dynamically.  A retailer needs to indicate in the program the number of goods participating in the set and its total amount. <br><br>  Figure 3 shows a check where, for 3,000 rubles, the retailer sold two goods - black and white bras.  At the same time, black was more expensive, so the system gave a discount on it more than on white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/ne/t5/tinet5djxffjqi-j5fdnq_zzofi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3</i> <br><br><h2>  Coupon promotion </h2><br>  Coupons are a great opportunity for small clothing stores to attract customers (we <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/about/feed/detail/promo-v-cheke-kak-bez-bolshikh-zatrat-postroit-programmu-loyalnosti-dlya-magazina/">wrote</a> about it in detail <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/about/feed/detail/promo-v-cheke-kak-bez-bolshikh-zatrat-postroit-programmu-loyalnosti-dlya-magazina/">here</a> ).  However, it is important to consider a number of points, limiting: <br><br><ul><li>  benefit from the purchase amount not more than a certain percentage; </li></ul><br><ul><li>  the number of coupons affecting the total amount (for example, one check - one coupon). </li></ul><br>  In Figure 4, coupon number 38211814 was used, which gave the buyer a 15% discount on each item.  The total discount was 516 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/kt/e2/0dkte229xsqmcyw7xw3p6dogun8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>four</i> <br><br>  All of our marketing campaigns are actively used by clothing stores.  But we remind retailers that, before launching them, the buyer‚Äôs double benefit should be excluded and the promotional items should be rejected with bonus points.  In "Profi-T" for this there is a standard mechanism (Fig. 5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/qk/ik/pmqkik99ukzur2loqjfma_j1-za.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>five</i> <br><br>  Promotions are a great tool for a clothing store to increase sales and customer loyalty.  Moreover, customers are now so used to them that they are unlikely to become regular customers of a retailer who does not hold such events.  The main thing is to carefully study the mechanics of stocks and hold exactly those events that will be in demand from buyers and beneficial to business.  And for this, it is desirable that the cash program prepares reports.  About how this happens in the "Profi-T" we <a href="https://www.pilot.ru/about/feed/detail/kak-kassovaya-programma-pomozhet-sekonomit-na-analitike/">wrote here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426071/</a></p>
