Their whole ocean.  Plus, we immediately complicated our task by adding what we don‚Äôt need to wear.  That is, it includes both wearable and those that are at home and are applied periodically.  What is important to us?  To be able to measure yourself, when and how you want.  And not only to measure.

      Described four dozen (not taking into account the variety of fitness bracelets and watches), but those are on!  Get-sign a link to the database of 421 wearable devices.  And only five of our forties are in this database.  But what such! <br><br>  But they will be more and more.  Cap asked to convey that the market is growing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to estimates of CCS Insight, the largest analytical company focused on mobile communications and the Internet, the wearable gadget market will reach $ 34 billion by 2020. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/523/f50/e09/523f50e09f8b4248a57bb92fb4118671.jpeg"><br><br>  That most terrible database is collected by Vandrico together with Deloitte.  The guys work in the mines.  As if.  Increase the productivity and safety of miners with the help of smart helmets, bracelets, setting up interactive maps and software for communication between specialists, they preach Adjail approach.  They are very modern and beautiful. <br><br>  Gadgets in the database are sorted by body parts, scope, functionality, battery type, connectors, operating system, compatibility with other platforms and how the device can be used at the workplace - after all, Vandrico is primarily about optimizing workflow. <br><br>  Plus, the database is a kind of non-commercial project, you can participate in its addition, if you have a gadget in mind that you have missed in the database. <br><br>  This library is still not about medical devices.  If sorted by application, out of 421 devices, only 86 are medical.  We reviewed them more closely and added them to the review. <br><br>  But what a thing.  Physics - it is physics.  If the technology already exists, and some company has invested in the development of a wearable device that analyzes the woodcutter's exposure to UV rays, then nothing prevents the same technology from being shoved into a gadget for those who walk along Venice Beach.  Or wear a gadget on beachmen that for lumberjacks. <br><br>  Everything that can be transferred to devices that help monitor and control your own health will be transferred. <br><br>  What modern industrial design can put on people today?  Accelerometer (measures acceleration), altimeter (measures height), barometer and pressure sensors, galvanometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, compass, metronome, sonar and pedometer. <br><br>  Oximeter, blood glucose meter and lactic acid level sensor;  CO, NOx, CO2 and methane CH4 sensors. <br><br>  Sensors of general illumination, visible light, infrared and ultraviolet spectrum. <br>  Sensors ECG, EEG, EMG, EDA, EKG, EOG (it's all about the heart). <br><br>  Motion sensors, muscle contraction, respiration, skin elasticity (resistance), temperature and humidity. <br><br>  And this incomplete list is only about measuring parts of devices.  And how do you wear wearable?  There is one.  That is, a wearable device can not only record your data in the background, but also perform interventions.  Therapeutic devices are certainly an important part of the conversation. <br><br>  Plus, there are devices that can measure something not constantly, but periodically.  Well, that though.  Let's not forget about them. <br><br>  And most of us have a smartphone with us in our pocket, in our hand, in our bag, on the bedside table and on the table in the cafe.  He is also a gadget, he can do a lot by himself, there are also applications. <br><br>  Since we are talking about applications, we must not forget about the important part of the devices, even though wearable, even if they are taken out of the box once a week.  This is a <b>personal account</b> .  It graphically shows the dynamics of changes: how many steps you have walked today, and how many - that week.  What do you have there with pressure, heart rate and how these indicators look compared to other people.  Personal rooms are the accumulators of what we are gadgets for ‚Äî the information we receive.  The collection and analysis of data, communication with the user in the form of personalized health tips - for the sake of this device and bought. <br><br>  <b>So, the classification of devices that help the hypochondria become a biohacker</b> : <br><br>  1. Wearable gadgets: bracelets, sensors, headbands, stickers, and everything that records data <b>continuously</b> <br>  2. Compact diagnostic devices for <b>periodic</b> measurements <br>  3. Compact <b>therapeutic</b> devices for self use <br>  4. Mobile <b>applications</b> <br>  5. Personal data storage systems: <b>personal offices</b> and electronic doctors <br><br>  In this article we will try to highlight the first three points.  And you need to hurry, until something new happens again!  Personal accounts and applications worthy of individual reviews.  If you want to participate in such work, connect, it will be very useful! <br><br>  Also, a separate review worthy of <b>gadgets for clinical research</b> .  We believe that the increase in the supply of medical devices on the market and their cheapening will simplify the conduct of clinical trials of aging therapies by patients, which we, the Open Longevity project, are striving for. <br><br>  And, of course, we will try to identify those devices that are directly related to the <b>diagnosis of aging</b> . <br><br>  There are devices that turn ordinary watches into smart ones.  <b><u><a href="https://wearchronos.com/">Chronos</a></u></b> , the size of a coin, is mounted on the inside of an ordinary watch and monitors physical activity, notifies you of calls, messages and reminds you of important events.  And <u><a href="http://www.montblanc.com/en/discover/specials/montblanc-introduces-e-strap.html">Montblanc</a></u> and <u>MMT SwissConnect</u> solve the issue of ‚Äúlearning‚Äù with the help of <b>smart straps</b> , essentially the same fitness bracelets. <br><br>  And then there are the rings.  <u><b><a href="https://mymotiv.com/">Motiv Ring</a></b></u> , a functionally familiar tracker of physical activity, heart rate and sleep quality, but made in the form of a ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a5b/ea4/5aa/a5bea45aa4a645c6bcdf8b3401802aa2.jpeg"><br><br>  But the diagnostic functions that interest us are the same for most popular bracelets and watches.  When choosing, it is worth paying attention to the ability to track sleep phases and automatically measure the pulse throughout the day while maintaining statistics, since it is the dynamics in this case that are valuable diagnostic information. <br><br><h2>  Wearable gadgets of constant use: bracelets </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/804/4f0/f4c/8044f0f4c317428880b92b5afcdfe77c.jpeg"><br><br>  In the beginning let's deal with bracelets. <br><br>  All <b>trackers</b> are based on an accelerometer that tracks a motion pattern.  His testimony is analyzed and issued in the form of steps, approximate consumption of calories and other statistics corresponding application. <br><br>  <b>Fitness bracelets</b> differ in appearance, the presence or absence of the screen and its quality, battery life, various advanced functions.  In some cases, the bracelet can track the phases of sleep and wake you up at the right moment or measure your pulse. <br><br>  The diagnostic functionality of the smartwatch is not very different from the bracelets, only the purpose of the watch is different - to replace the smartphone, bringing us closer to the pictures from sci-fi films.  And sometimes push out the classic, but already obsolete, Swiss chronometers. <br><br>  Of course, there are also watches with additional features.  For example, <a href="http://veldt.jp/en/all/news/2017/01/30/853">Tottori West Family Time Watch</a> tracks, among other things, how much time you spend with your family. <br><br>  The most famous examples of smart watches are the <b>Apple Watch</b> and <b>Samsung Gear</b> , which are experiencing the second and third generation.  However, a small battery capacity (you have to charge daily) is a rather inconvenient factor, and the usefulness for monitoring health compared to more specialized devices is not yet obvious. <br><br>  Even <b>Nokia</b> , which bought the French manufacturer <b>Withings</b> in 2016, will release smart watches under its own name.  The guys make nice devices that would fit in with the Republic or the MOMA gallery in New York: watches, bracelets, keychains sensors, portable blood pressure monitors, thermometers, scales and even smart hairbrushes.  Nokia will unite all this through the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fdf/b35/5cf/fdfb355cf7894e85b1e34c126207801c.png"><br>  <u><a href="https://www.withings.com/be/en/products/activite-steel">Withings</a></u> is now part of Nokia <br><br>  Next, we present examples of interesting gadgets with additional functionality, but first, let's look at the <b>best trackers of</b> 2017, according to the latest review on <a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitness-trackers/the-best-fitness-tracker">Wereable</a> : <br><br>  <b>Garmin Vivosmart HR +</b> (best fitness tracker 2017, as well as 2016 according to Wearable), <b>Fitbit Charge 2</b> (best overall tracker), <b>Garmin Vivosmart 3</b> (best for health): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b65/d16/a2e/b65d16a2e3f04dcc929162ad38821ea9.png"><br><br>  <b>Withings Steel HR</b> (the best heart monitor) and <b>Misfit Ray</b> (the easiest to use): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d48/6c4/9db/d486c49db2a244e488fa2f2ade21aa83.png"><br><br>  <b>Misfit Shine 2</b> (the best for parents with a stroller is a little unexpected! Besides, this is not a bracelet, but a clip that can be attached to shoes), <b>Moov Now</b> (best for those who want to get in shape), <b>Xiaomi Mi Band 2</b> (best for a limited budget): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/223/a84/ad4/223a84ad41104988b596ce089b12b50c.png"><br><br>  <b>TomTom Touch</b> (best for weight loss), <b>Garmin Vivoactive HR</b> (best for a variety of sports) and <b>Samsung Gear Fit2</b> (best screen). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b26/084/8fd/b260848fd120426fac68547612abd576.png"><br><br>  <b>Fitbit Alta HR</b> and <b>Skagen Hagen Connected</b> (the most stylish). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b82/e5a/a91/b82e5aa912d841158f2adfcd0afc909c.png"><br><br>  So, a few more devices. <br><br><h2>  WithMe2 (W / Me2) </h2><br>  <i>RootiLabs (Taipei, Taiwan)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f96/70a/b77/f9670ab77e9142ab8215a4dd5b7d95de.jpeg"><br><br>  W / Me2 does not serve as a substitute for professional medical advice and standardized professional diagnostic devices, but it allows you to obtain diagnostic data in a wider range, compared to most fitness bracelets or smart watches.  The fact is that he is <b>able to take ECG with the help of a chest cardiopulsor or cardiofeedback</b> that <b>comes in a set</b> , details the data in a form that the cardiologist understands, plus analyzes the pressure with an accuracy of 80‚Äì85%. <br><br>  Sensor W / Me2 captures the pulse, calories, respiration, etc., and transmits them to the smartphone.  The tracker counts and displays the time, steps, calories burned, distance traveled, incoming calls, records sports activity. <br><br>  The device also evaluates the age of the autonomic nervous system, depression, diabetic neuropathy, lung and heart disease, and monitors apnea.  The battery life is up to 144 hours. <br><br>  The cost in Russia is <b>15,990 rubles.</b> <br><br><h2>  Mio slice </h2><br>  <i>Mio Global (Vancouver, Canada)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/078/1fb/31b/0781fb31b3ed417ab5d8e8c1f53cf090.png"><br><br>  Here is a chip in Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) - a personalized index that takes into account the body's response to physical exertion.  The bracelet records the pulse throughout the day and converts the data into points.  The use of this index, according to the developers, helps to more accurately determine the load required by a particular person to maintain a good physical condition.  Maintaining the index level above 100 points should prolong life by 10 years and prevent diseases caused by a sedentary lifestyle. <br><br>  The effectiveness of PAI is based on data on the relationship between physical activity and health status of approximately 45,000 people who participated in the Norwegian study HUNT.  The article with the rationale for the methodology was <a href="https://mioresources.cdn.commercecm.com/docs/mio_pai_study-american_journal_of_medicine.pdf">published</a> in The American Journal of Medicine. <br><br>  Mio Slice also tracks sleep quality, calorie consumption, distance and other indicators. <br><br>  The cost in Russia is <i>8,990 rubles.</i> <br><br><h2>  Withings Pulse Ox - fitness bracelet and pulse oximeter </h2><br>  <i>Withings SA (France)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe5/98e/f5d/fe598ef5d9e04d099f32942e4fc5f552.jpeg"><br><br>  Putting your finger to the sensor on the inside, you can measure the pulse and the level of oxygen in the blood, which allows you to assess the overall level of the respiratory system.  When used as a bracelet or clip, <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/products/pulse">Pulse Ox</a> counts steps, distance traveled, height, calories, and tracks sleep cycles at night. <br><br>  Pulse Ox synchronizes data with your smartphone throughout the day, saves information in the app and converts it into clear graphs for a better understanding of the connection between your habits and your health.  The cost of the official site - <b>$ 99.95</b> .  In Russia - from <b>6,000 rubles.</b> <br><br><h1>  Wearable gadgets of constant use: wearable sensors </h1><br>  The body is big, you know, not just the wrists.  And wearable sensors, especially if they are in the form of flexible patches, can be glued to various places. <br><br>  Two liters of water a day, three liters - who is more?  What are these recommendations based on and how to measure how much water is retained in your body?  Metabolism is different, the climate is different, physical activity, too.  <b>The water balance indicator is what we need.</b> <br><br><h2>  LVL - water balance indicator </h2><br>  <i>BSX Technologies (Austin, USA)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a06/aa5/a44/a06aa5a44ab14a53bc215c10fdf08b7e.png"><br>  In October 2016, BSX Athletics (Austin, USA) collected more than a million dollars on Kickstarter for the ‚Äúfirst wearable indicator of water balance,‚Äù LVL, also tracking physical activity, heart rate and sleep quality. <br><br>  <a href="https://store.bsxinsight.com/lvl-hydration-monitor/">Pre-order</a> price is <b>$ 149.99</b> .  But the bracelet will be brought to you only in August 2017. <br><br>  Following BSX Athletics, in January 2017, developers at the University of North Carolina <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2017/01/hydration-sensor-2017/">announced</a> the development of a sensor that tracks skin hydration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a8c/b57/a04/a8cb57a0414c4426bd8c4975d5bc2ccb.jpeg"><br><br>  It consists of two electrodes made of elastic polymer composite, in which silver nanowires are embedded.  Shanshan Yao, lead author of the study: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe cost of the sensor currently available on the market, with which we compared our system, is more than 8 thousand dollars.  Our sensor costs about 1 dollar. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <b>For heart affairs</b> .  A very topical issue in terms of talking about the diagnosis of aging, since it is cardiovascular diseases that are by far the most common cause of death ‚Äúfrom old age‚Äù.  And yes, this is clearly age-related pathology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/caa/eed/4fa/caaeed4faea746b89c759c07a39ae51c.jpeg"><br><br>  If your friend is preparing for a marathon, then most likely he will not go to the training without a sports harness belt-heart monitor - the sensor on the chest gives extra accuracy. <br><br>  By the way, during sports or walking for a pulse, you can watch with the help of headphones.  They transmit data to a smartphone via Bluetooth.  <a href="https://www.jabra.com/sports-headphones/jabra-elite-sport">Jabra Sport Pulse Special Edition</a> costs <b>$ 249</b> when ordering on the official website or about <b>13,000 rubles.</b>  when buying in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b00/3ba/267/b003ba267cc648eb8a91c4639211e9db.jpeg"><br><br>  But cardiomonitors for sports and for daily carrying carry out various functions.  The former must register changes in a very short period, as the athlete quickly moves from one state to another.  Yes, and do not wear it all the time, but only in training.  The second, for daily use, should keep track of statistics for long periods, registering critical health conditions.  We will concentrate on them, as our review is not about sporting achievements. <br><br><h2>  QardioCore </h2><br>  <i>Qardio (San Francisco, United States)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cad/9f0/1bc/cad9f01bcee04835b18532333f7e3953.jpeg"><br><br>  Wireless, worn on the chest, the <a href="https://www.getqardio.com/qardiocore-wearable-ecg-ekg-monitor-iphone/">QardioCore heart</a> monitor <a href="https://www.getqardio.com/qardiocore-wearable-ecg-ekg-monitor-iphone/">is</a> designed for clinically accurate daily monitoring of ECG, heart rate and heart rate variability, skin temperature, respiration rate, and physical activity.  The received data is synchronized with the application for the smartphone, and can also be automatically transmitted to the attending physician. <br><br>  Focuses on people with a predisposition to heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, as well as diabetes and overweight. <br><br>  The cost of the device is <b>$ 449</b> , sales will begin in August 2017. <br><br><h2>  Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 </h2><br>  <i>Firstbeat Technologies Ltd.</i>  <i>(Jyv√§skyl√§, Finland)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/961/163/9c2/9611639c2b72452b965988f8f949f578.jpeg"><br><br>  Firstbeat primarily deals with solutions for athletes.  But the <b><a href="https://www.firstbeat.com/en/wellness-services/individual-wellbeing/">Bodyguard2</a></b> sensor <b>,</b> designed for round-the-clock recording of heart rate variability, is also suitable for ordinary advocates of a healthy lifestyle.  The sensor is attached to the body with two electrodes and is able to record readings for six days without recharging.  Yuhu! <br><br>  Data must be periodically downloaded to the computer via a USB cable.  Access to data collected by <b>Bodyguard 2</b> is only possible through native software. <br><br>  The <b>Firstbeat</b> system <b>is</b> based on the author‚Äôs system for assessing heart rate variability and is designed to assess physical activity, the impact of psychosocial factors on athletes and recovery during sleep.  The official site contains a significant <a href="https://www.firstbeat.com/en/science-and-physiology/white-papers-and-publications/">list of preprints and scientific publications</a> , which justify the effectiveness of the system. <br><br>  The cost of the <b>sensor</b> in Russia is ‚Ç¨ 329, software for individual use - <b>‚Ç¨ 399 per month or ‚Ç¨ 999 for life.</b> <br><br><h2>  BioStampRC </h2><br>  <i>MC10 (Lexington, United States)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f18/e94/576/f18e94576f3f46598a4c53e794253328.jpeg"><br><br>  The patch can be glued to different parts of the body and thus remove a different date.  Everything is automatically loaded into the cloud, there is an application.  Measures everything that can be measured with an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an electrode: locomotor, respiration, ECG, temperature, electromyogram.  Plus a whole set of cardiovascular parameters, including pressure and pulse wave velocity.  The sensor works 36 hours, then it needs to be recharged. <br><br>  In the minimum set of <a href="https://www.mc10cloud.com/biostamprc/">3 sensors</a> , replaceable stickers, gel, charger, application for Samsung Galaxy Tablet and access to information for 3 years.  Price from <b>$ 1500.</b> <br><br>  <b>Temperature</b>  It can also be measured continuously.  This is especially true for kids who are uncomfortable and unsafe to put a thermometer up to a certain age.  And the patch, as well, stuck and sleep. <br><br><h2>  TempTraq </h2><br>  <i>Blue Spark Technologies (Westlake, USA)</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cM7R9dVWFf0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Children's underwear thermometer allows you to monitor the temperature of the child around the clock.  Around the clock in a literal sense - the patch is designed for 24 hours, but it is disposable.

If you need to achieve the opposite effect, go to bed and wake up later, then Re-Timer is used before sleep, but no earlier than two hours.  The time of continuous use in both cases is no more than one hour.  The duration of the procedure is 3-4 days. <br><br>  A good review about the gadget can be read <a href="http://www.hwp.ru/articles/Re_Timer___ochki_dlya_borbi_s_bessonnitsey_117718/%3FSHOWALL_1%3D1">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Price $ 299.</b>  <b>The price in Russia is 23,000 rubles.</b> <br><br><h2>  Neuroon - diagnosis and management of sleep </h2><br>  <i>Inteliclinic Inc.</i>  <i>(San Francisco, USA / Warsaw, Poland)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d84/5ea/904/d845ea9047fe48af8825482068060b4b.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://neuroon.com/">Neuroon</a> falls immediately into all categories: it is both diagnostic and therapeutic, suitable for both constant use (during sleep) and periodic (for correcting the mode if necessary). <br><br>  Smart mask analyzes the sleep mode and adjusts to your biorhythms.

Chrono adapts to the patient's biorhythm and injects nicotine in advance, while the person is still sleeping.  The device acts similarly with other peaks, acting in advance.  Between peaks, the patient also receives nicotine, but in very small doses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8e5/e6f/13e/8e5e6f13e1ef42c79e2965774918c3cc.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, it will be possible to help make the device smarter by clicking on the ‚ÄúI have a break‚Äù button - this is to train the system for you. <br><br>  The device is still at the stage of clinical research. <br><br>  If you read this review and understand that we missed some important gadget, write, and we will add it.  And if you have experience using any of the listed devices, especially write. <br><br>  Plus, we still have to do reviews of applications for phones.  The phone, after all, is also a gadget, much can do by itself.  Write about the most useful thing that you put on your phone lately?  Not counting FaceAPP.  About health. <br><br>  An important next step will be the analysis of all the listed gadgets in the context of clinical trials.  No, not to test gadgets, but to research potential aging therapies with them.  Plus, there are many interesting devices in the clinical research industry itself.  Tell us about what you heard?  Our goal is to make research more accessible and larger. <br><br>  Plus, you need a review of electronic personal accounts.  What for?  We want to make <a href="http://openlongevity.org/about/">our own</a> .  Introduce research data, share experiences with each other, enroll in volunteers, monitor their dynamics.  Each device in this review has a personal account - why do we need to invent our own with zeros?  There are platforms for CI - we offer to take the best from those who have already done a lot of work on usability.
