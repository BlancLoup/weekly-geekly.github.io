      Every day I act automatically, as if such a regime is deeply ingrained in my brain: I have breakfast, open the laptop, have dinner, turn off the laptop and have dinner. <br><br>  <b>But driving on autopilot prevents me from perfecting my life.</b>  <b>And you too!</b> <br><br>  Every year we declare that we want to implement certain changes.  Every year we want to try something new.  Every year we want <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-chalzom-dakhiggom-kak-sila-privychki-mozhet-pomoch-dostich-svoikh-novogodnikh-tseley/">to give up bad habits</a> .  But usually we do not do any of this ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">It seems that the door to change is locked, but there is one word that can open it.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">And this is the word "why."</font> </h2><br><br>  The power behind it is connected with the ability to ask endless questions.  And although we learned this word as a child, turning into adults, we forgot how to use it for our own benefit. <br><br>  I'll show you ... <br><br>  It seems to my friend that it is impossible to turn physical education into a habit.  Of course, he tried several times to go to the gym, but after a few weeks it all ‚Äúflowed‚Äù from his schedule ... Now he thinks that he was simply not created for the exercises. <br><br>  But is this his real problem? <br><br>  I sat opposite, and asked him our simple, but incredibly effective question.  The dialogue turned out like this: <br><blockquote>  "It seems I just can not adhere to the training regime." <br>  "Why?" <br>  "I dont know.  Reflecting on the hall, I just do not know what to do there.  I spent quite a bit of time in it, but everyone else looks like they know exactly what they are doing. ‚Äù <br>  "Why does that bother you?" <br>  ‚ÄúWhen I go to the gym, it seems to me that people can laugh at me if I walk up to the bar, not knowing where to start.‚Äù <br>  "Why?" <br>  ‚ÄúApparently, I didn‚Äôt understand what exercises I needed.  Or maybe I did not consider the possibility of working with a coach.  Hm, I could do this.  I think it would help a lot! ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In the case of my friend, the real problem was not the formation of a study habit.  The real reason for the difficulties was the fears associated with the role of a novice in the gym. <br><br>  He lived on autopilot, taking a lack of exercise as a given, which he could not change.  But the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-teoriya-zadach-kotorye-nuzhno-vypolnit-sposobna-izmenit-vash-podkhod-k-osmysleniyu-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">key to change was in his hands</a> , wasn't it? <br><br>  Regardless of the subject of aspirations, you can try the same approach.  You may ask yourself "Why?" <br>  Imagine a world in which you are able to look into yourself and understand what the reasons really prevent to move forward. <br><br>  Imagine a universe in which you can change anything, perform any action, achieve what you want, if you are ready to take it seriously. <br><br>  Imagine a world in which nothing holds you back, and there is no longer any need to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/fizika-produktivnosti-primenenie-zakonov-nyutona-v-rabote/">overcome any obstacles</a> . <br>  You can live in this universe.  You are able to get into it at any time.  You can create it for yourself.  All you have to do is just start acting as soon as you are ready for it. <br><br>  I would like to know: <br><ul><li>  What prevents you from asking yourself why you live like this? </li><li>  What changes would you like to make using the word "why"? </li><li>  How would you implement the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù approach in your daily life? </li></ul><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vy-delaete-neobkhodimyy-pereryv-ili-prosto-lenites/">you are taking the necessary break - or just lazy?</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300400/</a></p>
