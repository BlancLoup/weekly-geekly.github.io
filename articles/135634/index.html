      <b>Mechanically</b> : Purchase of various brushes, sticks and cleaning fluids, pears for blowing dust, ionizers for repelling dust from the inner surfaces of the chamber and other tricks in order to get rid of such annoying dust particles.  On the set of modern cameras, so-called ‚Äúplettrays‚Äù (systems of ultrasonic cleaning of the matrix) appeared, but the dust still sticks, and the appearance of ill-fated points in the photographs is just a matter of time.  In principle, all cleaning methods are described well in the network and it is difficult to say something new here.  I want to dwell on the mechanical cleaning (I consider the software to be the last resort for removing what I couldn‚Äôt remove with my hands). <br><br>  <b>All mechanical cleaning methods have one weakness, the place where we carry out cleaning already contains dust flying in the air.</b>  Attempts to remove one speck of dust often result in a dozen new dust particles.  And this process can bring a person to despair (as it was once before with your humble servant).  And given that cleaning means are sometimes quite expensive and can punch a hole in our budget, the device I offer will be useful to many. <br><br>  <b>How to ensure clean air?</b> <br>  The decision suggests itself, a clean room where the air does not contain dust or at least a fume hood.  After a brief search in the network, it became clear that if you don‚Äôt intend to open the matrix cleaning workshop yourself, the pleasure turns out to be more expensive than buying a new camera with good optics.  But there was a way out. <br><br>  The flight of thought led me to the hardware store. <br><br>  <b>There I bought the following things:</b> <br>  1. A laundry box <br>  2. A pair of rubber gloves <br>  3. 2 adapters for the kitchen pipe (gloves are then attached to them), see photo. <br>  4. 2 straps of suitable diameter <br>  5. A piece of plastic for the viewing window <br>  6. Fasteners (different bolts and nuts in order to fix it all <br>  7. Breathing filter (the one that you use when painting). <br>  8. Self-adhesive rubber seal, the one we use for windows and doors so as not to blow. <br>  9. Fan for the bathroom (in my case used the old fan from the server cabinet) <br><br>  <b>After that I did the following:</b> <br>  1. In the cover I cut through the inspection hole and inserted the Plex and insulated everything with sealant. <br>  2. From the cut out piece, in the form of a filter, cut out the pressure plate. <br>  3. A circular cut out the holes on the sides of the adapters for pipes. <br>  4. I inserted adapters for pipes into two holes, the remaining filter for air and an exhaust fan (I think it is clear that air should be pulled out of the box, not vice versa).  The joints are treated with sealant. <br>  5. Pasted a self-adhesive rubber tape in place of the lid. <br>  6. On the adapter pulled the gloves and secured them with clamps. <br><br>  <b>It turned out this design:</b> <br><img src="http://www.superbasis.de/korobka.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If desired, the exhaust fan can be replaced with a vacuum cleaner (if you are not afraid of the noise during cleaning).  The device showed its usefulness and was used repeatedly by me.  And not only for cleaning but also for changing lenses.  Size allows you to put the box in the trunk.  That's all.  Cheap, angry and quite comfortable.  A sort of portable hood with his own hands.  <b>In principle, it can be useful in a bunch of other cases where it is necessary to ensure the cleanliness of the process.</b>  For example  cleaning optics or as suggested by the distinguished Shiva Kaladhara when replacing the display in a cell phone and so on.  The scope is limited only by our imagination and device dimensions. <br>  I hope the article was useful to the respected habro-user, because  We often deal with digital cameras both at work and in our leisure time. <br><br>  ps  I am not sure that it is appropriate here to give a link to your photos on the network, but if it will be interesting to someone I will give the link later. <br><br>  Sincerely, Mikhail Chervonenko. <br>  Russian programmer in Germany. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135634/</a></p>
