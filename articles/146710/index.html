Happlink is a network of interests in which people interact, first of all, not with their acquaintances, but with those whom they do not know, but who share the same interests.  In fact, we have designed only the very core of the service so far and now we want to make sure that the interaction scenario proposed by us will be clear to other people.  Some time ago I already spoke about this service in a more theoretical way ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129488/">Graph of interests: a new principle of interaction in the network</a> ).  Today I want to share practical insights. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82b/3e3/fc8/82b3e3fc8117beca1c1b135940809ec7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How HappLink differs from other networks </h4><br>  In most social networks, people communicate only with those with whom they have already been acquainted before.  In such networks, to add a new person to your social circle, you must first get to know him somewhere outside the network.  It is very unlikely that you will have many common interests around which you will be able to communicate and interact, most of the activity of this person will be completely uninteresting to you.  Because you are connected by your acquaintance, not by your common interests. <br><br>  HappLink is a fundamentally different network, a network of interests.  In this network, people communicate primarily with those who share their interests.  In order to find such people, it is not necessary to be familiar with someone from the beginning - it‚Äôs enough just to be active in one‚Äôs own interests.  And the network itself will connect you with all those who are passionate about the same as you, will help to start your joint communication and find new interesting friends.

    <h4>  How it all works in Happlink </h4><br><h5>  1. Specify your interests. </h5><br>  ‚ÄúYour Interests‚Äù is a key concept in HappLink.  In order for a network to be useful, you must first indicate your true interests: note what you are interested in, what you do, what you understand, what you would like to know or try.  It is not necessary to immediately describe all your interests - Happlink is designed in such a way as to help you do it gradually and deliberately.  If you suddenly did not find your interests, you can create them at any time by making them available to others.  All interests that you add to your own are collected in a special section of your ‚ÄúYour Interests‚Äù profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b4/00b/518/3b400b51812c702030cc15eff5759da2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  2. Keep track of everything related to your interests. </h5><br>  All that people do in HappLink, they are tied to one or another interest.  Any activity can be tied to an unlimited number of interests.  Everything that happens in the network directly around your interests can be monitored with the help of ‚ÄúTape of Interest‚Äù.  Any activity connected with at least one of your interests comes here.  If it seems to you that this activity should not have gotten into your tape, you can untie it from those interests to which it turned out to be wrongly attached.  If several other people, regardless of you, do the same, then this activity is forever decoupled from incorrectly indicated interests for all.  Or vice versa, you can associate someone's activity with the interest that the author of the activity did not even think about.  This is how the collective work on content relevance management (collaborative filtering) works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f78/03c/3f9/f7803c3f912f520e1fe273e8ee7592ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  3. Express yourself according to your interests and get recognition </h5><br>  You can express yourself in the interests of both ‚Äúauthor‚Äù (starting your own publications) or ‚Äúreader‚Äù (noting interesting publications of other people).  For each of your interests, you can see how many publications you have made on it, how many you find interesting for yourself, and also see these publications themselves.  If your publications are interesting to other people, then you earn a reputation for yourself.  There is no common reputation; it is always tied to the interests in which you manifest yourself as an author.  You can have a high reputation in one interest and have no reputation in another.  High reputation for any interest allows you to become the "leader" of this interest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79c/f51/3d5/79cf513d5d0a92f4309ca277687c6e5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  4. Discover new interests. </h5><br>  Each activity in HappLink can be tied to several interests at once.  And if some of them have already been accurately added by you to your interests (otherwise you would not see this activity in your feed), then other interests may turn out to be new to you.  Each interest has its own separate page on which everything connected with it is collected: you can see all the people who indicated this interest to theirs, all the activity shown by the participants of the network in this interest, as well as other interests related to this one.  Network members themselves create interest pages (as well as choose an illustration of interest, its descriptions, synonoims, etc.) <br><br><img src="http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/3601/digest.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  5. Find interesting people. </h5><br>  If you liked someone's publication, you can go into the profile of this person and see what other activity he shows in a particular interest, what his reputation is for each of the interests, how close you are to him in your interests, what interests you at the same time manifest themselves most.  By adding a person to your contacts, you can allow this person to influence the information that you receive for your interests, as well as receive information that is not directly related to your interests, but is relevant to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146710/</a></p>
