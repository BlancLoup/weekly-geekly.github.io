  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Non-standard WLAN organization approach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Usually, wireless networks are the prerogative of open spaces (warehouses, workshops, areas) or small premises (apartments and small offices).  Building a Wi-Fi network of a large office / office building / hotel / hospital / school is a serious headache and a lot of money.  But the recipes are here and very interesting.  We will talk about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Traditionally, wireless in office centers, institutions, hotels / hospitals / schools, etc.  unfolding on the principle of "points in the corridor - users in the rooms."  First of all, this is due to the rather high price of an Enterprise-class access point and the associated desire to put as many users as possible on one point.  Plus, getting cable into the hallway is usually easier than getting into rooms.  But it is this approach that causes problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b67/1b4/67e/b671b467e7dddfb3a6b0f6e23da185a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Firstly</b> , it is quite difficult to provide high-quality radio coverage.  The buildings are large, have a rather complicated architecture, many internal partitions, fire safety regulations require the presence of firewalls, in pre-revolutionary buildings (and the residences of a number of government agencies) wall thickness is measured in meters - all this complicates the passage of the signal.  Even hotels, usually built according to the principle of ‚Äúhall, straight corridor and doors to both sides‚Äù, have their own characteristics: bathrooms most often are located closer to the corridor (and this is a tile on the grid, mirrors, a lot of metal), on the walls of corridors there are often various decorations and the same mirrors (and the reflective coating of the mirror, the essence, metal), the walls separating the rooms from the corridors, must be fire resistant (as the doors).  At the same time, the signal spreads well enough along the corridor, which causes problems of interference between points and complicates channel planning.

      <b>Secondly, the</b> terrible word "repair".  Any experienced SKSnik can tell about customers who first made expensive repairs with Italian marble, and then realized it was about laying a network.  The same thing happens with the wireless - they did not forget to lay out the SCS, but after putting it decided to ‚Äúattach‚Äù Wi-Fi - ‚ÄúBut we do not allow laying only the new cable!‚Äù.  Providing human coverage in such conditions is practically unrealistic.  An example could be a project in a small building (4 floors, atrium), in which one point provided 80% of the coverage, and another 9 were huddled in ‚Äúallowed‚Äù corners, closing the remaining holes.  Again, questions of aesthetics (in an expensive business center or hotel will not tolerate protruding "horns" of powerful antennas) and security (in hospitals and schools). <br><br>  <b>Third</b> , more than 50% of the cost of a wireless network project in a building is the cost of the passive part and the associated work.  If they could have been avoided, the cost and timing of the project could be capitally reduced, and, moreover, the question of paragraph 2 could almost be closed. <br><br>  The solution, however, is fairly obvious.  Remember, at one time 3Com (and possibly other vendors) released an interesting product called <a href="http://www.3com.com/en_US/jump_page/more_lan_ports.html">NJ100</a> ? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49e/d48/728/49ed48728cd999b87745acbedea8e8eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How does this relate to wireless? </h4><br>  As you can see from the picture, this is a switch with 4 Ethernet RJ45 ports (actually from 5), made in the form of a standard SCS outlet.  All ingenious is simple!  Wireless manufacturers went the same way by developing low-cost access points mounted directly on a wall outlet (WallPlate AP). <br><br>  The points are equipped with built-in low-power antennas (sufficient to cover 1-3 adjacent rooms) and designed for operation from a wall outlet (and not from the ceiling), may additionally have several RJ-45 and RJ-11 ports (forwarding the phone), do not require configurations before installation, can work both with the controller, and independently.  At the same time, the installation procedure is usually simplified as much as possible so that an unprepared user copes with it and boils down to several steps: remove the socket, put the mount point, connect the cable, insert (and often just click) the point into the mount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c7/234/c10/4c7234c10571ecc573f35a077d09502e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The installation of the "outlet" point is extremely simple.</i> <br><br>  All of the above fundamentally changes the whole approach to planning - instead of thinking about how to get a signal into the rooms from the corridors, how to better dissolve the cable so that it is inexpensive and repair does not affect how to ensure fault tolerance and normal channel planning - we just set points right where you need coverage.  They can be placed in work rooms, hotel rooms, halls, meeting rooms, conference rooms, corridors, so to speak, ‚Äúfrom the client‚Äù.  On the contrary, walls and other obstacles start helping us - they weaken the interference between neighboring points, which simplifies channel planning (remember, there are only three non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz band).  Also, practically no cable laying is required, which eliminates additional costs for SCS, the interior of the room is not affected (the points intentionally look like telephone sockets). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea2/62c/918/ea262c91899f7c71b404465777d30718.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The use of rosette points radically changes the approach to radio planning.</i>  <i>For the better.</i> <br><br>  To date, there are two subspecies of the WallPlate AP solution.  The first one works over traditional wired Ethernet (for those who already have SCS, but no WLAN).  The second is suitable for those who do not even have SCS, but there is a telephone network based on a PBX (PBX) - in this case, DSL is used. <br><br><h4>  Class one: over Ethernet. </h4><br>  In principle, everything is clear here - we are building a superimposed wireless network on top of the existing Ethernet network on points of a special form factor.  The most well-known solutions are (in order of appearance on the world stage): <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/12883-12883-1137927-3836040-4172284-4273525.html">HP MSM317</a> (the result of the acquisition of HP from Colubris, a hotel specialist), <a href="http://www.ruckuswireless.com/products/zoneflex-indoor/7025">Ruckus Wireless ZoneFlex 7025</a> and <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business%2BProduct%2Band%2BServices/Private%2BBroadband%2BNetworks/AP6511_US-EN">Motorola AP-6511</a> .  The general characteristics for them are: low price (as many points will be needed - small antennas are small), built-in antenna, compactness, ease of installation, PoE power, the ability to provide Ethernet ports (including one port with PoE) .  However, the same outside points are radically different inside, and each is optimal for its scenario. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/619/616/2af/6196162afc357aba6effdbbf673c80b3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From left to right: Motorola AP-6511 (with and without mini-switch attachment), HP MSM317, Ruckus Wireless ZoneFlex 7025</i> <br><br>  <b>HP</b> , in fact, produces a typical ‚Äúthin‚Äù access point in a compact design.  MSM317 works exclusively under the control of the controller.  On the one hand, this is very convenient: you do not need to set up points before installation, dynamic control of radio coverage and channels appears, it is easy to replace, everything is perfectly controlled remotely via HP ProCurve Manager.  Colubris controllers themselves provide the broadest possibilities in terms of user authentication, organizing hotspots, and collecting data for billing.  The most remarkable thing is that, as well as the 3Com switch discussed earlier, the point is mounted in a standard socket for the SCS outlet!  However, there are limiting factors.  802.11n is not supported (at the time of release it simply did not exist), you cannot hide the Ethernet ports from the user, there is no port for forwarding the phone (although this is solved by recompressing the telephone cable under RJ-45, since one port is Passive Pass-Through still there).  The front PoE port gives the device connected to it no more than 8W.  Due to the compact size, the antenna had to be unsoldered directly on the board, the gain was close to zero, and as a result, the power (EIRP) turned out to be 14dBm - 4 times less than the conventional one.  As a result, you need a lot of points. <br><br>  In general, and in general, the focus is on solid corporate installations in an office environment - in the same segment in which the NJ100 was positioned.  Those who are ‚Äúsmaller and simpler‚Äù may be deterred by the need to purchase a controller even for installing 3-10 points, since  by themselves, they do not work, and the inability to support STP on Ethernet ports (you need to invest in a full SCS).  Non-offices (hotels / schools, etc.) definitely do not like the ‚Äústicking out of sight‚Äù RJ-45 ports, in which someone will definitely try to connect and the need to purchase a very large number of points. <br><br>  <b>Ruckus</b> ZoneFlex 7025 stands out for its lowest price, very compact and competent design, support for 802.11n, the ability to purchase a ‚Äúthin‚Äù or standalone version.  Among the shortcomings - again, a low-power antenna and a protrusion on the back of about 4 cm - is not essential when mounted in a box or in a recess in the wall (in place of the socket), but you can‚Äôt mount a point on a flat surface.  Ruckus Wireless is a popular choice of small organizations in the USA and Europe (large ones need full controllability and more power) and know how to please them.  The main drawback is the limited presence in the CIS markets (up to the complete absence in some countries). <br><br>  <b>Motorola</b> (Solutions) AP-6511 seduces users with increased signal power (one and a half times more than HP, for example) and MIMO 2x2 support, which should give much more coverage than competitors with a modular design (nozzles with different ports are available) , different modes of operation: autonomously, under the control of the controller.  Best of all, the AP-6511 can work as a controller for 24 other points!  In fact, Motorola (not much different from the approach of HP) took constructive developments acquired in 2007 by Tut Systems, working in the hotel industry since 1996 and knowing what really works and what doesn't (and by the way, the invented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPNA">HPNA</a> ), and launched the ‚Äúpoint with its modern WiNG 5 platform - the same as in its‚Äú adult ‚Äùline of points and controllers (which allows you to easily mix the AP-6511 with other products on the WiNG5 and expand the network). <br><br>  Among the drawbacks are the dimensions, the price (but because of the greater power, fewer points are needed, and a separate controller is not needed) and limited availability (not all CIS countries are certified).  There is nothing surprising in the total superiority of the point of Motorola is not - it came out last, and the company had the opportunity to look around at the competitors, and even leave a reserve for the future.  As I understand it, this is another step of Motorola‚Äôs strategy to penetrate into ‚ÄúCarpeted Space‚Äù - offices, hotels, universities, where you may need points of different form factors, and nobody wants to build several heterogeneous networks.  (Historically, Motorola sat tightly in retail and logistics - the same place as its mobile computers) <br><br>  <b>So</b> , a customer with SCS can now choose from two specialized solutions - HP (cheaper if it suits and especially good if the LAN is also on HP) and Motorola (more expensive and more versatile).  Small businesses available even cheaper Ruckus (if lucky).  Another popular option is to buy 12 Cisco ‚Äúpoints‚Äù of the WRT or EA series, make 12 SSIDs (HOTEL-AP1‚Ä¶ HOTEL-AP12), hang them on the line of sight and one above the other on the floors, and tune them all to one channel ‚Äúto see each other ‚Äù(or on channels 1,2,3,4,5, .., 12).  Saw both options more than once, it‚Äôs a pity, the Internet is not working well :) <br><br><h4>  And if there is no SCS? </h4><br>  Those who do not have an Ethernet network and Cat5 wiring are invited to work on what is - on the telephone network.  Solutions of this class are offered by Motorola (Private Broadband) and Teledex (ExpressNET AirLink).  In both cases, the scheme is extremely simple - some client equipment (CPE) with DSL and Ethernet / Wi-Fi support (in fact, a VDSL bridge) is installed at the user‚Äôs connection point, and DSLAM is extended at the PBX (PBX), the functionality of which is extended in accordance with specifics of the solution (DHCP, Accounting, management of a large park of CPE, QoS, etc.).  It turns out a kind of corporate adaptation of the well-known PSS, which is called Private Broadband (because the organization‚Äôs own network is used, unlike public access networks).  In fact - the usual VDSL.  But not quite normal ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24e/572/28d/24e57228d02fc3ece70b4d1b578ae795.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>DSL based solution design</i> <br><br>  However, there is a specificity here.  The factors that were previously insignificant come into play.  First, the requirements for cable infrastructure.  Clearly, DSL works well on Cat3, but not every DSL works well on noodles.  Especially if several lines are passing nearby (crosstalk, etc.).  I‚Äôll say right away that both solutions will work poorly with noodles, the speed drops significantly.  On the other hand, if the telephone network is in such a state that conversations of neighbors are heard in the handset, then wireless communication is unlikely to be a top priority on the agenda.  The second significant nuance - the provision of food.  If in the variant with Ethernet the points are powered by PoE, then the telephone network cannot provide 15W.  This means that either an additional 220B socket is required (and it is not always there), or it is necessary to go for tricks.  It is these two factors, plus the functionality of the DSLAM (in essence, the controller) that determine the functionality of the solution.  Also, in this class of solutions, there is almost always a purely wired end equipment - the installation of access points in each room may be redundant, and Ethernet ports may be needed.  Unfortunately, none of the solutions is available on the CIS market "off the shelf" - you need to be clever and deliver. <br><br>  To begin, consider the solution <b>Teledex</b> .  Everything is simple and beautiful here.  Teledex has historically been a supplier of telephones for hotels and institutions.  We will build a VDSL bridge into the phone, an Ethernet port - let's call it ExpressNET.  We will also embed an access point in the phone - we will get ExpressNET AirLink.  Everything is logical and elegant - at one time this decision even received the award ‚ÄúBest New Technology Product 2004‚Äù.  It is very convenient for those who only expand the network or think about its modernization.  However, there are downsides.  Firstly, if the organization already has telephones, they will have to be put somewhere, which is not very interesting in the case of expensive system telephones.  Secondly, to power the access point, you still need a separate power supply (and 220V socket), which is often not enough.  Thirdly, the technology is outdated - access points do not interact with each other, do not work with the controller, which leads to all the problems of the first generation WLAN, and DSL itself does not shine with speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/857/e97/d9c/857e97d9c99d758e35dcedad1aefbdab.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Teledex ExpressNET AirLink is simple and elegant.</i>  <i>An inquisitive reader who has gone to the site or read a datasheet will notice that the phones are being sold under the iPhone label (since 2004!).</i> <br><br>  Motorola's solution includes DSLAM, DSL high speed (up to 75Mbps) and, most importantly, the patented Adaptive Line Power technology - similar to PoE, but for a Cat3 cable with an effective range of up to 300m (600m for a pure wire solution).  It is obvious that in this case no additional power sources and 220V sockets are needed.  This allows you to make subscriber equipment in the form of compact ‚Äúnaps‚Äù on telephone sockets and, more importantly, to install them almost anywhere, which makes this solution unique.  This ensures the forwarding of the RJ-11 port for the "transparent" operation of telephony.  DSLAM in this case performs not only the role of an aggregator and an Ethernet access node, but also a power source for points, a WLAN controller, an AAA server and a QoS control system, providing a complete solution for organizing and operating a multi-service network.  Accordingly, the solution consists of a DSLAM that connects to the cross and provides power, and two types of CPEs - MC-802 (Ethernet + Wi-Fi) and mT2 (Ethernet only).  The solution itself went to Motorola with the acquisition of Tut Systems, so it has nothing to do with other Motorola wireless products, it has its own interface and does not integrate with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17f/b82/1ff/17fb821ff41634c0431b04059f232acf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Motorola MC-802 Wireless Wallplate, its wired brother mT2 and T3 hub controller.</i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  So let's summarize.  The growing popularity of wireless networks has led to the emergence of the need for a new form factor of wireless equipment: from banal access points embedded in hotel telephones to elegant ‚Äúrosettes‚Äù with the functionality of a WLAN controller.  At the same time, rather specific equipment is not expensive.  On the contrary, such a project can be implemented with a budget two times smaller than that required for building a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù WLAN.  The solution is interesting because there is no need to lay out the SCS, if it is not there - it is enough to have a telephone network with a PBX to get both a wireless network and a wired network ‚Äúinto the load‚Äù.  For domestic hotels, this, in fact, provides an opportunity for an instantaneous jump from today's realities to the level of Internet access (wired and wireless), PayTV, IP telephony, providing infrastructure for video surveillance and much more - without having to pull the cable and affect the interior.  It is enough to deploy solutions of the PowerBroadband class and associate it with the billing system.  If there is SCS - offices of any scale can quickly and relatively inexpensively deploy a full-fledged high-speed Wi-Fi 802.11n, which can be easily reconfigured during redevelopments or picked up when moving - regardless of whether they are in a business center or in a historic building with meter by walls.  And if in a historic building it is forbidden even to carry out construction work (to lay out the ACS) - again they will help out DSL solutions.  The network is easily expanded and managed by untrained users.  It seems to me that such a combination of price, simplicity and convenience should be quite in demand in terms of our realities. <br><br>  PS Well, and if there is no wiring at all - you can always build a Wi-Fi Mesh, and connect a point or controller via a 3G modem.  Fortunately, the 5GHz band is already resolved inside buildings, and there is a lot of normal equipment capable of building Mesh in the same 2.4GHz band.  However, the organization Mesh is a separate big topic with its own nuances, pitfalls and marketing omissions of manufacturers. <br><br>  <i>PS The article was previously published (by me) on the " <a href="http://ko.com.ua/node/53946">Computer Review</a> " site, but I think it will be interesting and to the general public. If anyone knows how to put it on the Motorola blog - I will be grateful.</i>  <i>Looks like the blog is dead ...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153069/</a></p>
