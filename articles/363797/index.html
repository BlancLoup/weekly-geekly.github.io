      This year Facebook has acquired the Microsoft Atlas advertising platform, which was the beginning of the process of its rebirth.  Now it can be perceived as a system of tracking the consumer's path to purchase.  Like Google‚Äôs own DoubleClick network, Atlas is not so much an advertising network as an advertising mechanism that allows marketers to build a campaign and track how customers react to brands and, ultimately, make a purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/a94/f16/3fca94f16f694d2e975ac52599d2571d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why is this so important?  Because the traditional way of tracking users with the help of cookies is not relevant when the user leaves the site, logs into the application, and then returns to the site.  In the modern mobile world, where everything is closely interconnected, this user behavior is decisive in making well-thought-out marketing decisions. <br><br>  Understanding the <a href="http://witget.com/blog/kak-povysit-uroven-konversii-celevoj-stranicy-s-pomoshhyu-psixologii-zhelaniya/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D03-12">behaviors and motivations that drive a person to make purchases</a> are critical conditions for identifying gaps in your ordering and sales system.  Being able to track users on a variety of platforms will give you the unique information you need to create a strategy that meets the requirements of consumers at all levels. <br><br>  <b>Flexible payment systems</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://witget.com/blog/kak-sozdavalsya-applepay-revolyucionnaya-sistema-mobilnyx-platezhej/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D03-12">Apple has created its first ApplePay payment system</a> , which it has integrated into the Passbook mobile wallet, and now everyone is looking at PayPal - the world leader in payment systems, which should demonstrate its reaction to this event.  PayPal withdrew from eBay, becoming a publicly traded company and thus creating a certain space for growth.  But can PayPal compete? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/515/2b4/8ff/5152b48ff10449d6b9524e9d8016b27b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Separated from eBay, PayPal was able to maneuver to respond to calls from Apple and other emerging payment systems.  At the moment, they manage to maintain the desired pace. <br><br>  PayPal cannot remain cool after TouchID (Apple) and Alipay (an Alibaba branch) have provided some mobile phone systems with a fingerprint identifier.  Becoming an independent company, PayPal can remain competitive without fear of influence from eBay trading. <br><br>  <b>How can this affect conversion rates?</b> <br><br>  At first glance, it may seem that almost nothing is happening, but as soon as the separation process is fully completed in 2015, PayPal will launch innovative projects and ideas.  In order to hit on Apple, Alibaba and its other competitors.  This company will also use its well-known and trusted brand to catch up in the shortest possible time.  Most likely, new technologies will appear both at the site programming level, and the geographical availability of transactions and the introduction of biometric / mobile payment systems. <br><br>  <b>Bridging the gap between television and applications</b> <br><br>  A television?  Do people still buy through TV?  Oddly enough, yes.  But not the way you imagine it. <br><br>  Delivery Agent - the creators of the ShopTV brand, collaborated with world-famous networks, leading news outlets and cable television to make purchases on TV possible through applications to smartphones.  Their multi-channel marketing has become the best way to combine sales through television and smartphones, available only through modern technology. <br><br>  You may ask, how can this concern you if you are not a producer of a popular TV show? <br>  The fact is that this technology blurs the boundaries between advertising and the consumer even more.  Now it is not just about advertising, but also about the purchase of specific products appearing in this show. <br><br>  For example, in the recent past, the Delivery Agent has signed an agreement with Sony to merge (integrate) its ShopTV application with the SideView application, for organizing more extensive media shopping.  In the case of Sony, it works like this: <br><br>  The TV SideView application offers a dynamic graphical interface that users can install on their smart TV, view lists with it, and manage existing applications.  By integrating ShopTV into TV SideView, the two companies provided their consumers with the opportunity to use the app to search, view, and purchase products while viewing a program or ad.  Sony's TV SideView application is available for smartphones and tablets that have Apple iOS or Google Android platforms.  According to Sony, their application has already been downloaded 4 million times (!). <br><br>  Contextual database owned by Delivery Agent's, displays products online, show, episode, stage or commercial and then offers these products for purchase.  Collaboration with Sony ensures the improvement of technology, which, according to representatives of the company Delivery Agent, is unusually important for the future television trade.  It is about ACR (automatic content recognition - automatic content recognition).  Television networks, content producers and advertisers combine their programs and advertisements with what is in the arsenal of smart TV, that is, an electronic fingerprint identification system, thereby establishing a kind of ‚Äúconnection‚Äù between smart TV and mobile devices. <br><br>  For example, HBO can embed the ACR code in the ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù film (‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù), which is triggered when the hero Targaryen Tech Head Dragon acquires an artifact on the screen, launches the TV SideView application and offers to the person watching this movie, product information about the product and displays the "Buy" button.  The application provides quick ordering for PIN code ShopTV customers.  Also, the seller can carry out a promotion through ShopTV / TV SideView, which will be reflected in the TV SideView, when the TV will advertise his product / service. <br><br>  <b>How can this affect conversion rates?</b> <br><br>  This is one of those conversion optimization technologies that may seem inappropriate at first glance, but since the whole system is in its infancy, there is not a single reason why it cannot be used online as a natural advertisement or retargeting platform.  Many clothing retailers already use the built-in view option, and, when choosing a shirt, for example, they immediately see the accessories that fit it. <br><br>  <b>Using smartphones, it has become easier to use coupons and discount cards for loyal customers.</b> <br><br>  Previously, if you had a coupon or code in a smartphone, and you wanted the seller to scan it, disappointment was waiting for you, since the laser could not read the necessary information from the screen of the smartphone.  Today, this trouble has remained for users of Samsung smartphones in the past. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42d/95b/5ae/42d95b5aef354c368af938e37ae70a8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since it is easier to refine the technology of a smartphone, than to change the 165 million laser scanners used in different outlets, you can now cash a coupon or a discount card for loyal customers using Samsung devices.  Newer laser terminals solve the problem entirely with optical scanners. <br><br>  <b>How can this affect conversion rates?</b> <br><br>  If you are a store owner who has always wanted to raise the level of customer engagement, using a branded app with coupons and reward programs for loyal customers, then this is the very opportunity you have been waiting for.  Mobeam, the company behind the recognition technology, claims that more than 140 million smartphones already equipped with their technology will be sold worldwide by the end of the year. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about it?</b> <br><br>  The biggest temptation associated with the advent of the next technology is to rebuild all of its marketing strategy for it, in the hope that this is a kind of ‚Äúmagic pill‚Äù that will surely breathe new life into the conversion level of your resource. <br><br>  But be careful not to fall under the influence of dubious benefits.  The best way to increase your conversion rate is to watch how the technology helps the customer to get what they want (what they need, not what you think is right for them; <a href="http://witget.com/blog/oprosy-na-sajte-kak-interpretirovat-poluchennye-rezultaty/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D03-12">polls can help to find out the true needs</a> ). <br><br>  What do you think of these innovations in conversion optimization?  Do you see the potential of these advertising technologies?  Share your thoughts with us! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363797/</a></p>
