A total of 3 episodes will be presented.  This is necessary to ensure that the conclusions that will be presented in the final article are not unfounded, but supported by actual experience and facts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thoughts about survival, be it a global catastrophe or just a car breakdown far from the city, many of us periodically visit in one way or another.  Many on the basis of these disturbing thoughts try to prepare themselves for such a coincidence of circumstances.  Then one day a group of enthusiasts, united by this idea, gathered to conduct a training trip for survival.  At a certain forum, there was a long discussion about how this will all be modeled.  And as a result of a long debate, everything was divided into 2 stages.  The first stage was experimental, and it was to try to povyshivat and evaluate what exactly is important in events of this kind and build a more adequate model for the second stage.  Here is what was invented to start: <br><br>  <u>Terrain conditions</u> : <br>  Presence in the vicinity of a water source.  Forest.  Desirable river.  Remoteness from settlements.

      <u>Conditions for participants</u> : <br>  Each could take no more than 10 items of clothing (counting each sock and each shoe for 1 item).  Allowed to take cameras. <br><br>  <u>Everyone had to take</u> : <br>  1. Knife (any shape and size) in the sheath. <br>  2. Empty tin can (instead of a mug and to maintain the entourage) <br>  3. One bonus indivisible holistic item. <br>  4. Required individual medications <br>  5. <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582">Karemat</a> <br><br>  All items and things should be placed on the participant or in the hands, i.e.  bags and backpacks are excluded (as an exception, I was allowed to take a backpack with a camera and all personal belongings to it). <br><br>  <u>The organizers had</u> : <br>  Common bowler, lens, flint, matches, first aid kit and all sorts of small charms for testing in conditions of survival. <br><br>  The season is summer.  Venue - Rostov region. <br>  We had 3 full days for everything.  The time and place were set, and at the appointed hour it all began.  We plunged into transport.  There was a surprise waiting for us - we were blindfolded.  It was interesting, because  we could not know where we are and where we are going.  This added entourage.  It has long been dark.  Eyes are still tied up.  Then we, holding on to one another, already in the dark walked several kilometers to the final place of deployment. <br><br>  Survival began. <br>  At the same time, a pleasant and frightening feeling of absolute freedom.  In this situation, the primary resource was water, and several people were sent to the spring with a pot.  The rest remained to make a fire.  It was summer and there were a lot of things around that caught fire well.  They made a fire, burnt dry a grass grass with a flint.  I must note that a bit of fresh water and a campfire were enough for us to be happy.  The feeling of hunger was surprisingly absent, as I understood because of the attunement of consciousness that there would be no food.  Rain was coming, and here the bonus item of one of the participants saved us - he took a few square meters with him.  meters of polyethylene, which fit under almost all.  Not less necessary subject was the bonus rope, which this polyethylene was attached to the trees. <br><br>  The next day, the duties were distributed in a natural way: women processed food-material, which was mined by men from everywhere.  There was no particular desire, and the search for food was reinforced mainly by interest.  Everything went to the food: roots of all kinds of plants, famous berries, young reed shoots, wild apples, hand-picked grain, snails, crayfish, mussels, fish (the last three products were given to us by the river), other edible objects and even a snake.  From the best raw materials cooked soup.  I have not eaten such a tasty soup in any Chinese restaurant :).  Separately, I want to mention a roasted viper: it surprisingly resembles a chicken, only more tender and tastier.  After the ‚Äúdinner‚Äù the stereotype ‚Äúand what are we going to eat there?‚Äù Finally breaks down.  There comes the realization that wildlife can give a lot of food, especially in summer.  In the city we eat really more than the body needs.  The rest of the day was spent on idle rest and experimenting with a fire. <br><br>  <u>Making fire</u> <br>  In this exit, we were able to easily make a fire in 3 ways: using a lens, a fire and a ‚Äúspell‚Äù.  On the breeding of fire by friction - a separate conversation. <br><br>  <b>Lens</b> <br><br>  If you are lucky and the sun is shining, and there is a lot of dry <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582">tinder</a> on hand, then by focusing the sun's rays at one point you can get a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãdecay that can be further inflated to the formation of a flame.  Until that time, I never made a fire in this way, but I mastered it rather quickly.  So, after half an hour or an hour with the lens, you will intuitively understand what to do and how and in the future you will do it almost immediately.  Robinson method, romantic, but very demanding of many conditions.  Overcast or damp, late evening or night, rain outside, and you are in the shelter - the method no longer works.  Those.  Taking a lens with you instead of traditional means is a big risk of being left without a fire.  But if you stayed on a desert tropical island, and only a camera out of things, then all is not lost.  :) <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE"><b>Flint</b></a> <br><br>  Great tool for breeding fire.  The essence is simple - with a knife at an angle of 45 degrees make intensive movements along the rod of the flint, at the end of the trajectory you will have a bunch of sparks.  When you get comfortable, even a small short-term flame will be produced. <br><img src="http://hotimg22.fotki.com/a/87_117/60_190/IMG_0263_resize.jpg" alt="Flint"><br>  The only negative is some damage to the knife blade.  Instead of a knife, you can quite successfully use the sharp edge of a broken stone.  The method is very good, perhaps the most immediate and effective of all available.  Flint is not afraid of water, is not afraid of mechanical damage, takes up little space and is durable in service.  Even if you have nothing but flint, night and it rains, you are most likely to make a fire. <br><br>  <b>"Spell"</b> <br><br>  Take a little crystalline <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">potassium permanganate</a> and pour out of it a small handful with a recess in the center.  In the center drip a large drop of ordinary glycerin.  Wait for a while.  First, the mixture will begin to sizzle and smoke, and then flare up.  The reaction time depends on the temperature and humidity of the air.  The method got its name because while we were waiting for the effect, we read improvised spells in Latin.  As it turned out, a variety of charlatans and pseudo-sorcerers around the world use this technique to fool people.  Potassium permanganate will not work if it is damp.  And it dampens much easier than matches.  Glycerin - liquid, is stored in the bottle, which makes it easily traumatized.  Therefore, this method is interesting though, in terms of spontaneity and reliability is no better than matches, which also need to be kept dry, but which are much easier to use.  Just know, if you have no matches, but there is a first-aid kit - rummage through it, all of a sudden there will be something incendiary. <br><br>  <b>Firing fire</b> <br><br><img src="http://hotimg16.fotki.com/a/87_117/60_190/IMG_3378_resize.jpg" alt="tools for the extraction of fire by friction"><br>  We all by that time saw a lot of pictures and read a lot of literature on how to make fire by friction.  As it should be, we made a bow, found a log and made a recess in it, found a flat stick.  From the pictures in the books, the spinning stick is pressed on top by a pebble, but we still could not find a suitable pebble, despite the fact that there were rocks and a lot of stones nearby.  We used a different log instead, also with a small hole.  Usually, 3 people were involved: one twisted his wand with a bow, the second held the lower log, the third - held the upper support.  And the process has begun ... <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq8zG5B6Hsw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjfNkMfBZWdFJgdbBCRdHYlH_fxxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  From the abundance of smoke it seemed as if a light was about to appear.  But no.  When it got dark there was not a single person who did not try to do it.  We have refuted the theory that there is no smoke without fire.  Smoke poured rocker, but the fire was not.  All the next day we spent on attempts to bring the matter to the end.  But - in vain.  Now, when I tried it myself, one can immediately see the flaws and the catch on all the videos on this subject on the Internet.  For example, it is often possible to see how a little powder or saltpeter with sugar, or the same mixture, from a method with a spell is put under a stick.  I don‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs impossible to make a fire with this method, I‚Äôm just trying to convey what‚Äôs not so easy to do.  It became obvious to us that in order to succeed in this matter, the correct combination of wood species of all elements of the ‚Äúfiery machine‚Äù, as well as a big bow, is necessary.  I cannot draw conclusions about this method, because I have not achieved any result.  I would be immensely grateful if someone would show me how <b>to honestly</b> make a fire in this way. <br><br>  <b>General conclusions</b> <i>(or what we understood and what came to this exit)</i> : <br><br>  <b>A knife</b> is a very important thing for survival.  If you have a knife - the probability of salvation increases many times.  Everything is done with a knife - it is cut, chopped, rummaged, hunted, eaten, sharpened, etc.  Already after, reading the literature, I studied for a long time the question of what a survival knife should be.  Checked knowledge in campaigns, in practice.  And he came to this conclusion: the knife should be inconsistent, medium in size, as simple and reliable as possible.  Forget about garbage with all sorts of personal belongings in the handle, these knives are scattered into pieces during normal operation. <br><br>  <b>Food</b> for the normal functioning of the body needs much less than we used to eat.  I repeat: wildlife can give a lot of food, especially in summer.  In the city we eat really more than the body needs.  And in general, the last thing you need to think about food in an extreme situation.  If there is nothing, then the feeling of hunger disappears completely on the second or third day.  Without food, a person is able to function normally for at least 2 weeks. <br><br>  Explore edible and inedible plants, berries, herbs and other gifts of nature in the area where you have to survive.  On this trip we could live for a long time on the roots of burdock alone, of which there were a great many.  We baked them in the fire, fried them, cooked them and simply ate them raw.  (By the way - I recommend, it reminds a cucumber by smell, and by its consistency, taste and color - sweet potato) <br><br>  The priority of life-important entities is: <br>  1 - Water.  Without water, you will not be able to act in 2-3 days and die in 5-7 days. <br>  2 - Shelter.  If conditions are harsh, then without shelter from the cold and wind, you will lose power very quickly. <br>  3 - Fire.  Keeping warm is just as important as finding shelter.  Also on the fire to boil water so as not to get poisoned and cook food.  Therefore, it is important to learn how to quickly make a fire. <br><br>  These items may be interchanged depending on the circumstances.  Everything else is optional and depends on the situation, but if you have these 3 entities, then you are almost saved. <br><br>  PS <br>  If the public likes this information, I still have something to write and share. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42382/</a></p>
