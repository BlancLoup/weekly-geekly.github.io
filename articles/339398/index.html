It became clear that under this topic you can put together a good conference, which I will tell you today. <br><br>  <b>Tasty</b> : we decided to gather scientists, practical engineers, architects and put emphasis on technology under one roof - it would seem to be a common thing, but no. <br><br>  <b>Difficult</b> : digging deeper, you can see that everyone is engaged in separate issues not together, but apart.

      Scientists build neural networks in theory, architects make distributed systems for corporations with the goal of processing huge data flows in real time, without the ultimate goal of unifying access to them, practical engineers write all this software for very narrow tasks, which then cannot be transferred to something something else.  In general, everyone digs his bed and does not climb to the neighbor ... So?  No! <br><br>  <b>In fact</b> : Everyone is engaged in a part of the general.  As Smart Data itself (and ‚Äúsmart data‚Äù is a very narrow translation) is by its nature, so those who work with it, in fact, make a distributed network of various developments that can sometimes create unexpected combinations.  This forms the foundation of smart data in its beauty and practical significance. <br><br>  So, what kind of puzzle pieces and who creates them, you can see and even discuss with the creators at the conference <a href="https://smartdataconf.ru/">SmartData 2017 Piter</a> October 21, 2017. Details under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://smartdataconf.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/50/59d750f885448548107277.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Further there will be many letters, we are for big and smart data, although historically the announcement implies a fast and capacious text, as short and precise as a sniper shot on a clear summer night. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Usually we divide all the reports into three or four categories, but this is not the case; each report is an independent story. <br><br><h2>  <b>First was the Name.</b>  <b>And "The name is a feature"</b> </h2><br>  The ambiguity and hackneyedness of the name (even we exploit this turnover for the second time in a month), it would seem, beyond good and evil.  But this is not even close to the content of the opening keynout Vitaly Khudobakhshov. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/dc/59d5dc930b6b7102922025.jpeg">  <b>Keynout: Vitaliy <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/khud/" class="user_link">khud</a> Khudobakhshov - ‚ÄúName is a feature‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Strange as it may seem to an educated person, the probability of being lonely / lonely "depends" on behalf of.  We will talk about love and relationships, or rather, what exactly the social network data can tell about it.  It is about the same as saying: <i>‚ÄúThe probability of being hit by a car, if your name is Seryozha, is higher than if you were called Kostya!‚Äù</i> It sounds pretty crazy, isn't it?  Well, at least, unscientific. <br><br>  Thus, we will talk about the most unexpected and counterintuitive observations that can be made using data analysis in social networks.  Of course, we will not ignore the issues of the statistical significance of such observations, the effect of bots and false correlations. <br><br>  In general, Vitaly Khudobakhshov has one of the largest bases for analytics in our country.  Vitaly has been accessing her since 2015 as a leading analyst at Odnoklassniki, where he deals with various aspects of data analysis. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/e0/59d5e0d1cff02006417847.jpeg">  <b>Dmitry Bugaychenko - ‚ÄúFrom click to forecast and back: Data Science pipelines in OK‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Vitaly‚Äôs smart data and Dmitry‚Äôs machine learning are connected, even parts of their life paths are somewhat similar.  Big data analysis in Odnoklassniki became for Dmitry a unique chance to combine theoretical training and a scientific foundation with the development of real, sought-after products.  And he gladly took this chance, having come there five years ago. <br><br>  During the report, we will talk about the processing and storage technologies of the Hadoop ecosystem, as well as many other things.  This report will be useful to those engaged in machine learning, not only for fun, but also for profit. <br><br>  As an example, consider one complex task - personalizing the news feed OK.  Without going into details, we will discuss data collection (batch and real-time), ETL, as well as the processing necessary to obtain the model. <br><br>  But just getting a model is not enough, so we will also talk about how to get model-based predictions in a complex, highly loaded distributed environment and how to use them to make decisions. <br><br>  And if you still want to be completely immersed in the algorithmization of machine learning in practice and working with big data, then the dialogue is better with the person who has passed one of the toughest schools on algorithms in the country (School of Data Analysis - SAD).  Meet: Anna Veronika Dorogush. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/e1/59d5e138bb6be359366964.jpeg">  <b>Anna Veronika Dorogush - ‚ÄúCatBoost is the next generation of gradient boosting‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Dual name, as a double direction of the report on the features of the new open gradient boosting algorithm CatBoost from Yandex.  The report will discuss how the technology was developed, which is able to work with categorical characteristics, and why put it into open access.  Also about CatBoost will be the answers to the eternal: what (apply)?  where (works)?  who (should pay attention)? <br><br>  The report will be useful to machine learning and data specialists: after listening to it, they will gain an understanding of how to use CatBoost most effectively and where it can benefit right now. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/e3/59d5e3c6731ea950864107.jpeg">  <b>Artyom <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ortemij/" class="user_link">ortemij</a> Grigoriev - ‚ÄúCrowdsourcing: how to tame a crowd?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  A couple of experts from OK, a couple from Yandex is already a crowd, and with it a fourth, ‚Äúother‚Äù task in the report, this time even more applied.  In machine learning and data analysis tasks, it is often necessary to collect a large amount of manual markup.  With a small number of performers, work may take months.  Artem is going to show how this can be done quickly and cheaply!  And this experience can be transferred to other tasks (and they definitely are), where many performers are required for a limited time.  The report, based on the experience of creating and using Toloki, the crowdsourcing platform of Yandex, will address issues of quality control, the motivation of performers, as well as various models of aggregation of markup results. <br><br>  Artem in Yandex since 2010, head of the group, is responsible for developing the infrastructure for collecting expert assessments, developing services for assessors and the crowdsourcing platform Yandex.Toloka. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/e4/59d5e47e4d97c079876940.jpeg">  <b>Alexander <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/alexkrash/" class="user_link">alexkrash</a> Krasheninnikov - ‚ÄúHadoop high availability: Badoo experience‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Big and smart data requires a certain infrastructure.  Let's be honest - very demanding.  What to choose? <br><br>  Hadoop infrastructure is a popular solution for tasks such as distributed storage and data processing.  Good scalability and a developed ecosystem captivate and provide Hadoop with a solid place in the infrastructure of various information systems.  But the more responsibility is placed on this component, the more important it is to ensure its resiliency and high availability. <br><br>  Alexander's report will be about ensuring the high availability of components of the Hadoop cluster.  In addition, let's talk: <br><br><ul><li>  about the "zoo" with which we deal;  * </li><li>  why to ensure high availability: system failure points and consequences of failures; </li><li>  about the means and solutions available for this; </li><li>  on practical implementation experience: preparation, deployment, testing. </li></ul><br>  The report will be most useful to those who already use Hadoop (to enhance their knowledge).  Another part of the audience will be interested in the report from the point of view of the architectural solutions used in this software package. <br><br>  <i>* Alexander, like no one else, understands what a ‚Äúzoo‚Äù is.</i> <br><br>  He himself is the Head of DataTeam at Badoo.  He is engaged in the development of tools for data processing in the framework of ETL and processing of various kinds of statistics, Hadoop infrastructure.  Experience web dev more than 10 years.  For best results, do not shun the use of explosive mixtures of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Java, PHP, Go), databases (MySQL, Exasol) and distributed computing technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Presto). <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/ee/59d5ee0c66800743011569.jpeg">  <b>Alexander Sibiryakov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/asibiryakov/" class="user_link">asibiryakov</a> - "Automatic search for contact information on the Internet"</b> <br><br>  The more data, the more ‚Äúinformational garbage‚Äù.  After working for five years in Yandex and two years in Avast!  As an architect, Alexander built the automatic resolution of false positives.  After that, interest in data processing in large volumes and information retrieval only intensified, as it usually happens with the case that you really like. <br><br>  Alexander's report will talk about a distributed robot for crawling the web, searching for and retrieving contact information from corporate websites.  In fact, these are two components: a <b>web robot</b> for receiving content and a separate <b>application</b> for analysis and extraction. <br><br>  The main focus of the report will be on self-extraction, on finding a working architecture, a sequence of algorithms, and ways to collect training data.  The report will be useful to anyone who works with the processing of web data or provides solutions for processing large amounts of data. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/ef/59d5efa56fbc5260928284.jpeg">  <b>Alexey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/natekin/" class="user_link">natekin</a> Natekin - ‚ÄúCards, boosting, 2 chairs‚Äù</b> <br><br>  According to the general opinion of my colleagues, Alexey is quite charismatic, which is well linked to the fact that he is the dictator and coordinator of Open Data Science, the largest online community in Eastern Europe, Data Scientists.  In addition to the above, Alexey is a producer of serious machine learning and data analysis projects. <br><br>  And now about the report.  Everyone loves gradient booming.  It shows excellent results in most practical applications, and the phrase ‚Äústack xgboost‚Äù has become a meme.  As a rule, we are talking about booster decision trees, and use the CPU and machines with a bunch of RAM for training.  Recently, many people bought video cards for various reasons and decided: why don't we start boosting on them, while neural networks on the GPU are significantly accelerated.  Unfortunately, not everything is so simple: there are realizations of GPU boosting, but there are many nuances in their utility and meaningfulness.  Let's try together to figure out on the report of Alexey - do you need a video card in 2017-2018 to train a gradient boost? <br><br>  PS By the way, information has its own expiration date, moreover, each type of data is different.  So, in the case of Alexey, another photo was provided, it can be viewed on <a href="https://smartdataconf.ru/2017/spb/talks/4nmhnhvppquc2gwei6moaa/">the conference website</a> in order to identify him correctly. <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/f4/59d5f4a0dacca458016211.jpeg">  <b>Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/snikolenko/" class="user_link">snikolenko</a> Nikolenko - <s>Another victory for robots: AlphaGo and deep learning with reinforcement</s> ‚ÄúDeep convolutional networks for object detection and image segmentation‚Äù</b> <br><br>  And this is a vivid illustration of another information expiration date: while this post was being prepared, the whole concept of the report had changed. <br><br>  As a result, in Sergey‚Äôs report we will discuss how networks that recognize individual objects turn into networks that distinguish objects from among the masses of others.  We will talk about the famous YoLo, and about single-shot detectors, and about the line of models from R-CNN to the most recently appeared Mask R-CNN.  And in principle that convolutional neural networks have long been the main class of models for image processing, and we live with it. <br><br>  By the way, this is not all the data that can be obtained from Sergey Nikolenko - a specialist in machine learning (deep learning, Bayesian methods, word processing, and much more) and algorithm analysis (network algorithms, competitive analysis).

In the report we will look at what Audit-Driven Development is and where it came from, show you how to organize a bitemporal repository of facts so as not to screw up before the controlling authorities, and prove that any modern distributed system simply has to have a time machine built in.  Also during the presentation, the ‚Äúuniversal formula of fact‚Äù will be revealed and the more often the tasks of the so-called ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù turn out to be. <br><br>  A little about the speaker, or rather, a lot: Vladimir graduated with honors from the Mathematical Support Department of the Saint-Petersburg Electrotechnical University ‚ÄúLETI‚Äù and has been developing software for state, educational and financial institutions, as well as automotive and telecommunications concerns for more than 14 years.

Then the report of Ivan Drokin about deep convolutional networks found its audience. <br><br>  <b>"We need to go deeper"</b> <br><br>  Currently, deep convolutional networks are <b>state-of-the-art</b> algorithms in many computer vision problems.  However, most of these algorithms require huge training samples, and the quality of the model depends entirely on the quality of the data and their quantity.  In a number of tasks, data collection is difficult or sometimes impossible. * <br><br>  In the report, we consider an example of learning of deep convolutional networks for localizing key points of an object on a fully synthetic data set. <br><br>  <i>* In one such experiment, data was collected by questioning and digitized by the students of one of the universities as part of a thesis.</i>  <i>Processing one array, even with the availability of modern means of working with data, took 2 weeks only to enter data into the system.</i>  <i>And for the combat project of these data is required many times more.</i>  <i>Do you have extra ‚Äústudent‚Äù forces to collect this data?</i>  <i>Not?</i>  <i>Then, I hope, you have put in the plan and the report of Artem Grigoriev.</i> <br><br>  Immersion Instructor - Ivan Drokin, co-founder and chief science officer of the company Brain Garden, specializing in the development and implementation of intelligent full-cycle solutions.

Ambassador to Russia of the Open Knowledge Foundation. <br><br>  Why this data?  Ivan‚Äôs biography is the best introduction to his report on open government data. <br><br>  The public policy of open data in Russia and in the world allows unlimited number of users to provide access to data created in government.

And, of course, how to access and use them in your project.  In addition, the data are not always reliable, errors accumulate in them, so let‚Äôs see how these errors can be taken into account. <br><br>  <i>Maybe, if they are already collected from us in such quantity, it is time to use them?</i> <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/fe/59d5fe76c1fa9864486071.jpeg">  <b>Mikhail Kamalov - ‚ÄúRecommender systems: from matrix expansions to in-depth learning in continuous mode‚Äù</b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> "And to this report, we recommend that you take the report of Artem Marinov, which would best emphasize the practical significance of this material." </font></font><br>  Nothing like? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At present, recommender systems are actively used both in the field of entertainment (Youtube, Netflix), and in the field of Internet marketing (Amazon, Aliexpress). </font></font> In this regard, the report will discuss the practical aspects of the use of in-depth training, collaborative and content filtering and time filtering as approaches in recommender systems.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Additionally, the construction of hybrid recommender systems and modification of approaches for online learning at Spark will be considered. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immersion into practical systems for ordinary users, which we are with you, will be carried out under the guidance of Mikhail Kamalov, Analyst at EPAM Systems since 2016, an expert in the field of NLP tasks and information retrieval. </font></font><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/fe/59d5fef7ec070035092574.jpeg"> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Andrei Boyarov - ‚ÄúDeep Learning: Recognizing Scenes and Points of Interest in Images‚Äù</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To everyone who came to this place - our thanks for their patience and interest. As already mentioned at the beginning of this article, in the field of big and smart data there are no studies and reports divorced from the general mission.

Here we need to highlight among all the images of the scenes those on which there are various famous places: palaces, monuments, squares, temples, etc. However, in solving this problem, it is important to ensure a low level of false positives. The report will consider the solution of the problem of recognition of sights based on a neural network for scene recognition. </font></font><br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/ff/59d5ffe65287d320740316.jpeg"> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alexander </font></font><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/alexserbul/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">AlexSerbul</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Serbul - ‚ÄúApplied machine learning in e-commerce: scenarios and architecture of pilots and combat projects‚Äù</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Being practically at the finish line of creating our network of reports, it is nevertheless necessary to check with practical experience.
