I do not want to analyze articles or something else.  I just want to express my thoughts on how you can be satisfied with your work (again, no matter what). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Man is so arranged, especially Russian, that he is always looking for those guilty of his personal troubles, problems, and failures.  Now think about it, you don't care, even if not now, there were problems with work, superiors, subordinates, colleagues.  Why all?  Who is guilty? <br><br>  Let's start with the earlier eras in your work, namely with the problems.  Create an abstraction. <br><br>  Here is an employee John.  The average person, average income, all average.  And naturally, he has the average " <s>insectoids</s> cockroaches in my head."  There is this John and friends at work, and there are also ill-wishers.

      By the way, to have well-wishers and "well-wishers" at work is quite common.  From this you can not escape.  Even if it seems to you that everything is open at your work, everyone is happy about each other, etc., then this is a small illusion.  I assure you that there will be someone whom in a critical situation you will hate and who will be guilty of something in front of the team or in front of you personally.  But this is so - for a bunch of paragraphs. <br><br>  In general, John, he knows how to do his job well.  Inserts a joke somewhere, aids somewhere.  But, let's say, he has a small drawback (for the team) - he gets tired, and not that he plowed like a draft horse - everyone is tired.  And he gets tired at the most unexpected moments.  In the middle of the week, before the deadline.  In general, it does not matter.  And let him not let anyone down, but it makes you nervous (well, at least a bit).  Actually, periodically everyone grumbles at him. <br><br>  And now let's move from description to essence.  The person was modeled, patterns can also be applied to him.  (further from the first person). <br>  ‚ÄúOh, how to get up, another fucking day and day off.  Washed, seagull slammed.  How hard it is to distract from the book / film / cat / wife (hereinafter and the choice).  Let's go to work.  *at work*.  Eh, the deadline is close, but there is no mood at all today: I‚Äôll work so that I can see, tomorrow, perhaps, I‚Äôll finish the mood quickly, there I‚Äôll do it ... * in N-hours *.  Oh, the boss came.  What does he need again?  he said all tomorrow.  Pro bonuses says.  And what - I will finish everything tomorrow, why should I face bonuses?  Here's a bastard, we have a chef.  The mood has fallen even more - I will not work. ‚Äù <br>  And so on. <br><br>  An example is of course a trivial one, but I hope it is clear and understandable why a person does not work, why the ‚ÄúkAZel‚Äù boss.  Who is to blame?  Wrong - John and guilty. <br><br>  Self-blame is certainly not an option, but you should often look around and understand the reason for your mood.  (This is the way to self-motivation, self-stimulation - <i>I will exaggerate in another topic, promise!</i> ). <br><br>  As a result, John may have trouble at work.  After all, the team (if he works not alone, but in a team) is not to blame for the fact that he is in a bad mood and he (the team) is not to blame for the fact that John does not want to work. <br><br>  And now let's turn to another abstraction.  More precisely, more specifically we will abstract ourselves. <br><br>  It‚Äôs probably pointless to give advice here, each person is his own master and is free to do what he wants, <b>if the</b> rights of another person are not infringed (the ‚Äúparadox of freedom‚Äù).  But, let's start with ourselves, we will create our own mood, we motivate ourselves, we see, and it will work out. <br><br>  Here we are (in the sense of everyone reading this <s>nonsense</s> habratopik, well, I'm with you).  We have current problems, and they are from the most different areas of our life, even here we can not talk about work - there is enough of that.  We have, again, cockroaches, <br><br>  Let's say you were late for work, traveling by minibus (the tram did not arrive) and were late.  (here the general case, do not exaggerate if it does not suit you) <br>  You got up a little later, were going slowly - well, you know how much time you need to arrive at work with a small margin (in 5 minutes).  They came to work, the boss cursed.  The boss is a goat.  Is it so?  I think no.  What prevented to get up 10-20 minutes earlier?  Take a shower, or do something to bring yourself to a vigorous state.  Get out early and have time left for force majeure.  The most important thing is that some do not understand, ‚Äúhow is it so - to work early?‚Äù Well, like this - if you like work, you can come early.  My friend came an hour earlier to rake up the mail, finish all the hated bureaucracy and already all 8 hours, almost everlastingly, to do his favorite thing - programming. <br><br>  Of course, it is clear to every employee that the bureaucracy slows down the whole process, everyone is trying to optimize it.  And part of us thinks that bureaucracy is useless.  I hasten to upset you - bureaucracy is needed, without it, of course you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to offer a more optimized version of the turnover document, maybe your version can help, and to everyone. <br><br>  If you have a motivator for bureaucracy, that's good.  If not, try to accept for yourself that bureaucracy is needed.  Take it - do not run away from it, reports, plans or something else - this is necessary, and for yourself.  With this all in your hands, you yourself can evaluate your work.  Well, based on your result, look at how much your score differs from the higher one.  Well, it does not interfere with conclusions. <br><br>  Next, let's look at the team.  Teamwork is generally a complicated thing.  And the more firm, the more problems inside.  How to understand the surrounding reality and decide how you can get along with all.  Yes, you are not ‚Äúaware‚Äù, you can get along with everyone, depending on how you behave.  It is not necessary to be the soul of the collective, it is not necessary to be an outcast in order to abstract.  Here, oddly enough, we must also understand the origins of the problems.  Start naturally with yourself. <br><br>  We were in the company, in our department, a whiner.  Here he was all bad, the bosses are bad, the staff (not all of course) are bad.  Well, it all turned out badly for him.  He himself tuned in that he does not want to work.  But initially, he worked poorly, his boss started to reprimand, he could not cope with his tasks, and he dropped out of the ‚Äúnormals‚Äù in the department.  In general, in the end, he was offended at all in the whole wide world.  Enemies are everywhere, any boss imposes on him a job, the general in general is an ‚Äúevil rajah.‚Äù  Telek also imposes everything.  br-rr-rr.  I personally would not want to live like this.  Yes, there are failures in life.  But to sit still, doing nothing or doing poorly, complaining about fate is too much. <br><br>  Well, imagine how they will communicate with this person in a team?  No one who wants to listen to, kill mood, words. <br><br>  Again, it is necessary to ‚Äúlove‚Äù the work (almost the simplest).  Work should at least like.  Ideally, it should be fun.  And let it be not from the process, but from the result, from the consequences, from the anticipations.  Stimulate yourself at least with what you can get - fantasize. <br><br>  In any case, any team - there is always a hierarchy, even among colleagues of the same level.  Peculiar hazing.  And then it all depends on you.  How will you behave in this team?  Step back or participate in life like everyone else, create this team. <br><br>  Yes, I agree, there are individuals who shy away from the collective.  But they are quite rare.  A person lives in society and it is desirable to join the social at work, even if you are disgusted ... or scary ... or uncomfortable.  Believe me, sometimes people are better than computers :-) <br><br>  By the way, changing jobs is an extreme measure.  To the stupid end, of course, do not need to die.  But running every six months from one office to another is not worth it. <br><br>  On account of the fact that they are cashing in at our expense.  What can I say?  Yes, there is such a thing, but we all also profit from something.  We all work for the sake of "profit."  Only here the volume of this profit and the meaning of this profit is different for everyone.  Again, do not blame the boss in a big zp.  and taking the money from you.  Grow, learn, apply knowledge and either you will understand the boss or you will become the same.  There are small exceptions, but very few of them.  Many work and then change because of the greater z.p. <br><br>  In general, in order to be a happy worker it is not necessary that the little birds sing around, the little angels fly :-) Start with yourself, and your good mood will either reconfigure the surrounding team, or will look with perplexity.  Do you know how, that you saw a happy man?  Just remember, if you are impressed by this person, then you are unwittingly happy for him, and then you yourself are already in a good mood.  Familiar? <br><br>  I wanted to abstain from the advice, but to bring a monologue to something necessary.  It‚Äôs all clear, ‚Äùyou say,‚Äú start with yourself and all that, you could say a couple of sentences (censor note).  By this reasoning and tedious monologue, I meant the following.  If you want to change your life for the better, start with yourself.  Trite?  Yes.  Is old  Not.  Do not be afraid to change something and make mistakes.  Trouble will always haunt you.  Small or large - it does not matter.  This is an experience and it will help you to have mostly small mistakes. <br>  I will not urge you to strict and precise execution of some rules.  It's boring.  Invent your own solutions to your problems.  Invent your own ways of expressing interest in working and raising your mood.  To read and apply the experience of professionals is not for everyone.  Whatever they say, no matter what ‚Äúcool‚Äù ideas are put forward, what pearls in books they write, nothing and no one will change you as much as you need for the better.  Well, "if you want to do something well, do it yourself." <br>  Working in a team - do not forget, you are part of a team.  Loneliness is not the best choice (and the network also does not replace live communication) and, believe me, it is better to work at least together. <br><br>  In general, live, work, enjoy life and simple things.  Embellish and surprise your world, nobody will do it for you.  Vobschem hold the tail gun! <br><br>  UPD: an employee had a question, what if he got into a vicious circle? <br>  boring-&gt; low working capacity-&gt; falling reputation-&gt; falling self-esteem-&gt; self-digging-&gt; boring ... <br><br>  If it were 3 years ago, I would quit, drop everything and go to another place. <br>  And now ... what ideas? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81941/</a></p>
