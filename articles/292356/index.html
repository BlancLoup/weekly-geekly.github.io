      By the way, there will be several articles on the main topic - to understand the psychology of making a purchase on the Internet, there will be sub-paragraphs in the process of creating the material and referring to the value system and perception system. <br>  Important preface <br><br>  Perhaps the reader is now awaiting the discovery of new truths, secrets or previously inconceivable technologies of product promotion, but I assure you that you will not read anything new, however, perhaps ... and only, perhaps, this text will push you to the realization of simple and ordinary things in this vast world. promotion and constant race of brands, which will be the very discoveries of the Truths.  Or maybe not, we do not yet know. <br><br><h4>  System of values </h4><br>  Try to answer the question, do you know what a value system is?  Try looking at Wikipedia and grasp.  Each person lives, relying on his own system of values, which he is guided by in making one or another choice.  So this is the secret of successful promotion, if your product, site, product (no matter how you call it) will begin to resonate with the System of Values ‚Äã‚Äãof the majority. <br><br>  Further, I will touch on this topic in more detail, but for now, this is the introductory data for the right attitude to the very essence of the information. <br><br><h4>  Consumer psychology </h4><br>  I will not write a lot of stereotypes on the topic ‚Äúhow a consumer should think when he saw your website‚Äù, this makes no sense, since this is just a stereotype, and our task is to learn how to create a platform for an ideal purchase based on new experience - awareness of basic rules, this is our new experience with you. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important to imagine that you do not know anything at all about this topic while reading the article.  And perhaps, ultimately, this information will become a tool for you. <br><br>  Each person relies on their own experience.  Psychological studies tell us that the human consciousness does not throw out anything from experience, even the most negative, but this does not mean that when choosing a product, a person is aware of the very idea why he made this choice. <br><br>  Of course, a person relies on his thoughts, he may even try to explain his motivation to buy some product, but he doesn‚Äôt know the real reasons, precisely because his resonances are based on previous experience, which he has already translated into a subconscious state. <br><br>  <b>Let's look at an example:</b> <br>  A man came up to me in a cafe and offered to buy a foot massager for $ 100.  But I‚Äôm sitting in a cafe, I‚Äôm not in the store and I forgot to think that I once wanted to buy such a thing ... <br><br>  <i>!</i>  <i><b>I once wanted to buy</b> - if the desire was, at least 20 years ago, it did not disappear anywhere, if it was not realized ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So, an insistent young man offers me ‚Äúhis product‚Äù, while I actually think about coffee, he tells me about all the charms of the work of this product.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>!</i>  <i><b>I think about coffee</b> - my attention is taken by others, but not completely.</i>  <i>I do not feel the tension and I do not feel that I was distracted.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>!</i>  <i><b>My attention does not consider the benefits of</b> this product and does not focus on it, as it happens in the store, but until a certain point ...</i> <br><br>  The young man aggressively offers to buy this thing, saying that it removes the pain from the feet and infrared radiation in general has a beneficial effect on the vessels. <br><br>  <i>I buy a massager.</i> <br><br>  Why do I make this seemingly unnecessary purchase without being in the store? <br><br>  Let's try to trace the chain of activation of values, on which the ‚Äúair seller‚Äù played. <br><br>  <b>First</b> : If I have ever wanted to purchase this product and have not done so, my desire still works, regardless of my thoughts. <br><br>  If I ever bought and was pleased, but for some reason, my massager broke or was lost, I still have a positive association and my desire to have this thing strengthened and strengthened in an unconscious assessment, not understood and not used in everyday life. <br><br>  <b>Second: The</b> young man uses a lot of text that I do not remember, since he does not cause the necessary associations, except for just a few words.  However, his speech is harmonious and fast and doesn‚Äôt bother much, catching only rare resonances in the mind. <br><br>  <b>Third:</b> I am partially distracted by thinking about what kind of coffee I want.  My mind spreads in several tasks, and therefore not on one of them, I cannot focus completely, so that I can think it over completely and make decisions based on rational logical conclusions. <br><br>  Instead, I make decisions based on past experience, almost automatically. <br><br>  <b>What conclusion can be made?</b> <br><br>  In fact, so far no, but still we will summarize some of the results. <br><br><ul><li>  Past user experience plays a pivotal role in choosing a product, regardless of the quality of the product itself, a person will make a choice on what resonates with his personal sense of reality, his previous experience. </li><li>  Any negative user experience can be circumvented by dividing his attention to solving several tasks, preventing him from focusing.  It is not always good, but it is worth understanding. </li><li>  By dividing and reducing the fixation on our own experience, we can lay down the ‚Äúwe‚Äù association in the user's mind ‚Äî this is good, which in turn will replace the old associations and negative experiences. </li><li>  Selling is a subtle psychology and a game with the consciousness of a potential buyer, in an attempt to offer him something that will really be useful and necessary, and not in pursuit of giving nonsense. </li><li>  A popular and marketable product will be one that does not take a lot of power when choosing.  Sales and marketing of which are based on unconscious processes users and do not strain the mind, forcing to think. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Ending </h4><br>  I did not finish.  Actually, I haven't even started yet, this article is a trial version in an attempt to understand if I can write clearly and understandably.  Then I really want to consider examples of major brands and market leaders, compare them with those who are lagging behind and understand what the difference is.  Describe your experience in internet marketing and nlp technology, color schemes and usability building, as ways to influence the users' minds. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <i>To be continued‚Ä¶</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292356/</a></p>
