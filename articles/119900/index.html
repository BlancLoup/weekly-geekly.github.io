And then you need to somehow bring this not quite good news to the client.  As the Snob magazine rephrased the famous saying, ‚ÄúI have two news ‚Äî bad and good.  The good news: bad news could be much worse ... ‚Äù <br><br>  We remembered at least 30 excuses of developers in front of clients about disrupting the deadlines for work.  The classics of the genre such as ‚ÄúTranslating Grandmothers Across the Road‚Äù and ‚Äúthe trolleybus fell doors down - could not get out at all‚Äù in our list, for obvious reasons, does not appear. <br><br>  Offer your options for excuses!  The best excuse option will receive a prize (under the cut).  So let's go! <a name="habracut"></a>

      1. At this stage of work there is nothing to show, but we have everything under control; <br>  2. We have a little difficulty with cross-browser: the site floats in FireFox; <br>  3. Even at the simplest task, we look out of the box, and this takes time, by the way! <br>  4. What is the name of your company? .. <br>  5. Making sites is our vocation.  But we sometimes get tired too! <br>  6. Augmented reality, for example, is when the site is not working yet, but we already really know that it will be cool! <br>  7. On the phone, you said it was not urgent; <br>  8. Our tester accidentally deleted everything; <br>  9. Our creator is depressed because you didn‚Äôt agree on his brilliant decision with Ninja turtles; <br>  10. You yourself did not call me; <br>  11. We have a new idea, and we need additional time to work it out; <br>  12. Website creation is a creative process.  Well, we had no inspiration! .. <br>  13. We are constantly improving our competencies, so the whole team left for Cyborif for 2 weeks; <br>  14. Usability requires improvement - my mother does not understand how to get to the library; <br>  15. I filled my Apple coffee and lost all the data. <br>  16. Modifying these plugins is a matter of two minutes; <br>  17. In the ToR, we have indicated such dates in order to receive an advance payment at least by the end of the project; <br>  18. We commissioned the layout of the freelancer, and he disappeared; <br>  19. Could not free up time to finalize your project; <br>  20. We have rather limited time resources ‚Äì24/7 are clearly not enough to complete such a grand project; <br>  21. What do you mean, I'm not drunk! .. <br>  22. I called you 10 times - no one picked up the phone.  So what, what Sunday? .. <br>  23. I heard you and right now I‚Äôll correct the deadlines of the developers in the task manager; <br>  24. We decided that we need to add air to the design layout, and we had to redo the whole structure; <br>  25. At the very last moment there was a fatal error, and we ... lost it!  Backup - well, did not ... Yes, this is epic fail! <br>  26. My programmers refuse to work for free.  No, they want to eat every day, not at the end of the work; <br>  27. Sorry, I overslept!  O_o <br>  28. We have not finished the work on the primary filling.  We are currently in the process of generating custom content.  Yes, we will flood in your forum ... <br>  29. Your site was accidentally hung on a competitor's domain.  No, what are you, we guarantee you exclusivity in your segment! <br>  30. The hard disk flew / the server fell / the electricity was cut down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccc/6e5/15d/ccc6e515d27c29e34cb41e1064d6af49.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right">  <b>Now what is written in small print:</b> <b><br></b>  The author of the best excuse, published in the comments (assuming that this is not a copy-paste from the list), receives a prize from the <a href="http://webprofessionals.ru/">WebProfessionals.ru</a> portal - a great wireless mouse from Microsoft Arc Black USB: <br><br>  The best excuse is selected by the maximum amount of +1 at the time of Wednesday, June 8, 2011, 23:00. <br><br>  Delivery of the prize in Moscow in hand, in Russia by mail Russia.
