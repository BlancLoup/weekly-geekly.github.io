More than 1,000 Java developers took part in the conference, 48 reports were read on 4 parallel tracks.

      Robot Fedya, who (as you can guess) was remotely controlled and voiced by a human operator.  It was funny to observe the communication of the robot with children who do not understand what they are saying to a person. <br><br>  Booths-booths of sponsoring companies: <i>JetBrains</i> , <i>Odnoklassniki</i> ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bd/dad/dfe/1bddaddfeacb410abeb91f8639d25ad6.jpg"><br><br>  ... <i>Deutsche Bank</i> , <i>Sberbank-Technologies</i> and <i>Luxoft</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3a/1eb/58c/a3a1eb58c4544288a7e7d93ecae056b2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conference opening </h4><br>  A word of welcome from organizers and sponsors (who are sometimes also speakers at the same time).  Alexey Fedorov, Ruslan Cheremin, Andrey Pangin, Oleg Anastasyev, Andrey Dmitriev. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fd/7eb/6e9/1fd7eb6e99e04fe48f1b44067759d4b1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>High fashion news, or In Search of a silver bullet</b> <br>  <i>Baruch Sadogursky, Victor Gamov, Kirill Tolkachev, Anton Arkhipov, Alexey Abashev, Anton Chernousov</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35b/af0/1ff/35baf01ff7c541d0ac7915283a08e4e9.jpg"><br><br>  Presenters of the popular podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> in <i>keynote</i> format presented many of the conference reports.  From left to right: Viktor Gamov, Alexey Abashev, Baruch Sadogursky, Kirill Tolkachev, Anton Chernousov ( <i>Golodny</i> ) and Anton Arkhipov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76c/af9/2d6/76caf92d6c404c52ba7579c282545063.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br>  The reports listed below were chosen solely from my personal preferences.  In some cases, it was difficult to choose exactly what to see at the conference.  However, the complexity of the choice was compensated by the possibility of viewing videos of other reports that had already appeared (for conference participants). <br><br>  <b>Hotspot and AOT: It's time to compile</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Chuiko</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09a/819/324/09a819324d784a179ee5d3d337be05ef.jpg"><br><br>  Dmitry spoke about the emergence (while only experimental) of the static (AOT, ahead-of-time) compilation of Java code in <i>Java 9</i> .  While the achievements are modest - compilation is possible only in the executable code under <i>Linux</i> and the size of the files is large (about 200 MB).  Interest in <i>Linux is</i> caused by the dominance of server-based Java applications on this particular platform. <br><br>  <b>Unobvious Generics</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Matorin</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efe/9f7/bcc/efe9f7bcc1fb42dba16db541ad0e30c9.jpg"><br><br>  On the report of Alexander went, because  previously listened to his ‚ÄúFunctional-style refactoring‚Äù report on <i>Joker 2015</i> .  In expectations, not disappointed.  The story was about <i>generics</i> ( <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/">Generics</a> ) and touched on quite deep topics, for example: <br><ul><li>  what the code is compiled with; </li><li>  bridge methods; </li><li>  erasure rules for types; </li><li>  <i>heap pollution</i> ; </li><li>  code examples that must be compiled and not compiled, and vice versa. </li></ul><br>  The knowledge of the topic is felt, the material is well served and looks interesting. <br><br>  <b>Escape Analysis and scalarization</b> <br>  <i>Ruslan Cheremin</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bb/730/e79/0bb730e79a8745c4accb63b37ab30d44.jpg"><br><br>  Very expressive (see the average photo above) and an intriguing report about <br><ul><li>  Escape Analysis (static analysis of the reachable area of ‚Äã‚Äãan object) and </li><li>  <i>scalarization</i> (projecting fields into local variables). </li></ul><br>  Previously attended a conference on his <i>Disruptor</i> report (with a full house in the hall) and was familiar with <a href="http://dev.cheremin.info/">his blog</a> .  There were so many people who wanted to see this report too, that Alexey Shipilyov <a href="https://twitter.com/alkovictor/status/723483050160562176">was forced to sit on the floor</a> . <br><br>  A happy presence in the hall of Tagir Valeev even made it possible to correct the problem voiced by Ruslan (what Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/209876/">wrote today</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Butt Build Tool - Maven vs Gradle vs SBT</b> <br>  <i>Anton Arkhipov, Yevgeny Borisov, Baruch Sadogursky</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c6/ff3/021/8c6ff30217e44975a3cc293dcba3ca38.jpg"><br><br>  For comparison, the assembly tools were chosen dominant <i>Maven</i> (defender - Eugene Borisov), <i>Gradle</i> (of course, Baruch) and, as an exotic, <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">SBT</a> (Anton Arkhipov). <br><br>  In the game form, the advantages and disadvantages of each of the tools were illustrated in various cases - the creation of a project blank, dependency management, etc.  The most interesting seemed to me the support of <i>BOM</i> ( <i>Bill of materials</i> ), i.e.  Description of compatible dependency versions for something (for example, <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/">for Spring</a> ). <br><br>  Lively, spectacular.  They were interested in the covers of notebooks by Zhenya, Baruch, Anton (see right shot).  The ascetic covers of Zhenya and Anton‚Äôs laptops, the sticker-rich cover of the Baruch‚Äôs laptop. <br><br>  <b>If not Unsafe, then who: sunrise VarHandles</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Shipilev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/411/663/ebf/411663ebfc2b46a9872d7f9875b7a550.jpg"><br><br>  The hard test fell to the lot of Alexey (see the most right photo) - the projector that was out of operation for the first 23 minutes.  Iron endurance, resilience (joke) and optimism allowed L√∂sche to smooth out the technical problems that had arisen. <br><br>  The report talked about the legal replacement of <i>sun.misc.Unsafe</i> , which will soon be offered and recommended - <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/193">VarHandles</a> .  For the remaining 27 minutes, Alexei traditionally figuratively, expressively and <i>convincingly</i> told about <i>VarHandles</i> .  Surprise caused that the performance of <i>VarHandles</i> can be provided even higher than that of <i>Unsafe</i> . <br><br>  <b>Raise your monkey</b> <br>  <i>Maxim Dorofeev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/179/faa/c5e179faa2c84f55865d89189ab62090.jpg"><br><br>  The first (chronologically) non-technical report of the conference.  A business coach, consultant, author of the project ‚ÄúHe did a lot!‚Äù Tried to convey ideas about the ways to personal effectiveness in an entertaining way. <br><br>  According to my observations, many even liked it.  I wonder if the presentation would remain so expressive with the exclusion of certain (almost and not at all censored) words from it ... <br><br>  <b>"Debriefing" Live!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de1/d54/960/de1d54960d3d4e4eb4345e5ed1164d6c.jpg"><br><br>  Party in the club <i>Stereo Hall</i> with the participation of leading podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> .  The recording of the resulting can be found <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/2016/04/episode-108.html">here</a> . <br><br>  Listening listeners (left to right): Tagir Valeev, Alexey Shipilev (with a T-shirt handed over), Sergey Kuksenko (looking directly at the lens), Nikita Salnikov-Tarnovsky.  Alexey Shipilev is already wearing a t-shirt on stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e40/9f7/f83/e409f7f831204f0e93e54ff2a41edbc9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Man and instincts: how programmed are we?</b> <br>  <i>Evgeniya Timonova</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58e/1d7/9c8/58e1d79c8e304e9f93441eeeb564a7a7.jpg"><br><br>  Very informative and curious report from the leading video blog <a href="https://vsekakuzverei.com/">Just like the animals</a> Evgenia Timonova.  In an intelligible form for a technical audience, it tells about instincts, scientific research in this area and provides understandable examples. <br><br>  Good selection of topics, presentations and speakers.  Interesting questions from the audience and interesting answers to them. <br><br>  <b>JCache and distributed caches: chaos!</b> <br>  <i>Victor Gamov</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1c/670/c3c/a1c670c3c2cc4fc5bc61e623e6cd9aed.jpg"><br><br>  Victor's report was devoted to distributed caching in general and <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail%3Fid%3D107">the JCache standard (JSR 107)</a> in particular. <br><br>  The ‚Äúicons of Shipilev‚Äù (the second photo) were shown, which need to pray when there are problems with the performance of the application, but in the absence of Aleksey.  The difference between replication and sharding on the example of a sheep.  Examples of types of architecture and code for various cases.  Enough lively and figuratively. <br><br>  <b>Java 8 support in Excelsior JET</b> <br>  <i>Nikita Lipsky</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/437/48f/d86/43748fd86d44437c9cac38caa28880d3.jpg"><br><br>  A completely unfairly ignored report, very hardcore and well suited to this conference.  Dedicated to the technical details, subtleties, problems when adding support for <i>Java 8</i> in the brainchild of the Novosibirsk company <i>Excelsior</i> - AOT-compiler <a href="http://www.excelsiorjet.com/">Excelsior JET</a> . <br><br>  A fairly representative presentation shows how support was provided for <i>Java 8</i> innovations: <br><ul><li>  lambda expressions; </li><li>  default methods; </li><li>  Stream API, Time API; </li><li>  Type annotahons, Parameter names; </li><li>  non-standard Nashorn and JavaFX; </li><li>  Compact profiles. </li></ul><br>  Nikita's explanations about <i>Oracle's</i> AOT compilation proved to be useful - what state of readiness is now and what goals are currently being pursued. <br><br>  <b>Strangeness Stream API</b> <br>  <i>Tagir Valeev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc8/41b/8c6/dc841b8c62a348238e184a045b5d1cbd.jpg"><br><br>  The first report of the reports in the record, which I just looked.  At the conference, the report was held in a large hall, interested a large number of people. <br><br>  Tagir, being an expert and guru of the <i>Stream API</i> , clearly showed his features and strangeness.  The examples presented illustrate the various characteristics of the <i>Stream API</i> (sized, subsized, sorted, orderered, etc.).  Some things looked, frankly, paradoxical. <br><br>  <b>Java 8 Puzzlers</b> <br>  <i>Baruh Sadogursky, Yevgeny Borisov, Tagir Valeev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/502/e22/494502e2252748bd8dba32eb98d3e3ad.jpg"><br><br>  The team of puzzlers from Zhenya and Baruch, reinforced by Tagir, was trying to guess riddles about the weirdness of <i>Java 8</i> .  The report was a worthy continuation of the <i>Groovy-</i> and <i>Spring Puzzlers</i> presented at previous conferences. <br><br>  "Eggs, more eggs!" (Tagyr key puzzle key replica) <br><br>  <b>Solving the live stack problem!</b> <br>  <i>Baruch Sadogursky, Kirill Tolkachev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/997/786/6ce/9977866cec1b4d72be2182e3758ad12c.jpg"><br><br>  Cyril ( <i>live coding</i> ) and Baruch (problem statement, comments on possible solutions and the resulting) presented ‚ÄúCI as a Service in 50 minutes‚Äù.  Kirill masterfully coded, Baruch wittily commented, it turned out well. <br><br>  <b>Take care of yourself!</b> <br>  <i>Nikita Salnikov-Tarnovsky</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfe/1ba/c49/bfe1bac49e7e4e83adfd94f305a1dd89.jpg"><br><br>  It was told about various possible ways of guaranteed release of resources.  Each of the options presented was illustrated with code examples.  The conclusion of the report (the presentation, unfortunately, is not yet available) is the use (depending on the case) of either lambda or the class <i>Cleaner</i> . <br><br>  <b>Seven lessons developers can learn from film</b> <br>  <i>Tim berglund</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4b/79e/28b/e4b79e28b3254fbfac378d60c400dfb7.jpg"><br><br>  In the report, Tim draws an analogy between the film industry and the IT industry.  Shows on the example of film production, what lessons can be learned and what similar techniques to use.  The report is expressive, original, concise. <br><br><h4>  Conference closing </h4><br>  The appearance on the stage of the organizers that has already become traditional at closing ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/1ca/545/8271ca54594d47f0b58e3f5e1512b727.jpg"><br><br>  ... then volunteers ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/e4c/af1/050e4caf1bcb4e60ad1c07e63cc48911.jpg"><br><br>  ... and conference speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10c/f89/230/10cf8923034e423a9dc703f8b2a73045.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Almost perfectly organized conference.  Lunch with the change of dishes by waiters is beyond praise.  I was a witness of technical problems only on the report of Aleksey Shipilev (we consider force majeure). <br><br>  Selection of strong speakers and strong reports.  Attentive and friendly organizers.  Good smart viewers. <br><br>  Conference artifacts, including <i>Excelsior</i> chocolate (thanks to Nikita Lipsky for the gift). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bd/a85/7d1/2bda857d1d9d42068bb01ecdaaa3d29b.jpg"></div><br><br>  And how did you spend these two days, dear participant of the conference? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282810/</a></p>
