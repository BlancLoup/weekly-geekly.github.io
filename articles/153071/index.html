At the competition, teams from around the world, consisting of four participants, solve algorithmic problems for two days. <br><br>  Russia at the Olympics this year was represented by Maxim Akhmedov and Oleg Ivanov from Moscow, Yegor Suvorov from St. Petersburg and Alexey Gordeyev from Perm.  All of them are winners of the All-Russian Olympiad of Schoolchildren in Informatics of this Year.  They were accompanied by the permanent leaders of our team Kiryukhin Vladimir Mikhailovich and Tsvetkova Marina Serafimovna.

      For those interested, it will not be difficult to find information about the tasks (there is an <a href="http://www.ioi2012.org/">official website</a> for this), the course of the Olympiad ( <a href="http://www.codeforces.ru/search%3Fquery%3Dioi2012">here</a> , for example), and generally almost any aspects of the event ( <a href="http://ioi.snarknews.info/index.cgi%3Fdata%3D2012/pressrel2012%26class%3Dioi2012%26year%3D2012">press release SnarkNews</a> , <a href="http://ioi.snarknews.info/index.cgi%3Fdata%3D2012/cou2012%26class%3Dioi2012%26year%3D2012%26sort1%3D2u%26sort2%3D3u%26sort3%3D4u">team table</a> , and anything else - a search engine to help :)).  I under the cut will try to at least a little bit to talk about the winners themselves, or rather, to give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow much different things were on their way to this Olympiad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Maxim Akhmedov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zlobober/" class="user_link">Zlobober</a> </h4><br>  A graduate of SUNTs MSU, and now a first year student of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of MSU.  The youngest member of our team recently brought us another gold medal (six months ago he took part in the <abbr title="The site is not found, unfortunately. But if I had found it, then without knowledge of Chinese, what should I do there?">Open All-China Mathematical Olympiad</abbr> ). <br>  Before the trip to the international Olympiad, Maxim and Oleg Ivanov went to the summer computer school (famous in certain <a href="http://www.lksh.ru/index.shtml">LKSH</a> circles) as <a href="http://www.lksh.ru/index.shtml">teachers</a> . <br><blockquote>  For educational purposes, we were put by Oleg with our teachers in quite junior parallels.  He and I were teachers in C. These are very basic algorithms for those who know the language.  And I was in C.py - this is a new experimental parallel, where teaching is conducted entirely on python. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  Yegor Suvorov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yeputons/" class="user_link">yeputons</a> </h4><br>  Three years in a row celebrates his birthday at the winter training camp.  He will continue to engage in sports programming while studying at the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of St. Petersburg State University.  Most likely with the IOI 2011 gold medalist Pavel Kunyavsky they will take part in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CC%25E5%25E6%25E4%25F3%25ED%25E0%25F0%25EE%25E4%25ED%25E0%25FF_%25F1%25F2%25F3%25E4%25E5%25ED%25F7%25E5%25F1%25EA%25E0%25FF_%25EE%25EB%25E8%25EC%25EF%25E8%25E0%25E4%25E0_%25EF%25EE_%25EF%25F0%25EE%25E3%25F0%25E0%25EC%25EC%25E8%25F0%25EE%25E2%25E0%25ED%25E8%25FE">ACM ICPC</a> international competition. <br><br>  Here's what Egor said before flying to Milan: <br><blockquote>  Preparation ... Well ... Well-known summer gatherings (two weeks of reinforced classes), then the ABBYY Cup (can also be considered preparation), but in general - to complete the old Olympiads, some online competitions.  Codeforces decide, decide and solve.  According to the theory, I now cover everything that can be on IOI. <br><br>  It seems to me that solving problems is a fairly universal option if there is enough theory.  And the theory, I think, should be enough for everyone to get into the top 4 in Russia. <br><br>  Now it is important to be prepared for stress, for nerve.  Oh yes.  You can solve problems in a not very calm atmosphere, for example, in the dining room.  There is an extreme method - in the subway.  I was told that musicians train like this before concerts.  Go to the transition and play.  It turns out several times worse than the exam, but then less crap. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  Oleg Ivanov </h4><br>  The closing ceremony of the Olympiad took place just on the day of his majority :) Oleg will continue his studies at the VMK MSU. <br><br><h4>  Alexey Gordeev </h4><br>  Lesha celebrated his majority at the <a href="http://infoolimp.tatar.ru/">final stage of the All-Russian Olympiad in Informatics</a> , held in Kazan.  Having taken the 11th place, he did not expect to get into the national team and even more so to return from Italy with a gold medal, but he showed himself worthily at the summer gathering and entered the four of the national team members.  From Sheremetyevo Airport, he went to the Leningrad station.  From September 1, Alexey is a first-year math member (like Yegor Suvorov). <br><br><h4>  Trainers </h4><br>  Gold medalists of IOI 2011 Alexander Timin and Pavel Kunyavsky traveled as coaches with the guys. <br>  Alexander is currently studying at the FIVT MFTI, and Pavel is studying at St. Petersburg State University as a mathema. <br><br>  Not only official trainers, but also other instructors are related to receiving medals by the guys: Yuri Petrov, Sergey Kopeliovich, Ivan Kazmenko, Pavel Kunyavsky, Mikhail Pyaderkin, Roman Andreev and Ivan Smirnov. <br><br>  Literally, from day to day we will publish the analysis of one of the olympiad tasks performed by Maxim Akhmedov, but for now <b>let's rejoice for the guys and congratulate them</b> :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153071/</a></p>
