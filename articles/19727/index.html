  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts about society</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I think a lot about people.  In one of my topics I wrote about ideologies.  The fact that ideologies lead a person away from objectivity.  Now I want to even think about objectivity and subjectivity and society. <br><br>  I hope there will be an interesting discussion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Individualization </h1><br>  Every person is at least an individual, as a maximum is an individuality.  It is held in a course of sociology.  In Russia, a lot of individuals.  At least I meet a lot in life.  Each person (judging on his own) seeks to develop his individuality, and, moreover, each with those methods that seem to him more effective.  Some buy bright clothes, others buy fashionable clothes with the condition that none of my acquaintances have the same clothes, some still compose music, the fourth ones draw‚Ä¶ they can be listed for a long time.  But society itself, in fact, seeks to suppress individualism.  For example, a person would not want a work colleague to surpass him in some way.  But he himself sees nothing wrong with his superiority. <br><br>  Thus, social conflicts begin in society.  Some get more, others less.  Some of them have an apartment on the ground floor, while others - on the twentieth.  Some live in the center, others - need to get on the train.  But society cannot self-regulate - not all people have equal opportunities.  This is where the government comes in, which compensates the incapacity for work for people with disabilities, provides unemployment benefits, etc.

      I believe that the Russian government is very talented.  It seems to me that in Russia there are a lot of individuals.  After all, just managing individuals, and managing individuals is more difficult!  After all, how much work must be done to ensure that individuals do not pay attention to social injustice and do not react to the suppression and restriction of their rights.  I will not go into details, but hardly anyone thinks that our government does not sleep at night, but only thinks about how to make the lives of ordinary people better.  When I look at the work of our government, I recall a quote from the ‚ÄúHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù (Douglas Adams - The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy): <br>  <em>The president is chosen according to the principle ‚Äúby contradiction,‚Äù giving preference to figures that involuntarily cause irritation and respect at the same time.</em>  <em>His job is not to control, but to divert attention from the management process.</em> <br><br><h1>  Dreams </h1><br>  I often come across the fact that as they grow up, people lose the ability to dream and to pose impossible or very difficult at first glance tasks.  Kids consider themselves to be Supermen and say that they can do anything.  And adults, mostly - these are some dull creatures.  I rarely come across people who have not lost the ability to dream and, in general, they are quite successful in life.  It turns out that society suppressing individuality also suppresses will and aspirations.  This is deplorable. <br><br>  I can give simple advice: everything is possible;  fight and you will win;  only the one who does not fight does not win. <br><br><h1>  Realtime </h1><br>  Society (as it should be) sets the framework for people.  The framework is both formal and informal.  A person, sometimes, also sets a framework for himself.  Frames accumulate, accumulate and at some point you can realize that you are floating with the flow.  But we are people.  People can do anything.  People completely own (and not only) own.  You can change everything that does not like.  You just have to make your efforts, but you should never forget that a person‚Äôs life is in his hands. <br><br><h1>  FAQ </h1><br>  A person's life has many questions that can be answered in many ways.  Scientists (mostly) believe in the material world, which is a certain objectivity.  But I have never faced face-to-face with objectivity.  I faced only with a huge mass of subjectivity, and, some of the subjectivity became widespread.  For example, some believe that the Earth was formed as a result of the Big Bang, others believe that God created it, many people also introduce ambiguity in the concept of God, etc.  One way or another - these are opinions.  Everyone has the right to have an opinion.  Science and Religion are very similar.  Both of these social phenomena are trying to answer questions.  A person has a choice - which FAQ to use to answer questions that are born in his head.  But there is still the option of using your own head, but very quite laborious - you have to think for yourself!  Those.  Religion and science are very simple and quick ways of ‚Äúanswering questions‚Äù. <br><br>  Tip: try to think for yourself - there will be a need for new knowledge;  many sources - try to consider as much as possible;  the answers you received are much more valuable; <br><br>  <em>This is all my personal opinion.</em>  <em>I do not claim neither for truth, nor for opening.</em>  <em>I just expressed my opinion.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19727/</a></p>
