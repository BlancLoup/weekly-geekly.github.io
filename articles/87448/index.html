I sent a letter to my mother with the name of the program and one line of description of this application.  She replied with one phrase: "I do not understand."  We threw out the source code and the program itself and started over. <br><br>  The most important lesson that we learned while working with the App Store - most of the unsuccessful App Store developers still did not understand: if by their name and short description their mother immediately understands what it is, the program will be sold more than 30 copies a day.  If the name and description of the mother does not understand what is at stake, the program will be sold less than 5 copies a day.  Unfortunately, other App Store developers do not have access to my mom or her delicious bagels, so we will continue to maintain this strategic advantage.

      The main reason for the success of the program: Make sure that the description of your program is very clear.  If not, then simplify. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When you do this, you will discover one of two things: <br><br>  1. I do not have a single product <br>  2. I have a product that people need. <br><br>  It is like with Microsoft Word.  If you had extremely simplified it, you would get a notebook.  A notebook is still a very useful product.  I can describe the notebook in one sentence: it allows me to create, save and print documents. <br><br>  If you can not describe your product in one offer - you can not sell it.  People do not want to listen to your explanations, they just want a simple and clear answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhat does she do?‚Äù If you need two sentences to answer this question, then you have problems. <br><br>  What happens when you put aside all the extra features and cheap effects that you see: the application still has some meaning for humanity?  If the main purpose of the program has no value, and this is its main function that you want to sell, then you have problems again. <br><br>  Customers have two questions: <br><br>  - What is she doing? <br>  - Yeah!  And why is she better than the one I already use? <br><br>  Answer these two questions in one sentence and you will make money.  For example, if I wanted to sell Microsoft Word to Notepad users, I would answer these questions like this: <br><br>  - It allows you to create, save and print documents <br>  - You can make the text bold, italic and add pictures <br><br><h4>  <b>* Simplification measures *</b> </h4><br><br>  1. First of all, highlight the most important function of the program.  No, not two, not three, only one function.  What is the essence of your application?  Yes, there are other applications that perform the same function, but this is not a problem.  You have to understand, as long as there are any problems, and as long as there are applications, they are decisive - people will need these programs. <br><br>  2. Describe it in a single line, in terms of user benefits.  In other words, what problem will be solved by this application. <br><br>  3. After you answered the buyer the question ‚ÄúWhat is she doing?‚Äù In one sentence, he said ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù And proceeded to inquire about her?  If not, change points 1 and 2 until this happens. <br><br>  If you have a ready-made simplified program concept, then implementing the basic functionality of this concept will be very fast and cheap.  You will get a very simple prototype and will be able to test it on real users, before spending time creating additional features.  Work on this prototype so that it works well, test it with your friends, family and your Twitter readers.  Get feedback and hear their opinions. <br><br>  After the implementation of the main idea that you discover!  Once you have a working prototype, you will make a final decision on the future path of its development, if you still want to develop it. <br><br>  You will remain competitive by following this path, increase your chances of success, and reduce losses if your initial assessment were incorrect.  And this is the formula for a successful business, isn't it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87448/</a></p>
