The service is a calendar of working hours with the possibility of pre-registration for the company's services. <br><br>  The debate about what has been done is bad and what is already <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/groupon-scheduler-rolls-out-for-free/">going</a> well, but my goal is not to participate in them.  Also do not think that in this article I want to throw mud at the service of the group and on the sly to sell my own.  I just wanted to remind once again - what are the goals of us, people who run their own business?  And what do we really need? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main goal, of course, is to make the world a better place by offering people our unique service!  And for this you need to attract customers and help them understand what benefits they will get for themselves using our services.  Our foreign language courses will open up new opportunities for them, our beauty salon will increase their self-esteem, and so on ...

      Speaking the language of marketing, we can distinguish two basic steps: attracting new customers and retaining permanent ones.  Using shocking discounts at the first stage is a proven method.  A customer comes for a discount at a store, where an experienced seller draws his attention to other interesting products, gives a discount on a second purchase, gets a buyer's card ... And it works! <br><br>  Grupon service - bulletin board for primary shocking discounts.  A lot of groupon clients are companies that provide certain services.  For their convenience and to avoid collisions, the group implemented software that allows customers to sign up for a specific time. <br><br>  But will you continue to use this method / service for the second stage - to work with regular customers?  Of course, no company will operate at a loss, selling services only at a promotional price!  Plus, using discounts as advertising, we risk attracting lovers of freebies instead of customers who really want to continue to use the service. <br><br>  What kind of software you need to use to achieve marketing goals in the second stage?  Using the example of the <a href="http://ru.simplybook.me/">Simplybook.me</a> service created by our company, I will <a href="http://ru.simplybook.me/">give a</a> brief overview of the principles by which you can critically evaluate any online booking service available on the market. <br><br><h3>  1. The ability to create a customer base and work with it. </h3><br>  Why it is important: people tend to be interested in something new, and also to ‚Äúforget‚Äù without reminders.  Therefore, the customer base is very important: using promotional email and SMS mailings, informing about innovations and upcoming promotions, we encourage the client to use our service again and again. <br>  As implemented: By registering, the client leaves his email or phone.  There is functionality for mass mailing and quick communication with clients in social networks. <br><br><h3>  2. Flexible promotion system and full control of the company over it. </h3><br>  Why is important: <br>  - by changing promotional items and the size of discounts, you can create a stir, as well as interest clients with various types of services <br>  - limiting the validity of the discount, we motivate the client to return to our company in the near future <br>  - creating special offers with limited circulation, it is possible to strengthen relations with regular customers <br>  How implemented: the company administrator has full control over the creation and editing of the discount system. <br><br><h3>  3. Availability of mechanisms for attracting customers in the long term. </h3><br>  Why it is important: People who came on the recommendation of friends are likely to become long-term customers, while the company's costs of attracting them are minimal. <br>  How implemented: with the help of coupons in the discount system, there is also a built-in possibility of recommendations in social networks. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would say that modern services should be both a convenient system that fulfills its purpose and a reliable assistant on the path to success for its owner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141726/</a></p>
