The other day it became known about the project of another company, which creates a seemingly similar system. <br><br>  Developers from the Italian Institute of Technology announced at the conference of ICDA 2019 about the <a href="https://futurism.com/watch-robot-dog-airplane">completion of the creation of a four-legged hydraulic robot</a> , which was called HyQReal.  Hydraulic it is named because its limbs are hydraulically driven. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the tests, this robot was able to tow the passenger aircraft Piaggio P180 Avanti weighing 3.3 tons.  Made, it is, of course, to attract attention.  Despite the weight of the aircraft, it all depends on the resistance of the rubber tires of the chassis when the vehicle is moving.  On the other hand, it is clear that the robot is very strong, since it was able to move such a hulk from its place - the usual mechanism is hardly capable of that.

      Italians have been working on this project since 2007.  Every year they demonstrate intermediate achievements, but now they have shown the final result.  It is worth noting that the device is able to make its way through visual data. <br><br>  The hydraulic drive was decided to choose because it allows you to develop much more power than the servo.  Yes, the latter are more functional, but in some cases something has to be sacrificed for the sake of common success. <br><br>  The robot is very small, its length is only 1.33 meters, and its height is 0.9 meters.  The height of the device is 130 kilograms, power is supplied from a 48-volt battery.  Well, the system controls 2 computers.  The first collects and processes visual data, the second analyzes the information received and sets the robot in motion. <br><br>  The hydraulic system operates on the basis of four electric motors that drive hydraulic pumps.  And they, in turn, create the necessary movement for the system. <br><br>  It was decided to test the robot at the airport of Genoa, Italy.  During the checks, the robot was able to budge and tow the plane with a length of 14.4 meters and a wingspan of 14 meters.  The Italians created their own robot, first of all, to perform work in difficult regions - for example, where a disaster occurred recently, an earthquake, a volcanic eruption or something else.  A robot can search for people, drag goods, open doors and perform other functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/4f4/072/fba4f4072233cd7e0529382380ec6ee0.png"><br><br>  As for the above-mentioned company Boston Dynamics, it is also distinguished.  10 SpotMini robots were able to transport a truck on the road without any problems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnWolLQSZic" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The developers said that all the robots that took part in the shooting, came off the assembly line of the company.  Now Boston Dynamics continues to produce these robots, adjusting mass production.  The company hopes to sell them to partners for a variety of tasks - from transporting goods to exploring rough terrain. <br><br>  So far, the cost of devices is unknown - neither a robot from an Italian company, nor robots from an American one.  Nevertheless, everything goes to the fact that such systems will soon be used in production and in other areas.  Of course, the popularity of such systems depends on the price factor - if the cost is too high, then they are unlikely to be dispersed by the thousands, because we must not forget that robots require preventive maintenance, for which money is needed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453542/</a></p>
