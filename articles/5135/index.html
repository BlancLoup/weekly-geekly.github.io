      “Not all people have the necessary higher legal education in order to understand a very complex legal agreement and understand how much they actually have to pay money in the end in the form of interest payments for a loan,” the head of the antimonopoly service said in an interview with the Russian round-the-clock news channel "Vesti". <br><br>  According to him, the majority of banks work in good faith, but about a quarter of banks indicate incorrect interest rates for loans. <br><br>  “They write in big letters that the real rate is, say, 14% per annum (for ruble loans), which the majority of the population considers acceptable under current conditions.  And then they start writing in small print somewhere at the very end of the contract that, for example, it may be necessary to pay 2% for opening an account, but not annually, but 2% per month, ”said Artemiev. <br><br>  “For the operation, which generally costs one penny, in fact, the borrower took 24% of additional annual interest,” he noted. <br><br>  “And others have such cheating, and as a result, a citizen, instead of, as he thought he needs to pay 14% -15%, pays 60, 70 and even 100%.  This, by the way, is the reason why many people do not return loans to banks, ”said Artemyev. <br><br>  He regards this as a “big and serious” problem.  “I would like to emphasize that these claims, which are filed, are undoubtedly a move in the right direction,” noted Artemyev. <br><br>  “It is only important to measure the strength and the result here, because the banking sector is so very delicate,” he believes, since the trials, in general, threaten the banking system with “quite serious upheavals.” <br><br>  The Federal Antimonopoly Service also considers it illegal for a bank to insure loans in certain companies.  “This is a violation of antitrust laws.  We are now conducting several such cases.  And we, I think, will successfully complete them.  I have no doubt in absolute judicial perspective that we will win there, ”said Artemyev. <br><br>  “But everything that concerns banking standards, all kinds of insane, hidden commissions, it seems to me, the state should speed up the Federal Law on Consumer Lending as soon as possible,” he said. <br><br>  In his opinion, there will be a place in the law for mortgage lending.  “This is a terrible thing, this is a man, the family falls into dependence for dozens of years,” said Artemyev. <br><br>  “Do not annoy the population.  It is necessary directly, clearly establish the obligation of banks, the so-called effective rate.  And if they already indicate the wrong number, then they can be brought to criminal, administrative responsibility and so on.  But this can be done only by federal law, ”the official said. <br><br>  He believes that if Gosuma in the near future adopts amendments on penalties to the code on administrative offenses, then basically the reform of antitrust laws in Russia will be completed. <br><br>  “Then the companies will pay tens of millions of dollars for an art to deceive consumers for a one-time violation.  Then these penalties will be very sensitive for the company.  And today, when we catch them even by the hand, at best they will get off with a slight fright, paying 50 thousand rubles, ”said the head of the antimonopoly service. <br><br>  According to him, such a “nonsense” amount for the bank, and they again begin to break. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://dengin.ru/dengi/Glava-FAS-uveren-chto-skrytye-komissii-ehto-pochti-moshennichestvo/">Dengin.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5135/</a></p>
