The prospect is more than attractive.  But there is a nuance.  If you don‚Äôt know how to control a spacecraft, the success from the Galaxy ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù will be only the pride of owning a pile of expensive scrap metal and a huge hole in the budget. <br><br>  I have never been a cosmic pilot.  Until now, I have been able to ‚Äúfly‚Äù only on the free Bitrix24.  And you know what I tell you?  It's the same story with him - either you hire a pro pilot and he trains you.  Either you study by yourself, and you collect as many ‚Äústars‚Äù along the way as you draw nerves and resources. <br><br>  So the conclusion from the text I will give immediately, without the ‚Äúmulti-letter‚Äù: a good result from using any (!) CRM will be given only by trained people, time and money.  Big money and a lot of time.

      And then I‚Äôll just talk about what ‚Äústarships‚Äù I saw, what principles I selected, and what happened as a result: you‚Äôll just know what to spend time and money on.  And why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  And, after all, why? </h3><br>  Wins the one who knows how to count - if you pass the shortcut of modern marketing.  Data processing and analysis of these allows you to spend less effort and money on ineffective actions.  And to make contacts with customers more targeted and targeted.  And the key word here is ‚Äúfast.‚Äù  The Big Data Marketing beast is not at all tame - the more accurate and more specific the segmentation of the target audience and the more interaction processes, the more data need to be processed, which means that good old-fashioned files here will not help, we need automation.  This is exactly CRM - a system that collects, structures and allows you to analyze information on employees, customers and business processes. <br><br>  For most businesses, the tasks that are assigned to CRM are of the same type: <br><br>  - Organize a database of customers with the possibility of segmentation by key features. <br>  - Determine and record the processes of interaction with the client (from the moment of contact and until repeat sales). <br>  - Partially automate these processes (notifications, greeting cards on mail). <br>  - Determine the effectiveness of the channels of promotion and sales. <br>  - Monitor the work of employees responsible for interacting with customers (sales department). <br>  - Get financial statistics on transactions. <br><br>  For the industry (and, in my case, medical) CRM it is also an improvement in the quality of customer service: <br><br>  - More time to see a doctor by automating the filling of data. <br>  - It is more convenient to track the history of visits and appointments. <br>  - More understandable and patient-friendly documents (appointments, bypass lists, etc.). <br><br>  It is considered.  In the perfect space of modern marketing.  In fact, it turns out a bit wrong ... <br><br><h3>  And how is it? </h3><br>  My first CRM integration experience can be called successively a stretch.  We needed nothing at all: to transfer from the cloudy exelki to something less freezing and long base of existing customers, to ensure segmentation of this base by key products, the life of the client, the product specifications used by him.  Next, provide automatic lead recording from the corporate site and build a sales funnel on them.  And also - get a visual report on the channels and failures.  I wanted to track down where and whom we are losing.  Yes, all this for a minimum of money.  And the best - for free. <br><br>  Free is Bitrix24.  And, I must admit, it is good, how good a free solution can be at all.  We got used to it hard, and, as it became clear now, we got used not to the interface and logic of a specific program, but to work in CRM in general. <br><br>  Initially, the whole idea was focused on the sales department.  Sales as a result of CRM and integrated (well, or vice versa).  The bottom line is that only one department of the company began to work in the system.  What is at odds with the CRM-religion in general, but absolutely did not affect the quality of the company.  The technical department and customer support (and the company is developing software) sat tightly on the Jira and the corporate Wiki - they remained there. <br><br>  As for sales and marketing, due to CRM we managed to unload employees from the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù routine - we stopped filling out a bunch of Excel forms.  We were able to visualize the sales route (and we already had instructions and scripts for it), hooked up all the incoming calls to CRM, tied up sales plans and - hurray - pulled statistics on advertising channels and reasons for refusals.  Well, they dragged it out - it is visible in CRM, but for analysis and calculation it was necessary to use the good old copy-paste to Excel.  Functional "Reports" Bitrix gives for money.  Like the option ‚ÄúAutomated processes‚Äù - our dream about automatic transfer of a client to a different status under a certain condition with the notification of the responsible manager did not come true. <br><br>  And yet, work, according to staff, it became much easier. <br><br>  The conclusion is obvious - if you are not ready to study and understand for a long time and painfully, but for happiness you need nothing at all - you do not need to spend money.  And the time to search and compare CRM also do not need to spend.  Grab Bitrix24.  And forward - through thorns.  There will be stars - buy additional paid options. <br><br><h3>  Shuttle to cruiser </h3><br>  The second challenge associated with CRM was thrown to me by private medicine.  It is difficult to find a more conservative and difficult-to-lift system.  And this is due to the huge number of legislative standards and regulations.  Documents are what one has to ‚Äúturn over‚Äù to the doctor most of the working time.  And these documents are still paper.  Rumor has it that next year telemedicine will be released in a regulated field, and already there, first with a step, and then a trot ... But for now, the doctors still write the case histories by hand (and their appointment with examination protocols, etc.).  At the same time, private clinics compete in the same way for clients and the speed of interaction, service, the ability to attract, retain and return here play key roles. <br><br>  The first thing I learned about CRM in medicine: ‚ÄúEveryone is sitting on 1C.  Because accounting. ‚Äù  Point.  That is, financial flows in medical centers, clinics and other sanatoriums are tightly planted on the basic product 1C.  Company.  And on top is a superstructure.  Either, again, the 1C-based ‚ÄúPolyclinic‚Äù or ‚ÄúHospital‚Äù, or the BIT UMV, or the Rarusovsky Medical Office Management, Outpatient Clinic, etc. <br><br>  What impressed me the most (if not dumbfounded) after the free Bitrix24 was the principle of installing such systems.  A license is purchased for the workplace.  Lump sum payment, recurring payments except for the update.  Well ... For each request for support, if, for example, it requires more than 20 minutes of time from its employees. <br><br>  One computer - one license.  Accordingly, if you have 10 medical specialists in your medical center, plus you need a place for one administrator and one director for all and all of the director, then this is already 12 licenses. <br><br>  Starting packages go to a certain number of places (multiplicity of 5 or 10), for 1BIT such costs, for example, 29,000 p., About the same cost as 1C: Polyclinic. <br><br>  The amount is still lifting.  But.  If - suddenly - you do not have a base (the 1C: Enterprise itself), then life becomes more fun.  Then the question of iron will arise - the system is installed on a server with certain specifications.  Then - directly install-configure (also chargeable) and employee training - and this is for money. <br><br>  According to my very approximate calculations, the organization of an information technology network in a small clinic (with only 4-5 key workstations connected) was about 250,000 - 300,000 rubles. <br><br>  Is it worth it?  The demo access to the BIT UMS, which I was given for 15 days, showed that yes, it is worth it.  Definitely.  Patient records, examination templates for almost all medical specialties.  Inventory accounting (consumables, drugs), flexible pricing (discounts on individual services and service packages, certificates on treatment procedures, etc.), convenient calendar and appointments with a complete history of patient visits.  This is a real combat intergalactic cruiser - reliable, maneuverable, powerful.  This is if a quick acquaintance with the system.  A detailed acquaintance showed that in order for this large object to fly to conquer worlds, everyone.  Each.  Here almost as a cleaning woman.  Must learn to work with her.  Time and extra money.  Or you have a strong investor.  Either you are already working (earning) and you need a new breakthrough.  Other conditions for the clinic, allowing you to purchase this luxury frigate, I do not see. <br><br>  What else puzzled quite strongly - extremely negative reviews about the suppliers of this software.  Circumstances tied us to BIT UMS.  And never in any field of activity have I observed such unanimity in the negative assessment of the company that supplies software in our city.  I sincerely hope that this is only so ‚Äúlucky‚Äù for us.  A regional representative is about service and training.  If it is not possible to adjust something (and, judging by the reviews, it happens quite often), then ‚Äúcall a specialist‚Äù - if you please, unfasten it.  If the employees find it hard and painful to delve into working with CRM (and we remember that it was not easy for IT specialists, and then, for a moment, the doctors) - additional hours of training, if you please, pay.  You can, of course, train a key employee so that he can teach everyone else - list his salary in the budget. <br><br>  A monopolist, with a non-kopek price list ... I, frankly, would not bind.  At least at the stage when the costs of software largely outweigh the benefits of this software. <br><br>  Accordingly, it was decided to look for something else.  Something more simple to learn, quick to ‚Äúrise‚Äù and ‚Äúfly to any point of the Universe‚Äù ... <br><br><h3>  Pepelats with Gravitsapa </h3><br>  Cloud solutions - convenient, mobile, easy.  On any device, without being tied to server hardware, without being tied to a workplace.  Bitriks24 of these.  And also such a desirable, but Amo that I never found. <br><br>  There are also medical ones.  Even a few.  And the first thing that struck me was Medesk.  By the way, for me personally, the way a company presents its product is of great importance.  And Medesk is beautiful.  In comparison with the cards of the same 1C products on the websites of representatives - sometimes it seems to me that they are captivating conservative industries with the same conservatism. <br><br>  I was not able to work with the demo (the owners of the company still stubbornly looked in the direction of the BIT) but I read the company tape with great pleasure.  And yes, other things being equal, she would most likely have stopped on her.  The software is offered for a subscriber with payments once a month with reference to employees (some users go under the tariff plan, additional access is purchased separately).  I saw a similar principle, for example, in chat services.  I liked the package cost about 9000 per month.  When calculating for a year, the solution turns out to be more expensive than the license of 1C modules.  Although, again, does not require the cost of updating and maintaining server hardware. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù argument made me thoroughly search through the first three dozen of Google‚Äôs issue on several complex queries.  Options are not impressed.  CRM Clinic365 was awarded for prices similar to 1C, the same principle of payment and a complex scheme for calculating the amount for the desired delivery.  Not impressed and Infoclinic.  MedicalCRM promised 2000 p.  per month, but for all attempts to learn the details offered to leave contacts.  The software product sold through the processing manager puzzles me immediately.  In the wishlist was that Clientiks.  But then ‚Äúthe spit found‚Äù on another stone: conservative medicine does not trust the clouds, has many questions about the protection of personal data in such services.  And not ready to consider cloud solutions as the main IIA. <br><br>  The solution turned out to be obvious and trivial - at the start stage even the clinic can easily use the free and quite maneuverable Bitrix24, the good Google carester immediately slipped the friendship case of this CRM and private clinic under the arm.  Accounting for sales and visits, no medical records and patient data is enough for the first time.  It is not necessary even to buy <s>additional</s> options for gravitapu. <br><br>  To walk through the space fleet, as a result, to dwell on the very simple version (no offense to Bitriks24, but simply on the scale of tasks solved by professional medical CRM) is a very interesting experience.  Even more interesting was the attempt to make him friends with medicine.  My resume - do not even try.  The most important, paramount and important thing that the clinic needs from the software is a schedule grid with a record of patients.  It should be easily compiled, logical and visual.  This is the main tool of the clinic administrator, and there is no such tool in Bitrix24.  All attempts to collect at least indicative (without recording, but just to see the load of the cabinets) mesh in the basic functionality failed with a deafening crash and brought a lot of emotional suffering to me (‚Äúfan‚Äù), and the head physician - supporter of the usual solutions under 1C.  It is clear that the story with ‚Äú... leads, funnels, and other marketing tricks‚Äù we never got.  Turn 360 degrees, back to the troposphere, to cloud solutions. <br>  The first version is always correct, the rule is confirmed again.  And, to the owner of a marketer's note, if you have already achieved that your product has become the first version (in issuing, in comparison priorities, in visually attracting attention, etc.), then with considerable probability it will become the only one accepted - tested on me.  Medesk was pleasantly surprised not only by the user-friendly interface (he was understood immediately and easily by the head doctor and the director), but also by the service.  They have a postpay subscription, quality support and a lot of training materials.  Allocated a personal manager - upload documents, help set up and understand the system.  That is, the points ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù, ‚Äúunderstandable‚Äù, ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù are ticked off.  After providing the demo access to make a unanimous decision, it took one and a half working days, plus two more days off, when we simply set up the system for ourselves.  Director's resolution ‚ÄúSo far it is even more convenient than the BIT UMS!‚Äù. <br><br>  It is difficult to draw unequivocal conclusions on the basis of the week of work (set-up week), so the intrigue still remains.  Whether we can really automate processes and work out a quality service using Medesk will show the launch and the first months of the clinic.  Well, under the curtain, I take another card out of my sleeve.  This is a joker.  ‚ÄúYou can opt out of our services at any time.  We just work so that this does not happen, ‚ÄùMedesk says.  I have always won over the freedom of choice.  I'd like to believe that in an enterprise with a higher level of responsibility, it will be justified. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315284/</a></p>
