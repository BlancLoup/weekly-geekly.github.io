How to make a facade of a skyscraper</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Glazing of the first Petersburg skyscraper is a unique operation.  There are at least two reasons for this.  The first is the scope of work.  The glazing area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lakhta Center Tower is 72,500 m¬≤.  These are almost three Red Squares in Moscow, or ten football fields or fifteen platforms for landing the first stage of the FalX 9 mission of SpaceX ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa5/734/40e/aa573440eaeb49088be6ae673c357835.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In total, the glass part of the facades of the complex (tower + MFZ) reaches 130 thousand square meters.  meters  Claims world record.

        </script>
      <br>
      The second reason is that in addition to the impressive square, the unique shape of the tower makes it difficult.  It changes on each floor - it expands, narrows and twists - every floor 0.82 degrees relative to the central axis. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8e/4ca/9b5/d8e4ca9b55a748828e2aa2e8655c17b8.png"><br>  This difficult geometry has given many tasks not only to designers, but also to those who directly glaze the tower.  Because of the shape, most of the glass packs are slightly different from each other - it means that each has its own place. <br><br>  We will learn how this glass puzzle consists of 16,505 elements + a premiere video showing how it will be washed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Main element </h3><br>  The parallelogram of the bent form acts as a facade element: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32d/9bd/d37/32d9bdd3730d4112bacbe85e9210eddc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The curvature of the glass unit is needed to achieve the spiral shape of the building - the facade, as it were, flows around the tower around its axis.  Simple flat glazing will give in this case the effect of "faceted glass."  Cold-bent version implies a smooth monolithic surface: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/b05/6dd/21fb056dded64acf9d206e62844876e4.gif" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  How to bend the glass in a "cold" way </h3><br>  A laminated bag measuring 2.8 mx 4.2 m is placed in an aluminum frame lying in a horizontal position.  Under its own weight (about 780 kg), the glass packet is deformed, bending under the frame shape.  Thermal effect is absent - this is the technology of "cold bending".  The maximum deformation of one corner of the glass from a plane is about 40 mm. <br><br><h3>  Where do such glasses </h3><br>  To begin with, in Russia cold-formed glasses make.  If we talk about purely Russian brands, for the time being, this is a couple of relatively small productions that do not yet have the capacity to develop a volume of 72 thousand square meters.  meters  But we think that they have everything ahead. <br><br>  For the tower "Lakhta Center" windows are produced by Josef Gartner GmbH, for the MFZ - 4 companies at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b44/aa6/a9d/b44aa6a9d0584edaae47cb5111e98c20.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Glass samples of all four manufacturers of facades MFZ, exhibited at the site for full-scale modeling.</i>  <i>Lakhta, Petersburg, 2016</i> <br><br>  Gartner operates in Russia - specifically for the project, the Germans opened production in Levashovo, 20 kilometers from the site.  This solution is from the field of logistics: to deliver oversized and very heavy double-glazed windows from Germany is, of course, not German - non-pragmatic. <br><br><blockquote>  The plant in Levashovo is the 12th, owned by the group and the first high-grade production company in Russia. </blockquote><br><h3>  Total control </h3><br>  The incorrect behavior of glass in the facade means that a person somewhere made a mistake - in the calculation, or in the manufacture, or in transportation, or in the installation.  Therefore, all four stages are controlled - before arrival at the site by the manufacturer, and then - by the builders.  So we meet the newly arrived party of double-glazed windows not with a loaf, but with special means. <br><br>  Inspectors on special technological instructions look at each glass unit - each of those tens of thousands who will be in the whole complex of Lakhta Center.  A weekly report is made of the negative nuances found, if any.  When the glass is redone, this is a subtle manufacturing defect, but internal bubbles or defects due to poor transportation will help to establish attentiveness and meticulousness of specialists. <br><br><h3>  Anchoring process </h3><br>  The process itself looks like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VXC6enaAJs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Front fastening system - mounted.  Front panels (double-glazed windows in frames) are hung on brackets, and are not fixed rigidly to the bearing frame of the building. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e6/42d/431/2e642d431da74ab4ae3330286a7d97cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the finished form from the inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/069/314/42a/06931442ab044c86b9c7d6fb8dc8983e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  View of staples for hanging glass in the neighboring MFZ: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/7dd/08c/9a57dd08c88341c3afe9b79d0af4fca4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Row in finished form, ibid: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/374/425/8c3/3744258c38464cc8aed4775a3f699bd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the hinged system, it turns out that the glass envelope fits the design, but is not built into the building, while remaining somewhat independent. <br><br>  The reason for choosing such an option is that the tower will be movable due to precipitation and shrinkage during construction and after the completion of all monolithic work, the impact of external facts such as wind and sun.  The hinged system and the decision on the joints between the double-glazed windows give a compensating effect, making the facade independent of the vibrations of the building and the efforts arising in its structures. <br><br>  Another reason is that the facade panels themselves are also moving - due to temperature differences: in the summer they expand, and in the winter they contract.  The same, but less pronounced process occurs during the day.  Of course, these factors required consideration in the design of the glass unit and the fastening system of the facade. <br><blockquote>  An interesting example of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">building</a> that was glazed without proper consideration of temperature fluctuations led <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/igor_o/" class="user_link">Igor_O</a> to discussions on the previous article.  The result is sad - the glass has crumbled, even if not immediately. </blockquote><br>  It turns out that between the joints of the glass is formed some space?  And there is.  Each panel around the perimeter has seals that prevent the influence of external factors on the internal climate of the building.  The facade system is sealed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/371/0ba/20f3710ba5ec4e9f9e5825df27b426c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also a space between the facade and the interfloor overlap - it is closed during subsequent works. <br><br><h3>  Why not immediately glass </h3><br>  Glazing - "closing" type of work on the construction of the tower.  Glazed levels allow you to see what the skyscraper will look like in its completed look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f9/cbe/39d/3f9cbe39dceb465b871dc55a7f21c462.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The technological gap between the glazing and the construction of a composite structure around the core of the tower is due to the convenience of placing equipment for lifting and installing double-glazed windows and the required safe distance.  Protective grids are installed under the floors to be erected to prevent the fall of construction tools and materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c2/462/91b/2c246291b9e44db0b5c36d2a4dc28661.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The height of the glass, as we recall, 4.2 meters.  This is equivalent to the height of one floor.  Front elements are hung around the perimeter of the floor.  After that, the installation process goes to a higher level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/649/104/1516491044dd40f6bc5c9715ce8ed85e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Buffer zones </h3><br>  The building in horizontal section consists of five petals.  In the corners, between the edges of the petals, there are double facades.  The space between the "threads" of the facades - buffer zones. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/220/fbc/dca/220fbcdca0ef4390bdc199b43d48f5e8.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Buffer zones are peculiar glazed loggias with the help of which natural ventilation is possible: on the ‚Äúloggias‚Äù there are provided ‚Äúair vents‚Äù - technical valves that will automatically open under certain conditions. <br><br>  Buffer zones occupy two floors at a height, so the front panels are not hung on the floor slab, but on the guide frames: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c65/b68/033/c65b68033cba4c34b92395e44d6c7c73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two-story buffer zone, inside view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/aaf/6a4/033aaf6a4c3f4b578e98ca72e59ca79e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And a view of the "loggia" from the side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02e/f70/15c/02ef7015c2b24bd1a00c3749f9552b40.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  SOF </h3><br>  All structural elements and engineering systems of a modern building are interconnected.  The facade is no exception.  To clean the facade of the Lakhta Center from pollution or to replace damaged glass, use a special lift.  In the ribs of the tower between the front panels, grooves are provided, and in the cradle itself - clamps with rods, which are fixed in the slots of the facade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59a/817/f59/59a817f59c4f48319b2cd2e8f837df30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This mounting system allows you to completely eliminate swinging cradles at height. <br><br>  This is called "SOF", a facade maintenance system.  SOF was developed specifically for the tower - because of the spiral shape, there were no ready-made solutions.  On the SOF, we will tell in one of the posts.  For now - a video about this system.  By the way, this is the premiere. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID_8YHjhcBU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Glass Innovations </h3><br>  The first glass facade as an architectural element of the building appeared in Germany in 1926.  Fully translucent facades for the first time in the world began to be used in the Soviet Union.  The first building with facade glazing was the House of the Central European Union, built in Moscow in 1936 by the famous architect Charles Edouard Le Corbusier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/653/0c1/a68/6530c1a68cba421ea05bafe79693a988.jpg"><br>  Photo of the CentroSoyuz building from the <a href="http://liveinmsk.ru/">site ‚ÄúMoscow walks‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Soon this architectural innovation became very popular.  At first, the mirror facades were just straight.  Then, in the 1940s, curved architectural glass appeared in Western Europe.  At the heart of the bending - bending process - heating the glass to a temperature of - 600 ¬∞ C, then - bending with a mold and slow cooling.  From the glass made the top of the skyscraper 30 St Mary Ax - London Cucumber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a1/e76/026/4a1e76026b5343dbbc0bd60c1ba9a6ed.JPG"><br><br>  In the early 1990s, cold-rolled glass was invented.  Canadian Rick Silas has managed to bend tempered glass at room temperature, while maintaining its structural integrity.  Invented way Cold Bent Shattered Glass allows you to bend glass and laminated glass around virtually any existing structures. <br><br>  The first object from cold-formed glass in Russia was the St. Petersburg headquarters of the Bank St. Petersburg, the glass area is 20,000 m¬≤.  The second is the 255-meter tower "Evolution" in Moscow City: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea4/bcf/6d2/ea4bcf6d28374293a789e335f2362b4d.jpg"><br><br>  The next object is the 462-meter ‚ÄúLakhta Center‚Äù, where the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcold-formed glazing reaches up to 85% of the entire front surface of the Supertoll. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2d/929/efd/b2d929efd448478282b0eb065b9fb80b.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400345/</a></p>
