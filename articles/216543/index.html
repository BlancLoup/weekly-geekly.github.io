Who needs it, how to become a business analyst, and is it really worth striving for it?  <b>Maxim Tsepkov</b> , Chief Architect of the Directorate for Development of Solutions, CUSTIS Group of Companies, will tell about this. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e0/497/a56/1e0497a56b375d48740c87eee5866d0b.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Why do companies need business analysts, what role do they play? </h5><br>  The role of the business analyst depends on the software development model that the company uses, as well as on the division of responsibility for the project between the developer company and the customer.

      There are several common models, but combinations of these can be used. <br>  1. The business analyst works ‚Äúin the field‚Äù, contacts with representatives of the customer and collects the requirements, which are then transferred to the ‚Äúchief designer‚Äù or ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù as background information for the design.  In the future, he is a communicator between the architect and the customer. <br>  2. The business analyst acts as a direct customer for developers.  It forms some consistent set of requirements or even a business model that describes the functionality of the system, and works them out to such an extent that the developer can continue to design.  The analyst then submits the requirements to the development, accepts the work done and provides the implementation. <br>  3. The business analyst is considered as the next step in the growth of the analyst (system), who is an expert in design, but without knowledge of the specifics of the subject area.  And as you master the subject area or several, he becomes a business analyst. <br><br>  In all models, business analysts require knowledge of the subject area and the ability to communicate with the customer in his language.  But the differences relate to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the business analyst within the project. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/8bf/81e/37d8bf81e43957a778db476320444462.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Why business analysis is considered more complex than programming, and the more testing, the scope of activities? </h5><br>  Business analysis is located at the junction of the subject area and design and requires fluency in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once - ‚Äúcustomer language‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammer language‚Äù.  At the same time, ‚Äúcustomer languages‚Äù are different for different industries and even for different companies within the same industry, and the business analyst is required to quickly navigate and learn a new area for him in the absence of any systematically organized information and training time.  These skills are rarely found among developers, so business analysis is considered a more complex area.  But at the same time, business analysts need good design skills, which are not always available to specialists who come from the business area, and not from IT, and a business analyst without design skills is not considered qualified.  As for testers, they also need knowledge of the subject area in cases where they conduct a full functional test.  But the ability to design from them is not required. <br><br>  However, this applies to models 2 and 3 of the first question.  And in model 1, the work of a business analyst is not considered more complex, it is quite comparable with others, it just has its own specialization. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb4/3ad/50a/eb43ad50accd2f8786c848a696d2ac27.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Is it possible to become an analyst right after high school? </h5><br>  Can.  Only younger, which will be taught by senior comrades.  And from the very beginner analyst you need activity and a thirst for knowledge, a desire to work.  Then, with the accumulation of experience, the qualification and range of tasks to be solved will grow.  Actually, here the analyst is no different from other professions. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/679/8cd/d39/6798cdd3901f873a0893d0587402517e.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Why share systems analysis and business analysis? </h5><br>  Because these are different activities, knowledge and skills.  In the system analysis, design, ‚Äúcleared‚Äù from the subject area, is distinguished.  This is a natural process of differentiating activities by type.  And then in different projects, different types of activities may be needed and they may be distributed differently between roles. <br><br>  In the above-mentioned model 1, business and system analysis are clearly divided between different people.  In Model 3, they are combined as two business analyst activities, which at the same time can give separate tasks for designing a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù (or system) analyst subordinate to it.  And in model 2, business analytics is usually given conceptual system design, possibly together with the developer, and the detailed remains on the developer. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d88/c20/4b9/d88c204b95b11e083bfc462ac1b184db.jpg"><br><br><h5>  What are the main qualities of a good analyst?  What are the "antiquities"? </h5><br>  The main quality is a good conceptual thinking that allows you to quickly build models in the context of lack of information, complemented by advanced communication skills for obtaining this information, as well as broadcasting and discussing your models.  This is a complex quality, but it gives the activity integrity.  Only it occurs, unfortunately, very rarely.  This is where the analysis begins - and which ‚Äúnon-analytic‚Äù is better - and at the same time the point of view usually depends on the problems in the projects that answer the question.  And if in a positive way, then all these aspects of activity must be provided by one or several people working together, and you just need to understand how you will do it. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/131/5c1/86f/1315c186fb5be6f963c5cc5de18046d4.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Who needs analysts - grocery companies or outsourcing? </h5><br>  It depends on the specific project, its life cycle stage and the division of responsibilities between development and marketing in the case of a product company and between the company and the customer - for outsourcing.  Both in those and in others there is a certain set of activities related to analysis in the widest sense.  But they can be implemented in different ways - highlighting individual roles or assigning additional functions to others.  It depends on this whether a dedicated analyst will be in a particular project or his responsibilities will be ‚Äúspread‚Äù among several employees playing other roles. <br><br><img height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bc/057/3c8/2bc0573c81c53cde27d37396a2a5fe2c.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Is it possible to become a good analyst without communicating with colleagues and not attending industry conferences? </h5><br>  Probably you can.  Because now there are many channels and ways to obtain information from the outside world.  And instead of communicating with colleagues and conferences, you can read books, search for information on the Internet and study at trainings.  Everyone chooses the way that is more convenient for him.  However, it is absolutely impossible to become a good analyst if you don‚Äôt learn, do not follow the development of your professional field, the emergence of new methods and approaches.  And for me personally, conferences are the most effective way to ‚Äústay informed.‚Äù  Because they are collected by analysts of different qualifications from various companies to talk about their problems and solutions;  and they have already filtered out of the huge flow of information what they thought were most valuable, and often even managed to try it out in their work.  Besides, having heard something new, you can always "live" communicate with those who are in the know and have tried, discuss with him an attachment to your problems - usually people willingly share their vision, in fact, give free advice, because, discussing , they also advance in their understanding.  And I myself, in spite of the great experience, at each conference I discover something new. <br><br><h5>  Why should anyone who works or wants to work as an analyst should go / go exactly to Analyst Days? </h5><br>  Because now in the post-Soviet space it is one of two specialized analytical conferences (the second is the <a href="http://conf.uml2.ru/">Summer Analytical Festival</a> ).  The level of reports and communication on it is very decent, and it is an effective way to learn new things and develop professionally.  At the same time, in the days adjacent to the conference, there are always trainings by leading analysts, in addition to master classes at the conference itself, and this is also a great opportunity to learn something new.  It must be said that the trainings at the conference differ from the ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù trainings at the training centers by the fact that it is on them that the trainers try new forms, talk about what they themselves have recently mastered or realized.  So this is a wonderful way to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the work of an analyst for those who are going to develop in this direction, and for experienced specialists - the opportunity to see what is happening in the professional sphere and learn something new. <br><br> <a href="http://analystdays.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/746/2dd/2b47462dd725bfb48ebaa560cb2bd4cb.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216543/</a></p>
