    <br>  According to statistics, 43% of all purchases are made under the influence of the Internet, but directly online transactions account for only 9% of the total turnover.  It turns out that people look, choose, compare products on the Internet, but prefer to buy them offline. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In practice, there are a huge number of people who still prefer to buy in real stores.  Nothing can affect them, neither your super-loyal prices, nor the widest range of products, nor the simplest form of ordering ... <br><br><h5>  So WHAT all the same stops them?  And what to do with it? </h5><br><br><h4>  1. It is # DIFFICULT ... </h4><br><br>  Clients love sites with complex designs (in other words, ‚Äúexpensive ones‚Äù), and they don‚Äôt like at all that these very sites have complicated and incomprehensible navigation ... <br><br><blockquote>  Forrester Research's research proves that 50% of customers leave without buying just because they simply could not find what they were looking for ... </blockquote><br><br><br>  Visitors to your site should not learn how to use your site, based on what you impose on them.  The whole process should take place naturally, and navigation should be intuitive. <br><br>  <b>What to do:</b> <br><br>  Use the heat map to analyze where your customers click to find the right product. <br><br>  Remove all items that distract the customer from the main goal - finding the right product and purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3a1/38f/b37/3a138fb37e3255232006ca32d214c0aa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  * Ebay click card.  Source: <a href="http://www.eyeproved.com/">www.eyeproved.com</a> <br><br><h4>  2. This is # BORING ... </h4><br><br>  When shopping online, the attention of customers is the same as when shopping in a busy shopping center, where there are many shops.  It dissipates very quickly, moves from one store to another ... <br><br>  The situation is even more aggravated online by the fact that as soon as the visitor gets bored, it‚Äôs not interesting - he very quickly disappears for good ... <br><br>  <b>What to do:</b> <br><br>  Add some life to your site, make shopping exciting.  There are many ways to do this: <br><br><ol><li>  Gamification (game mechanic use) </li><li>  Interactive overview videos </li><li>  Social inclusion (for example, the ability to share news about a new purchase in social networks) </li><li>  And one more important point, pay attention to the speed of loading your site.  Not all customers have access to high-speed Internet, and I would not like to lose customers because of this. </li></ol><br><br><br><blockquote>  According to Kissmetrics, 25% of customers will close the site window if it loads for more than 4 seconds ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  A great example from Dropbox: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/239/d43/a13/239d43a137e9bfc71e4a3418c7bb4353.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They offer you a bonus - 250MB of additional disk space for completing some simple tasks. <br><br><h4>  3. Product Information # INSUFFICIENT ... </h4><br><br>  Buyers hate to issue a return of goods, hate the same way as sellers ... Therefore, customers refuse to buy those goods, the actual appearance of which they can not imagine. <br><br>  It is very important to describe the product so that after reading this description, the client understands what he will receive by opening the box at home. <br><br><blockquote>  The Forrester Research study shows that 45% of customers will immediately leave the site if they could not find the answer to their question ... </blockquote><br><br><br>  <b>What to do:</b> <br><br>  Add the most detailed description of the product, specifications, dimensions, etc. ... Add as many photos from different angles as possible (3D images can be used), video review, reviews of other buyers. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúCompare Products‚Äù option will not be superfluous, which will help the client to make a quicker choice. <br><br>  A great example is the iPad description on the Apple website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d7a/993/767/d7a9937671bf6e7f9e606b486f090477.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  4. Hands # DO NOT TOUCH ... </h4><br><br><br><blockquote>  People are tactile creatures, so it‚Äôs very important for us to ‚Äútouch‚Äù the product ... </blockquote><br><br><br>  The inability to physically see, touch the goods - one of the biggest problems online shopping.  Therefore, in order to overcome customer objections on this topic, one has to sell not just the product, but also the experience of using it. <br><br>  <b>What to do:</b> <br><br>  Make a description of the goods in such a way as to emphasize each advantage and create a visual picture in the buyers head, make the imagination work. <br><br>  It is not enough to simply describe the characteristics of the product, it is necessary to add information about the benefits that the customer will receive with this product. <br><br>  Photos, videos and reviews - MUST HAVE! <br><br>  See how Bellroy presents a new wallets model: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/spmL1PtXyjk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhSg0itFa7XB9L5X224-B82wFwgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  5. Understand the # SAMI ... </h4><br><br>  Having a huge product range - the key to market dominance.  Yes it is‚Ä¶ <br><br>  BUT, psychologists say that the choice of goods among a large range, a great stress for the human body. <br><br><blockquote>  Offering a large selection of products, but not offering assistance with a choice, you doom customers to long-term wandering in categories and cards of goods. </blockquote><br><br><br>  And, as soon as the client gets tired of all this, he will immediately leave without buying anything. <br><br>  <b>What to do:</b> <br><br>  Always put yourself in the shoes of customers to understand what they think they want to find on your site. <br><br>  Most buyers, especially generation Y, walk around the site, often without even knowing what exactly they need ... <br><br><br>  And this is your chance to act as an expert, to help pick what they like. <br><br>  Luna Sandals offer their customers an online assistant for choosing sandals: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/da9/dcd/28c/da9dcd28ceb43fbcbd5c4990bbd98b43.png" alt="image"><br><br>  81% of customers answered that they would buy in the store again, if they were satisfied with the previous purchase experience.  Therefore, getting rid of customers from the "headache" during online shopping, be sure to pay off in the future. <br><br>  Satisfied customers will buy more and more often, and most importantly bring you new customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298568/</a></p>
