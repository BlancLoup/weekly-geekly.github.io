New kind of business?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>WHAT IS SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP?</b> <br><br>  Often social entrepreneurship is confused with charity.  Of course, there are some of its elements.  But still, this is not exactly charity. <br><br>  <b>Social entrepreneurs</b> are entrepreneurs acting at the intersection of charity and traditional business, solving social problems, popularizing charity and philanthropy, and giving business a human face. <br>  Social entrepreneurs improve the world by inventing and spreading new approaches to solving social problems, using both traditional business practices and innovations, inventing new forms of business, or non-traditional adapting traditional business approaches to social problems.

      The Skoll Foundation offered the following formulation: <b>Social entrepreneurs</b> are agents of social change, creators of innovations who violate the status quo and change the world for the better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a45/38b/83a/a4538b83ab845a7d34d1d2227e12cd10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Social entrepreneurship is a big trend in Silicon Valley.  There are even educational programs that offer social entrepreneurship programs.  For example, Stanford University offers programs for social entrepreneurs: <a href="http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/">Center for Social Innovation</a> , <a href="http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/about/strategicplan/pathways">HAAS Center for Public Service</a> , Stanford Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society ( <a href="http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/">Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society</a> ). <br><br>  Here are the statistics of social activity of Americans: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6e/504/6ed/a6e5046ed129fd0c9f5a3632818d68c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Social entrepreneurship is becoming more and more popular recently in Russia, which, of course, is good news. <br><br>  <b>BUSINESS MODEL</b> <br>  Social entrepreneurship has adopted a hybrid business model, where commercial and non-commercial goals are tightly linked to each other. <br><br>  <b>PROJECT EXAMPLES</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">KIVA</a> is a platform that aims to fight poverty.  Kiva allows people to lend small amounts to various business needs ‚Äî for example, a woman in Zimbabwe can borrow money to buy a cow so she can earn money from selling milk.  Kiva earns on contributions from borrowers (about 15% of the loan amount). <br>  Here you can see the financial statements: <a href="http://www.kiva.org/annualreport/2012">www.kiva.org/annualreport/2012</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.razoo.com/">RAZOO</a> is a crowdfunding platform for social purposes.  Razoo's mission is to create a new generation of philanthropists.  At Razoo, you can create your own events, and collect money for those in need.  Not very clear concept of the Russian mentality, in the United States and Europe is very popular. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.causes.com/">Causes.com</a> is the largest support platform for various programs. <br><br>  <a href="http://gooddler.com/">GOODdler</a> - a platform for donating goods.  Charities spread the list of goods they need, and donors from around the world can buy goods for them.  Products will be delivered directly to a charity organization at the time they are needed. <br><br>  <a href="http://globein.com/">GlobeIn</a> is a great place to help artisans around the world and connect them with the global market.  Here you can buy great handmade products, and at the same time help people.  By the way, the site was founded by our compatriots. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.lyft.me/">Lyft</a> is a private taxi service where you can not just get to your home, but also get new friends.  A great alternative to our private owners - safe, secure, fun. <br><br>  Many businesses launch social initiatives as part of their core business.  For example, <a href="http://www.toms.com/marketplace%3Fcid%3Dcausesmpdis%26utm_medium%3Dmc%26utm_source%3Dcauses%26utm_campaign%3Dcausempdis">TOM's</a> is not only hipster shoes, but also a powerful social project. <br>  Also <a href="http://www.sleeptrain.com/community.aspx">SleepTrain</a> - a company that produces mattresses, has become known for their social activity.  They do a lot of social activity by helping orphanages ‚Äî they organize a collection of toys, which they then distribute to orphanages. <br><br>  <a href="http://ambarclub.org/">AmBAR</a> launched the social project <b>AmBAR Philanthropy</b> , which supports social startups, especially those founded by our compatriots.  This year, a special social session will be held at the <a href="http://svod.org/">SVOD conference</a> .  <a href="http://www.gooddler.com/">GOODdler</a> , <a href="https://sunnykarma.com/">SunnyKarma</a> and others will make <a href="http://www.gooddler.com/">presentations</a> to <a href="https://sunnykarma.com/">investors</a> . <br><br>  <b>RUSSIAN SOCIAL PROJECTS</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://lavkalavka.com/">LavkaLavka</a> - Perhaps one of the brightest and most beautiful social startups in Russia is a farmer project that aims to revive agriculture and lost gastronomic traditions in Russia and other countries.  LavkaLavka is an online project that helps farmers sell their products to residents of large cities, bypassing markets and a complex system of second-hand dealers.  The words of one of the founders of LavkaLavka, Boris Akimov, accurately reflect the spirit of social entrepreneurs: ‚ÄúI have such quality acquired with age - to do what I can at the moment.  I am certainly worried about what is happening with my country. ‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nikola-lenivets.com/">Nikola-Lenivets</a> - Another project is the natural-creative cluster ‚ÄúNikola-Lenivets‚Äù, located in the Kaluga region, and includes several villages.  The mission of Nikola-Lenivets is to create a natural, self-regulating environment for living, recreation, work and creativity in harmony with nature. <br><br>  <a href="http://te-st.ru/">Greenhouse social technology</a> - helps realize social startups online.  The mission of ‚ÄúGreenhouses of social technologies‚Äù is to develop a culture of creating civil online applications.  The guys are doing an amazing job, linking civil society activists and IT specialists. <br><br>  <b>FEATURES OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS</b> <br><br>  Communicating with social entrepreneurs, you always feel something connecting them.  I would single out a few features that unite these people: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Belief in the innate ability of <b>all</b> people to make a significant contribution to the economic and social development of society. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Desire to make the world better. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Determination that allows them to take risks and break out of the generally accepted framework. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Healthy impatience - they can not sit back and wait for change, they themselves are changing the world. <br><br>  Useful resources: <br>  - <a href="">business model canvas for social startups</a> <br>  - <a href="http://csi.gsb.stanford.edu/sehub">various useful resources on social entrepreneurship at the Stanford Center for Social Innovation</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201624/</a></p>
