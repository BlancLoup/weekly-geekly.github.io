We are all different: someone self-confident, and someone indecisive and lost in public.  But nevertheless, do not ignore the rather simple and even obvious advice in preparing for the defense of a graduation project. <br><br>  And yes, posting a picture with Robert Downey Jr.  to your desktop does not guarantee you success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/8d9/6c0/d338d96c09ce41339e42cb44375fdb10.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Go to protect other students </h3><br>  If public diploma protection is practiced at your university, that is, any students of the institute may be present, and not just the defender and the commission, then I advise you to go and see what it is so as not to think anything out.

      Alternatively, it is possible one year before the <s>Doomsday of</s> your defense to go to the defense of the senior course.  Personally, I didn‚Äôt go, because at that time we had a test session, a lab lab, and when we were invited to go after the test, I was too lazy.  But I had several acquaintances from senior years who described in detail how everything was.  Or go for the protection of classmates, speaking in earlier days. <br><br>  Why do I incite you to go look for protection?  You just have to understand that not all members of the commission (if at least one) will be in the subject line, what you are talking about.  True, someone from the commission can google in advance on the topics of reports on the protection of which he is present (in my defense this was the head of the department).  Otherwise, for your 7-10 minutes of the report, it is logical to assume that not all members of the commission will delve into all the details of the subject matter.  Therefore, most students are asked a tangible amount of standard questions.  Go to other defenses or chat with students who have already fired and make approximate templates of questions and be ready to answer them. <br><br>  If according to what you said there are no questions, it means that you have told you if it is very boring, and everything has passed by the ears of the commission, or nothing is clear to anyone.  Even a very good presentation will have a couple of questions. <br><br><h3>  A good report and presentation is the key to success. </h3><br>  Your speech during the report may show you in a favorable plan, even if your project is not as ambitious as we would like.  Don't underestimate speech rehearsal! <br><br>  It seems to many that, they say, I already wrote a diploma myself (from the author: I hope so) and I can formulate my idea correctly.  It is one thing ‚Äúright‚Äù to talk about the topic, but do not forget that you are given a limited period of time.  And you do not think that you may be incurred in some direction, and you will not have time to tell about other modules of the program, parts of the project.  I had such comrades in my group who reported for about twenty minutes instead of the seven allowed.  By the way, they can interrupt you, which is not good. <br><br>  At 22 years old (at the time of defending a specialist diploma), I could not boast of my oratorical abilities.  I rehearsed myself at home, after which I already knew that I would be telling each slide of the presentation.  Then, a couple of days before the defense, I presented my project at work, where it was written.  Here I received my test portion of questions.  One department head began to ask me very deep questions on topics that I could not answer.  But as it turned out a couple of minutes later, he thought that I would defend my candidate‚Äôs, and also in another direction (I didn‚Äôt communicate much with this boss).  After everything was cleared, it was said: "Then a good job."  Only a year later, I came across a picture: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/5a1/862/b575a18626794acca16e86a85635d70b.jpg"></div><br>  One of my classmates rehearsed in front of her friends, although they didn‚Äôt understand everything.  And by the way, she performed very cool, the slides were excellent and her speech was appreciated by all those present at the defense. <br><br>  I know that not all institutions have a pre-defense (in our institute, this is not practiced in all departments).  Feel free to rehearse a performance several times.  It does not matter, the first time it will be successful or not.  But it will be an experience on the basis of which you will make adjustments to your performance. <br><br>  A little less than a year after defending a diploma (my work has grown a bit during this time), I already spoke at a youth conference on the thesis topic, and some participants were surprised at how calm and confident I told my report (ok, to be honest, a little I was worried because the audience was more than a diploma).  Prepare a speech in advance, and it will give confidence when speaking. <br><br><h3>  Is it possible to do without special effects? </h3><br>  Before you conduct a live demonstration of your work (for example, if you did a project related to robotics), you need to carefully evaluate your time and readiness. <br><br>  At the demonstration, abnormal situations may arise and your copter or other device will not budge.  Or you should be 100% sure (and there are no guarantees) that nothing broke or burned before the performance.  If something does not go according to plan, you can be nervous that even a report cannot be completed.  Better make a video with the actions that you want to demonstrate to others.  A live demonstration, perhaps, is desirable only for students defending a degree in robotics, I don‚Äôt know for sure. <br><br><h4>  That's all I wanted to bring </h4><br>  If you follow these simple tips, then you will definitely succeed.  Yes, a diploma defense is not the worst thing in life, but it is a rather important event that needs to be approached with responsibility.  You may never have to speak at any seminars or conferences after defending a diploma.  But in order not to tell the epic stories, how you were tortured with questions for as long as half an hour and after that put three four to six years. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if there is any protection in December or January, as we did, but I still wish good luck to the defenders!  And try to make a diploma a little bit earlier than two days before the defense in order to prepare for the performance. <br><br>  And remember, a diploma is always useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/204/e31/45f204e31a0149bdbb864e8b536a829d.jpg"><br><br>  In the comments I am waiting for your interesting stories with the protection of the diploma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315756/</a></p>
