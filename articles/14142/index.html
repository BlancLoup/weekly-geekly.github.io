  <section class="page js-page"><h1>week's deliGoo: Lifehacker ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù, wicked admins of del.icio.us and Web product of the week</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Four days ago, on September 12, I wrote a topic <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/25091.html">called deliGoo</a> in <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/">Startups</a> <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/25091.html">to help del.icio.us users</a> .  It was the first material about our new project - <a href="http://www.deligoo.com/">deliGoo</a> , placed in open sources.  I placed it precisely on Habr√© not by chance, it was ‚Äúreconnaissance by force‚Äù - we wanted to test the deliGoo again before the final launch.  Intelligence was a success, we received some useful comments and made sure that deliGoo works not only on our machines :) <br><br>  September 13, we began active promotion through the media.  On the same day it began to bear fruit.  We were the first to publish <a href="http://webplanet.ru/corporate/service/2007/09/13/deligoo.html">Webplanet</a> in Runet, then there were publications in <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/09/14/is30">Internet gadgets</a> , <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/news/.info_news/2329/">SEOnews</a> and <a href="http://telnews.ru/event/14141">Telnews</a> . <br><br>  Abroad news about the launch of deliGoo spread like wildfire <a name="habracut"></a>  - Almost at the same time, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/deligoo_mashes_google_with_delicious.php">Read / WriteWeb</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/09/13/deligoo-custom-google-search-for-delicious/">Mashable were</a> written about us.  At that moment, when we saw it, it became clear - we are not threatened with obscurity: on the counters of RSS subscribers of each of these resources there is a figure exceeding 100k :)

      So it turned out.  News about our project moved around the world along with the sun - starting from the east coast of the United States, it consistently went around the media and bloggers of the Americas, spread to Asia, and then began to spread throughout Europe. <br><br>  On Thursday and Friday dozens of media and bloggers around the world wrote about us.  I had to read materials in Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German.  Surprisingly, <a href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a> literally coped with everyone!  With it, I could easily understand what the review was about and highlight a couple of phrases for publication in a special column on the <a href="http://www.deligoo.com/en/">deliGoo</a> website. <br><br>  On Saturday, in a weekly summary of events, Read / WriteWeb <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/weekly_wrapup_10-14september2007.php">called deliGoo ‚ÄúWeb product of the week‚Äù</a> .  Probably no need to explain how nice it is when people talk about your product that way :) <br><br>  But not without curiosities. <br><br>  For example, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/bookmarking/custom-google-search-your-delicious-bookmarks-with-deligoo-300036.php">Lifehacker.com</a> wrote about us (6th place among the blogs of the world by <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">Technorati rating</a> ), while managing to put an incorrect link to the site.  Because  it was already ‚Äútheir‚Äù on Friday evening, and I didn‚Äôt get an answer to my letter asking for the correct link in their material, which at that time was on the main lifehacker.com, we had to urgently do an automatic redirect from their incorrect link to main page deliGoo :) <br><br>  Another thing that surprised us was the behavior of the del.icio.us service administration.  Not surprisingly, having lit up in the media, deliGoo quickly began to gain popularity primarily among del.icio.us users.  Anyone who uses this excellent service knows about the reflex, when you see a curious site, you immediately reach for the Delishis button on the browser panel to remember it in your bookmarks.  And here we are talking about a service designed for del.icio.us users. <br><br>  Our case was no exception - the link to the deliGoo website quickly became popular and hit the top on the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> home page and <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">the popular tab</a> .  What was our surprise when after a while she suddenly abruptly disappeared from him!  At the same time, all neighboring links to other popular sites remained in place, and the indicators of the popularity of our link did not decrease, but continued to grow.  It became clear that without any manual intervention in the rating of one of the largest social resources of the Internet, it was not done. <br><br>  After some thought, we realized that the situation has a fairly clear explanation.  The del.icio.us service is owned by Yahoo, and we got into their monastery with a plugin that uses the <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/">search product of</a> their main competitor, Google.  And this plugin began to quickly gain popularity, and it turned out that they advertised it on their own website.  Apparently, for a long time their patience was not enough, and the link to deliGoo disappeared from popular ratings. <br><br>  Interestingly, the same fate subsequently befell a link to our other page, which was not entirely correct, but appeared in several reviews, and users often kept it in their bookmarks.  She, too, was removed from the top on the tab popular.  And when a link to the deliGoo review on the popular Japanese resource <a href="http://google-mania.net/archives/218">Google Mania was</a> ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù from the top, we just smiled :) <br><br>  The main thing is that the links themselves have not disappeared from the bookmarks of users.  Yes, and on the secondary pages of the del.icio.us rating you can see them - see, for example, the <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/search">popular search tags</a> (by the way, out of 12 links on this page, 5 are somehow related to deliGoo, and the indicator (xxx recently) is still would provide a link to the main page of our site a place in the top of the most popular links del.icio.us, compare yourself). <br><br>  But, of course, this behavior of the del.icio.us administration surprised us very unpleasantly.  And not so much because of our product (although, of course, it was insulting), but because of the violation of the very idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãWeb 2.0, when the ratings are determined by the users, and not by the moderators who protect someone's interests.  And this happens in a "free" country ...  In general, this incident somehow lowered us from the clouds to the earth in relation to the web-divan. <br><br>  Ok, I'm rounding up.  The week was interesting and intense.  The main thing that we have learned for ourselves according to its results: on the Internet it is really not so important where you are physically.  It is important that you do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14142/</a></p>
