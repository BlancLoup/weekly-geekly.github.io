  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effects of working space on efficiency</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A very long time I went to writing this article. <br>  Even in the summer, here, on Megamind, an article was posted on how one development company was looking for a comfortable place to work for itself and eventually came to the conclusion that an ideal office should be built.  Thanks to the guys for the inspiration to share their own experience in different types of premises. <br><br>  We get acquainted - I am a marketer (advertising and marketing specialist) in an internet marketing company. <br>  I have a wealth of experience in different types of premises. <br>  A huge building in the forest, owned by one company, a business center in the business part of the city, where there are many companies, a small office near the metro.  Everywhere there were advantages and disadvantages. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Becoming a part of a small new team - we were looking for a comfortable space for ourselves, wherever no one would interfere with work and where it would be convenient to get with minimal time loss.  Travel time to work is one of the most painful issues.  Since  in the cold season, and this is in Siberia for almost 6 months, movement on the roads becomes difficult.  For 6 months, the city in the morning and evening costs 8 points of traffic jams.  Tired of all this, we came to the decision to rent a cottage, which was converted into a business house.

All summer we spent training seminars, which the company must take place a couple of times a week, on a spacious veranda.  By the way, the veranda also became a dining room and a sports hall - everything depended on the weather and our mood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/440/e78/222/440e78222a45476d979761ae59fda941.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  In front of the house is parking for 5 cars, where we have already managed to cram in 7. In our free time, we dream over how to increase parking for a couple more parking spaces. <br><br>  Heat came to our house with the first cold snap, because  The house has its own heating. <br>  Efficiency work in a relaxed atmosphere affected more than benevolently.  Not distracting from the work on trifles (tickets, gerbolife, books, etc.), we manage to do more and better, which is of great importance in our field of activity. <br>  Previously untested approaches to working with clients ‚Äî project teams ‚Äî play a large role in many ways.  Previously, small groups were involved, if you can call it that - SEO-specialist and maintenance specialist.  Now the scheme has expanded - a single project is being worked on - an SEO specialist, a client support specialist, a web developer, a web analyst, a copywriter and a marketer.  Labor costs are higher, but they are compensated by high productivity of work. <br><br>  Considering that the movement is one of the most scrupulous moments, then here turned out to be its advantages.  To the nearest subway on an empty road 15 minutes by car without exceeding the speed.  With traffic lights and small traffic jams - 25 minutes. <br>  Customers willingly come to us, rather out of curiosity, because  it is not typical for Novosibirsk to work in an office building, especially if there are about 20 people in the staff. <br><br>  Specialists of the sales department also say that it is quite comfortable to go to meetings, although many of them do not have personal transport and move around in public.  By the way, what is the disadvantage of the location - the public transport stop is relatively far away. <br><br>  At the moment, our corporate house is rented, but plans are to build our own building outside the city limits and continue working in this room format. <br>  It will be interesting to know who else has experience of similar work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295698/</a></p>
