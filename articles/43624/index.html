Friendly advice: do not.  And if you already have it - close it. <br><br>  Blogging now doesn't seem like such a good idea as 4 years ago.  The blogosphere, an earlier oasis for spontaneous self-expression and clever thoughts, has swept over a tsunami of paid-up nonsense.  Cheap journalism and guerrilla marketing campaigns muffled the real voices of non-professional masters of the word.  It has become almost impossible to attract attention, except for the attention of critics.  And why bother?  The time it takes to write fine, witty prose will be more useful to express yourself on Flickr, Facebook or Twitter. <br><br>  If you quit now, you will be in good company.  The famous talker, Jason Calacanis, made millions on his Weblogs network.  But he completely abandoned his blog in June.  ‚ÄúBlogging is just too big, too impersonal, and it lacks the intimacy that attracted me to him,‚Äù he wrote in his last post.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  He is right about impersonality: check the list of the top 100 blogs on Technocrati and you will find that personal sites have been superseded by professional ones.  Many essentially online magazines are: The Huffington Post, Engadget, TreeHugger.  An independent commentator will not hijack a team of professional authors, issuing up to 30 posts per day. <br><br>  When the blogosphere was still young, enthusiasts were on horseback and posts quickly turned out to be in the top of Google by any request.  In 2002, the search for ‚ÄúMark‚Äù was led by Mark Piligrim, a web developer, above Mark Twain himself.  This phenomenon was part of what made blogging so exciting.  Not more.  Today, if you are looking for, for example, the last speech of Barack Obama (Barack Obama), the first links will be to a page in Wikipedia, an article on Fox News and a couple of entries from professional sites such as Politico.com.  What are your chances of your highbrow text falling high on this list?  Equal to zero, no doubt. <br><br>  Thus, your blog will attract only the lowest form of life on the Net: debaters and brawlers.  Post your soul to the blog, and some anonymous trolls with nicknames r0rschach or foohack will seep in comments with your daubs like ‚ÄúNonsense.  Why don't you just kiss McCain's ass. ‚ÄùThat's why Calacanis has retired in his personal newsletter.  He can speak with his fans directly, without suffering from the idiotic replicas of anonymous spitters. <br><br>  Moreover, websites with predominantly textual content are no longer so popular.  The reason blogs took off is because they made publishing text easy for non-techies.  Part of this simplicity was the lack of support for pictures, audio and video clips.  At that time, multimedia content was too heavy to download and demanding to the channel. <br><br>  Social media sites like YouTube, Flickr and Facebook made publishing pictures and videos as easy as typing.  Even easier if you take into account the time that most bloggers spend, caring about the quality of their texts.  Take a cue from Robert Scoble, who made a name for himself as a Technical Evangelist and Microsoft official blogger from 2003 to 2006.  Now he mainly publishes videos and notes on Twitter.  ‚ÄúI still keep my blog mainly for long texts,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Twitter, which limits the recording length to 140 characters, in 2008 is what the blogosphere was in 2004.  You will find here Scoble, Calacanis and most of their buddies of that golden age.  They argue - this is because Twitter is much more operational than the blogosphere.  And you can search Twitter posts right after posting, without waiting for Google to index them. <br><br>  As a person writing, though, I appreciate him for his brevity.  Bloggers are now expected to write clever, insightful, witty prose to compete with Huffington and The New York Times.  Twitter‚Äôs limited size makes it all equal.  It allows amateur bloggers to stop worrying about the quality of their texts and get to the bottom line. <br><br>  <i>The translation was made on the website <a href="http://translated.by/you/twitter-flickr-facebook-make-blogs-look-so-2004/">translated.by</a> on the initiative of the microblogging service <a href="http://www.smster.ru/">SMSter.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43624/</a></p>
