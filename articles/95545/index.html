It‚Äôs good if you studied Yandex.karts or Google Maps before the trip ... or, for example, you have maps of the required scale or a knowledgeable travel companion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50d/b19/d78/50db19d78e20bd2e2da7567ca1f14515.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And if all this stuff is not?  An unknown road, dark and invisible signs, an urgent meeting at an unknown caf√© ... Apparently, it was just in such cases that portable navigators were invented once. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company Prestigio has released a lot of navigators, even very many - they all come under the GeoVision brand.  Model Prestigio GeoVision 4200 is considered a novelty, its company released recently.  Despite the fact that the device belongs to the budget, the device has quite good performance characteristics: a screen of 4.3 inches, a 533 MHz processor, a Centrality Atlas IV chip with a satellite receiver with 64 channels is all that is needed to complete the main task assigned to the navigators.

Accordingly, there is no possibility to fix the navigator on the dashboard, and due to the fact that there is no cover, you will have to carry the device in your pocket (well, if there is a garage and the device can be left in the car). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7c/140/458/f7c140458b7dbedf9e53de87d5b4e7d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is a pity that in the kit there was no place for a memory card - at least the smallest, it is primitive to throw something.  Usually in all devices of any price range (phones, communicators, e-books, fotik, etc.) at least some kind of memory card yes there is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2a/04b/113/b2a04b113ae0e6e3ba6231c064a93bb7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="-">  Appearance </h2><br>  It is difficult to come up with something unusual in the design of a budget navigator, so in principle, everything is standard.  You can mark, perhaps, a small thickness (only 13 mm) of the device - with such dimensions it will easily fit in your pocket.  Dimensions - 119x75x13 mm and weight in 160 g <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d63/10a/8c0/d6310a8c0792f6bdee898df3a4466019.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Practical materials - the back side and all sides around the perimeter are completely made of rubberized soft-touch material, and the front side is formed of a thin aluminum sheet with a fine polishing texture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/215/cd7/11e/215cd711ebe44a4ab7db425a6c4f0d65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Matte screen is good;  diagonal - this model has 4.3 inches with a resolution of 480x272.  True, it is framed with a thin frame - this contributes to the accumulation of dirt in the corners, but does not affect the ease of pressing the corner buttons on the screen.  The screen in bright sunlight is significantly blind - you can make out the picture at maximum brightness, but this is not so comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c1/a32/367/1c1a323671cb53748247222e9910c04d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the sides, everything is standard - a slot for a microSD card, miniUSB and a 3.5mm jack (for headphones), a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù reset and a button on the switch.  Above and below there are small recesses intended for fastening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfe/5e3/873/cfe5e387358fcf0d43946b0efdc3e63d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side, there is a small ‚Äúglass‚Äù with a piece of the circuit inside - I found out by experience that this is a light sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/785/733/af7/785733af72d296d7c87c4d713670ddac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08e/372/e57/08e372e57833bee8903a427947562456.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The mount is very small, but it provides the necessary freedom to rotate the device.  Easily (de) mounted and securely holds the device. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  The device is turned on by holding the button on the upper end - after 10 seconds (‚Äúcold‚Äù start) the device comes to a combat state.  Another 5 seconds goes to download navigation software, which in this model is Navitel Navigator. <br><br>  The main menu is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa7/564/075/fa7564075be14fafafc62e07afac4277.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first button starts, of course, the main function of the device.  Further, the most common Navitel, to which I was very used to.  The pre-installed map was a bit surprised - it was all over Russia, but even Moscow was shown very mediocre (the atlas was ‚Äúten-kilometer‚Äù, although for a long time there is a more accurate one, with 1 km details). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/621/639/816/621639816610d1d012206b26c080bf21.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only the main roads, the names of settlements and a little POI - knowing that this should not be the case (after all, I had been stuck on Navigator for a couple of years - there was excellent detailing of at least all of Moscow and Moscow Region), got on the site - there they immediately accepted the registration key and gave opportunity to upgrade.  I also learned that with the navigator there is an opportunity to update for two years for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a19/9fc/d42/a199fcd42128f955602d228a0bd766a6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Satellites are caught quickly enough, but of course there is no information about traffic jams.  Reception is stable, no troubles occurred during testing.  The only thing that did not like it - adjusting the sound volume without hardware buttons on the go turned out to be quite difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/574/f56/a29574f56a13cffe4175be5ed2f2fde6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to navigation, there are a few non-core functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27e/1c9/0df/27e1c90df00df00dca55299ec9f1bb79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, the image viewer (turn, ¬±, full screen and something else there): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3f/d88/36b/b3fd8836b03ddd4c554861ff201b7f3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... a music player (quite convenient, although the buttons are not enough), a video viewer (honestly, I didn‚Äôt even try it, but I think running a small converted AVI-shku on such a processor will not be a problem) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c3/2e0/5a2/3c32e05a2c7a103541032bc9ca66eb86.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... and reader texts (no problems with the Cyrillic alphabet).  Here it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a34/f50/796/a34f50796903a3750d0a1450a6350b81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The settings page is simple - it's nice that at least here all the buttons are large.  There are 18 (!) Interface languages, battery indicator, volume and backlight adjustment, time setting and screen calibration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/055/c78/ef5055c7805040b6e8f71dd223df77e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device does not slow down at all - neither when going through the menu, nor when the program is running.  And what's more, as with all Windows devices, you can still upload a lot more inside, enhancement functionality for.  For example, on the same w3bsit3-dns.com there is a small (5 pages) <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D149763">branch</a> dedicated to this particular navigator model - judging by the discussions, there are absolutely no problems with the menu modification (which means you can add any navigation software that they do ).  Well, all other programs there too, apparently, are suitable - file managers, toys, reading rooms, etc. <br><br>  The sensitivity of the screen is very good, there are no problems with pressing the buttons in the corner of the display (more inconvenient if they are small) - the stylus has never been useful. <br><br>  When connected to a computer, the navigator emits 3-4 unpleasant "creaking-quacking" - what is the reason, I don‚Äôt know) Fortunately, I connected it only a couple of times.  A flash drive for 2 and 4GB the device is equally normal, so you can throw some content periodically. <br><br>  If you hold the off button, the reverse timer (for 10 seconds) and two buttons - ‚ÄúOff‚Äù and ‚ÄúZzz‚Äù will appear on the screen.  After the first item, the device will turn on for 10 seconds, after the second - 1-2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b03/ef9/790/b03ef9790941ed0ea670e2fb3f0ce0e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device has a removable lithium-polymer battery for 1200 mAh (3.7 V) - it lasts only 2-3 hours of battery life. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Compact size <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good build quality, non-marking body, matte screen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Very smart works, including quickly turns on <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  It is possible to expand the functionality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Sure reception of a signal <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Price <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  No traffic jams, bluetooth, DVR functions, etc. - it was necessary to leave something to expensive devices) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Poor equipment - no memory card or cover <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  No hardware volume control keys <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Short battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The screen "goes blind" in the sun <br><br>  In fact, all the disadvantages are not serious - if you drive a car on the navigator, the battery life is corrected by the charging from the cigarette lighter.  However, as well as the problem with the screen - it happened that the sun shines in the eyes, but that the navigator turned from the sun does not.  As for the brief fuss with installing a new card at the very beginning, it‚Äôs even a plus.  Rarely "out of the box" is the actual software, so it was a great reason to update the software, the map and get a closer look at the work of the navigator. <br><br>  By the way, the price is more than anti-crisis - from 3990 rubles. <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  I have never come across the products of this company before, so the level of technology that they produce for me was a mystery to the last.  Although, of course, who is judging by one device ... but in general, everything is very good. <br>  This navigator is ANOTHER navigator on the market and it has a huge number of competitors, so it‚Äôs quite difficult to stand out with something special.  Or maybe ... and not necessarily something to stand out, it is enough just to be a good working tool that performs the main task assigned to it well for a small price?  Here, this is about this device. <br>  So if you need a navigator, without any bluetooth there ... then for such a price, why not.  More functionality is in indexes with a large index - there is already at its discretion.  I will add only that it is still better to buy devices with a screen of 5 or even 7 inches.  So that everything could always be seen, but at speed it was not necessary to aim at the buttons and peer into the inscriptions;  4 inches - a minimum. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95545/</a></p>
