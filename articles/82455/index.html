I will try not to make any loud statements, but I will write something that is not convenient for me.  I hope to find a bit of understanding you,%% username. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For many years (more than 6) using Oper, I am saving up "fatigue" like metal, and apparently it‚Äôs time to burst / break in anticipation of the emergence of a new Oper'y 10.50.  Yes, the speed of the new version has increased - it's great!  Support for the latest standards is great.  But the old sores shade all this beauty.

      A couple of years ago I was already trying to convey something to the developers, but I did not achieve anything, because  acted alone.  Now I would like, with the help of support, to write them a normal message, which they at least read.  In this topic, I will try to explain all the disadvantages that I have long been saving in my subconscious (PS, but can you tell me if they have any solutions?). <br><br>  Go‚Ä¶ <br>  1. The inability to copy a table with a table in MS Word.  Absurd ... The first example that comes to mind is <a href="http://top100.rambler.ru/top100">Rambler's Top100</a> .  Consequently, it remains either to copy from other browsers, or through MS Excel, but at the same time losing hyperlinks and other formatting. <br>  2. The inability to create folders in Opera Mail.  Of course, I understand that she does not claim to be a full-fledged mail client, but a large number of users, according to my observations, lack this in Opera Mail, as a result of which, they switch to other mail clients.  But I like Oper's mobility (I use it in a portable form and carry it on a flash drive) - I can come in from any computer and check my email, read RSS. <br>  3. RSS ... It is impossible to display the names of the news feeds in the news list, although they are set in the news feed management window (there you can set a static name, or you can use the name from the news feed).  I have a static (readable for me), but in the news list the name is still taken from the tape. <br>  4. Personal panel / navigation panel ... There are several drawbacks in the personal panel at once: <br>  - impossibility to transfer it under the address panel; <br>  - the inability to insert simple and dynamic delimiters; <br>  - when bookmarks are added to it (by dragging the page tabs), they appear in the root of the bookmarks folder, which creates some confusion. <br>  Now I have a navigation bar adapted for storing bookmarks for frequently used resources.  She does not have the above minuses.  But she has other disadvantages: <br>  - it is inconvenient to make new bookmarks (because this panel was not intended for bookmarks, then you can‚Äôt create a bookmark by simply dragging it); <br>  - the inability to open a bookmark with the middle mouse button (scroll) so that it opens in a new tab; <br>  - It is impossible to make / create a folder with bookmarks. <br>  So what I am leading to, it would be necessary to combine the advantages of these two panels and you get the perfect tool. <br><br>  Another good thing would be to remove IRC and BitTorrent clients (or make them modular, not to install them during installation).  Having them in a browser that requires a lot of RAM just to be turned on and do nothing is absurd.  I uTorrent with 64 distributions eats a little more than 32MB.  Opera just turned on is already 35Mb.  A little surfing, and even then stand on the distribution of torrents - all 150-200Mb. <br><br>  Support for Widgets and Units would also be selective during installation.  I personally do not need them. <br><br>  PS And in order to please all Oper'y users, it would be nice to add to the choice when installing Opera Mail, RSS and Dragonfly - after all, not everyone uses these functions.  Those.  make oper'u fully collapsible.  Someone just needs a browser - please. <br><br>  PS2.  I wanted to write something else, but I forgot: ( <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  I hope that the matter will move from the dead center and go further discussion in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82455/</a></p>
