  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you want coworking in Thailand?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For two and a half years I have been living in this country.  All anything, not enough of one - like-minded people.  In this post I decided to find out - how many people are interested in the opportunity to live and work in Thailand, in the co-working center in the north of the country? <br><br><h4>  Why do you need this? </h4><br><ul><li>  <i>Cheap life.</i>  The same standard of living can be saved at a much lower cash cost.  For those who like to stick this word in each article - ok, call it an anti-crisis proposal.  For those who do not like - the costs are so small that it was more convenient to live here before the crisis. </li><li>  <i>Easy life.</i>  There is a lot of infrastructure, it is near, it is cheap.  A bunch of food establishments, cafes, markets, entertainment of various kinds.  All in a minute ride a motorcycle. </li><li>  <i>Interesting life.</i>  First of all, it is a foreign country, an exotic country.  Secondly, there are many interesting, free-thinking people from all over the world.  There are many ways to spend time actively, creatively, etc. </li><li>  <i>Colorful life.</i>  What is better - to work in a former factory floor, or a beautiful tropical garden?  I offer the second! </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Why do I need this? </h4><br>  Some may be suspicious - if everything is so cool, then the guy probably wants to make some money?  Yes, the guy wants to earn extra money, but in a slightly different way: working productively in a society of interesting, creative colleagues and like-minded people.  Therefore, the enterprise will be completely non-commercial, as was originally accepted in co-working initially (to admit, I am even jarred by the sterile-glamorous interiors of domestic co-working establishments).  Therefore, I will not accept the announcement ‚Äúcome to work with us, the entrance costs so much, photos are attached‚Äù.

      Naturally, if it goes, such an announcement will appear here.  In the meantime, I want to gather a "mighty handful" of people who form the backbone of the co-working center.  People who are ready are ready to pack their bags;) <br><br>  I am ready to offer these people help in: <br><ul><li>  Move </li><li>  Visa Issues </li><li>  Orienteering </li></ul><br>  Naturally, since these people form the backbone of the community, they are required to be active and willing to sacrifice themselves in all matters relating to the arrangement of the center. <br><br>  What do you think? <br><br><h4>  Mini-FAQ on questions from comments </h4><br>  <i>I have a wife, I can not to Thailand!</i> <br>  It‚Äôs not for nothing that I wrote ‚Äúthe north of Tayalanda‚Äù - these are not at all beach sex resorts.  Here, it can be said, the intellectual center - many universities, many students.  There are even international faculties, which is why there are many young and intelligent Americans and Europeans. <br><br>  Moreover: family is even welcome - a family man is more responsible.  Because he will come to work, and not hang out in bars, or cafes, or hang out all day in a hammock.  Well, it‚Äôs more interesting for family people to come not to some kind of resort for beach gelatinous life among the hell who, but to a more or less decent city to improve their living standards or reduce costs. <br><br>  I myself have a wife :).  Moreover, many acquaintances live here with 1-2 children of completely different ages - from infants to school (students are already going to study either in the capital, or in developed countries - Australia, Europe, the USA). <br><br>  <i>What with the passport and visa regime?</i>  <i>Don't be dark!</i> <br>  Visa-free entry or visa on arrival for the month.  Through simple manipulations, you can obtain and then extend longer-term visas.  People live here for years. <br><br>  <i>What are the costs of living?</i> <br>  It all depends on you.  You can live in a room for 2500 rubles a month and eat local food for 20 rubles.  You can live in a palace for thousands of dollars and eat in pathos restaurants.  You can choose some intermediate state. <br><br>  <i>Can I open a bank account, pay taxes?</i>  <i>Work?</i> <br>  An account can be opened, as an Inserant, to receive money from anywhere.  To work - having found an employer who is ready to carry out all operations for legalization.  However, in this topic, we are talking primarily about remote work. <br><br>  <i>Where is it at all - the north of Thailand?</i> <br>  It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai">here</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56705/</a></p>
