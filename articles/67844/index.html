The first problem the newcomer faces is the program of studies.  Where to begin?  How to do?  How many approaches / reps?  And if not?  A good coach can answer all these questions, if there is no such one available - read on.  In this post I want to pay attention to the BASIC exercises around which the rest of the workout should be built.  The optimal number of visits - 3 times a week.  This program may be enough for 3 months or half a year.  After that, it should be modified so that the body does not get used to the load and does not stop responding to the iron ‚Äústimulus‚Äù.

The latest progress in the press comes with great difficulty. <br>  The most common mistake - the separation of the pelvis from the bench during an exercise.  It will instinctively, if the weight is large, in this case you increase the load on the triceps, but ‚Äúunload‚Äù the pectoral muscles.  It is worth getting rid of this habit, because it is NOT pressing from the chest, but something else.  Also, do not tilt / tear off the head, as an option - you can do the "bridge". <br>  And remember - the wider your grip (but within reason) - the greater the load on the chest, the narrower - the more on the hands.  Manual <a href="http://athlete.ru/trening/gym_sheiko.htm">athlete.ru/trening/gym_sheiko.htm</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm up, 4 sets of 6-8 times with a working weight.  Every week you add to the working weight +1 kg, but do not reduce the number of repetitions in the approaches. <br><br>  2 - This press is similar to a horizontal bench press, with the only difference that the working weight in the exercise will be less (by a rough estimate) 15-20 kg, here the ‚Äútop‚Äù of the pectoral muscles and a fair share of the deltoid are involved.  Description <a href="http://www.sila-tela.ru/jim_na_naklonnoy_skamie.html">www.sila-tela.ru/jim_na_naklonnoy_skamie.html</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm up, 4 sets of 6-8 times with a working weight.  Every week you add to the working weight +1 kg, but do not reduce the number of repetitions in the approaches.  It is possible that you will do your best in the regular bench press and will not be able to quickly progress in the bench on the inclined bench. <br><br>  3 - This exercise is preparation for full barbell squats.  Until you can do 1.5 of your own weight for 15 times - do not even go to the power frame. <br>  So, in the press with the legs lying down, the socks are spread out, the feet at the top of the platform.  The pelvis and back are NOT removed from the bench at the time of execution, the harmful load on the lower back is already present.  The knees should touch the chest, the downward movement is restrained, the upward movement is intensely powerful. <br>  Manual (without pictures) <a href="http://www.sila-tela.ru/jim_nogami.html">www.sila-tela.ru/jim_nogami.html</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm-up, 4 sets of 15 times.  Next week we add 5-10 kg to the starting weight. <br><br>  4 - The cornerstone of power sports.  Alpha and Omega.  Yin and Yang.  Honestly, I would write a separate article about squats, but in order not to bore readers, I‚Äôll give you a link to a good manual <a href="http://fatalenergy.com.ru/power/index.php%3Fnewsid%3D1183240990">fatalenergy.com.ru/power/index.php?newsid=1183240990</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm up with an empty neck, 4 sets with a working weight.  The first week X kg 10 times, the second week X + 5 kg 8 times, the third week X + 10 kg 6 times, the fourth week X + 15 kg 4 times, next month you add 2.5 or 5 kg to the starting one weight. <br><br>  5 - This exercise in itself will not cause difficulties, and doing it wrong is quite difficult.  It is carried out on an inclined bench, dumbbells are either ‚Äúthrown‚Äù on the chest or are served by the insurers. <br>  <b>Progress</b> : without a warm-up, the working weight of the dumbbells for 3-4 sets of 10-12 times.  +1 kg every week. <br><br>  6 - Exercise rather stretching.  And what does stretching give us?  "Stock" for the growth of muscle fibers and resistance to injury.  We put the weights on the floor, with the handles up, at the width ‚Äî a little more than the width of the shoulders.  The legs are thrown on the bench, the body in its original position - parallel to the floor.  We do exercises to failure, then NOT stopping we put our feet on the floor, our knees touch the floor, we finish ourselves. <br><br>  7 - A good description is here <a href="http://ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_nog/razgibanie_nog">ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_nog/razgibanie_nog</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : without a warm-up, 3-4 approaches for 10 times, progressing in the basic exercise, you should not have the strength to make progress in this, ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù ... <br><br>  8 - Starting position - the back is pressed to the bench (+ the feet of the legs rest against something), the chest with the wheel, the upper part of the back rests against the bench.  The rod stroke ‚Äî behind the head ‚Äî down restrainedly, to the middle of the skull (approximately where the head ends and the neck begins), up ‚Äî with effort, powerfully. Note, over time, you can increase the width of the grip ‚Äúfor risks‚Äù on the rod, thereby ceasing to load triceps and increase the load on the deltoid muscles. <br>  Manul here <a href="http://ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_delt/gym_shtangi_sidya">ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_delt/gym_shtangi_sidya</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm-up, 4 sets of 8-10 times.  Every week we increase the weight of the bar by 1 kg. <br><br>  9 - He is the " <a href="http://hardgainer.ru/hard2.view1.page14.html">Stand Barbell</a> Press" instruction in pictures <a href="http://hardgainer.ru/hard2.view1.page14.html">hardgainer.ru/hard2.view1.page14.html</a> <br>  I would add on my own - a prerequisite - a weightlifting belt, legs can be left either shoulder-width apart or fully closed.  And when you move the bar down, you have to touch the chest, if you only make the movement up to the chin, then this is, firstly, not so high-quality, and secondly, you will constantly experience problems while pressing in the Dead Point.  On the last repetitions, if it‚Äôs very hard, but there is no fear, you can slightly bend your legs, and then straighten up with your whole body, launching an inertial wave, as it were, which will slightly ease the movement of the bar upwards.  I do not advise abusing such a "reading", the quality of the exercise decreases. <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm-up, 4 sets of 6-8 times.  Every week we increase the weight of the bar by 1 kg. <br><br>  10 - The most common mistake is a ‚Äúhumpback‚Äù back.  This also occurs instinctively when the required muscles of the novice athlete are not yet developed and the thrust of the block occurs with the whole body, stupidly bending the upper back.  Therefore, the chest is wheel-mounted, the back is as flat as an arrow, the block moves strictly vertically, hands (from the fingers to the deltas) and the upper part of the back are attached. <br>  Video here <a href="http://vision.rambler.ru/users/perfit2/1/56/">vision.rambler.ru/users/perfit2/1/56</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm up, then X kg for 15 times, X + one plate for 12 times, X + 2 plates for 10 times, X + 3 plates for 8 times, X + 4 plates for 6 times.  Strength remained - X + 5 plates 4 times.  Every week we add 1.5 kg to the weights in each repetition. <br><br>  11 - Exercise on the development of "wings", they are also the broadest back muscles.  Do not forget that (when viewed in profile) the vertebral column minimally deviates, only the back and arms and shoulders actually work.  Flexion-extension of the whole body is not needed.  Video from Turchinsky <a href="http://www.kach.com.ua/turchinskiy.php%3Fid%3Dtur_2-3">www.kach.com.ua/turchinskiy.php?id=tur_2-3</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm-up, 4 sets of 10-12 times.  With proper bench press techniques, the ‚Äúwings‚Äù will grow anyway, so be careful with increasing weights. <br><br>  12 - Like the most important exercise for the lower back / ‚Äúballoons‚Äù (chest-lumbar fascia in the common people), and 90% do it wrong.  It is performed on the ‚ÄúRoman chair‚Äù, it is important not only to throw the body down, and then return to its original position - this is a real jerk, a waste of time and fun for those who watch from the side.  You should DIMINATE at the top point for 2-3 seconds, while maximally lifting the body due to the lower back muscles.  We lower the case, we lift, we detain in the top point, we lower.  Cycle.  Correct feelings after 4 approaches for 10 times - as if iron piles were hammered into the back, spasms when trying to bend, etc. (: <br>  <b>Progress</b> : 4 approaches for 10 times, stopping at the top point for 2-3 seconds, next week add one repetition to each approach. <br><br>  13 - There is a lot written on a <a href="http://hardgainer.ru/hard2.view2.page14.html">subject hardgainer.ru/hard2.view2.page14.html</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : 4 sets of 10-12 times.  It is assumed that you will replace pull-ups without weight with pull-ups with weights (put a belt on and hang pancakes / dash on it) <br><br>  14 - The exercise is performed similarly to a barbell press while sitting, with that kn \ bim difference, that in your hands you have dumbbells, at the end point of the elbows are parallel to the floor, a detailed manual here <a href="http://biceps.com.ua/tehnika-vyipolneniya-uprazhneniy/deltyi-zhim-ganteley-sidya">biceps.com.ua/tehnika-vyipolneniya-uprazhneniy/deltyi-zhim-ganteley -sidya</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : 3-4 approaches 10 times.  Do not forget to wear a belt. <br><br>  15 - Exercise on target load is similar to paddle cravings.  Description here: <a href="http://www.ironmine.narod.ru/kinesiology/exercises/general_back/bb_bent_over.htm">www.ironmine.narod.ru/kinesiology/exercises/general_back/bb_bent_over.htm</a> <br><br>  16 - None of the exercises load the long head of the triceps like this.  The main point is that when the rod is lying on the outstretched arms, the grip is narrow, either on the bench or on the EZ-shaped bar, there are no special variations; when moving, the arm from the shoulder to the elbow is static, only the forearm moves, the arms themselves are parallel and the elbows are not divorced to the sides!  You can perform as "to the forehead," and for the head.  <a href="http://ironmensport.com/uprazhn_na_tricyps/francuzkiy_gym_lega">ironmensport.com/uprazhn_na_tricyps/francuzkiy_gym_lega</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm up with an empty neck, 3-4 sets of 8-10 times, +1 kg every week. <br><br>  17 - This exercise is a mandatory step on the path to strong triceps, partly chest and shoulders work.  Exercise is similar to the usual bench press, with only one condition that the grip is narrow, and the distance between the thumbs is no more than 20 cm. The important point is that the elbows are pressed as close as possible to the body when you do the exercise. doing a curve bench press.  Podrbono described here <a href="http://www.steelfactor.ru/trening/075.html">www.steelfactor.ru/trening/075.html</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : warm-up, 4 sets of 8-10 times, +1 kg every week. <br><br>  18 - The royal exercise for the development of legs and back entirely. Technique exercises on the difficulty is comparable to the squat, manul here <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanovaya_tyag</a> , to describe the technique in words is quite difficult.  The first three months of classes are not recommended; replace with hyperextension.  I will also add that it is always performed with a weightlifting belt, the waist does not relax and does not bend when performing, the movement of the bar from the lowest point begins on the lower leg (it is important - do not do cravings in shorts, this is fraught with undesirable and painful "epilation" on the legs).  There is a diverse number of programs for traction, as a complicated option - it is done with direct grip with a stop for 1-2 seconds after each repetition.  Beginners can start by performing ‚Äúmulti-grabbing‚Äù, without stopping between repetitions.  Magnesia or talc are <i>desirable</i> . <br>  <b>Progress</b> : mandatory warm-up exercise "hyperextension", at least 2 approaches, then warm-up with the way and as weights increase.  4-5 sets of 6-8 times, each week you can add 2.5-5 kg. <br><br>  19 - A couple of weeks or even a month this exercise should not be carried out with the burdening, achieve at least 10-15 repetitions without unnecessary load.  Regarding the implementation - there is a lot of controversy about how to do push-ups on the bars.  I will advise you only two things - not to ‚Äúleave‚Äù your hands strongly behind the whole body and not to fall too low (a real opportunity to get a shoulder injury and drop out of training for six months) is enough and parallels with sex.Manual <a href="http://www.real-man.ru/a229.html">www.real-man.ru /a229.html</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : 3-4 approaches for 8-10-12-15 times (depending on your weight and arm strength) <br><br>  20 - You will use this simulator for the first three months, then forget about its existence.  It is intended only to develop lagging triceps or ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù hands, but does not contribute to the rest of the progress.  The technique is simple, like two and two - the elbows are pressed to the body, only the forearm is in motion.  Manual here <a href="http://www.tvoe-telo.ru/books/SM_Exercise/sm_e37.php">www.tvoe-telo.ru/books/SM_Exercise/sm_e37.php</a> <br><br>  21 - They are ‚Äúgoodmoning‚Äù, according to rumors - the favorite exercise of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Exercise is not so finishing, how much - relieving the back after heavy deadlifts.  Manul here <a href="http://ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_spiny/naklony_so_shtangoy_na_plechah">ironmensport.com/uprazhn_dlya_spiny/naklony_so_shtangoy_na_plechah</a> <br>  <b>Progress</b> : 3-4 approaches on 8-10 times, with an empty neck. <br><br>  The program is quite heavy, I do not argue, but it covers everything.  Hardly any muscle groups without attention.  Guaranteed full and stable development (: <br><br>  PS Spell-cheering is welcome, after all, he wrote an article for 7 hours in a row. <br>  PS2 There is not enough karma to transfer to the appropriate topic. <br>  PS3 Food, rest, FAQ - this will be in the next post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67844/</a></p>
