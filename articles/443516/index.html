So much so that he was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18258030/george-hotz-ai-simulation-jailbreaking-reality-sxsw-2019">going to free</a> mankind from the slavery of the computer system. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that this is not the case,‚Äù says the entrepreneur.  "You can easily imagine an entity, much smarter than us, who can build a cell, the existence of which you do not even know." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In principle, the idea that reality is nothing but an illusion has existed for a long time.  This was thought by the ancient Greeks, including Pythagoras and Plato.  The latter pointed out that only ideas are material, and all other objects are only shadows.

      With the advent of the computer era, the theory of simulation has not disappeared anywhere, on the contrary, it has become very widespread.  The idea was reflected in a number of games, films and books.  Of course, the most famous for the majority is ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù, but it is far from the only work that demonstrates its own realization of the idea. <br><br>  One of the most famous proponents of the fact that our world is an illusion recreated by a computer program is the Swedish transhumanist philosopher and professor at Oxford University <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Nick Bostrom</a> .  He builds his proof on the basis of three theses, arguing that at least one of them is true. <br><br><ol><li>  Humanity will die out before it reaches the ‚Äúposthuman‚Äù phase with a high degree of probability; </li><li>  Each posthuman civilization with a very small probability will run a significant number of simulations of its history or its variants; </li><li>  Most likely, we live in a computer simulation. </li></ol><br>  Bostrom has several followers, including Ilona Mask and the same Hotz.  The latter began by creating a jailbreak for the first phone, then cracking in Sony game consoles, working on the autopilot and now engaged in simulations and the release of humanity from them. <br><br>  According to him, the most negative factor in the future will be that the person‚Äôs freedom of choice will gradually disappear.  It will happen with a very high degree of probability. <br><br>  Hotz spoke about his plans to establish a religion dedicated to an emulated universe.  ‚ÄúI began to think about giving rise to a new religion and church.  There are a lot of structural problems with companies - there is no opportunity to win. ‚Äù  Hotz probably had in mind his own problems with the autopilot he had developed, which he was forbidden to distribute in the US - the regulators were very convincing. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the case of working with companies, you only lose.  I believe that churches, religious directions can be more suitable for solving the tasks I have conceived, and also they are suitable for carrying out work on the preparation of the withdrawal of society from a simulation. ‚Äù  This idea is also not new.  Before Hotz, it was realized by Anthony Lewandowski, a former Google and Uber employee, who started the AI-deity cult (or something like that). <br><br>  He opened the church, preaching faith, which is called Way of the Future.  The main <a href="https://rb.ru/story/ai-church/">goal of the movement</a> is ‚Äúthe creation of a divine essence on the basis of artificial intelligence, so that its understanding and praise can benefit society‚Äù.  Lewandowski said that he and his colleagues are planning to begin work on the creation of a ‚Äúgod‚Äù, an entity that is many times smarter than the most intelligent person. <br><br>  Lewandowski claims that supramental artificial intelligence can take care of the Earth better than humans.  However, he fears that the latter may become something of a domestic animal for AI.  As for the church itself (as well as religion), it was officially founded in 2015.  Apparently, the budget of the organization is small and amounts to several tens of thousands of US dollars. <br><br>  Geohot probably plans to go about the same way, because he believes in singularity and artificial intelligence.  During his speech, Hotz also stated that he believes that the singularity is very close.  According to him, if we enter the era of singularity with the aspirations and desires of modern people, the future will be just awful.  However, the tasks of Hotz and Lewandowski differ from each other.  If the first one is sure that we live in a simulation and plans to leave it anyway, then the second one is going to become the ‚Äúdeveloper of god‚Äù - the AI, who will rule the world. <br><br>  So far it is unclear how seriously Hotz talks about all this.  But if at least half as serious as Lewandowski, then he can really do what he thinks about. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443516/</a></p>
