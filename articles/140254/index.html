Issue Experts: Roman Tyshkovsky, Eugene Kurt</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the studio <a href="http://www.finam.fm/">“Finam FM”</a> - Roman Tyshkovsky partner and head of the media practice of Odgers Berndtson;  Yevgeny Kurt, managing partner of uCoz service.  Together with the presenter, Maxim Spiridonov, they talk about the resignation of the Mail.Ru Group corporation, the launch of the Yandex navigation service, the reaction of the network public to the ambiguous NTV film, the results of a study of the Russian coupon services market, and a web mapping service provided by Google. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Yuri Milner, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Mail.Ru Group, resigned from office.</b>  This is stated in a press release published on the website of the corporation.  As follows from the text of the message, Dmitry Grishin, CEO of Mail.Ru Group, took his place. <br><br>  <i>- What does the care of Yuri Milner for Mail.Ru Group mean?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Where will Yuri Milner invest?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Roman Tyshkovsky: “Yuri has long said that he wants to finish his projects in Russia and focus on his activities abroad.</i>  <i>Therefore, there is nothing unexpected.</i>  <i>It was obvious that at some point he would cease to be, even formally, the chairman of the board of directors, which is what happened. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yevgeny Kurt: “Perhaps, perhaps, Mail.Ru Group will start investing at some stage.</i>  <i>Yandex started investing in startups. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Comment by PR director of Mail.Ru Group Ksenia Chabanenko: “The company's business strategy is being developed and proposed by a team of top managers of Mail.ru Group headed by CEO Dmitry Grishin, so no changes will happen here.”</i>

      <b>2. The company “Yandex” introduced the service “Yandex.</b>  <b>Navigator".</b>  The application can plot routes, taking into account the traffic situation, warn about the situation on the roads, calculate the distance and travel time.  At the moment, the service works only on mobile devices based on iOS and Android operating systems. <br><br>  <i>- First impressions of the product.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Roman Tyshkovsky: “From the point of view of the application, this is quite a handy thing, although, of course, with a huge number of flaws.</i>  <i>But it normal.</i>  <i>This is the first version.</i>  <i>I treat this service as a product that is free, so it’s strange to demand from it some kind of higher quality from the very beginning. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yevgeny Kurt: “I think this is an expanded version of Yandex.Maps.”</i>  <i>She is a little better plots &lt;something&gt;, says something.</i>  <i>He does not speak very much, does not know the roads everywhere, but at the same time, Yandex has all the resources to develop this “application”.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Comment by the manager of the Yandex.Navigator service, Sergey Maksimov: “This is not exactly an altruistic project, there &lt;in Yandex.Navigator&gt; it’s quite realistic to advertise and make this service profitable.”</i> <br><br>  <b>3. A screening of the film “Anatomy of Protest” on the NTV channel turned into a loud scandal.</b>  The film claimed that the opposition forces paid their rallies to the participants and deliberately provoked the police into violent actions against ordinary protesters.  Viewers who disagree with the channel’s viewpoint left dozens of angry and obscene comments in NTV groups on Vkontakte and Facebook social networks.  Twitter microblogging service users on the night of March 16-16 wrote several hundred messages with the hashtag “NTVlzhet”, which made the word “NTV” among the ten most mentioned service tags.  In the following days, several DDoS attacks were carried out on the television company's website, which made the resource inaccessible for some time. <br><br>  <i>- How to evaluate the reaction of the network public to this film?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What forms can indignation against an odious telecontent take?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Will there be a boycott of NTV or major advertisers of this channel?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yevgeny Kurt: “I don’t like TV content &lt;...&gt; for a long time.</i>  <i>I made my choice, but most of it is making it in favor of television. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Roman Tyshkovsky: “In the general format, advertisers are guided by what TNS gives, &lt;...&gt; and the boycott of goods will not affect, even in the medium term, an understanding of the effectiveness of &lt;advertising on this channel&gt;.”</i> <br><br>  <b>4. J'son &amp; Partners Consulting presented the results of a study of the Russian coupon services market.</b>  Evaluation of sites of mass discounts was carried out in terms of marketing effectiveness and geographical coverage.  The leader in both indicators was the Biglion service, which outpaced such major players in the coupon market as Kupikupon and Groupon Russia. <br><br>  <i>- Why are clones of Western projects in RuNet often stronger than the originals?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What is the scale to evaluate coupon services?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The future of the coupon market.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Roman Tyshkovsky: “Just the Biglion team turned out to be stronger and more professional than the Groupon team, it responded faster to incoming requests.”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yevgeny Kurt: “I don’t see strong research in our market, unfortunately.</i>  <i>I didn’t see any methodology there. ”</i> <br><br>  <b>5. Google Inc., in conjunction with the portal Auto.ru, launched the “Roads of Russia” web mapping service.</b>  The project collects information about the quality of the country's roads based on data obtained from users' mobile devices.  To participate in the project, you need to install on your smartphone an application that analyzes the degree of vibration of the vehicle's suspension on a particular section of the path and transmits this information to the website rusdorogi.ru, where it is processed.  The application is available only for devices based on the Android operating system. <br><br>  <i>- Why are Yandex and Google engaged in navigation applications?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Prospects for the web service "Roads of Russia".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yevgeny Kurt: “The main problem is connected with power.</i>  <i>Ok, well, we know that the road is bad there.</i>  <i>What are we not going there?</i>  <i>Do we have a paid bypass?</i>  <i>They do not have.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Roman Tyshkovsky: “I do not understand when this service can be useful to me.</i>  <i>It’s pointless to build a route around the pit, no one will ever do it. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Comment of the project manager of “Roads of Russia” Arkady Khachkovanian: “First of all, our site is of an informational nature, and we would like users to find something useful on this site.</i>  <i>If the structures responsible for the quality of the pavement also find something useful, we will be very pleased and for this, in principle, we work. ”</i> <br><br>  <a href="">Download file (36.6 MB / 53: 20 MP3, 96 kbps)</a> <br><br>  <b><i>Release on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id421415648">iTunes</a></i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140254/</a></p>
