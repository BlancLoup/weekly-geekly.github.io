  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT inside HP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, <b>given</b> : HP CIS - offices in 11 cities of Russia, in Minsk, Kiev, Baku, Almaty and Astana;  about 1,500 employees who are always in a hurry.  Local subnets connected via VPN and connected to global services (mail, Sharepoint, IP telephony, hundreds of business applications). <br><br>  <b>The question is</b> : how many IT people need to keep it all right? <br><br>  Of course, to save the intrigue, the answer will be at the end of the post.  In the meantime, let's see how the IT infrastructure in our large-big company works in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Big numbers </h4><br>  Today, HP employs 304,000 people in 170 countries.  Geographically, they are divided into 3 roughly equal regions of the region: Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), the Americas (North and South) and Asia-Pacific.  The needs of each region are served by its gigantic data center, which employs the main enterprise applications: Exchange, Sharepoint, SAP ERP, Siebel CRM, and several hundred others.  The internal document management in the company is almost completely electronic.

          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      IP Telephony Service for HP in Europe is supplied by British Telecom.  In Russia, their contractor is the French Orange Telecom, registered under the name "Equant".  They are in charge of the entire infrastructure: from a telephone on each desk and PBX in offices to a large hub in the vicinity of London, through which all calls go.  Any of the 75,000 employees at EMEA can call the 11-digit internal number. <br><br>  But despite the fact that most of the time it all works like a clock, sometimes something goes wrong.  What, then, should the user do to solve the problem? <br><br><h4>  Knowledge is power </h4><br>  More than 20 years ago, Hewlett-Packard began to actively participate in the development of the ITIL / <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITSM">ITSM</a> methodology.  During this time we have eaten an uncountable set of dogs in the automation of IT management and today we are selling our experience to customers in the form of <a href="https://h10078.www1.hp.com/cda/hpms/display/main/hpms_content.jsp%3Fzn%3Dbto%26cp%3D1-10_4000_100__">dozens of software products</a> .  And it is logical that within the company everything is built on them. <br><br>  The solution of a typical problem (a letter is not sent, it is impossible to enter the service of a virtual conference, etc.) can and should fall on the shoulders of the user himself.  For this, the Get IT utility is installed and enabled on every work computer by default.  And any solution starts with clicking on its tray icon (corporate OS - Windows). <br><br><img src="http://www.communities.hp.com/online/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/hport/get-it.gif" alt="Get IT application screen"><br><br>  The Get IT application is a local copy of the knowledge base available on the HP internal portal.  It is constantly updated, and the utility is automatically updated from time to time.  The information in the database is divided into 10 main topics (mail, software, printing, telephones, etc.) and is available in 6 languages.  You can search for a solution to your problem either by going down into the rubricator or by trying to formulate the problem in the search bar. <br><br>  Not only IT gurus work in IT companies, but 70% of problems are solved here at this stage - after finding the most detailed guidance on how to eliminate them.  A major role in the success of this approach is played by the continuous unification of the park of computers and applications that are used in the company. <br><br><h4>  Live chat </h4><br><img src="http://www.communities.hp.com/online/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/hport/it-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" alt="First line support - Costa Rica">  If a solution could not be found (the problem goes beyond the standard ones, or simply did not have enough patience), the user can contact a living specialist of the first line of technical support around the clock and year-round.  That is - in Bangalore or Costa Rica (depending on the time of day).  Well, or sometimes - to Poland.  Even Homer Simpson was for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãoutsourcing! <br><br>  As soon as communication begins (by phone or web chat), the IT professional can already see the current configuration of the user's computer.  And he often finds and solves a problem before the user has time to describe it.  In most other cases, the solution takes no more than a few minutes. <br><br>  If (sometimes it happens!), Even in India, they don‚Äôt know how to help you, the application of the problem is escalated to the local support service.  Only, again the paradox, the local support service can also be located thousands of kilometers away from you! <br><br><h4>  last hope </h4><br>  And here we smoothly approach the answer to the question at the beginning of the post.  Throughout the CIS, the ‚Äúlast line‚Äù of support is managed by ... drum roll ... 2 people.  Meet: Denis Bogachev ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/irreplaceable/" class="user_link">irreplaceable</a> ) and Georgy Parygin ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/georgy_it/" class="user_link">Georgy_IT</a> ).  By the way, they, too, are not employees of HP, and work in the company under the contract.  HP's full-time IT staff in the EMEA region are actually only 2 top managers.  Tell me honestly, did you think so? <br><br>  And now another question: what do you think, how many appeals from colleagues have to personally handle Denis and George during the month? <br><br>  Well, now you ask us questions :) <br><br><h4>  To be continued ... </h4><br>  <i>In the next series of our exciting series: how to print a document, if you work in the largest manufacturer of printers?</i>  <i>And the cycle of computers in nature - who said that the horse does not change at the crossing?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82863/</a></p>
