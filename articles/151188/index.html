      Offline maps are traditionally supported in WP8 along with other Nokia smartphones on other platforms such as Symbian and MeeGo.  Those who prefer offline cards, note that they work faster and are cheaper because they do not need to spend money on an Internet connection.  In addition to these benefits, in WP8, offline and online maps can also be used by other, third-party applications through the corresponding API engine called Nokia Location Platform.  This engine, which until recently existed as an API for JS (Web), JME (S40), Qt (Symbian &amp; MeeGo), as well as REST services, is now available on Windows Phone 8 as a feature of the platform and in hybrid form - online and offline. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of the Nokia Lumia <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/lumia920">920</a> and <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/lumia820">820</a> is that they have <b>autonomous</b> A-GPS and A-GLONASS receivers installed.  Existing Nokia phones with GPS suffer from the fact that in offline mode, Nokia Maps turns off A-GPS and as a result, you have to wait for a long time until the device finds your current location.  Now Lumia 920 and 820 promise the normal operation of A-GPS and offline, including, that is, the location will be in a few seconds. <br><br>  It should be added, for those who do not know that if the cards switch between offline and online modes, then all changes to offline maps obtained online will remain in the cache after turning off this mode. <br><br><h4>  Pedestrian navigation with voice prompts </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/d06/8a7/73dd068a7484ee8696724c1ce278dba8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is something that is in Symbian and MeeGo, but what was not done immediately for the Windows Phone platform.  Yes, there are three types of navigation in Nokia Maps - road, public transport and pedestrian.  Traditionally, autonavigation is placed in a separate application called Nokia Drive.  Navigation using public transport - in a separate application Nokia Transport.  So, now in Nokia Maps for Windows Phone 8 there was also a navigation for pedestrians, which voiced key points, turns and street names with a voice, while following the route. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that pedestrian navigation is made in such a way as to lay hiking routes, including through areas that are accessible only to pedestrians, such as parks, footpaths, footpaths, stairs, etc. <br><br><h4>  Augmented Reality </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bd/67d/05f/6bd67d05f9b81710bbd4b3beb5fc16d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Augmented reality, or augmented reality, is what Nokia planned for quite some time as an additional feature for Nokia Maps.  As seen in the picture, the engine of augmented reality, imposes marks from the map on the image of the camera.  In what you see on the screen which side is this or that purpose or point of interest that interests you.  Coupled with pedestrian navigation, it looks like a very useful piece, especially for wandering around an unfamiliar city.  It is worth saying that in this case, the compass is also included in the case, so it is not necessary to run around, you can just spin on the spot and look at the screen. <br><br>  For owners of Windows Phone 7, augmented reality is available as a separate Nokia City Lens application, which can be <a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/trials/nokia-city-lens-for-windows-phone">downloaded here.</a> <br><br><h4>  Indoor Navigation </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50b/275/691/50b2756918b90a740828c32619eabce0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Another feature that has long been waiting in the wings in Nokia labs.  The world was known as indoor positioning, indoor navigation, and ultimately called venue maps.  It is very useful in large indoor areas where GPS reception is difficult or impossible, for example, airports, shopping and business centers, stadiums, subways.  This feature requires radio infrastructure inside the desired building.  At a minimum, the infrastructure can be created based on existing WiFi networks.  As a maximum, you will need to install special WiFi and / or Bluetooth beacons. <br><br>  At the moment, Nokia Maps supports navigation inside more than 4,600 locations in 38 countries of the world, and new ones are added every month.  Again, indoor navigation will be available to external applications as part of the Nokia Location Platform. <br><br><h4>  My commute </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa0/3e8/4ca/aa03e84cab03baf497aec5811e9cd220.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is to remind that the new Nokia Lumia inherited this relatively new feature.  It consists in the fact that your constantly used routes are recorded automatically if you have passed them more than two times, for example, from home to work.  You can also set the route manually, as in the picture.  For such routes, the My Commute technology, an hour before the required time, calculates the travel time, taking into account traffic jams and other road conditions, and tries to find an optimal alternative in time, taking into account current circumstances. <br><br>  With the release of Windows Phone 8 officially announced that this chip for several months will be available in Germany, Russia, UK and Brazil.  As for Russia, I have a hunch that not all of Russia will fall under this case, but what will happen - we will see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151188/</a></p>
