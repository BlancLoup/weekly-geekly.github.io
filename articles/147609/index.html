No, I'm not going to argue with that. <br><br>  I just want to give an example of the fact that the imperfection of our laws is compensated by the non-binding nature of their laws.  And even if this law is adopted, we most likely will not wait for loud Wikipedia closures.  There will be just another tool that SORM is now, just in case.  This, in my opinion, is an exclusively political tool.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After all, think about it, browse and thoughtfully delete a page on the application from Roskomnadzor during the day, not one large social network can.  If it even works, it will be the opposite: they will close it first and then they will consider it, because the risk of getting an IP address blocked is equivalent to losing a business.  Another question is whether the really controversial applications will come from Roskomnadzor?  We don't know that. <br><br>  But there is a good example from the existing practice.  Look, on the website of the Ministry of Justice there is a <a href="http://www.minjust.ru/nko/fedspisok">Federal list of extremist materials</a> updated by court decisions. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>619.
