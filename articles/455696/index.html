      Public authorities have access to FGCS through IPGO (Information Portal of the State Authority). <br><br><h4>  The goals and objectives of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Centralized production management of all enterprises and organizations of the country as a single economic entity. </li><li>  Automatic production planning based on analysis of demand for the company's products. </li><li>  Receives from other subsystems, processes and provides management of the enterprise with all the necessary management information for managing the enterprise. </li><li>  Receives from the enterprise, processes and distributes data on the work of the enterprise to other subsystems. </li><li>  Carries out software pricing for products and services of the enterprise. </li><li>  Manages the opening, expansion and closure of enterprises. </li><li>  Manages product quality. </li><li>  Manages payroll for company employees. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  System structure </h4><br><ul><li>  Production Management </li><li>  Product and service nomenclature management </li><li>  Financial management </li><li>  Sales management </li><li>  HR management </li><li>  Business Process Management </li><li>  Payroll management </li><li>  Equipment and materials management </li><li>  Document flow </li><li>  Quality control </li><li>  Delivery and Storage Management </li><li>  Recommendations for company management </li><li>  Statistics and reporting </li></ul><br>  and other sections. <br><br><h4>  Description of the functional </h4><br><ul><li>  The system on the basis of orders, pre-orders and previous sales made by citizens and organizations through subsystems OGSUP, OGSTUZTU prepares for the management of the enterprise plans for the production of goods and services and monitors the implementation of these plans. </li><li>  It allows you to purchase products, materials, equipment and services from any enterprises and organizations in the country to carry out business activities of the enterprise in electronic form. </li><li>  Allows you to make early pre-orders for products of other enterprises without prepayment, which allows to increase the accuracy of production plans. </li><li>  All document management with customers and suppliers is performed within the system in electronic form. </li><li>  All operations for the sale and purchase of products and services of an enterprise are carried out through the OGSUP system and the OGSZTU system connected with it (the nationwide system of orders for goods and services). </li><li>  Based on information about trade operations and product orders, continuous mathematical modeling of the country's economy and the adjustment of production plans for all enterprises and organizations of the country are carried out. </li><li>  Retail outlets connect to the system via online cash registers and send information about each retail trade to the system. </li><li>  Based on a multidimensional analysis of the financial and business activities of the enterprise, artificial intelligence algorithms on a daily basis assess economic activity and prepare recommendations for the company's management to improve work efficiency and optimize financial and economic activity, expand production, and change the personnel structure of the enterprise. </li><li>  Taking into account the need for qualified personnel of a certain specialty, the system prepares plans for the preparation, training and retraining of specialists of the required specialty for the relevant educational institutions of the country. </li><li>  Finished products produced by a manufacturing enterprise are shipped to consumers under the control of the OGTS system (national transport system). </li><li>  Production is centrally taken by state transport services from the company's warehouses, delivered to large sorting centers, from where it is distributed by means of various types of transport to local warehouses throughout the country. </li><li>  From local warehouses, products are transported to the warehouses of purchasing organizations and to large centralized IDPs (points of issue of orders) for issuing orders to citizens. </li><li>  Large, centralized PVZ should gradually replace the existing stores, markets, shopping centers. </li><li>  PVZ should be located in all settlements of the country at the rate of 1 PVZ per ~ 10,000 population. </li></ul><br><h4>  Satisfaction of citizens </h4><br>  Meeting the needs of citizens is the most important task of the production management subsystem and one of the most important tasks of the entire OGAS 2.0 system. <br><br>  Since it is hardly possible to satisfy all the needs of all people (the cumulative needs so far seriously exceed the cumulative capabilities of meeting them), the task of meeting the needs is set in the task of multi-criteria optimization of the needs matrix, taking into account: <br><br>  1) Amounts of money from every citizen <br>  2) Cost of satisfying each need <br>  3) The importance of need (for example, the level in the Maslow pyramid) <br>  4) Limited industry capacity to meet needs <br>  5) Other criteria. <br><br>  In order to create such a matrix, it will be necessary to define, digitize needs and create a mathematical model that can be constantly updated and optimized. <br><br>  As a result of optimization, we will receive an optimal matrix, which will determine the list of those needs of people who should be satisfied in the near future, taking into account the specified optimization criteria.  Based on this optimized matrix, production plans will be drawn up for the country's enterprises. <br><br>  How to determine the needs of citizens? <br><br>  To do this, all the enterprises and organizations of the country add all the goods and services that they produce into a single national Internet catalog or online store (subsystem OGSSZTU). <br><br>  Every citizen from this catalog can order and pre-order goods and services.  The ordering process is the process of digitizing needs. <br><br>  Orders can be paid or unpaid.  Ordered and paid goods - delivered to the EOF or to the house to the consumer.  Paid services can be obtained at the place of their provision. <br><br>  If the ordered goods are not paid for (not enough money, not in stock), but added to the Wishlist - such an order is considered an unmet need.  These needs will also be taken into account by the system.  The system will strive to meet such needs in the future.  Sooner or later, it will be possible to expand production at a particular enterprise, lower prices, raise wages and meet these unmet needs of citizens. <br><br>  All purchases, all orders must be made out either directly online, or if the purchase and sale operation occurred offline, the purchase information must be digitized and sent to the system. <br><br><h4>  Production planning </h4><br>  A key function of the production management system will be the planning of production of tangible and intangible benefits for all enterprises and organizations in the country. <br><br>  All enterprises must strictly comply with the production plans established for them by the system. <br><br>  The system should continuously collect information about the demand for each individual product or service of the country's enterprises and, based on an analysis of the demand curve for each specific product, draw up a current production plan, predict future production plans and, if necessary, prepare an expansion plan for the enterprise that produces this product. <br><br>  The system should also examine the unmet demand for products.  Products and services that are not paid for by consumers, but added to the wishlist should also be taken into account when calculating future production plans. <br><br>  If demand is stable, the system should only monitor the implementation of the company's current plans and, if necessary, reward or punish the company's management for compliance / non-compliance with the plans. <br><br>  If demand began to change dramatically - grow or fall, the system should analyze the change in demand for goods, extrapolate this demand to the future and predict a new level of demand after a certain period.  Based on this extrapolation, the system must predict the future required volume of production for this product and plan the expansion of production to meet growing demand. <br><br><h4>  Production expansion </h4><br>  The system must know exactly the limits of the production capacity of the enterprise and if the projected demand for the products begins to exceed the marginal production capacity, the system should begin preparing the expansion of production. <br><br>  Expansion of production must be undertaken in advance, even before the current production capacity of the enterprise has been exhausted, so that by the time this expansion is completed, the old production capacity has not yet been completely exhausted, and the enterprise can continue to meet the current demand for products. <br><br>  Production capacity should always be expanded with a margin to cover possible future growth in demand for products.  This will allow to have reserves of production capacity of the enterprise even with a sharp jump in demand. <br><br>  At the same time, the expansion of production capacity should not be excessive, so that the excessive expenditure of resources on such unjustified expansion would not be to the detriment of other industries.  Saving labor, equipment and materials should be an important priority throughout the economy. <br><br>  The artificial intelligence of the system will prepare recommendations for expansion of production for the company's management, perhaps even step-by-step instructions for such expansion. <br><br>  Will provide the company with the necessary resources, equipment, personnel for such expansion.  The management of the enterprise will only need to strictly follow the prepared instructions and physically implement such an expansion of production capacity. <br><br><h4>  Construction of new enterprises </h4><br>  If the reserves for expanding production at the enterprise are exhausted, there are no more areas for building new workshops, there is no possibility to supply new production lines, there are not enough qualified personnel to work at this enterprise, or production of completely new products is required, then it may be necessary to create new enterprises. <br><br>  The creation of new enterprises is centralized, under the leadership of state bodies. <br><br>  To create a new enterprise, the relevant state bodies should conduct a comprehensive analysis of the situation using the specialized system functionality, which, based on summary data on orders for products of the newly created enterprise, will be able to determine the optimal location of this enterprise. <br><br>  The new enterprise should be located as close as possible to most consumers (to reduce the time of product delivery), should be located near major sources of electricity, close to suppliers of materials and equipment, as well as close to the labor concentration centers of proper qualification and specialization. <br><br>  The algorithms of the system should carry out a comprehensive analysis of all these factors and offer the competent government authorities several optimal places to locate a new company to choose from.  The final decision rests with the officials of this state body. <br><br>  When creating a new enterprise, the current and future demand for the products or services of the given enterprise and potential opportunities for expanding the production volume should be taken into account.  The size of the enterprise under construction should be comparable to the volume of unmet demand, with a margin for the future. <br><br><h4>  Closure of an enterprise </h4><br>  If an enterprise‚Äôs products are in extremely weak demand and / or the quality of an enterprise‚Äôs work is very low, and the enterprise has no social significance, then the system may decide to liquidate the enterprise. <br><br>  In this case, all employees of the enterprise will be employed at other enterprises, if necessary they will be retrained, retrained.  If the dismissed employees are not found a suitable workplace immediately, they will receive a guaranteed minimum benefit for as long as necessary for their employment. <br><br>  The premises and equipment will be transferred in favor of other enterprises or transferred to warehouses. <br><br><h4>  Product quality </h4><br>  Quality products are any products that strictly comply with state standards for which they are manufactured.  The output of products that do not correspond to any GOST standards should be limited. <br><br>  To ensure high quality products, a mechanism for rating goods, services and enterprises is provided.  The system OGSUP and OGSZTU (national system for ordering goods and services) will be implemented under each product in each order to leave the pros and cons, based on which the product rating and enterprise rating is calculated.  Every minus must be accompanied by a recall.  It must be indicated which GOST is broken by the enterprise and what is the violation.  The review must be confirmed by a photo, expert opinion and other factual data. <br><br>  If the violation is confirmed, the product rating and the rating of the entire company are reduced, which affects the salary of all employees of the company in the direction of reduction.  The management of the enterprise itself should take measures to improve the quality of work and find out who exactly made the departure from the GOST. <br><br>  After the elimination of deficiencies, the management can send the consumer quality products with a request to cancel their negative feedback. <br><br>  The absence of negative reviews about the quality of the enterprise gives the company a maximum rating, which increases the level of wages of all employees of the company to the maximum possible. <br><br><h4>  Wage </h4><br>  The salary of each person working in the country should be calculated by the national electronic system fully automatically.  Algorithms for calculating wages are approved by nationwide electronic referendums. <br><br>  Factors that should affect the size of each employee‚Äôs salary: <br><br><ul><li>  Minimum hourly rate </li><li>  Working hours </li><li>  Position </li><li>  Education </li><li>  Experience </li><li>  Quality of the entire enterprise </li></ul><br>  other. <br><br>  How to determine the quality of the entire enterprise? <br><br>  The quality of work by the company is determined by: <br><br><ol><li>  Compliance with the products of the company approved GOST </li><li>  The enterprise carries out a plan generated for the enterprise by a national electronic system. </li></ol><br>  If an enterprise produces everything strictly according to state standards and fully complies with all the plans set for the enterprise, then we consider that the enterprise is exemplary, the quality of the enterprise‚Äôs work is up to par and all its employees receive the highest possible salary level in the country. <br><br>  If the company works poorly, violates the approved GOSTs or does not fulfill the plans, then all employees of such an enterprise will be reduced in proportion to the poor quality of their work.  Those.  the worse it works, the less workers receive (and the salary of the most unskilled worker cannot be less than the minimum). <br>  If the company has corrected the shortcomings and the quality of its work has increased, then the salaries of all employees will increase. <br><br>  The maximum salary of the most highly qualified and highly paid specialist should not exceed the salary of the lowest paid employee in the country more than 10‚Äì20 times.  This is necessary to ensure an acceptable level of social justice and reduce social tensions in the country. <br><br>  If the GDP of the whole country grows, then the minimum wage throughout the country is indexed, and the wages of all the working people of the country increase proportionally. <br><br>  The system will pay wages to the personal accounts of employees in the UGFS (national financial system). <br><br><h4>  Pricing </h4><br>  Pricing for all products and services for all enterprises of the country is carried out automatically by the system, based on a summary of the costs of production per unit of production and other factors.  The company's management can not directly charge prices for products. <br><br>  The system will try to keep prices for products constant at any level of demand for these products.  If necessary, the system will change prices automatically, for example, if the enterprise does not fulfill production plans. <br><br>  With an increase in labor productivity at this enterprise, product prices may decline. <br><br><h4>  Storage and Delivery </h4><br>  Delivery of products to consumers is carried out with the help of OGTS (unified national transport system).  The system manages all modes of transport in the country.  The functionality of the system allows you to plan and optimize the delivery of any goods. <br><br>  Products ordered by consumers from the warehouses of enterprises by various types of transport are delivered first to large sorting centers, then to regional warehouses, from where they are transported to the VAD within walking distance or to the consumer‚Äôs home by courier delivery.  This provides the fastest, shortest and cheapest way to deliver products from producer to consumer, without intermediaries.  It should also reduce the final cost of goods for the consumer. <br><br><h4>  Innovation </h4><br>  Innovations, inventions, innovations will be created in a separate subsystem of OGAS 2.0, which is called OGII (the national system of inventions and innovations). <br><br>  The subsystem works according to a scheme similar to an angel investment or crowdfunding system, only all investments in new projects are made by the state. <br><br>  In the OGII subsystem, any citizen will be able to offer his idea, concept, project of a new invention, news.  Anyone can discuss the idea.  If an idea gains the minimum required number of support votes, then a small amount is allocated by the state to create a working prototype of this invention.  If the prototype turned out to be successful and the introduction of this invention into mass production will also support a significant number of citizens, the inventor is rewarded for the invention, and the prototype goes to the standardization committee. <br><br>  On the basis of this prototype, the Standardization Committee is preparing a new GOST, after which the GOST is sent to a suitable enterprise, where a new production line is created for production in accordance with this GOST.  After that, the mass production of this product begins, the product is added to the national catalog of goods and services and any citizen of the country can order it. <br><br>  All risks of financing this invention and its serial production are assumed by the state.  The inventor himself does not risk anything, but he also cannot claim any future income from the production of this product.  His reward for this invention is the large one-time award for the invention, as well as its mention as the author of this invention. <br><br><h4>  The advantages of the system </h4><br><ul><li>  Accurate and complete satisfaction of the needs of citizens of the country. </li><li>  A significant increase in the efficiency of the entire economy of the country. </li><li>  Saving materials and labor. </li><li>  Releasing a large number of well-paid managerial and support staff of enterprises in the country due to the fact that a significant part of management decisions and auxiliary operations will take over the artificial intelligence of the system. </li><li>  The management of the company does not bear the financial and sales risks. </li><li>  There are exactly as many products as consumers need. </li><li>  No overproduction crises. </li><li>  The company receives accurate production plans. </li><li>  The company receives precise instructions for the expansion of production. </li><li>  The company's management does not need to make complex management decisions in the face of market uncertainty. </li><li>  Standardization and interchangeability of products manufactured by different enterprises due to the observance of unified state standards. </li><li>  Stable prices for any products and services. </li><li>  Lack of inflation. </li><li>  Products are delivered directly from the manufacturer to the consumer without intermediaries. </li><li>  No cheating prices by intermediaries. </li><li>  The risks of bringing a new product into production are borne by the state, and not by an individual businessman. </li><li>  Allows you to translate all trade and financial transactions and all document management in electronic form. </li><li>  Reduced bureaucracy. </li><li>  Reducing corruption and stealing money at all levels. </li><li>  The growth of workers' wages with the growth of the country's GDP. </li><li>  Continuous increase in the welfare of citizens. </li></ul><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  A nationwide production management system will make it possible to significantly improve the quality of economic management in the country, create an effective mechanism for centralized production planning in all enterprises, help reduce bureaucracy, and reduce unproductive labor costs. <br><br>  The integration of the state-wide production management system into a single management system will make it possible to achieve a powerful synergistic effect from combining the capabilities of different subsystems. <br><br>  <i>Links to other parts:</i> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454488/">Part 1</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455696/</a></p>
