This effective and efficient tool is not always used correctly, which results in the impression that SMS distribution does not work.  Let's try to dispel several entrenched myths. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Myth 1. SMS marketing is always spam. </h3><br>  This is the most common and enduring myth, which, unfortunately, has grounds.  Spammers do often use the short message service.  However, this does not mean that sending an SMS will automatically turn you into a spammer. 
      <br>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      If you receive permission from the user to send messages, if messages are relevant and interesting for him, if they come at a convenient time for him, and on the first request you will exclude him from the mailing list, be sure that you will receive a loyal client. <br><br>  Before starting an SMS campaign, be sure to review the legislation of the countries in which you plan to launch it.  In many states, sending messages is strictly regulated, but you should not be frightened.  On the contrary, the less unscrupulous "colleagues", the more attention will be paid to you. <br><br><h3>  Myth 2. SMS marketing is less convenient than other channels. </h3><br>  A short text message does not really look as bright and colorful as an email or video in a social network feed.  But SMS has many other advantages.  This personalization, and the opportunity to receive immediate feedback, and confidence that the message will be read.  No other channel can guarantee it all at once. <br><br>  In a world where most people (91% according <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/">to</a> Morgan Stanley) do not represent their life without a mobile phone, and the total number of active SIM-cards in the world equaled the number of inhabitants of the planet in 2015, it is difficult to imagine a more efficient communication channel.  Moreover, according <a href="http://www.textanywhere.net/faq/what-is-the-average-sms-marketing-open-rate">to</a> Frost &amp; Sullivan, only 2% of messages remain unread. <br><br>  The 160 character limit also plays into your hands.  In today's world, everything is accelerating, and the subscriber will rather read a short and succinct message than a long letter with superfluous details. <br><br><h3>  Myth 3. SMS marketing is only effective in a few industries. </h3><br>  It is considered that SMS-mailings work only in the retail and banking sector, and even then not in each case.  In fact, a variety of businesses can use short messages to inform customers, from cinemas and cafes to companies providing transportation services.  The secret here is in collecting the current database, reflecting the target audience. <br><br>  There are many examples in the world of how SMS uses the most unexpected organizations.  For example, regular mailings are done by <a href="http://www.textanywhere.net/faq/what-is-the-average-sms-marketing-open-rate">churches</a> , <a href="https://www.parentmail.co.uk/services/text-only">schools</a> , and any organizations that seek to optimize communication between members. <br><br><h3>  Myth 4. SMS is the past </h3><br>  The main communication between people now really takes place in numerous messengers, however SMS remains the universal channel of access to any mobile phone, even to a smartphone, at least to a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù, regardless of the availability of access to the network.  Analogues of this channel for business does not yet exist. <br><br>  Moreover, the Nielsen <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/09/20/jaw-dropper-18-to-24-year-olds-average-110-text-messages-per-day/">study found</a> that subscribers aged 18‚Äì24 send about 10 times more messages than subscribers aged 55‚Äì64.  Someone will see this as a lack of interest from a middle-aged audience, but it also says that new generations continue to actively use SMS. <br><br>  SMS is a convenient and effective marketing tool.  But, like any delicate instrument, it must be properly configured.  And then its capabilities will become your competitive advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338306/</a></p>
