  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tale about how the officials of the money for information consider</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, our high-ranking officials have been very actively talking about saving state funds for everything, including informatization, which, they say, Russia holds.  I once again turned the attention of the forum in Tver to this, which promises us a lot of things - online diaries in all schools, an electronic database of dissertations, an online appointment with a doctor by the middle of next year, and so on.  Personally, I always find it unpleasant, when taxes are spent is not clear on what, but, as it seemed, the economic delights of officials can also be confusing.  Judge for yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the pros.  Yesterday, at the Tver Forum, Ilya Massuh (Advisor to the Minister of Communications and Mass Media) talked about how duplication of some costs surfaced at some stages of informatization ‚Äî when we started to follow this ‚Äî we managed to save up to 5% of all costs per year.  And this is nothing less than 3 billion rubles.  Savings are obtained by removing duplicate portals, accounting systems and their maintenance, and so on.  Actually, the control of expenses on informatization allowed saving up to 10% - 6 billion, respectively.  Trifle, but nice. <br>  By the way, duplication in our country itself, apparently, feels very good.  I remember that at SPIEF Gref, talking about the introduction of a universal e-card, I noticed that to launch it I had to synchronize the databases of various departments and as a result, the duplicate lists of benefit recipients were deleted - the list was completely reduced "slightly" - three times. <br>  Probably, Kudrin‚Äôs statement that it is necessary to check what projects are being financed should be attributed to the pluses.  According to him, the cost of automating one pharmacy will be enough to automate an entire area in any region.  And the cost of the workplace for a disabled child is a little cheaper than the automated workplace of a bank employee. <br>  Now for the cons.  With them, the situation is somewhat more fun.  Yesterday, the Minister of Culture Avdeev (yes, actually I, too, to conceal) learned that organizing video broadcasting from a concert or performance is not at all expensive - all that is needed is a webcam and a microphone on a laptop.  About this yesterday Avdeev told our president. <br>  So now I think what threaten us with such video broadcasts from concerts and when laptops with a 3D camera are on sale - for shooting performances and football matches in 3D ... <br>  Another similar plus.  Tatyana Golikova said that it would be possible to introduce an electronic record to a doctor only by 2012 - and this is expensive and difficult.  Luzhkov also said that regions in which such projects have already been implemented in test mode can provide already proven software to the regions where the service needs to be launched.  Note - for free.  Also ready to teach for free to work with this software.  It is only necessary that there be an order to introduce this service ... <br>  I just have a question, how can there be free software if, as far as I know, clinics don't use open source software?  And how can there be free tuition if at least the teacher has to pay a salary? .. <br>  So while questions about the pros and cons of savings on information I have more than answers. </div>
