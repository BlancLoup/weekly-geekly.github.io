  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Centralization of online commerce</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Eldorado company on Thursday announced the launch of the Internet Pickup service, which is new for the domestic market.  Now every customer of her online store will be able to pick up the product he purchased at the nearest branch of the retail network.  This service, known in the West as ‚Äúpick up in store‚Äù, is widely used in the practice of the largest foreign retailers, such as American Best Buy and German Saturn and MediaMarkt, whose former key managers have been successfully working for a long time in the Eldorado management. <br><br>  Thus, the company abandoned plans to open one local Internet representation in approximately 10 major cities of the country.  Instead, the needs of the growing number of online customers at a terrible pace will be served by the only current site eldorado.ru.  Working, by the way, on a hardware base of 2 (two) servers.  On the "Bitrix".  With a peak load, the New Year was measured in tens of thousands of hosts per hour and promising to increase with time.  Have you lost your mind in Eldorado? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It seems not.  The matter is simple economic calculations, which promise the cost of maintaining regional online stores at $ 8-10 million per year, while their total turnover would not exceed $ 40 million. Amid $ 60 million turnover of the Moscow store in 2007 - the amount is not impressive. <br><br>  In the future, up to 800 trading platforms in Russia and Ukraine will be used as pickup points.  This channel of shipment of goods for eldorado.ru should become very important - by 2011 it will ‚Äúturn‚Äù through it up to $ 100 million.

      By the way, the financial performance of its network department "Eldorado" first opened on the same Thursday.  The truthfulness of this information was confirmed to us by unofficial sources, so that it may be possible to meet a new leader in the domestic e-commerce market soon if Ozon.ru with its comparable <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/eCommerce/39461.html">$ 66 million turnover last year</a> is pressed from the pedestal.  The growth of the latter, due to a small share of expensive electronics and home appliances in sales, was only 93% for the year.  It is impossible to estimate the growth of eldorado.ru according to open information, however, according to the company's own estimates, the entire market is growing by 150-300% per year (sales of electronics on the same Ozone tripled over the year), so the site most likely increases its turnovers at a pace. <br><br>  According to Bernard Lukey, general director of Ozon.ru, Bernard Lukey, today half of all customers of his store in capitals pick up goods at the points of issue, and in regions the share of "pick upers" reaches as much as 80%.  This is due to savings on fairly expensive delivery.  However, Eldorado, known for its aggressive pricing policy, is delivered free of charge from the retail network.  What is the point of buying via the Internet, if you still have to go by yourself for the purchase?  In saving a few percent due to lower prices in the online store and in reserving goods for you, which may not be in retail. <br><br>  Let's leave the not quite correct comparison with "Ozone" and look at the traditional competitors "Eldorado".  All large retail chains (M.Video, Tekhnosila, Mir and others) follow the path of crushing Internet representations in the regions, without expressing concern about low profitability.  In the <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2008/07/17/155271">comments</a> to Vedomosti, the representatives of the companies speak optimistically and even criticize the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmixing two independent sales channels: the Internet and supermarkets, because they have different customers‚Äù.  And their self-confidence has a basis: for example, the turnover of the Tekhnosila online store in 2007 amounted to almost $ 32 million, i.e.  2% of the total turnover against 1% of the World Wide Web at Eldorado.  And 2% the company soon promises to turn into 30%. <br><br>  Eldorado, nevertheless, remains a trump card - in less than two years since <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/eCommerce/1947.html">its opening</a> , its online store has already become a leader.  And this is despite the fact that regular IT companies of the company have not written a single line of code for it: all work has been outsourced to Qsoft from beginning to end, which its representatives do not tire of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/link/go/22473">mentioning</a> .  But this is only an external manifestation of the fact that the company is simply not afraid to take risky steps.  True, the role of a desperate fighter for saving on everything, including buyers, is sometimes reinforced by the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29319/</a></p>
