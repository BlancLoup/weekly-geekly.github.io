    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  <b>Instead of intro</b> </h6><br>  I started programming and entered the mathematical specialty, because I wanted to have a hand in creating new, fundamentally progressive technologies, projects, I wanted to bring the onset of the information age and a breakthrough in all spheres of our life. <br><br>  Recall what horizons and opportunities we have been prophesied by cinema and fantastic books.  Everywhere even exact dates were indicated, 2019, 2027, 2039. That, everything, in these years nobody will grow old, no one will die ahead of time, there will be no wars, there will be no epidemics, robots will work for us, and happy humanity will go to the stars, to explore new horizons. <br><br>  But ... it will be 2017 in the yard soon.  So, something I do not see a breakthrough, I do not see a stunning progress. <br><br>  Yes, we have cool cell phones, you can call, write messages, you can even play games.  We have super cool, powerful graphics cards, millions of dollars are spent by game makers to create their creations, graphics, sound, gameplay - everything is top notch, GTA 5 can be confused with the real world. <br><br>  Yes, that's just we live not in GTA 5, you can not survive, and if something is restored where they were before.  The world is not a game, everything is real here, everything is real, in which case there will be no restart. <br><br><h6>  <b>Current state of affairs</b> </h6><br>  For more than 100 years we have been driving these tin boxes, cars, for more than 100 years we have been using medieval engines.  Yes, companies spend billions to improve them, and what do they improve?  That's right, the injection system, increase the speed of rotation of the shafts, come up with a new lubricant.  And what ultimately?  It's still the same bucket that pollutes the atmosphere and takes millions of lives every year. <br><br>  Aircraft?  When will something safe to fly appear?  Why in the cabin of the aircraft with each landing is heard or crying or laughing or applause?  The Wright brothers would see our planes, would have been pleasantly surprised that the descendants were not far from the construction of 2 cross sticks and the engine on healthy kerosene. <br><br>  In general, everything that was higher is a prelude to the most important and most important thing that scares me, annoys me and does not allow me to calmly relate to this problem. <br><br>  Invite the surgeon from the 12th century to the surgical unit, I am sure he will not be surprised or discouraged, he will be all painfully familiar with all the tools.  Saws, axes, drills, vices, hammers - a standard set. <br><br>  Low bow to Fleming, Florey and Cheyne for penicillin, otherwise, we would have lived as much as in the 12th century.  Penicillin, anesthesia - without them what would have happened to us?  It is terrible to imagine. <br><br>  Well, in the 20th century, several great minds and truly great people made life easier for the sick.  But!  What has been done in 100 years? <br><br>  How many diseases in the world and how many of them can we treat?  Is there at least 1 disease that we can cure completely, without the hardest consequences and simply removing everything we can get to? <br><br>  Genetic diseases, at least one we can cure?  The genome is not solved how the brain works without a clue, vague pictures - that's all what people are capable of in 2016? <br><br>  Take, for example, such diagnostic tools, again from the last century, like an ECG, great, it shows there are problems, ok, thanks, come back in a year.  Sorry, but how to treat?  Pray, it can blow it, but if it doesn‚Äôt blow it, we‚Äôll give you a little back, cut off something, sew something, can stretch it for another couple of years. <br><br>  Well, let the brain work on the principles of quantum mechanics and our pioneering knowledge of the quantum world does not allow us to interfere with the work of the brain.  But damn, is it really impossible to create artificial kidneys, liver and other "simple" organs.  The issue of rejection had to be solved 50 years ago, but as usual, take a pack of medicines, they will kill your immunity, and then how lucky you will be.  Well, a 12th century surgeon would suggest the same plan. <br><br><h6>  <b>Unanswered Questions</b> </h6><br>  But what do we do to make this future come?  What did each of us, scientists, programmers, biologists, chemists do in order to change something?  Where is progress, where is breakthrough, where is the future? <br><br>  No, we are waging endless wars, creating nuclear weapons, hundreds of people are working on the creation of new missiles, new bombs.  This is more important, what are the sequences of the genome, there are more important things. <br><br>  What prevents us, where is the stumbling block? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302568/</a></p>
