The number of users is growing every day, and recently we asked the most active participant in our project to write a review about its history of creating its quest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>A letter from Ani</b> </h4><br><blockquote>  I will begin with the background: I recently traveled to St. Petersburg to rest and met with my acquaintance.  As expected, I brought him a souvenir from my city, which I forgot to donate during the meeting, but I was lucky, this person introduced me to the goQuests application, an impression about which I am going to share with you. <br>  I want to immediately note that I‚Äôm on you with new technologies, I don‚Äôt understand anything in them, but I need to give a souvenir, and my friend is busy, so I decided to try to create my first quest.  I thought that nothing would come out, but everything turned out to be simple - you make up stages, then assignments to them, answers, hints and all this can be decorated with pictures. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The next day, with my girlfriend went to the Divo-Island, and I decided to combine two in one - to hide the "treasure" and relax.  She has roughly studied the territory, recorded everything on video and made a couple of pictures.  My souvenir was a magnet, so I didn‚Äôt get too fiery there, burying or hiding it.  In the evening, while I remembered that, how and where I began to invent a quest. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/50f/1c6/53f50f1c6bfc4c9ea8976480e1237171.jpg"><br><blockquote>  The process of creation turned out to be very exciting, I didn‚Äôt even expect this: all the time I wanted to think of something more complicated to confuse a person.  Creating hints is even more interesting - I tried to do everything with hints, and only in the last hint did I get the correct answer.  The quest delayed so that the time flew by unnoticed until 6 in the morning, and instead of 3-4 stages, as I originally wanted, it turned out 10, in some stages prompts are about the same.  In general, I received a lot of pleasure - a very creative activity, and this is exactly what I love. <br><br>  Made, sent and waited.  A very busy acquaintance the very next day ran to carry it out and found my gift safe and sound, as required, because  worried that they would find him earlier or he would spoil.  I liked the friend's quest, so I did not try in vain.  I am even glad that I forgot to give a souvenir at the meeting - it would be boring and uninteresting, and the person received a charge of positive emotions, because we are all a bit children, and hardly anyone ever dreamed of ever finding their own treasure. <br><br>  Therefore, now this <a href="http://goquests.ru/">application is</a> forever in my phone - I will give gifts only this way.  In my opinion, it is much more original, and to find a gift is always more exciting than just getting it, plus the process of creating a quest attracted me very much - I love creative.  Therefore, I recommend to everyone - this application brightens up the gray days perfectly) <br><br>  I express my deep gratitude to the creator of this application: a very useful and fascinating thing, and most importantly - easy to use.  After all, who in this world will entertain us, except us? </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292798/</a></p>
