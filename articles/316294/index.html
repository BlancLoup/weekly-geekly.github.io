No, really, we used to think that we are great.  Recently, we had to change this habit and learn to live in a completely different world: where we regularly make mistakes and learn from these mistakes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/308/26c/81b/30826c81bc8c4c5caf1a1dfcf5d275ab.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  We press on the atmosphere: life story </h2><br>  The very discovery of the fact that we are not good fellows at all - deserves a separate paragraph.  First, with the help of our investor's advice, excellence and perseverance, we noticed that many clients were leaving us.  This large outflow obviously does not fit with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexcellent service.  And then reality broke into our lives in the face of a real live client, who was not too lazy to make out our mistakes with us.  It was Ivan Shkirya, and he said that he didn‚Äôt need any discounts, nor a refund, or even a public scandal, the only thing he wanted was to start servicing his own companies. <br><br>  The situation with the service of Ivan was all the more surprising that the formal metrics on it were fulfilled.  After all, we have had a lot of metrics for a long time: we monitor how quickly we answer clients, how many documents our accountants have spent per day, how many tasks the lawyers have done, how many clients have already calculated taxes and how many of them agree with the amount.  And all this wealth practically did not help us when it came to business.  For every mistake or delay, we had a realistic excuse: here was a mistake in the software, and here the client himself did not explain well what he wanted.  Well, you know what people say in such cases, right?

      Ivan was not happy with us, but we did not even see it.  That was the worst.  It turned out that we are not handsome at all, but, scary to say, shit.  At first we decided to despair, but after a couple of minutes of existential longing, we decided that depression was not our way.  I had to change. <br><br><h2>  The culmination and difficult struggle: the problem is not solved simply </h2><br>  What is it with us has become, you ask?  At least that's what we asked.  So, the analysis showed that degradation does not require special skills.  To stop seeing client problems, we needed to do two things on a regular basis. <br><br>  First, we noticed that we boldly put labels on customers.  For example, when you described a client as a ‚Äúcashier‚Äù, ‚Äúrogue‚Äù, ‚Äúmuddy type‚Äù or ‚Äúhysterical person‚Äù, then it is not so scary to make mistakes or indifference against him.  He is still a ‚Äúhysteric‚Äù. <br><br>  Secondly, we simply began to treat errors as routine or statistics.  We have long been a big company: we have about 10 times more clients than in the usual "big accounting" company.  We also have a lot of employees by the standards of the market for accounting services - this is the scale and he played a cruel joke with us.  Roughly speaking, an error in one of the 100 payments has ceased to be regarded as a disaster.  We had a situation in which the continuation was normal and completely unhealthy, in the end there were always some excuses, either subjective (‚Äúnaughty customer cannot explain properly‚Äù) or objective (‚Äú1C does not work well‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomers too much "," admins have a hand not from that place "). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff8/449/adb/ff8449adb1334ee08c32eeaf1f3e59b9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What have we begun to do with this, you ask?  Yes, the same thing that almost any entrepreneur would have done in our place: they got a big red-hot scrap and began to wield it.  We were able to return to the company the realization that mistakes are bad.  Some people said that performing tasks on time is not very creative, that they are not cogs and decided to leave.  On the other part, even the red-hot scrap didn‚Äôt really work - I had to make a decision for them.  As a result, we closed 3000+ overdue tasks and ceased to consider errors as normal. <br><br>  In addition to the universal introduction of motivation, specific roles that are responsible for quality have been added: we have an operating director and seven quality managers.  Yes, we now have more quality managers than in the usual accounting company!  It would seem that we have substantially improved the climate: the operating director goes around to the operations of taxis, the qualityologists around are running around in leotards and discovering mistakes, but there are still no feelings that quiet happiness and harmony has come.  And the matter is not even that half of the company didn‚Äôt get away from us - it‚Äôs not to say that there were less errors. <br><br><h2>  The following teaser series </h2><br>  Here we were waiting for the following ideological discovery: it turns out that the error cannot be corrected without stopping to look for the guilty.  We have learned to fight with errors in DNA for a very long time: we are fucking able to hire professional accountants.  However, you can really improve the quality only by rearranging the process so that it protects you from mistakes. <br><br>  Do you think this is shamanism?  In fact, everything is simple and realistic.  For example, it turned out that if you do not copy the payment, but create it again each time, then the number of payments with errors will drastically decrease.  It would seem petty nonsense, moreover, it looks like a complication, but in reality everything is completely different: it is much more beneficial not to make mistakes, even if you spend a little more time on the action itself. <br><br>  Or it turned out that it is necessary to fundamentally divide people and the processes of consultation and bookkeeping.  Roughly speaking, the accounting department does some of the work for operational support of the business - answers questions about how to save on taxes, makes documents for clients.  Another part of her work is to support a continuous accounting process, which is very necessary for the state (you know).  It‚Äôs difficult to do these two things at the same time: it‚Äôs easy to get one and score on the second.  And most importantly, after we divided the accountants into consultants and they have no reason to leave themselves, they are indulging themselves: poorly advise due to being taken into account or vice versa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32e/df5/694/32edf56949ac4f82849e4291db607ca2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Separation and atomization of processes and actions allowed us to finally fulfill the dream of genocide: we were able to replace people with a soulless iron.  In contrast to live accountants, robots cannot yet be responsible for a too wide area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork ‚Äî the robot can be charged with something understandable and compact. <br><br>  For example, robot Natasha is currently getting bank statements for all of our clients.  A robot Lena holds in 1C all the acts of services performed.  Our robotic accountants do not just execute written instructions, there is machine learning inside that will allow them to replace our employees from manual labor. <br><br><h2>  An encouraging conclusion that gives hope </h2><br>  What do we have today?  Can we guarantee the quality of our work?  Can a plane or server guarantee that it will not fall?  Of course not, but you can reduce the likelihood and see the dynamics of this decline.  We read all correspondence with clients, we mark and sort all erroneous messages and we see that the number of errors decreases.  The airline industry began with 30% of unsuccessful departures and reached one crash per several million departures.  In aviation, it was easy to find the motivation for such work, people are dying.  From our mistakes, people do not die, but we ourselves may die. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316294/</a></p>
