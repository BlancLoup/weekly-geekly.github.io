The WGS shares this niche in the domestic market together in the ESL (Electronic Sports League).  Characteristically, only the WGS administration can create tournaments, players are not given this opportunity.  But I must say that the list of events already running looks good. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The project itself is primarily focused on professional cybersportsmen, but for beginners there is something to do in the vast WGS.  Based on the matches played, a clever rating system (hello, leagues in SC-2!) Will determine the level of the player and then automatically select an adequate opponent.  Situations where ‚Äúfolders‚Äù play against beginners are excluded.  Much has been done to maintain a balanced and fair game, regardless of whether the tournament is held for real money or for an internal rating.

      WGS believes that matches held outside such projects are exclusively amateur.  To me, it is said unnecessarily categorically, but there is a grain of truth in this.  Instead of dumping on the prize pool together with people about whom only the nickname, the post office and, at best, the address of the VKontakte profile are known, it will be safer to entrust the money and evaluate the results to a large, responsible online project.  At the very least, it will be more reliable than putting a fund on Vasi Pupkin‚Äôs wallet with i_will_scam_you@gmail.com.  Here, in addition to making individual contributions, it is possible to create a ‚Äúteam bank‚Äù for group competitions.  Fast payment is guaranteed by connected payment systems. <br><br>  When the game lokalka becomes close, projects of this type - the most it is to test their own strength in tournaments with players from around the world.  At WGS to take part in professional competitions, and to earn on victories is also quite realistic.  Now foreign players on the resource are still not enough, for example, the TOP-20 consists almost entirely of our compatriots, plus that or a minus is up to you. <br><br>  GOLD-accounts deserve special attention.  They are surrounded by such a tight cover of secrecy that it is completely impossible for an unregistered user to understand what they are.  Apparently, this is something secret and cool, because the list of GOLD-account features is not even published on the site. <br><br>  The project also has its own client program, the most important feature of which is embedded anti-cheat.  Besides him, she can work as an instant messenger, keep statistics on games and share files with other project users. <br><br>  <a href="http://world-gs.com/">The WGS website</a> is available in two language versions: in Russian and in English.  Design subtly gives the beginning of the 2000s, but this does not prevent the project to follow its goal - to make eSports a source of permanent income for ordinary gamers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107795/</a></p>
