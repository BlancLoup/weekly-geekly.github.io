Other companies started this way much earlier and went to it much further.  As a warm-up, I suggest Habrozhiteli to guess who owns the phrase below. <br><br>  "... you provide the company ... and its partners with a worldwide valid license that allows us to use this content ...". <br><br>  And this is not all interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Open the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/policies/terms">Google Terms of Use</a> and read them from start to finish. 
      <br>

      <br>
      What should the company notify its customers first? <br><br><blockquote>  By using our Services, you agree to these Terms ... Do not improperly use the Services.  In particular, do not try to interfere with their work or gain access to them bypassing the standard interface and our instructions. <br><br>  You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or rent any elements of the Services and related software, reverse engineer and try to extract the source code of this software except as required by law, or with written permission from Google. <br></blockquote><br>  I think that the scandal associated with the attitude of Oracle to the researchers of its products has not yet been forgotten by habrazhiteli.  Here we see that a reputable company that actively encourages the search for vulnerabilities in its products, in the basic research document, prohibits them.  True punishment for this act is small: <br><br><blockquote>  If you violate these terms and conditions or if we suspect you of this, we may suspend or completely block your access to the Services. <br></blockquote><br>  Habrazhiteley has not forgotten the Russian ‚ÄúLaw on bloggers,‚Äù which introduces full responsibility for the materials posted by the blogger.  Using Google services, its customers are also fully responsible for all posted materials, including information.  Without reservation. <br><br><blockquote>  Services may contain content created and / or uploaded by third parties.  The latter are solely responsible for it. <br></blockquote><br>  Users (and this is quite natural) do not like spam and advertising.  Microsoft has clearly prescribed a procedure for refusing to receive advertising.  Google in the same situation comes differently: <br><br><blockquote>  If you use our Services, we may send you notifications, messages from the administrator and other informational materials.  In some cases, you can, if necessary, refuse to receive them. <br></blockquote><br>  The phrase "in separate" sounds very evasive.  In fact, it turns out that Google is not bound to either limit the flow of advertising. <br><br>  Let us turn to personal data. <br><br><blockquote>  When you work with our Services, you authorize us to use your personal information in accordance with the Google privacy policy. <br><br>  Some of our Services allow you to upload, add, store, send or receive content.  However, all intellectual property rights in relation to these materials remain with their owner. <br></blockquote><br>  It sounds harmless.  After all, in any case, we leave information about ourselves (for example, during registration) and this information is somehow used (processed) to provide access to the service. <br><br>  But further more interesting: <br><br><blockquote>  By downloading, adding, saving, sending and receiving content in our Services, you provide Google <strong>and its partners with a worldwide license that allows us to use this content</strong> , post it, store, reproduce, modify, <strong>create derivative works from it.</strong> for example, translations, adaptations, and other ways to optimize materials), <strong>share them, publish it, openly reproduce, display, and distribute</strong> . <br><br>  The listed rights that you grant to us are used solely to ensure the operation of existing Services, <strong>their promotion</strong> and improvement, as well as to develop new ones. <br></blockquote><br>  It turns out that Google (and do not forget about its partners) is not limited by the use of our data for marketing purposes.  Within the limitations of this document, how fantastic will the situation described below look like?  "Why in your presentation used data about our secret complexes Iskander?".  ‚ÄúThis presentation was made in connection with the project of promoting our services to the US Department of Defense system.  In it, we show that even top-secret information trusts us. ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, it is not very pleasant that company employees have access to your documents (including confidential), photos (including intimate ones) officially and at an arbitrary moment.  I remember in the times of Snowden's revelations, there was a news that the NSA employees were having fun, making collages of photos.  Naturally this is forbidden, but we are all human. <br><br>  By the way, it is extremely interesting how carefully our data partners store Google and how they deal with them after the termination of the partnership agreement. <br><br>  But further more interesting! <br><br><blockquote>  The publicly available data for your Google account (name and profile photo), as well as information about actions you take in Google services or in external applications related to your account (for example, reviews, comments, and +1) <strong>can be used by us for commercial purposes, including advertising</strong> .  You choose which information is publicly available.  For example, you can prohibit the use in advertising your name and photos. <br></blockquote><br>  I think everyone knows how ordinary web users are not aware that the services they use may well be set up by default for the full publicity of their data (who reads the license agreements?).  But without the demand to use user data for commercial purposes? <br><br>  And what about the company when users stop using its services?  Recall that under the law on personal data, they must be destroyed according to the procedure. <br><br><blockquote>  You have the right to stop using our Services at any time.  In addition, Google may block your access to them at any time, limit it, or negotiate new terms related to it. <br><br>  This license will also be valid after you refuse to use the Services (for example, we will still use the company information you added to Google Maps). <br></blockquote><br>  It turns out that Google is absolutely not going to limit the use of our data. <br><br>  And what will happen if as a result of the above features of Google or as a result of technical failure, the Google client will suffer losses? <br><br><blockquote>  NEITHER GOOGLE, ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE SERVICES OTHER THAN THOSE INDICATED IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN OUR SERVICES, THEIR FUNCTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, <strong>RELIABILITY</strong> , AVAILABILITY AND <strong>COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR NEEDS</strong> .  SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" PRINCIPLE. <br></blockquote><br>  In short, it looks like the company does not care about the customers' opinion about the quality of its products, as well as their reliability.  Clearly stated customer-oriented approach.  Yes. <br><br><blockquote>  NEITHER GOOGLE, ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, LOSS OF DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, EVEN IF SUCH LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PERMITTED BY LAW. <br><br>  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF GOOGLE, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE USE OF THE SERVICES (OR, at our option, re providing you with the relevant services) . <br>  IN NO EVENT, GOOGLE, ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AN INCIDENTAL DAMAGE OR LOSS. <br></blockquote><br>  Rather standard conditions for software.  But Google goes further: <br><br><blockquote> If you use our Services on behalf of your company, this means that the company accepts these Terms.  It is committed to protecting Google, its subsidiaries, management, agents and employees from any lawsuits, processes and proceedings related to your use of the Services or your violation of these Terms, as well as from any liability, including financial, in relation to claims, damages, damages, processes, proceedings, legal fees and attorney fees. <br></blockquote><br>  What is the point in talking about the reliability of cloud storage and mail, if the owners of the service are not responsible for the quality of its work? <br><br><blockquote>  All disputes in one way or another connected with these Terms of Use are resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of California (USA), excluding provisions on conflict of laws.  All claims related to these Terms of Use or the Services themselves are within the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Santa Clara County (California, USA).  <strong>You, along with Google, recognize the jurisdiction of these courts</strong> . <br></blockquote><br>  It seems recently in Russia they are trying to assert the supremacy of Russian laws? <br><br>  And of course, all these conditions can be changed suddenly and without warning. <br><blockquote>  We reserve the right to change these or additional Terms of Use in the event of amendments to legislation or updates of the Services themselves.  <strong>You need to regularly track information about such adjustments</strong> .  Changes to the conditions we will report on this page.  Information about changing additional conditions is distributed within the framework of the respective Services ... If you do not agree with changes in the terms of use of the Service, you should stop working with it. <br></blockquote><br>  What data is collected by Google is described in the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/policies/privacy">"Privacy Policy"</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  When you create it (Google Account), we ask you for personal information, such as your name, email address, telephone number or credit card details.  For those who want to use all the sharing features, we also ask you to create a public Google profile in which you can enter your name and add a photo. <br><br>  We collect data on how and which services you use.  This happens when you, for example, visit websites advertised in AdWords or AdMob, or browse and interact with our ads or content. <br><br>  We collect information about devices, such as the model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, as well as mobile network data and phone number. <br><br>  When you use our services or browse content provided by Google, some of your actions may be automatically saved in server logs.  The following information is recorded: <br><ul><li>  Details on the use of services, including search queries; </li><li>  data on telephone calls, including phone numbers for incoming, outgoing and forwarded calls, date, time, type and duration of calls, as well as information about the SMS route; </li><li>  IP addresses </li><li>  information about hardware events, including system failures and actions, as well as settings, browser type and language, request date and time, and URL transition. <br></li></ul><br><br>  At Google, we collect and process data about your actual location.  We also use various technologies for determining the coordinates, for example, we analyze your IP address, GPS data and other sensors of the device in order to identify devices closest to you, Wi-Fi access points and cell phone towers. <br></blockquote><br>  It also confirms once again that: <br><br><blockquote>  The publicly available data for your Google account (name and profile photo), as well as information about actions that you perform in Google services or in external applications related to your account (for example, reviews, comments and +1 marks) can be used us for commercial purposes, including advertising. <br><br>  We combine all user data (including personal) from all of our services in order to simplify the exchange of information between friends. <br></blockquote><br>  That is, all the information about your device, its address, your location, your calls, your interests and preferences - everything is collected and analyzed. <br><br><blockquote>  We can provide aggregated, impersonal data to all users and our partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or related sites. ‚Äù <br><br>  We provide your data to companies, organizations, or individuals not affiliated with Google, in the event that we honestly believe that obtaining, using, maintaining or disclosing such information is reasonably necessary in order to ... protect Google‚Äôs rights, property or security. our users or the public in general, as required and permitted by law. <br></blockquote><br>  That is, there are no restrictions on the disclosure of your data if it is required by Google. <br><br>  And if you are a developer?  Open the <a href="http://play.google.com/intl/ALL_ru/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html">"Developer Distribution Agreement"</a> : <br><blockquote>  5.1 You provide Google with a non-exclusive and worldwide license without paying royalties to copy, display and use the Products for administrative and demonstration purposes in connection with (1) placing the Products on the Store;  (2) marketing devices and services that support the use of Products; and (3) improving the Android platform. <br></blockquote><br>  Maybe this is only Google is interested in our data? <br><br>  The word is given to the agreement from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">Facebook</a> . <br><br>  Do you think Facebook is made for you? <br><br>  <strong>Our goal is to publish advertisements and other commercial or sponsored materials that are of value to advertisers and users.</strong>  <strong>To help us do this, you agree</strong> to the following: <br>  1. You give us permission to use your name, profile photo, materials and information (for example, your favorite brands) in connection with commercial, advertising or other similar materials that are provided or enhanced by us.  For example, this means that you allow a company, company or other organization to pay us for displaying your name and (or) profile photo with your materials or information, without demanding any compensation for these actions.  If you have selected a specific audience for your materials or information, we will take this into account when using. <br>  2. We do not pass on your materials or information to advertisers without your consent. <br>  3. You understand that we can not always explicitly indicate that some services and messages are paid. <br><br>  <strong>You grant us the</strong> following specific permission, based on your privacy settings and applications, regarding the use of all materials covered by intellectual property rights, such as photos and videos (hereinafter referred to as ‚Äúmaterials that are subject to intellectual property rights‚Äù): you provide we assign, transfer in order to sub-license, does not imply the payment of royalties <strong>worldwide license to use any materials that have spread</strong>  <strong>tsya intellectual property rights, to be placed by you on Facebook or in any way associated with Facebook</strong> (hereinafter - "License to Intellectual Property").  The validity of this Intellectual Property License ends when you delete the materials published by you, which are subject to intellectual property rights, or your account, <strong>except when your materials are transferred to other persons and have not been deleted by them</strong> . <br><br>  Well, the little things: <br><br><blockquote>  It is forbidden to modify, create derivative works, decompile or attempt to obtain the source code from us without explicit permission to perform such actions, which may be contained in the terms of an open license or in the text of our written permission. <br><br>  If you download or use our software, for example, a separate software product, application or browser plugin, you agree that from time to time the software may download and install updates and additional functions in order to improve and further improve the quality of work. <br><br>  We strive to create a global community with standards that are suitable for everyone, but at the same time we try to comply with local laws.  The following provisions apply to users and others who interact with Facebook outside of the United States: <br><br>  You consent to the transfer and processing of your personal data in the United States. <br></blockquote><br>  You can sue only in the United States, as is the case with Google. <br><br>  What Facebook collects is listed <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">here</a> . <br><br>  Note that the license agreements of Russian <a href="http://legal.yandex.ru/rules">services are</a> much more loyal to their users - there really is not provided for the dissemination of information.  The only thing you can pay attention to is the double readability of clause 6.1 of the Yandex Users Agreement: <br><br><blockquote>  All objects accessible using Yandex services ..., as well as any content hosted on Yandex services, are subject to the exclusive rights of Yandex, Users and other copyright holders. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265779/</a></p>
