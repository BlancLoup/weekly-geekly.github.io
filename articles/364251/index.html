However, from the title you already understood what it was about. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/242809/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b0/438/383/3b0438383f3d458f8aef5a3395994f6a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Caution!</b>  Publication may cause an irresistible desire to have a son. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">History lesson</font> </h2><br>  The company LEGO (the name comes from the Danish phrase "leg godt", "Play with pleasure") does not need to be introduced - it was founded back in 1932, although the first plastic cubes familiar to all appeared much later, in 1947. It is noteworthy that the LEGO cubes , produced in those years, are fully compatible with those that are produced now.

      The history of the company, released by Pixar on the 80th anniversary of LEGO: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdDU_BBJW9Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhXrNVWU2QDPMn0pVQ1I9r_l_GQxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now the company produces about 20 billion items per year, that is, more than 630 pieces per second.  In the current model range of more than 600 different designers and it just so happened that the Mindstorms series is a kind of apex of technical thought, the most sophisticated designer.  In short, it allows you to make quite a full-fledged robots. <br><br>  As Wikipedia says, the LEGO Mindstorms series was first introduced in 1998.  After 8 years (in 2006) the LEGO Mindstorms NXT 1.0 set was born, and already in 2009 - the LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 set.  Today we will talk about <b><a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/613920">LEGO Mindstorms EV3</a></b> - the last (third) generation of the constructor <s>terminator</s> , which was introduced almost a year ago, on January 4, 2013 (it became available only six months later). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Differences EV3 from NXT 2.0</font> </h2><br>  In principle, the main idea remains the same - the series is designed for the assembly of programmable robots.  Therefore, the first question arises, what has changed since the release of the previous designer and is it worth buying a new one?  The main difference is in the updated sensors / motors and, most importantly, in the EV3 intelligent block (EV stands for EVolution): <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="220"></td><td width="250">  <b>EV3</b> </td><td width="250">  <b>NXT</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Display</b> </td><td>  Monochrome LCD, 178x128 </td><td>  Monochrome LCD, 100x64 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>CPU</b> </td><td>  300 MHz <br>  Texas Instruments <br>  Sitara AM1808 (ARM9) </td><td>  48 MHz Atmel <br>  AT91SAM7S256 <br>  (ARM7TDMI) </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Memory</b> </td><td>  64 MB RAM <br>  16 MB Flash <br>  MicroSDHC slot (up to 32 GB) </td><td>  64 KB RAM <br>  256 kb flash </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Usb host</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Wi-Fi</b> </td><td>  Optionally, via USB dongle </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Bluetooth</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Apple device support</b> </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Not </td></tr></tbody></table> As you can see, the difference is quite significant - it would be strange if in 4 years only the screen resolution and the set of stickers were changed. <br><br>  Another difference is that the NXT series was sold in several versions (in different years) and was a different set, basic and resource.  The new EV3 with this is simpler - while it is sold in the basic version - <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/products/31313-mindstorms-ev3">31313</a> (601 <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/products/31313-mindstorms-ev3">items</a> ), from which you can make a lot of things.  But if you wish, you can purchase the basic set <a href="http://education.lego.com/ru-ru/lego-education-product-database/mindstorms-ev3/45544-lego-mindstorms-education-ev3-core-set">45544</a> (541 parts) with additional sensors and parts (no one interferes with the use of parts from ordinary designers).  By the way, pay attention to the five-digit articles - the company switched to this numbering in 2013. <br><br>  As far as compatibility is concerned, everything possible has been done.  All NXT sensors and motors are compatible with EV3 and are recognized as NXT.  EV3 sensors do not work with the NXT, but EV3 motors seem to be compatible.  NXT-brick can be programmed with software from EV3, but some functions may not be available, but to program EV3-brick with NXT-software without third-party solutions will not work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Inside the box</font> </h2><br>  Even when I myself was small and went with my parents to the central Children's World (when he was still), to the Lubyanka - even then I could not take my eyes off the boxes with LEGO.  Then there were neither Hiktames, nor even Habra, but since then the boxes have remained all the same bright and juicy, even in adulthood they activate the process of salivation) In this regard, other manufacturers have a lot to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a8/9c4/833/1a89c4833f054a1aa947165dcd380026.jpg"><br><br>  Part of the box, in fact, represents (if it is cut) a track with different color zones, which can be used for robots with color sensors. <br><br>  All parts are neatly laid out in bags, complete with instructions and a set of stickers.  Let's briefly go over what was put in the kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3c/e2c/013/e3ce2c013ebf4cb8b92669d028c5b380.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cee/967/7be/cee9677be4114d19bac54be1ba364d4d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>EV3</b> itself, which is also an intellectual unit, is also the heart of the system, it is also a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù or ‚Äúcube‚Äù.  It serves as the control center and power station for your robot and has the following functional elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16d/f6a/c2d/16df6ac2d9a0455aa69c8b7ee8cf647b.jpg"><br><br>  - Multifunctional monochrome display with a resolution of 178x128 <br>  - Six-button control interface with backlight change function (3 colors) for indicating the operation mode <br>  - 4 input ports (1, 2, 3, 4) for connecting sensors <br>  - 4 output ports (A, B, C, D) for executing commands <br>  - 1 miniUSB connector for connecting an EV3 to a computer <br>  - 1 USB host port (to connect multiple EV3 into one chain, for example) <br>  - 1 slot for microSD memory cards (up to 32GB) - to increase the amount of available EV3 memory <br>  - Built-in speaker <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/04e/354/4b504e354b084cbcb38755f1e71b50c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5db/5d6/430/5db5d643019d4f4eb0ee2b31fdcf80eb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dc/0ad/34d/1dc0ad34d9484d00ae46fb6895bbaae6.jpg"><br><br>  The EV3 cube also supports Bluetooth, WiFi (via the NETGEAR WNA1100 Wireless-N 150 USB adapter), has a software interface for communicating with computers, which allows you to create programs and configure data logging directly on the EV3 microcomputer. <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Large EV3-servomotor (2 pieces)</b> .  Created to work with the EV3 microcomputer and has a built-in rotation sensor with measurement accuracy up to 1 degree.  Using this sensor, the motor can be connected by other motors, allowing the robot to move at a constant speed.  In addition, the rotation sensor can also be used when conducting various experiments to accurately read the data on distance and speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/481/cb3/94f/481cb394fd7b4db4b968b256bb7de53e.jpg"><br><br>  - Built-in rotation sensor with measurement accuracy up to 1 degree <br>  - Maximum speeds up to 160-170 rpm <br>  - Maximum torque of 40 Ncm <br>  - Automatic identification by EV3 software <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Medium EV3 servomotor.</b>  Ideal for tasks where the speed and speed of response, as well as the size of the robot is more important than its carrying capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ae/afb/be9/3aeafbbe905b4261882b2eaf729e2ad1.jpg"><br><br>  - Built-in rotation sensor with measurement accuracy up to 1 degree <br>  - Maximum speeds up to 240-250 rpm <br>  - Maximum torque of 12 Ncm <br>  - Automatic identification by EV3 software <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Color sensor (EV3).</b>  Able to detect 8 different colors, although it can also be used as a light sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/316/2da/ada3162daf144531976efa46a47b095c.jpg"><br><br>  - Measures reflected red light and ambient ambient light, from total darkness to bright sunlight <br>  - Fix and determine 8 colors <br>  - Poll frequency up to 1 kHz <br>  - Automatic identification by EV3 software <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Touch sensor (EV3).</b>  Allows the robot to respond to touch, recognizes three situations: touch, click and release.

First, there are other Lego sensors, such as: <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Gyroscopic sensor (EV3).</b>  Digital gyroscopic sensor EV3 allows you to measure the rotational movement of the robot, as well as detect changes in its movement and position.  Angle measurement mode with an accuracy of ¬± 3 degrees;  built-in gyroscope detects rotation with a moment up to 440 degrees / s;  polling frequency up to 1 kHz. <br><br>  <b><font color="#e40136">¬ª</font> Ultrasonic sensor (EV3).</b>  Generates sound waves and captures their reflections from objects, thereby measuring the distance to objects.  It can also be used in sonar mode, emitting single waves.  It can pick up sound waves that will trigger the programs.  Measures distances from 1 to 250 cm, and the accuracy of measurements is ¬± 1 cm. <br><br>  And secondly, sensors and other accessories from third-party manufacturers such as <a href="http://www.hitechnic.com/sensors">HiTechnic</a> and <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/">Mindsensors</a> are <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/">supported</a> - they offer all kinds of joysticks, infrared distance sensors, magnetic sensors, compasses, gyroscopes, accelerometers, timers, multiplexers, ball bearings, etc.  So, if you ask a question, you can find a lot of interesting things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbf/b51/67d/fbfb5167de3240cf94e960c819d9023c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, as you already understood, LEGO is for real kids! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">First model</font> </h2><br>  Included with the designer is a paper instruction, according to which you can assemble a single model - a kind of tracked self-propelled machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/199/d98/d2e/199d98d2e53548dc8ffe968ae5292b6d.jpg"><br><br>  At first I was surprised, because even in the simplest sets (series of the LEGO Creator type) there are always a few instructions, and then suddenly the papers were spared or there was no place in the box.  It turned out ... that only on the official site from the kit of parts it is proposed to assemble 17 different robots!  Therefore, the 17 instructions in the box would be really superfluous (both for logistics and for forests of nature).  Here are the names of the robots: <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/ev3rstorm">EV3RSTORM</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/gripp3r">GRIPP3R</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/r3ptar">R3PTAR</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/spik3r">SPIK3R</a> , and <a href="">TRACK3R</a> .  <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/robodoz3r">ROBODOZ3R</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/banner-print3r">BANNER PRINT3R</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/ev3meg">EV3MEG</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/bobb3">BOBB3</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/mrbeam">MR-B3AM</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/rac3-truck">RAC3 TRUCK</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/kraz3">KRAZ3</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/ev3d4">EV3D4</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/el3ctric-guitar">EL3CTRIC GUITAR</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/dinor3x">DINOR3X</a> , <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/wack3m">WACK3M</a> , and <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/build-a-robot/ev3-game">EV3GAME</a> - instructions for them will have to download from Ineta, as well as software for connecting EV3 to a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/f19/38d/030f1938d4674afc975c3cfda92a99e7.jpg"><br><br>  The instruction is most detailed, it's difficult to mess up.  <font color="#cc0000"><i>The son said</i></font> that the parts in the bags were not packaged very well - on the very first page you may need to open 3 different packages, but these are also trifles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e97/ef2/ac6/e97ef2ac6bf34d4e9e0a012f40f64876.jpg"><br><br>  The EV3 cube needs to be powered, for which you can use a battery (not included) or 6 finger-type batteries.  Looking ahead - 2 more batteries (but already mizinchikovyh) will be needed to power the IR beacon (aka remote control). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca3/be6/d21/ca3be6d21b1e4da98a552a7c807eb986.jpg"><br><br>  The first model of a child (7 years old) gathered in about 30 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/040/d3d/45e/040d3d45ef634b6aaeddede98baa4636.jpg"><br><br>  The process was not as exciting as, for example, assembling models of LEGO Technics - the instruction suggests assembling far from the most interesting robot: there are only large parts in it, including almost all sensors and engines - apparently, to demonstrate the work of each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e4/3fd/778/0e43fd77810249229444477acb7e448c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/349/b8f/c91/349b8fc91eb647aab96f500e5b3caf23.jpg"><br><br>  But the result surpassed all childhood expectations - for the first time he collected a model that could move by itself: back and forth, turn, turn on the spot, twist tentacles ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/70c/b44/83670cb44ce340f69606511827bfe872.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/900/6bd/e95/9006bde9541642ba8ce71cb0041af7f5.jpg"><br><br>  The launch is carried out from an EV3 cube, for which you should press a couple of buttons on the front panel.  Some actions can be programmed directly on the cube: select the number of iterations, adjust the sound signal and so on - do not tell everything in one article, smoke manuals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3a/d25/185/c3ad25185b8542e99dc46d207c1a769c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/720/48d/8a372048d5134ffaa3fe9314d3eb62f2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Soft</font> </h2><br>  It was not necessary to program through the computer collected above model.  Nevertheless, there is such a possibility, while at different levels of hardcore. <br><br>  The easiest way for a child to start is to use the software offered by the manufacturer, which is available for both Windows and OS X. In the second case, the distribution kit weighs 666 MB, and the installed application will take gigabytes.  It is called LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Home Edition and was developed in collaboration with the well-known company <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/labview/">LabView</a> .  On the LEGO website there are <a href="http://www.lego.com/ru-ru/mindstorms/learn-to-program">quite a few</a> programming tutorials. <br><br>  Immediately after launch, we see an interactive ‚Äúgarage‚Äù of robots that can be assembled from a set: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b2/9fe/024/1b29fe024e29410da679090bde25562f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/6d7/7f7/72f6d77f72304395a57db86e95199d04.png"><br>  Choose the one you like and start collecting: an interactive assembly instruction, videos and a selection of various missions that you can complete with the assembled robot will appear in front of us.  That's why the distribution weighed so much. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/807/24a/bc0/80724abc041048f5bc04bec3cfee7b05.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/761/ced/baf/761cedbafa7d4c31a0220881ffcb88aa.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d5/8b1/f1e/5d58b1f1ece94a25bb15fb6cfda556da.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b7/b90/c27/0b7b90c27b414a7fab85a1d86877f7ff.png"><br>  I see no reason to describe everything in detail: you download the application faster and see what is there and at what level.  Unless I mention one of the shortcomings that I remember most: not the most friendly (especially for children) interface - the application is smacked by some bank client. <br><br>  It should be noted once again that the EV3 cube can be controlled from a smartphone on Android or iOS operating systems, for which there are separate applications. <br><br>  If all this was not enough, you can increase the degree of hardcore.  For the EV3 cube, there are various firmware that can expand its capabilities, speed, etc.  Here, for example, is the alternative <a href="http://www.lejos.org/ev3.php">leJOS EV3</a> firmware ‚Äî a jvm firmware that allows you to program EV3 in Java.  Want in another language?  Ok, google - <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lego_Mindstorms">you have</a> almost 60 options to choose from: ASM / C / C ++ / Perl / Python / Ruby / VB / Haskell / Lisp / Matlab / LabVIEW and much, much more. <br><br>  I will not tell you more about this for several reasons: first, the programmer of me is completely false (all hopes for the son), secondly, until we managed to collect only one model (and take the second for the weekend), and - third - you have already placed an order for this constructor and you will soon find out for yourself;) But seriously, the article is already huge - here‚Äôs two more references: <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lego_Mindstorms">one</a> and <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT">two</a> . <br><br>  Well, another big plus is the LEGO-community, which is full of all over the world.  You can be sure that at any stage of experiments with robots you can always find like-minded people and those who can help with solving the problem.  In addition to friendly communities, a huge variety of different instructions, models, source codes, videos and training materials are posted on the network.  All this means one thing: you do not get bored with Mindstorms. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WmYNcfwovqo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj98CChUlGLnJYycMGewtOeprcJDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TABtCSKsQZs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcqH8nCVzSo-UDDo63udB5ovbYNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQvG6IgrgYQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgPLWKwJlM6qV48IuWm_LuZiPQp8g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X89pXBJaPWI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgq_refyEepL7dfQXXUUqEGPh6cFQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xCd55oSgO4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhipwc-cg8tsf6RCKLmI12lhrniRMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Advantages and disadvantages</font> </h2><br>  Not for the first year, LEGO products have been famous for their quality, so there are no complaints in this regard: a spectacular box, details, stickers, instructions - everything has been worked through to the smallest detail.  Therefore, let me close my eyes to all the ‚Äúsmall pluses‚Äù compared to one big one: the variety of possible combinations of designs that can be made even from a standard set of parts (it‚Äôs not worth talking about additional kits) is limited only by your imagination.  The ability to program the assembled model in different ways is another plus, which, in fact, is much more than it seems at first glance. <br><br>  But from the really significant drawbacks I found only one: the price.  In the summer, <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/613920">LEGO Mindstorms EV3 could be bought</a> for 14-15 thousand, but the rapid growth of the rate of the evergreen president increased the price to 17 thousand.  Someone will say: ‚Äú <i>yes, cool designer ... BUT WAIT WELL!</i>  "And he will be right.  During the study of the set and its capabilities, I went by the amount of the resources that were invested in its creation;  I understand that there is a lot of electronics and everything else ... but still, I still can not accept the cost of the designer.  For this money, you can <s>pull a person out of prison (s)</s> to pick a lot of other gifts: a quadrocopter, a radio-controlled ICE model, a full-sized electromotor cycle, a year of classes in the sports section, a tablet ... and a lot of things!  But you can go to the sport at any time and it seems to be not quite a gift, and the same quadrocopter will buzz before the first serious breakdown.  Lego in this regard is a much more long-lasting gift that combines the pleasant with the useful, with unrealistically great potential.  Yes, on the same tablet, you can also learn to program, but when there is no opportunity to live to touch the result of the work with your hands, it is not so exciting.  So decide for yourself. <br><br>  Oh yes.  The manufacturer positions this set for children from 10 years old, but even a 7-year-old child was interested in playing around - the process of rapid development began.  What do you think, how many of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5QwoDGMzvTk">these guys</a> and what time will they buy their first Porsche?  ) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">The end</font> </h2><br>  New Year's Eve each of us is associated with Snow Maidens, mandarins, Olivier basin and, of course, with gifts.  And if we talk about children, then their gifts are far from the last place on this list.  And if it so happens that your son grows, then you can not even doubt that this designer under the Christmas tree will bring him to the porosity of joy.  And considering that after the New Year's salute you will have almost a week to dig deeper into the cubes and wiring with your child ... you do buy his child, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c2/cc2/f00/0c2cc2f0035e4b5d8dbf6ed0d04ae338.jpg"><br><br>  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364251/</a></p>
