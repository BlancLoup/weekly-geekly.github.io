  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of data bootcamps abroad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr, hello.  Recently, the so-called bootcamps have become popular in the world of education.  For example, <a href="https://www.thefirehoseproject.com/definitive-guide/1">this link</a> describes quite well what the bootcamp is in the field of programming and how it differs from the usual educational programs in universities. <br><br>  <i>A bootcamp is a technical educational program that aims to teach participants the most relevant market skills.</i>  <i>This allows participants with little programming experience to focus on those aspects of programming that can be applied here and now to solve real-world problems.</i> <br><br>  We decided to focus and prepare a review of several bootcamps abroad in the field of data science, which are the most well-known and have been on the market for several years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1.</b> <a href="https://new.galvanize.com/san-francisco/data-science">Galvanize</a> <br>  Location: USA, 7 cities, including New York, San Francisco and others. <br>  Duration: 12 weeks <br>  Format: full-time <br>  Cost: $ 16,000, at the current rate of ~ 950 thousand rubles.

      The features of the program include the fact that this is a full-time program.  This means that you will have to study all day and will be difficult to combine with work (remote, for example).  At the moment, they have already graduated 172 people.  The program consists of 4 modules.  The first can be called preparatory - the foundations of Python and statistics are laid.  The second module is devoted to machine learning.  The third is natural language processing and data visualization.  The fourth is devoted to the preparation of the graduation project. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science%3Fwhere%3Dsan-francisco">General Assembly</a> <br>  Location: Major Cities USA + London, Sydney, Melbourne, Singapore <br>  Duration: 11 weeks <br>  Format: part-time <br>  Cost: $ 3,950, at the current rate ~ 233 thousand rubles. <br><br>  As you can see, you can take part in this program not only in the USA, but already in Europe, Australia and Asia.  The program itself is part-time, that is, it is real to combine with work.  It consists of 3 modules.  The first is again connected with the preparation: work with libraries, basic statistics.  The second module is about machine learning.  The third is about working with textual information and time series, as well as about the task of reducing the dimension. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> <a href="https://www.datascienceretreat.com/">Data Science Retreat</a> <br>  Location: Berlin <br>  Duration: 12 weeks <br>  Format: part-time <br>  Cost: ‚Ç¨ 10,000, at the current rate of ~ 630 thousand rubles. <br><br>  This program does not position itself as a bootcamp, but as a place where a person learns more independently and is provided with mentors and other opportunities for this.  Plus, as indicated on their website, they are preparing a lead data scientist, that is, more serious requirements are being placed on the level of preparation.  You need to have experience, or at least go through several online courses where a person could learn basic knowledge. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> <a href="http://nycdatascience.com/data-science-bootcamp/">NYC Data Science Academy</a> <br>  Place: New York <br>  Duration: 12 weeks <br>  Format: full-time <br>  Cost: $ 16,000, at the current rate of ~ 950 thousand rubles. <br><br>  This program is also full time and lasts 12 weeks.  Its difference is that it simultaneously teaches two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Python and R. Plus, the last two weeks of the program are devoted to tools for working with big data - Hadoop, Spark. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps">Metis</a> <br>  Place: New York, San Francisco <br>  Duration: 12 weeks <br>  Format: full-time <br>  Cost: $ 15,500, at the current rate of ~ 915 thousand rubles. <br><br>  This program also has its focus - they pay more attention not just to working with data, and working with data with an eye on web projects.  Therefore, in their program you can find JavaScript, D3.js, Flask, etc.  It is also an interesting feature that they provide a scholarship of $ 3,000 for women, representatives of sexual minorities, as well as veterans of the US Army. <br><br>  This is a list of 5 large and well-known bootcamps abroad.  Naturally, this list is not exhaustive.  They are followed by about a dozen companies that train data science professionals. <br><br>  What is the advantage of such formats?  First, as it was said, the right packaging of knowledge and skills goes in a bootcamp in such a way that a person gets everything they need to enter the industry in a short period of time.  Secondly, a person immerses himself in an environment that is almost guaranteed to lead him to the desired result.  Thirdly, the participants acquire a network with which they can continue to develop well, making joint projects and helping each other.  The bottom line: saving time, increasing the likelihood of success, acquired communication. <br><br>  By the way, from March 16 to June 8, we have <a href="http://newprolab.com/bigdata%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D13.03%26utm_content%3Dbootcamps">our 12-week bootcamp in the field of working with big data</a> .  This will be held for the 6th time.  If you want to jump into this train, then hurry.  There are literally a couple of places. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323796/</a></p>
