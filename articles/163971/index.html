As you probably know, our new flagship Meizu MX2 has already gone on sale, while sales started almost simultaneously in China, Hong Kong and Russia.  The smartphone is in the hands of many reviewers, and I also decided to keep up and prepared my review for a novelty.  In the review I will try to pay attention to the important features of the MX2, talk about the design of the case and the materials used, performance, hardware in general and other things, and skip a couple of boring moments, but if they interest you, write in the comments, I will try to answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/567/883/e0e/567883e0e7a9b73a58255957aa43b228.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Just in case, links to materials that may be of interest to you before reading the review:

      ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/160353/">Introducing the Meizu MX2!</a>  Information on the technical characteristics of new items and prices <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/161449/">"Stubborn Maverick Huang Zhang and his Meizu smartphones."</a>  Interview with CEO of Meizu <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/162789/">A brief history of Meizu: from MP3 player to smartphone.</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/162789/"><br></a>  The story about the history of Meizu from the moment of the appearance of the first players under this brand to the present day <br><br><h4>  <b>Kit:</b> </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Smartphone <br>  ‚Ä¢ USB cable <br>  ‚Ä¢ network adapter <br>  ‚Ä¢ Plastic clip to open the lid <br>  ‚Ä¢ Plastic adapter microSIM-miniSIM <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two microSIM trim stickers from miniSIM <br><br>  The smartphone comes in a neat box of hard white cardboard, all the elements inside the box are laid out in small boxes, the smartphone itself lies in a recess inside the box that looks like a book, by the way, this is a book with solid page pages that contain basic information about the device . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/078/bdd/abd/078bddabd27fcc4982468e7f7ff95edd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ac/edc/036/0acedc03694f2b1c0d046ffbc8274cf3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Appearance, design</b> </h4><br>  On the front side, the new MX2 is different from the previous model, there is no ‚Äúiron‚Äù key here, the thinner frame between the display and the edges of the case, the metal edging, due to all these details, Meizu MX2 has become more elegant and strict.  Metal piping - the visible area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame, laser-cut from a single piece of stainless steel, this element creates the necessary structural strength of the smartphone and adds bonus points when compared with fully plastic devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/123/a15/4c0/123a154c058a7d5cbfa71c2ffcd2f785.jpg"><br><br>  The screen in the Meizu MX2 is protected by Gorilla Glass.  Over time, small scratches may appear on it, but even non-commercial samples after a long time of use have a completely marketable appearance.  The back cover is made of plastic: the top layer is translucent - like ‚Äújelly bean‚Äù (candy-jelly), and the second layer, the inner one, in white, or rather milky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a6/3e2/753/9a63e275344daaa33e4c40bf8a92fe05.jpg"><br><br>  The surface is glossy, fingerprints remain on it, but completely invisible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a1/bff/8c5/5a1bff8c572da50a004def7e50c4ca53.jpg"><br><br>  Meizu MX2 has a relatively compact size (124.9 x 64.9 x10.2 mm) compared with the current flagship smartphones and even some low-end devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/987/564/872/987564872639cf71bb7ed3ac67a130e9.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the MX2 screen has been increased by 0.4 inches, the device has become taller than the MX by only 3.5 mm, and has gained nothing in weight - 3 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0d/3e2/797/d0d3e2797ff2348b046ae4756ab3acc6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72d/47b/1cd/72d47b1cd759a9f8db24f51be32dc252.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/590/477/da8/590477da866d0e623055fbe90e2aa0f4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d7/de9/0c4/7d7de90c4000acd67159ba8301f448cc.jpg"><br><br>  Since the back is a little sloping, in the hand MX2 is great, and the metal edging pleasantly cools the palm. <br>  The assembly is excellent: there are no gaps, cracks or other defects, the cover is very securely fastened and even if the smartphone falls, it most likely will not fly off. <br><br><h4>  <b>Keys and connectors</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/302/4dd/b82/3024ddb822f6fa740d4bee7719b5902d.png"><br><br>  On the front side of the smartphone at the top is a small slot where the speaker is located.  It is loud, and if you want a direct comparison, it is not inferior in quality to the dynamics in the Apple iPhone 5. To the right is an additional camera for video chats, to the right, two sensors.  They are responsible for automatically adjusting the brightness of the screen matrix and turning off the display (blocking) when the phone is offered to your ear.  During testing, I did not have questions to these sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac7/34a/6d9/ac734a6d9075d287db21694add82721b.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom is a small round touch button (in the Meizu MX, it was slightly convex and mechanical). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/547/3e7/e6b5473e7f6a9c6289d452cd01fbc067.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the developers abandoned the other two buttons - ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  The touch button in the Meizu MX2 with a short press performs the functions ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, swipe upwards - ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, and if you click on it twice, the menu with previously launched applications will pop up.  In the new version of Flyme, a screen brightness adjustment slider appears on the right in this menu.  For those who hardly reach the unlock button, the developers of ‚ÄúMeize‚Äù provided an interesting chip: hold your finger on the touch circle for a couple of seconds - the screen will be locked, and if in the locked state you can lightly touch the phone twice, the backlight will turn on pull the screen from bottom to top to unlock. <br><br>  In the active state, the button glows white, when a message or other events are skipped, it flashes periodically, and in standby mode it glows faintly in dark green, a phosphoric layer is used for such a light glow.  It looks spectacular and unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a41/5d0/353/a415d03533bf1f067338d74055d3169b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a2/d07/3d1/2a2d073d158fdf7317acb56762a9a97d.jpg"><br><br>  The volume key is located on the left side of the smartphone.  Made from translucent white plastic.  It is thin, but easily groped with fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbc/dee/ace/fbcdeeace5bda3ccf402f525698a8c87.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/859/b5f/cbf/859b5fcbfe823f245c9c33096f553850.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76f/0dd/b41/76f0ddb418163ba946f7a45ac75eed1c.jpg"><br><br>  At the top there is a second microphone (the first is at the bottom) for noise cancellation, a normal 3.5 mm headphone output and an on / off button for the phone.  It is exactly the same type as the volume rocker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f6/ffa/1b5/4f6ffa1b561152155b8a88d57314e160.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/784/b6a/316/784b6a316f5a263aa0586af7b47bfe8a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5e/049/a97/d5e049a97e3575969b1dd51aadf39273.jpg"><br><br>  Below is an open microUSB and microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd7/e6b/130/bd7e6b1302f8beb3ad9d230d072726be.jpg"><br><br>  Behind are the camera's eye, covered with a protective glass, a small flash and a speaker.  The speaker volume is slightly lower than in the MX, but at the same time its quality has been significantly improved - sound detailing, low frequencies elaboration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e55/48b/193/e5548b193312668293b715fa4f0b34aa.jpg"><br><br>  To remove the cover of the Meizu MX2, you need a special tool included in the kit - something like an i-clip for the Apple iPhone.  Insert the "clip" into the hole located on the left edge of the smartphone, and gently pull the cover with your nails.  From the first time it turns out not at all, but if you do it carefully - there will be no problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/022/04f/2dd/02204f2dde8bbc4a5aae2e7e583c44e3.jpg"><br><br>  Under the panel there is only a slot for MicroSIM cards and nothing more.  The logical question is: ‚ÄúWhy, then, in general, is it removed?‚Äù But just so that it can be replaced with panels of other colors and even made of other materials (we hope). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cb/d1c/2a9/0cbd1c2a9e1215aad940f7b856aab279.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6a/d26/aee/b6ad26aee6fb3af54c1e288817f30b3c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b9/d09/50c/9b9d0950c62fbe43d49ec6ac76c637e6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Screen</b> </h4><br>  Unlike the MX, the MX2 is set to a screen with a diagonal not 4 inches, but 4.4 ‚Äù.  The resolution also increased: instead of 640x960 pixels, it became 1280x800 pixels (WXGA).  Slightly more than HD, but does not affect the compatibility in applications and modern games.  The display matrix of Meizu MX2 is made using Sharp New Mode 2 technology - similar to Sharp IGZO.  When compared to IPS-LCD, then the MX2 matrix has more viewing angles and colors are not distorted under any screen tilt.  It gives nice juicy colors, let's say so - natural.  The contrast is 1000: 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f02/77f/6ce/f0277f6ce3c31e08ce02d673a9c12e90.jpg"><br><br>  Pixels on the display, even with all the desire, you will not see, of course, if you do not resort to a magnifying glass or a microscope, because here the density is 347 dpi.  The touch layer is made by capacitive technology and handles up to 10 simultaneous touches. <br><br>  Brightness has a large adjustment range.  The minimum brightness is sufficient for comfortable reading of books at night, and on a sunny day it can be made higher (up to 450 cd / m2), while the readability will increase to almost 100%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/839/9af/f54/8399aff54e9f01c896f2101506b93e7a.png"><br><br>  In Meizu MX2 there is an adaptive brightness control technology (CABC), which provides precise brightness settings, depending on the displayed content and programs, using this technology you can save from 20 to 50% of the power of the battery charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c69/b62/ab1/c69b62ab134ac5dc5a2b49ace0107135.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Comparing screens Meizu MX2 (left) and Meizu MX (right)</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ff/d30/979/4ffd30979d49f46814fe627e055775e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d99/fbc/c2f/d99fbcc2ff15fd31e379716fb513812c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71d/7b0/a61/71d7b0a61e088e9f53dc75918e4bb0ea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd3/e22/6d9/fd3e226d94a26655520d3bfa4697fce2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Performance and Memory</b> </h4><br>  The new smartphone uses one of the most powerful chipsets MX5S (Samsung Exynos 4412).  Exactly the same installed in the Samsung Galaxy Note II. <br><br>  The quad-core processor (32 nm, ARMv7, Cortex-A9 MPcore) operates at a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz.  Graphic Accelerator - Mali-400 MP.  RAM in the device 2 GB (dual-channel LPDDR2).  At the moment there are not so many smartphones with a similar volume, and those that are, do not differ in compact size.  On average, Meizu MX2 is free around 1.2 GB of RAM (Instagram, Plume, Gmail and several other specific applications work). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b6/f63/a3b/9b6f63a3b77b9d9d7f29ce63c7e925cc.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fb/e64/bc1/7fbe64bc1bbc3d4d3485d5d2c280323d.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8c/4b2/740/b8c4b2740363459bac0547d4b9de763e.jpg"><br><br>  There are no questions about performance.  All powerful and resource-demanding games are launched and go: be it GTA Vice City, NOVA 3, Modern Combat 4, Asphalt 7 and so on.  If at maximum CPU load in many smartphones the entire body heats up, in MX2 only the metal edge at the top. <br><br>  The following are the most popular synthetic system performance tests: <br><br>  <b>Antutu benchmark</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c5/d1b/2a8/0c5d1b2a8b4a85bccbf67e1026d515ca.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b0/656/8c8/7b06568c847362c932f4662cf98208df.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  <b>Quadrant standart</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd5/70e/1ea/fd570e1eac3decdae563d6f14c8856fa.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Vellamo Benchmark</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/592/a6b/c41/592a6bc41efe42e7c43fc0f1cd03f4da.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/176/05c/e4e/17605ce4e3fd8564e96a2060d63320ac.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  By the way, if you do not constantly need the maximum performance, you can change it in the ‚ÄúSpecial features‚Äù settings: low (200 MHz), optimal (600 MHz) or high (1600 MHz). <br><br><h4>  <b>Navigation and Interfaces</b> </h4><br>  As with any Android smartphone, there is a Google Maps application for GPS or GLONASS navigation.  Testing in the GPS test program showed that a cold start takes about 3 minutes, and a hot start takes just under 15 seconds.  If you turn on A-GPS and mobile Internet - the waiting can be reduced to 5 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6e/734/aaa/c6e734aaaecf55ad73f6a36174a9941b.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aaa/d03/f6c/aaad03f6c2df93b200701ccf46852073.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  Meizu MX2 works in GSM networks (900/1800 MHz) and UMTS (2100 MHz, maximum speed up to 21.6 Mbit / s), there is support for Wi-Fi (802.11b / g / n) with DLNA and Bluetooth version 4.0.  In place of USB 2.0, to which you can connect, for example, a data storage device (USB flash drive), since the phone supports USB Host.  Through the same interface, the sound S / PDIF.  For more convenient switching of network modes, Flyme has built-in switches, they are located at the top right in the "notification panel". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/222/d7f/ae7/222d7fae7c858ad0f6c18b0edc6f2317.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Photo and video camera</b> </h4><br>  The Meizu MX2 uses an 8-megapixel backlit matrix (BSI).  There is a small LED flash suitable for highlighting the area at a distance of up to 2 meters.  Also, the flash can be used as a flashlight; any application from Google Play that implements this function is suitable for this.  And as a flashlight, the flash turns out to be very good - the light is powerful and bright. <br>  The aperture of the main camera f / 2.4 is the standard of modern camera phones.  Of course, I would like to f / 2.2, and even more so - f / 2.0.  Front camera 1.3 MP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd2/b5b/ba1/bd2b5bba190f7120a3f6817c90c9aacd.jpg"><br><br>  Photos from the test samples that I received earlier - I was completely not satisfied.  But photos already came from much better commercial samples. But programmers still have a lot to work on: for example, eliminating digital noise in a photo and setting up autofocus on macro objects during an auto survey.  In the latter case, you have to switch to Macro mode in order to focus on a subject located at a distance of less than 200 mm. <br><br>  The interface is very simple and does not differ from the interface in the previous MX.  Below is the entrance to the "Gallery", the release of the shutter and switch between camera and camcorder.

Frankly speaking - not a lot, but the screen here is not as big as in the Galaxy S III, HTC One X or Nokia Lumia 920. The battery is connected to the smartphone using a loop and is located behind the protective panel, if necessary it can be replaced. <br><br>  The presentation presented the following figures of battery life: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Talk at 2G - 13 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Conversation in 3G - 10 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3G web surfing - 7 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Web surfing Wi-Fi - 8 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Watching video in 1080p resolution - 6 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Listening to music - 46 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Standby time - 330 hours <br><br>  After thorough testing, I cite a little more correct data.  So: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Talk time (auto switch between 2G / 3G) - 9 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the mode of Wi-Fi-surfing - 7 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ In 3G surfing mode - 6 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the video viewing mode (720p, the maximum brightness of the screen backlight) - a little more than 5 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the music playback mode - more than 40 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ In standby mode, the phone may last for about two weeks. <br><br><h4>  <b>Music and video</b> </h4><br>  The music player interface has not changed.  Also present is an equalizer - 100 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 4 kHz and 16 kHz.  The sound quality has been seriously improved in comparison with the Meizu MX: deep bass, excellent detail, no noise at all.  By the way, in January we will prepare another subjective comparison of smartphones, in which Meizu MX, Meizu MX2, Xiaomi Mi-Two and Apple iPhone 5 will take part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd8/b07/fc3/dd8b07fc393d1ac0e8936f4a73882bbb.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73c/638/84b/73c63884bf044ff79f651f596085832e.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  The music player supports FLAC, Ape, AAC, MKA, OGG, MP3, MIDI, M4A, AMR and WAVE formats. <br><br>  Video player supports at least formats: MP4, 3GP, MOV, MKV, AVI, FLV, MPEG, M2TS and TS.  If there are no problems with AVI, MP4 and MKV in 1080p resolution, then the TS and M2TS smartphone plays with a standard player with difficulty.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to put a program for playing video, such as MX Video Player and switch the mode from ‚Äúhardware decoder‚Äù to ‚Äúsoftware decoder‚Äù.  Just in case in the ‚ÄúSpecial features‚Äù set in the column ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù - ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù - the video will go without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4d/164/e6c/f4d164e6c973b910d14e70bfe0b69dfc.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/593/f56/aa3/593f56aa3fb5216b11f11ba7560e730a.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br><h4>  <b>Innovations in Flyme 2.0</b> </h4><br>  Meizu MX2 works on Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean with branded UI Flyme 2.0.2.  Users of previous Meizu smartphones are very familiar with the shell - it is very simple and quite comfortable.  In early January, I will prepare a detailed overview of all the features of Flyme. For now, I‚Äôll only focus on the changes that appeared in version 2.0. <br><br>  Firstly, you can now launch the camera from the ‚Äúlock screen‚Äù.  To do this, activate the backlight and swipe the screen from right to left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc4/1fb/60f/dc41fb60f6d4bd542265bb88f9cc4a9e.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a98/a78/cf4/a98a78cf417a9250a745b73c8c58b94d.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  Secondly, in the "notification panel" appeared the launch icon "Settings". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c9/f95/cde/3c9f95cdede95ec4379cfac5e5d0e136.jpg"><br><br>  Thirdly, after opening a menu with previously launched applications in the new version of the shell, brightness is adjusted, and programs are closed by moving the shortcut up or down (or using the ‚Äúclose‚Äù button). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a55/599/3be/a555993beb18771fac5c432d2e429f8b.jpg"><br><br>  Fourth, in the settings of the special.  Opportunities appeared item "Halftone screen."  After switching on, the image quality deteriorates a bit, but energy consumption decreases. <br><br>  The main "trick" is to use the Smart Bar - a proprietary panel with control buttons.  In Meizu they decided to abandon the standard elements, as the developers considered them inconvenient and do not fit well with the Flyme shell.  The new panel is smaller and more functional, it takes up less space, and more controls fit on it.  In games and when watching videos of the Smart Bar, the panel simply does not appear, unlike the standard bar, which appears but is not highlighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5e/f42/532/d5ef42532b95f3f4ae567332c8b9049e.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbb/1c7/fa2/bbb1c7fa248b3ad1daac0295fa8b48d8.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca3/825/326/ca38253267eea31370f707e122f614a1.jpg" width="340" height="544"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ee/db9/a59/6eedb9a59dd4841d71ff30ad2bca8b41.jpg" width="340" height="544"><br><br>  If the application is not optimized for Smart Bar, only the Back button will be present in the interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb4/6b3/ee0/eb46b3ee068efb34bf5874e12cf9997e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  I will summarize, as a user of the new Meizu MX2 smartphone. <br><br>  <b>Positive sides:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Cool design <br>  ‚Ä¢ Robust housing with metal trim <br>  ‚Ä¢ Powerful processor <br>  ‚Ä¢ A large amount of RAM <br>  ‚Ä¢ One of the best displays <br>  ‚Ä¢ Loud and high-quality sound in headphones. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Flyme Shell <br><br>  <b>Negative sides:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is inconvenient to open the back panel <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can not switch to "pure" Android <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNoisy‚Äù camera <br><br>  If you compare Meizu MX and Meizu MX2, the work that the developers have done is clearly visible, it is not just a change in design or a change of mechanical key to a touch one.  The company, led by Jack Wong, is moving in the planned way, improving the chosen format MX - a smartphone that is ready to work after the first start-up, "out of the box."  Initially, there was a Meizu MX model in two versions (based on a dual-core platform and then based on a quad-core), now its full-fledged sequel, Meizu MX2, comes out.  In the new model, the design was changed, the screen diagonal and its resolution were increased, the runtime was optimized (MX2 really ‚Äúlives‚Äù from one charge longer than its predecessor, despite fears that everything will be the other way around) along with the transition to Samsung.  The company continues to use high-quality components, such as the Sharp New Mode 2 display, for example, a screen with moderate power consumption, which gives a cool picture.  The sound quality is improved, both in the speaker and in the headphones, and, of course, Flyme has been reworked and improved, I will write a separate detailed review about it (as well as how to get the root). <br><br><hr><br>  Now you can buy Meizu MX2 in our online store <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/shop/phones">mymeizu.ru</a> , in January, the smartphone will also go to DNS retail stores. <br>  On our forum there is a <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/forum/45-433-1">topic for helping</a> newcomers, owners of MX2, as well as <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/forum/43-258-1">a discussion thread for the model</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163971/</a></p>
