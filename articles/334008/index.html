  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FIAS is dead, long live ... long live ... yes it is not clear that for now</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, in the field of logistics and related e-commerce, a rather unattractive situation is taking shape.  On the one hand, of course, the Russian Post is to blame for everything, then <abbr title="Express delivery service">DPD</abbr> , <abbr title="Courier service">SDEK</abbr> , Yandex.Delivery, couriers taken separately and of course the State Department ‚Äî well, without him.  The problem, in my opinion, is of a more fundamental nature, having a peak path with Hochmas along the way.  How to write the address correctly?  Where to get the zip code and who goes where.  Where does the Mail deliver, where do DPD and CDEC get on dogs?  And here let's understand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main problem is called: ‚ÄúAnd the devil knows what country we live in‚Äù.  On the one hand, we have not noticed in December 2014, after the adoption of the Governmental Decree, a fundamental change was made due to the fact that now the official postal (does not allow the language to call this address) facility is the Municipal Address.  His motorcade is insane, both in its tautology and in its confusion, erasing the boundaries of understanding villages and villages.  The reason is simple: the FTS decided that, in the absence of a law on postal address and administrative division, let us use the municipal principle.  Of course, up to this point it was possible to understand them.  Well, what a difference to them - well, they do not have the task of geographical, administrative, postal, and so on division.  Pure internal request.  And that would be so until they entered it into the rank of a postal address by decree. <br><br>  This is on the one hand.  On the other hand, business practice has already taken shape, again, it is objectively understandable why <abbr title="RF Address Classifier">KLADR was</abbr> used as a reference guide, and the Post of the Russian Federation did not have its own reference guide.  In general, all hooked under the only departmental directory - KLADR.  And while this corresponded to the state of things in the understanding of an ordinary person who lives in the Moscow region, the city of Troitsk.  And God bless him, that the Federal Tax Service did not have time to track the migration of post offices.  An error of 5 percent is quite a pardon for the useful business that the FTS has voluntarily assumed.  Well, she added a new <abbr title="Federal Information Address System">FIAS</abbr> format, continuing to carry on parallel with KLADR.  The Post of the Russian Federation at this time was preparing its <abbr title="Central mail address data repository">CHDPA</abbr> and the population expected that the Post would be published sooner or later.  Well, there was still hope that Rosreestr will give birth.  But there, too, does not care about the needs of workers.  For there is nothing to use third-party experts, the money itself is not enough.  In general, the base so reduce and can not yet.  They waited to blow it again. <br><br>  For all attempts on our part to unite the efforts of independent logistics companies and create an independent directory, for example, under the auspices of <abbr title="National Association of Distance Commerce">NADT</abbr> , it was not crowned with success.  Money was a pity to everyone, for their money, and the address base would be common.

      But ... everything went wrong, "maybe" and the situation has changed dramatically.  The Federal Tax Service transferred the management of KLADR / FIAS to the subsidiary organization ‚ÄúTax-service‚Äù.  In the same place, everyone was brought to complete absurdity.  Killed positionality, replacing the hierarchy.  They abandoned the administrative division, as a result of which Lenin Avenue in Moscow turned from a single object into a heap of segments in which it is impossible to understand it in Moscow or already the city of the satellite, and whether it generally connects with each other.  Completely lost history of changes and much more. <br><br>  And then all sorts of ideas like words3word, using geo-coordinates directly, etc. began to arise.  It would seem the 21st century in the yard.  What is the problem?  But she is.  And there are a lot of them: <br><br>  1. How to retrain all people to write coordinate words, just coordinates?  addresses not all remember? <br><br>  2. What is considered a benchmark?  Is it possible to use unreliable data collected by projects like OSM or Yandex?  Which, by the way, has recently involuntarily changed the address landscape.  It can be seen by some programmer in Yandex that it was not cool to use fractions and he plotted 21_2 on cards instead of house 21/2.  And the valiant municipal authorities announced a tender for printing plates on houses.  Where did the valiant contractors get the data?  Of course, not from Rosreestr, but from Yandex maps.  The introduction of the regulation returns this project from the free state to the sovereign - they are all in the starting point. <br><br>  3. How to deal with legally and financially significant correspondence?  How to guarantee its delivery by questionable standards or coordinates? <br><br>  4. To what accuracy to bring the coordinates and how to understand that the point is reached?  To what number after the comma should I specify the coordinates?  How long should a postman walk with a GPS navigator as a fighter? <br><br>  5. Any of those.  The process at the Post of the Russian Federation or at any logistics company should be based on the possibility of the absence of a computer-Internet on any site.  Therefore, the address must be intuitive.  This, by the way, is one of the claims to FIAS. <br><br>  6. What to do with new buildings, which in half of the cases border on an unauthorized building like high-rise buildings in the suburban areas numbered as section 1 entrance 2 floor 3. Although in reality these are 2 multi-storey buildings on a plot of 30 acres?  Well, not to mention the real squatter in the southern borders of our country? <br><br>  There are not very many exits. <br>  First, it is not necessary to wait for the return of consciousness from the FTS.  If only because it is an internal departmental development, albeit derived from a government decree into a common headache.  The analysis of this resolution is a separate topic of the article.  For example, do many people know that it allows addressing in national languages, introduces absurd types such as "construction", allows letters in the Latin alphabet (how to distinguish P and R?), Etc. <br><br>  Second, with the hope of waiting for the Mail to publish the CCPV.  Here is just a question: does she need it?  Loan to support competitors?  In this case - I would have thought at the place of the RF Post.  All that remains is someone like Jandek who receives a ‚Äúlabel‚Äù from the state and becomes something like an ‚Äúauthorized agent‚Äù with a federal budget.  But again, no one has canceled the regulations, but who will do them ....?  And will not the house again appear with an underscore?  And besides, it must be understood that addresses are not only places on the map, having coordinates, floors, apartments, but elements of social communication, verbal exchange!  information, parts of business and trade.  This is the cultural layer in the end ... <br><br>  In the meantime, download the next version of FIAS and ... do not install it.  We write parsers to the postal site in the hope of pumping out at least some updates of zip codes from there.  And, yes, our copter is all - delivery to the coordinates, in the hope that it will not fly into the next window from the nursery or a circle of young technicians on the first floor of a package with whiskey or something else more interesting.  And the children, the children know how to catch it and open it ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334008/</a></p>
