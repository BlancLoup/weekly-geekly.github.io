  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile WiMAX in Russia - November results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, habrah citizens.  I continue to publish my monthly dedicated to the promotion of mobile WiMAX services in Russia, using the example of two small towns in its European part. Those who follow the news in half a eye, but are interested with all my heart, I dedicate this post. <br><br>  For convenience, a very brief summary of the previous series: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/41321/">0. Start</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/WiMAX/43960/">1. Results of October</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>November 1 - modems in retail Peter</b> <br>  November.  The month is turbid in all respects, it seems to be still autumn, and it seems that the new year is coming soon.  But just on November 1 (I ended up with this epic about October) - The company threw out at retail of the Northern Capital white wimax Samsung SWC-u200 modems that were issued for the network test under the Yota Champion program.  I can‚Äôt forget the association: Yota Champignon, especially if you know what informational testers are holding in the dark.  The essence remains the same - the modem costs 4.5k, and access to the network is free until March 31, 2009 (April 1 - the beginning of commercial operation).

      <b>November 11 - Russian Technologies Believe in Scartel Success</b> <br>  News resources spread around the news: ‚ÄúThe state corporation Russian Technologies has exercised an option to purchase 25.1% of shares of WiMAX Holding Ltd‚Äù, which in turn owns Scartel (the Company), whose Yota brand is the subject of this conversation.  Moral, which led the public and voiced, can be briefly described in one phrase: "now everything will be fine with them." <br><br>  <b>November 12 - HTC MAX 4G Presentation</b> <br>  That Wednesday, at the same time in Moscow time and St. Petersburg, the very same presentation of the new communicator from HTC, which was created by order of Yota, took place.  His name, which, in theory, at the time of the presentation should be on everyone‚Äôs lips, was first announced to the public only in the invitation list 4 days before, and the evil hooligans <a href="http://max4g.ru/">did not fail to take advantage of it</a> .  All October we called him Quartz, but in vain.  Now his name is Max. <br>  The main technical feature of the device is the ability to work in the WiMAX network Yota.  The main ideological is the branded services that make up the soft-stuffing: TV, Video, Music, Contacts, in a word - Y. services.  All this innovative confusion turns HTC MAX 4G into an access key to Network resources (including media content), but only if there is a good signal that is still fragmented.  Its cost is 28,900 rubles. <br><br><img src="http://www.yotatester.ru/img/preza2.jpg" alt="htc max 4g presentation"><br><br>  About the presentation and the device itself is already written decently ( <a href="http://www.yotatester.ru/prezentaciya-htc-max-4g-press-konferenciya-sverdlova-syurpriz/">I summarized in a blog</a> , on <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/articles/yota-htc-max.shtml">mobile-review</a> , on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/44473/">Habr√© a</a> bit, etc.), I will not repeat, because in the near future there will be even more information - the device is already in retail.  From the presentation I conducted a direct unofficial video broadcast for YotaTester.ru (again via Yota). <br><br>  Yes, an important aspect is the tariffs.  Again, only from April 1 there will be 3 (three!) Tariffs: 900 rubles / month (mini), 1,400 rubles per month (special tariff for HTC MAX) and daily (100 rubles per day).  Read more about the tariffs <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/services/tariffs/">on the</a> Company's <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/services/tariffs/">website</a> . <br><br>  <b>November 27 - First Forum Meeting</b> <br>  On November 27, I organized the first meeting of the most ideological of Yota testers and participants of the wireless networks market.  At first I managed to plan an excellent program for the guests: I got a box with Max in order to let me know what kind of a 30k-beast I was, I invited several official representatives of the Company (from St. Petersburg) to answer a million questions, including mine.  There was a guest from Svyaznoy, and good guys who write video chat software (including mobile).  The meeting was very fruitful and inspiring. <br><br>  <b>November 28 - the beginning of sales of USB WiMAX modems in Moscow.</b> <br>  On this day, started selling modems Samsung SWC-u200 in the capital.  The cost of 4500 rubles, the network is free until March 31, 2009. The same layout, the same "pies".  What is the buying activity - I do not know.  The start of sales of modems was quiet, because Max made all the noise, whose availability on pre-orders started on the same day (2 days before the official date of the Company).  All Muscovites who wanted to join the Idea in advance - have long ordered modems from St. Petersburg.  Maybe in the comments there are representatives of retailers, then share the info, how do modems disperse? <br><br>  <b>November 30 - HTC MAX 4G on sale officially.</b> <br>  Well, and on the 30th, on the last day of autumn, Max went on to retail.  In small quantities, at a price of 28,900 rubles.  On the same day, as they say in the Company, the Y. services started: work: TV, Music, Yap-Yap, which are available only to Max owners, and at this moment in Y. service - Yap-yap is already 31 users.  I know firsthand that all services were brought to mind in a frenzied rush, and this may be why the topic ‚Äú <a href="http://forum.yotatester.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D119">HTC MAX 4g - problems and solutions</a> ‚Äù in 48 hours has grown to the size of a separate subforum.  In any case, since Max is in retail, it means there is in the media, and if there is in the media, then wait for mass <s>executions ...</s> reviews, detailed and professional. <br><br><img src="http://www.yotatester.ru/img/bear_max.jpg" width="425" alt="htc max 4g"><br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br>  The amount of information on the topic is increasing at such a pace that you can already choose what to be interested in specifically: only devices, or signal encryption, tuning devices, or solving software problems, and so on.  Last month, the company was able to invite an official representative (just one!) To the company in order to create a <a href="http://forum.yotatester.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D62">special topic</a> and receive intelligible, and most importantly final answers to questions. <br>  So, the absolute majority of November issues are coverage of the Network: coverage inside buildings, coverage outside, lack of coverage in certain areas of the capitals as a whole, and a big-big wish for the Company to develop into area (s), since in the area Yota is a clear death local monopolies. <br>  But alas, this is not a question of this month, and, what is more, of the remaining stub from 2008.  This is all the future.  At the end of November we have: the emergence of the first devices in retail, raw, but working Y. services for HTC MAX 4G and a planned, but not aggressive development of the Network.  Do not wait until the end of the year for the promised absolute coverage within the Garden (Moscow time), but Yota is a long-term project, so sooner or later you and we too will ‚Äúbe fine‚Äù (c). <br><br>  Good luck in December. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45945/</a></p>
