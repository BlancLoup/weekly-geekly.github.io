  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sellers we trust</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yagoodza/blog/53168/">first post</a> about <a href="http://www.yagoodza.ru/">Yagudzu</a> there were questions: why and for whom am I doing this project?  And, actually, why?  :) <br><br>  I really want to answer this question in as much detail as possible, but at the same time it is simple and clear, without resorting to the help of far-fetched and complex terminology.  Having a lot of experience in online marketing, the last thing I want to do is speak the lifeless language of marketers.  I had the opportunity to be convinced of the viciousness of this practice, a vivid illustration of which is the current deplorable situation of large online stores that have invested in advertising and speeding up, and not in long-term relationships with customers. <br><br>  But, before answering the question, I want to talk about such a phenomenon as social commerce.  It is in his direction that Yaguza moves. <a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      For the unusual term for our ears lies the correct and simple idea.  Social commerce is a responsible and open business.  To achieve this is not so easy.  Here it is important to treat customers not as a mass that buys and consumes, but as equals.  After all, we, consumers, are able to provide invaluable assistance to sellers: point out the shortcomings, assist in building honest relationships and business.  We are able to act as partners at the level of ideas and advice. <br><br>  That is why I connect to the Yaguza project only those stores that meet the criteria of a responsible seller interested in a client: they actively communicate with customers, show interest (as opposed to the principle ‚Äúnot you, so different‚Äù).  They are modern and flexible.  They use social networks: blogs, flickr, facebook, VKontakte, LJ - they answer questions and respond to reviews.  They are not indifferent to their business and their client. <br><br>  There are already projects in the world that allow their customers to take part in improving their business: <a href="http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaHome">starbucks</a> , <a href="http://www.ideastorm.com/">dell</a> ... <br>  Similarly, you can optimize and online shopping.  It is only necessary to show the users that it is worth communicating openly with virtual sellers, instead of diverging on opposite sides of the barricades.  These projects show us: the people of the new formation are happy to have the opportunity to interact with the business, they are interested in openly demonstrating their attitude and advising something useful in their opinion.  A business should move away from SEO-spamming-jinzo-blogging promotion in the direction of an open conversation, because its goal is not just to sell more expensive but more, but to attract loyal customers.  And they, as everyone knows, are the best :) That's why we organized a platform on Yagudz, where users and shops can conduct an open dialogue and help each other become better! <br><br>  People constantly share experiences and opinions in blogs, forums, communities;  but this information is scattered and randomly scattered around the internet.  All these questions, answers, tips, etc.  they are used only so that consumers can share information with themselves and tell where they are well served, and where is bad, where is good, and where is bad.  Business is not involved in the dialogue, its participation is not something that is not encouraged, but even forbidden: ‚Äúaha, purchased reviews and advertising!‚Äù ... And we allow you to invite a potential buyer for a frank conversation, to sort out the problems together and find a solution. <br><br>  And, finally, a little about the term itself, so that there are no discrepancies.  Social commerce is a phenomenon that implies a clear goal: to make buyers and sellers partners or even friends.  It includes social shopping, a social network, and social media.  You can, of course, argue about the loyalty of such an interpretation, but it is much more constructive, it seems to me, to just think about it, understand it - and take part in improving the world around. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56638/</a></p>
