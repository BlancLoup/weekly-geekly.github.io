  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Orbital Service (continued)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the first article I outlined the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a direction in the rocket and space industry.  Now I wanted to describe in more detail the possibilities of the space transport module, its characteristics and the economic benefits of this project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Transportation of spacecraft (SC) from low circular orbits to the working orbit.</b> <br><br>  The Universal Transport Space Module (hereinafter ‚ÄúUTKM‚Äù) can transport the spacecraft to the working orbit (to the point of standing in the geostationary orbit) after the spacecraft is placed in a low circular orbit by a launch vehicle.  To carry out the transportation, "UTKM" moves closer to the spacecraft in orbit and captures it with a manipulator.  Capturing the UTKM satellite includes a plasma propulsion system and transports the spacecraft to a working orbit.  The use of "UTKM", equipped with a plasma propulsion system allows to increase the energy characteristics of existing launch vehicles in terms of the output of heavier spacecraft.

      <b>2. The rise of the operating spacecraft into the working orbit while the spacecraft orbit is reduced during operation.</b> <br><br>  To do this, "UTKM" moves closer to the spacecraft in orbit, seizes the spacecraft with a manipulator, and then, turning on the plasma propulsion system, will lift the spacecraft into its working orbit.  Thus, ‚ÄúUTKM‚Äù allows extending the service life of spacecraft operating in orbit, due to the spacecraft saving of the onboard supply of fuel components and greater use of it to correct the spacecraft position. <br><br>  <b>3. Correction of the position of the operating spacecraft in orbit, in which the onboard supply of the working fluid</b> used to correct the position of the spacecraft <b>is fully used</b> . <br><br>  "UTKM" allows you to extend the service life of spacecraft operating in orbit.  Currently, up to 50 pieces are in orbit.  telecommunication satellites with operating equipment, but not capable of supporting orientation "to the Earth" due to the lack of fuel components for correction engines.  ‚ÄúUTKM‚Äù, flying up to the spacecraft, can lift it into the working orbit and, using the manipulator, perform the necessary correction of the position of the spacecraft ‚Äúto the Earth‚Äù by adding its service life. <br><br>  <b>4. Maintenance of operating spacecraft in orbit.</b> <br><br>  "UTKM" allows: <br>  - to inspect the spacecraft using the cameras installed on it and provide information on the status of the spacecraft to the owner; <br>  - carry out refueling of the spacecraft with fuel components and compressed gases (if the spacecraft has the appropriate interfaces); <br>  - to carry out simple repair operations (for example, using a manipulator, reveal the failed solar panel of the SV, etc.). <br><br>  <b>5. Cleaning the geostationary orbit from non-functioning spacecraft.</b> <br><br>  The ‚ÄúUTKM‚Äù can get closer to the non-functioning spacecraft, capture it with a manipulator, tell it the necessary acceleration for the spacecraft to descend from orbit and burn in the dense layers of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.  Given the high cost of the standing point in geostationary orbit (120-140 mln. US dollars) and their limited number, this feature of the UTKM is of great importance both for launching new satellites and for commercial efficiency of using UTKM in orbit.  It is important to note that when working with a non-functioning spacecraft, there is no need to observe all safety measures, as with an existing spacecraft. <br><br>  <b>6. Using "UTKM" as a booster.</b> <br><br>  The output of "UTKM" is carried out with the help of a launch vehicle, according to a combined scheme, according to which "UTKM" performs the role of an upper stage with a payload installed on it.  After launch by the launch vehicle into a circular orbit, UTKM, using gas-jet and plasma propulsion systems, delivers the payload to the working orbit and is separated from it.  From the moment of separation of the payload, its functions of the upper stage change to the functions of the ‚ÄúUTKM‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>7. The use of "UTKM" as a propulsion unit for the transport of cargo on interplanetary trajectories.</b> <br><br>  <b>8. Using "UTKM" to solve other problems.</b> <br><br>  The layout scheme of "UTKM" makes it a universal platform on which you can install civilian, scientific and military equipment, depending on the interests of the Customer. <br><br>  To maintain the functioning of "UTKM" in orbit for a long period of time, the design of "UTKM" can be used to refuel the components of the fuel and compressed gas.  For this purpose, a light class rocket displays a container containing a reserve of components of fuel and compressed gas into a circular orbit.  After that, "UTKM" with one manipulator captures the container, and with the help of the other, connects the corresponding filling interfaces with the container.  After refueling, "UTKM" undocked and will continue to work in orbit.  During the last refueling, when the fuel components and compressed gas are completely withdrawn from the container, when disconnected from the container, UTKM informs the container the necessary acceleration for de-orbiting and burning in dense layers of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, thus excluding the appearance of a new space debris object.  Similarly, "UTKM" can take the components of the fuel and compressed gas from the container and for refueling the spacecraft in orbit if the spacecraft has corresponding interfaces. <br><br>  As a working fluid, the Plasma Ion Motor design allows the use of: <br>  - inert gases: Ar, Kr, Xe; <br>  - alkali metals supplied to the engine in the molten state: Cs, K, Na; <br>  2. Weight PID-200 with bracket 8.1 kg. <br>  3. Service life: at least 10,000 hours. <br>  4. Maximum tractive effort 0,0125 kgf. <br><br>  The table shows the experimental characteristics of the engine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c52/8a2/b2e/c528a2b2e1b049698dc3a4cb239b7042.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, it is not much different from existing developments, but it has an excellent advantage in working in airless space. <br><br>  And I want to pay a little attention to the economic feasibility of this project, I want to give an example of a few tables, with the number of satellites in orbit and the cost of orbital services that the transport module can perform.  The data were taken from the scientific work of one of my friends, so that they are not quite accurate, but they can provide an overall picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/c75/ad8/e4dc75ad83cc45f9a144150550c8d927.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/561/1b9/470/5611b9470fbf4ceda7cdce877f857f8b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I apologize in advance if something is crookedly inserted, since this is only my second post. <br><br>  As you can see, the volume of the market is simply enormous, $ 2 billion (even if this is a very optimistic figure) is impressive.  And I want to say that if we want to further develop the space industry, use the near-earth space correctly, then we should seriously think about creating such projects. <br><br>  Unfortunately, such projects cost huge amounts of money and require huge investments, which is problematic in the current economic situation.  These studies were conducted by a group of my friends and myself, including, purely on my own initiative.  Many space agencies are working on such projects and they are also failing to reach acceptable economic profitability. <br><br>  In any case, I believe that in the future, people will be more involved in space and universe exploration than internal disassembly and inter-congregation.  After all, in my opinion, there is nothing more attractive and mysterious than the mysteries of the universe. <br><br>  Have a nice day, everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362441/</a></p>
