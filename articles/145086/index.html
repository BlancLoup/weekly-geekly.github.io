Too lazy to look for an ATM to repay a friend?  Is there a product or service for which you want to receive payment by cards, but do not want to buy a special POS-terminal and enter into an agreement with an acquirer for any reason?  If at least one question you answered "yes", then you definitely should be interested. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/492/8fb/71c/4928fb71c3fefc01fe3909fccd4fc23a.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  In order to answer the above questions, you can order a mobile terminal for accepting payments made by PrivatBank.  Website: <a href="https://pos.liqpay.com/">https://pos.liqpay.com/</a> , payments are working on the technologies of their liqpay payment system. <br><br>  It has long been heard from friends in Ukraine that PrivatBank is there ahead of all in technology and all kinds of it-features like convenient mobile Internet banking.  Their mobile payment terminal is a bank card swiper that connects to iOS or Android through the headphone jack of smartphones.  Then with the help of the application iPay, which can be installed from the market, you can use the device.

Personally, I constantly do not have enough cash for such needs.  Well, enough of dreams, let's see what this mobile terminal can do. <br><br><h4>  Application functionality </h4><br>  A mobile terminal can: <br><ul><li>  accept payments on the card </li><li>  accept payments to the liqpay payment system account </li><li>  accept payments to jur account  faces </li><li>  view payment history </li><li>  transfer money from one card to another </li></ul><br>  Software for a svayper rather convenient, realizes all functions, both on iOS and on Android'e.  After payment, you can enter the paid e-mail and ask to put a signature on the screen with your finger, after which payment details with a signature picture will be sent to this address. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd1/a56/dee/fd1a56dee5e858a33310731aac879c15.png" alt="iOS menu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/746/fcd/171/746fcd171ab20c01327915df74edfe3c.png" alt="iOS signature"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f0/3c2/53e/2f03c253e4b0aee21de18230124f6ae4.png" alt="Android menu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b05/2c2/b69/b052c2b69160a3871d6f58b1d12203a9.png" alt="card read android"><br><br>  The svayper itself works well, I considered all my cards without problems, it is only necessary, as the application suggests, to ‚Äúconfidently carry out the card‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Tariffs </h4><br>  For payments, they charge a transaction fee. <br>  When paying by card: 2.7%.  When transferring money from card to card: 1.95USD + 1.00%. <br><br>  Frankly speaking, tariffs are not the lowest, but when targeting small payments, the cost of goods and services should not increase significantly. <br><br><h4>  liqpay </h4><br>  I liked the registration in the payment system.  All you need is a mobile phone number, they become attached to it.  Then enter the one-time password received from SMS to enter. <br><br>  I must say that as a payment system for the Russian Federation, they seemed weak.  Frankly few features and counterparties to pay for goods and services.  They seem to have a clean and clear website, but at the same time there are a number of small blunders in usability that are depressing (a pop-up list with a large number of values, but at the same time opening only 5 points, buy text for 85 rubles and other trifles). <br><br>  And I want to say something about software separately, it just has to be convenient today, otherwise the service provider will quickly lose the market.  Even my main Internet banking in Raiffeisen started to disappoint: they don‚Äôt have mobile applications, only a mobile portal, in order to pay for something, you need to launch some awful java applet and send him the key, which is impossible with smartphones.  And I have not yet spoken about such usability giants as Sberbank, VTB24 or the Baltic Bank in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Now, when each payment system seeks to become a bank, and every second bank to become a payment system, these systems are integrated and soon, companies that have not offered their users high-quality service (convenient Internet banking, mobile applications, at least inconvenience due to security) will lose customer service. the base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/e30/5b9/65be305b9705e66549b664780941c1d0.jpg" alt="mobile terminal"><br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Who used the terminal more actively - add, specify. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145086/</a></p>
