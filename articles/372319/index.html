      The venture fund Y Combinator is going to conduct a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271042/">large, long-term and large-scale study of the</a> impact of AML on society.  This five-year study will certainly confirm or refute the ideas and results obtained in other countries, on increasing the happiness and financial well-being of citizens receiving AML, increasing labor productivity, reducing the bureaucracy, reducing poverty and crime, reducing healthcare costs, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator Foundation, has always adhered to a model similar to AML in financing startups: in exchange for a 7% stake, a start-up gets money without conditions and can dispose of it as he pleases.  As the experience of Reddit, Dropbox, Airbnb and hundreds of other companies has shown, this model really works.  People do not give up work at all, do not lie on the couch and do not spend on drink their money.  Quite the contrary, having received financial guarantees, getting rid of obligations and the need to work in the office on a schedule from 9:00 to 18:00, almost everyone starts working <b>even more</b> than before.  And more importantly - more efficiently than from a stick. <br><br>  Y Combinator announced plans to conduct a large-scale experiment <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271042/">in January 2016</a> .  Sam Altman expressed confidence that behind this scheme is the future, especially against the background of the disappearance of traditional jobs due to technological progress, the spread of robots and artificial intelligence. <br><br>  Before the large-scale American experiment, Y Combinator decided to conduct a short-term pilot study, and yesterday he decided on the city where it would be: <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/moving-forward-on-basic-income">Oakland</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae5/71d/058/ae571d0586bc4747a07a0b2f52b02531.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4_(%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Auckland</a> is a city located in Alameda County (California, USA) with a population of 390,724 according to the 2010 census statistics.  It is the third most populated city in the San Francisco Bay Area after San Jose and San Francisco. <br><br>  34.5% of the population are whites, 28% are African Americans, 16.8% are Asians.  The crime rate in some areas is very high.  According to the FBI, in 2005, Oakland ranked first in homicide rates in California and tenth in the United States among cities with a population of more than 250,000.  Although in other areas, wealthy Americans live in peace: the regions are constantly patrolled and there is little crime <br><br>  ‚ÄúAuckland is a city of great social and economic diversity,‚Äù admits Sam Altman, ‚Äúhere is where wealth is concentrated, and there is considerable inequality.  We think that these traits make it a good place to explore how unconditional basic income will work in our pilot project. ‚Äù <br><br>  During the project, important information will be collected for a large-scale study: the procedure for payment of AML is defined, procedures and methods for collecting and analyzing data are developed, methods of random sampling of the population for distribution of AML, etc. are established. <br><br>  Y Combinator initially announced a competition for the post of the head of a research project: ‚ÄúWe received more than 1,000 resumes for this position, including from full-time professors at Oxford, Columbia University and Harvard,‚Äù writes Sam Altman.  As a result, Elizabeth Rhodes, Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, who had previously led a similar project to provide health and education in the slums of Nairobi, was chosen as the AML research manager. <br><br>  Participants in the pilot project in Auckland will receive an AML payment without any conditions.  They will be able to manage the money and their time at their discretion: continue to work further or quit, engage in self-education, go as volunteers, move to another country - whatever.  "Unconditional basic income promotes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfreedom, and we want to see how people manage this freedom." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ce/46b/3e3/9ce46b3e3d264f9f8463c4a3707ef46a.jpg"><br>  <i><sup>Auckland residents</sup></i> <br><br>  If the pilot project is successful, a large-scale large-scale study will begin.  If not, Y Combinator is going to explore other approaches to paying an AML. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe unconditional basic income (BOD) as a radical form of social dividends was formulated by Thomas Payne as early as 1795, she was remembered at the end of the 20th century, but she became really popular about a year ago.  Recently, several countries have announced experiments with the AML.  In a few days, Switzerland <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270200/">will hold a referendum</a> on unconditional basic income.  Experiments with social dividends in 2016-2017 are planned by the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/252952/">Netherlands</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265764/">Finland</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272558/">Canada</a> .  Soon, <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/77710601/Labour-leader-Andrew-Little-promises-debate-on-universal-basic-income">New Zealand</a> and the <a href="http://blog.ycombinator.com/basic-income">USA</a> may follow their example. <br><br>  Unfortunately, some countries of the world categorically do not accept the humanitarian idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAML, but introduce the opposite idea - a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275698/">tax for the unemployed</a> .  For example, in Belarus, the unemployed have already begun to pay $ 250 per year to the treasury.  The experience of the neighboring country is studied by the Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  But if you make long-term plans, then the AML seems like a viable idea: ‚ÄúOne of the reasons why it works, in our opinion, is that technological progress should lead to an abundance of resources,‚Äù writes Sam Altman.  ‚ÄúAlthough unconditional basic income today seems to be financially difficult to implement, in a world where technology replaces people in the workplace and AML becomes necessary, technological progress and an abundance of resources will drastically reduce the cost of living.‚Äù <br><br>  Y Combinator believes that people will continue to work anyway, but now they will be able to devote time to projects that they are really interested in.  There they will apply their strength more effectively. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="737688607964549121"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  The next few months, Y Combinator will spend on the study of the details of the project.  Already established dialogue with the municipal authorities of Auckland and representatives of local communities to develop the most optimal way to distribute AML. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372319/</a></p>
