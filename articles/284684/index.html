This situation is interesting in that the resource is engaged in the fight against violations of the law by the traffic police (DPS).  The records of conflict situations with obvious violations by law enforcement agencies were laid out, activists participated in the courts, helping people fight illegal behavior of people in shoulder straps.  Activists traveled around the country and interfered in situations where traffic policemen violated laws, etc. <br><br>  In fact, they are very good bone in the throat of organs, their stories are often on TV and officials are then forced to justify themselves to the camera.  Ordinary employees, too, because of them, often fell into fines, because they spread information on how the law enforcement officers can be brought to the law in case of violations on their part.

      In general, closed objectionable resource.  The registrar is the same as that of ex.ua, but this, in principle, may be due to the fact that it is the most popular in Ukraine. <br><br>  <b>In this case, this is not a fight for copyright or the fight against porn, not even a response to an insult to the president, but pure censorship.</b> <br><br>  It is possible that the guys will succeed against this background to inflate the scandal around themselves and they will return the domain and will not risk further contact.  I would very much like to help them in this, because this may be the beginning of the end of the freedom of speech in the toilet.  Such sites, of course, can easily be hosted in another country, but they will close those who cannot (or have to keep the editorial staff in Ukraine). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What resource does, can be seen on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3D%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%26oq%3D%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%26aq%3Df%26aqi%3Dg1%26aql%3D%26gs_sm%3D3%26gs_upl%3D17193l21329l0l21568l24l21l2l8l8l2l210l1601l1.9.1l11l0">youtube</a> .  There are no documents and instructions there, however, but you can get an idea. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> (according to ain.ua information) On January 16, 2011, a <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache:svkiLT39m80J:roadcontrol.org.ua/forum/viewtopic.php%253Ff%253D69%2526t%253D4970%2B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%2B%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582%26cd%3D2%26hl%3Den%26ct%3Dclnk%26gl%3Dua%26client%3Dopera">video clip was posted</a> on the ‚ÄúDK‚Äù forum demonstrating a squabble with a traffic police inspector, during which the traffic police officer said in the 7th minute: ‚ÄúWhat are you telling me about the rules? , do not read your "Road Control", it will soon be closed, I promise you. " <br><br>  <b>upd2:</b> The essence of civil affairs and the details here: <a href="http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2012/02/14/6958738/">www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2012/02/14/6958738</a> , the site promises to restore by the evening, transferring to another hosting. <br><br>  <b>upd3:</b> from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Powerslave/">Powerslave</a> <br>  In the summer, during the road control raid, Getmantsev (control major of the special unit of the State Traffic Inspectorate), sticking to the DK (road control) activists, forbade them to go to the toilet at a post near Alushta.  There was a verbal skirmish, the result of which was a video clip provided with a song about ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù with non-regulatory vocabulary. <br><br>  Getmantsev cooked up a lawsuit on the protection of honor and dignity in which he asked to ban him from writing on the site and remove the article from publication.  As a result, they have been judging for about half a year. <br><br>  The whole point is that the official can not forbid himself to criticize under the laws of Ukraine.  A road control - officially registered by the media.  In addition, the leadership of the traffic police on this conflict in the summer gave Getmantsev offensive scolding, as he was wrong. <br><br>  As a result, the 10th day is not clear for what reason the court issued an order to cover the site until the circumstances were clarified. <br><br>  <b>upd4:</b> Movie replaced by the official appeal: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFxtnnMtRY8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgSXzVihMPvXcF2kVV5kgAWRE1VYA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284684/</a></p>
