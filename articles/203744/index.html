A new study of our partners refutes at once all idle speculation: over the past six months, there have been more positive emotions in runet!  Location messages about love and hate in the regions of Russia under the cut. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fa/11d/698/5fa11d698e5cde53c4541e64fa01745c.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the period from October 17 to November 13, 2013, the second measurement of the ratio of positive and negative emotions in public messages of Russian social media users was conducted.  As in the June study, <b>Russian-language references to “love” and “hatred” from the first person were analyzed</b> : positive emotions (for example, “I love”, “I love”, etc.) and negative (“I hate”, “annoys me "And so on.).  To determine the messages that meet the above criteria, more than 300 million messages from 25 million authors from popular social networks were analyzed: VKontakte, Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal, etc. <br><br>  During the study period, emotions that can be described as <b>“love” or “hate” were cumulatively mentioned about 3.5 million times</b> .  Compared with the June survey, the overall ratio of positive and negative emotions in Russia has changed towards an increase in the share of positive: <b>77% of messages with a positive message (72% in June) and 23% with a negative attitude (28% in June).</b>

      As in the first study, the “Index of Love” * was calculated for each subject of the Russian Federation, thanks to which it is possible to single out the points of the greatest positive and negative.  According to the results of two measurements, all regions of Russia have positive indices greater than 1 (more positive messages than negative ones). <br><br>  The main difference in the results of the two measurements is the expansion of the range of values ​​of the Index of Love.  According to the results of the first study, the index fluctuated within the interval from 1.6 to 4.1.  To date, <b>5 regions have exceeded the maximum of the first study: the Republic of Karelia (index 4.7), the Republic of Altai (4.3), the Jewish Autonomous Region (4.3), the Kurgan Region (4.2), the Republic of Kalmykia (4.2 ).</b> <br><br><h4>  Leading regions based on two studies: </h4><br>  The undisputed leader of the November rating was the <b>Republic of Karelia (4.7)</b> , which rose in the rating by 2 positions - from third place in June. <br>  <b>The Republic of Altai</b> , which was the leader in the June survey with the index of 4.1, turned out to be on the second line of the rating in November, despite the increase in the index in the region to <b>4.3.</b> <br>  Places from the third to the fifth ranked regions that have not previously entered the top-5.  At the same time, the <b>Jewish Autonomous</b> Region rose to 3rd place from 77th, having increased the index almost 2 times - from 2.2 to <b>4.3.</b>  <b>Kurgan region and the Republic of Kalmykia</b> raised the index from 3 to <b>4.2</b> points, and took 4-5 place, whereas in June they were on the 20th line of the rating. <br><br><h4>  Regions with the lowest “Love Index”: </h4><br>  The maximum of negatives this time was recorded in <b>the Komi Republic (2.2)</b> and <b>Ingushetia (2.0)</b> , which speaks of a general positive attitude, but with a high percentage of messages with negative emotions in comparison with other subjects of the federation. <br>  According to the June survey, the “Love Index” was higher in both of these regions: the Komi Republic ranked 18th in the ranking with an index of 3.0, and Ingushetia - in 34th place, with an index of 2.8. <br>  A significant increase in reports of hatred in the Republic of Ingushetia was provoked by the information “A minute of silence was booed up in Nazran”, which is denied by residents of the Republic: <br>  “The impudent and cynical lie [...] The video was first cut off in a curious way - in order to cut out everything that existed before and start with the announcement of a minute of silence and whistle.  People at that podium did not even know that a minute of silence was announced.  I do not condone anyone.  I just do not like lies.  All the more so cynical. ” <br><br>  <b>The Chechen Republic, the Republic of Sakha, the Republic of Dagestan and the Saratov region have</b> significantly increased the share of positive messages, compared with June data, and have an <b>index of more than 2.6</b> , but still belong to the group of regions with the lowest “Love Index”, occupying the short lines ranking - from 77th to 81st place. <br><br>  It should be noted that the Nenets Autonomous District, which according to the results of the June study had the lowest index (1.6), moved to the 50th place in the rating, having increased the index to 3.3, that is, more than twice. <br><br>  Thus, in Russia as a whole, the range of values ​​of the index has expanded towards an increase in the “positive” maximum, simultaneously with an increase in the minimum value, which may indicate an improvement in the emotional climate in the country's regions. <br><br>  <i>* The index is calculated as the ratio of the number of messages of love to the number of messages of hate.</i> <br><br>  You can get acquainted with the full version of the study and the interactive map “Love Index” in all regions of Russia <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D979">on the Brand Analytics blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203744/</a></p>
