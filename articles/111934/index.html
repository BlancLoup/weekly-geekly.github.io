I read it myself and wanted to share the translation with others, but I was going to make the translation for several years.  Now it became interesting for me to publish it also from a historical point of view - 4 years have passed, and it is curious to see the relevance of the skills that were thought of then, as well as to get the opinions of readers.  Interesting?  Then keep reading. <br><br><h2>  Long-lived computer skills </h2><br>  <b>Main idea:</b> Schools should teach a deep, strategic understanding of a computer that you cannot learn by reading manuals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, I saw a textbook used for learning to work on a computer in the third grade.  One of the chapters (‚ÄúBig Calculator‚Äù) was provided with detailed instructions for formatting tables with numbers in Excel.  Everything would be fine, but only in the new version of Excel the interface was drastically changed, and the traditional command menus were replaced with a ribbon with a result <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/wysiwyg.html">-oriented</a> interface ( <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/wysiwyg.html">results-oriented UI</a> ). <br><br>  Unfortunately, I had to inform my parents, proud of my daughter, that her knowledge would become obsolete before she finished the third grade.

      The problem is in too tight anchoring of education to specific programs.  Even if Microsoft did not redo Excel this year, she would have done it anyway in the future.  Updating textbooks for teaching Office'2007 is not a panacea, because the interface will have changed by the time the current third-graders started working in their 10‚Äì15 years old, and will change more than once by the time they retire in 2065. <br><br>  Of course, there is a certain sense in teaching schoolchildren the skills that they can begin to apply immediately, but teaching them to deeper concepts that will benefit them always, regardless of changes in specific applications, is of much greater value. <br><br>  Learning "lifelong" computer skills in our schools can also be an advantage because it will give students skills that they <b>can hardly learn on their own</b> .  On the other hand, since programs are becoming easier to learn how to use them, anyone can figure out how to draw a pie chart, for example.  People will learn how to use the functions they need, when they need them - and they have the motivation to do so.  These are things that have to learn endlessly, and they are not related to formal education. <br><br>  I present some basic skills that I think we should teach in elementary school. <br><br><h5>  Search strategies </h5><br>  The current leader in the search engine market can disappear in 20 years, and the search page patterns that dominate all search engines are almost certain to change.  Therefore, we must teach children not to the Google hacks. <br><br>  However, the basic search concept will become even more important in the future, as we get more and more information that will be universally available.  Strategies, how to formulate a good query, how and when a query to reformulate or add search refinements, how to restrict the search area, how to evaluate the relevance of search results, how to combine several search engines of different types will remain important even if specific implementations of these strategies change. <br><br><h5>  Reliability of information </h5><br>  When <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/children.html">children tested websites,</a> we noticed that they click on ads much more often than adults.  It is definitely important to teach children to recognize different types of advertisements, including sponsored and natural search results.  But we have to go further and teach children strategies for assessing and validating information on the Internet.  <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050131.html">Teenagers are</a> especially impatient on the Internet, and therefore potentially more vulnerable. <br><br><h5>  Oversupply </h5><br>  In the future, there will be even more mail, instant messengers, SMS messages, voice mail, phone calls, video calls, websites, podcasts, and even more rich intranets. <br>  People can take simple measures to <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040105.html">combat an oversupply of information</a> , but the flow of information is growing like a snowball, and we will need more complex strategies. <br><br><h5>  Writing for online readers </h5><br>  Communication only through the Internet, intranet and other interactive environments is becoming an increasingly important skill for work.  Extensive research has shown that <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/">users read online media much differently</a> than print.  Thus, we must <b>teach students how to write hypertext</b> , not a printed document. <br><br><h5>  Computer Presentation Skills </h5><br>  Good speakers know <a href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/in_defense_of_p.html">how to use PowerPoint</a> to engage the public with their presentation instead of putting them to sleep with a bunch of lists and items.  Most professionals agree that serious presentation skills are necessary for promotion.  So far, few of today's presentations are being made with computer support to better convey the meaning instead of saying beautiful speeches. <br><br>  Many students already use PowerPoint to present their projects.  We need to go beyond the mechanical slide show, and teach them the skills of effective presentations using a computer. <br><br><h5>  Ergonomic workspace </h5><br>  In the process of increasing the computerization of life, RSI (injuries resulting from constant stress), such as tunnel syndrome and others, are detrimental to an increasing number of people.  We must teach people how to preserve and protect their health, and how to create a workplace in accordance with existing ergonomic guidelines.  Rule number 1 - take frequent breaks and get up, but there are still many rules, including the location of the monitor and chair, table height, and lighting.  Most computer-equipped places endanger health with headaches, back pain, and other injuries. <br><br><h5>  Debugging </h5><br>  We do not have to turn every person into a programmer, but knowing the basic principles of finding mistakes is one of the basic skills of survival in the computer age.  For example, spreadsheets may contain errors in formulas, and if people do not know how to detect such errors, they will make decisions based on incorrect data. <br><br><h5>  User Testing and Other Basic Usage Guides </h5><br>  Just as all children should not become programmers, we also should not turn them all into usability specialists or interface designers.  However, the more we do business in an interactive environment, the more it becomes important that understanding the fundamentals facilitates interaction.  Understanding <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">ease of use principles</a> such as ‚Äúrecognition vs.  remembering, or ‚Äúreconciling,‚Äù will be an important quality for an educated person. <br><br>  The more commodity categories become computerized and increasingly complex to operate, the more people will need the ability to judge ease of use and become more informed consumers so that they can purchase products that really work for them to fit their needs. <br><br>  In addition, even if children will never conduct custom tests like adults, I think they should all try one test at school.  Testing is a simple and effective way to gain an understanding of the many important principles of usability.  For example, teachers may ask children to write small websites on various topics, and then check them on each other to see how well they convey information.  The realization that other children do not understand your site is much more motivational than the teacher‚Äôs red pen marks on your essay. <br><br>  In his book, The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691124027%3Ftag%3Duseitcomusablein">New Division of Labor: How Computers Create a New Labor Market</a> , Frank Levy and Richard J. Mernein identify three key skills that are unlikely to be handed over to someone or automated in the future.  These are problem solving skills, understanding the relationship between concepts, and interpersonal communication.  The ‚Äúlifelong‚Äù computer skills I have outlined can likewise prepare students for a career that will be sustainable as globalization increases. <br><br>  <i>PS from the translator: I am not a professional translator, so I‚Äôll be happy with the amendments and comments on the translation.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111934/</a></p>
