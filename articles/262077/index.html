He writes that welcome screens should be considered in relation to how the service activates the user - only this way will benefit the product, and not be a bothersome review of functions that are not needed now.  Dan cites examples of such scenarios from well-known companies like Facebook, who found that if a user added 7 friends within 10 days after registering, he probably would not abandon the site.

True, large tablets have recently been falling in sales due to 7 ‚Äúversions and phablets, and the iPad, no matter how hard I tried, didn‚Äôt go very far beyond the consumption device, but having multiple windows would make it a little more useful.  The application switching mode has also changed, and when a third-party keyboard is connected, the approach familiar to the desktop OS is shown.  Windows 10 showed a universal solution for the entire line of devices, I wonder how Apple will come to this. <br><br>  Among other interface patterns is an attempt to solve many problems of large screens in a new player: moving a significant number of controls down, using a swipe to switch between main sections like in WinPhone.  Active use of round color category icons.  A rounded input field from the old era reappeared in the search.  It takes into account <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8748157/ios-9-google-now-microsoft-cortana-comparison/in/8496022">more nuances of the current context</a> .

The guys from San Jose finally found out that for many years they have been creating not a photo editing tool, but rather an assistant designer.  Plus, "suddenly" swallowed many designers Sketch.  As a result, the product received a lot of new features and changed the strange behavior of the old ones: <br><ul><li>  Artboards: assembly areas that allow you to create multiple screens of different sizes in one document, greatly facilitating the work, export and view layouts. </li><li>  Multiple styles of layers: it became possible to create several identical layer styles overlapping each other. </li><li>  New export dialog, replacing Save For Web. </li><li>  Libraries: create once, for example, toolbar.  You use in other places, then you change the source code, it changes everywhere.  The development of a smart object. </li><li>  Companion application for viewing design on devices (iOS already, Android on the way). </li><li>  <a href="http://adobe-photoshop.github.io/">Photoshop Design Space</a> : a completely new interface for Photoshop specifically for designers. </li><li>  A lot of small tweaks from the point of view of both performance and interaction: one possibility to impose internal translucent Stroke is worth something!  :-) </li><li>  <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/adobe-stock-shaking-up-the-stock-content-market/">Adobe Stock</a> is a photo vector stock embedded in all products of the company. </li><li>  Adobe CreativeSync - a new approach to the exchange of all your design resources.

How to stop producing documents and start living.  All this burns a lot of time for paperwork - the forces go to polishing side documents, not the product.  It is necessary to perceive the work on the product as the creation and development of a platform, and not a specific release. <br><br>  I talked a little about this at the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jvetrau/wud2013-yvetrovmail-rumobileuikit">end of 2013</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jvetrau/uxrussia2014-burgerdriven-design-mail">2014</a> .  But there was an emphasis on specific cases, and in this presentation - step by step instructions for creating such a platform.  By the number of slides, this is the ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù level, but the task is really difficult. <br><br>  At the end of the presentation, there is a long list of all those who made this picture stand together and began to be implemented in practice.  The original idea was simple, the first prototype of the platform appeared in mid-2012.  But as more and more services were transferred to it, the vision was corrected and expanded.  We have a huge number of products and questions on each of them, so that we are still on the way.  Therefore, the series will continue :) <br><br>  <a href="https://vimeo.com/130303630">Video performance</a> .

The team announced a project on FrontendConf in Moscow and Web Standards Days in St. Petersburg.  Protein can convert any interface components to vector for use in Sketch or Adobe Illustrator and back.  That is, changes from Sketch will fall back into the library as code ‚Äî like Dropbox for interface components. <br><br>  The authors say that this is a fundamentally different approach, which, as promised, will solve the problems of interaction between designers and developers.  Designers can now use live components to create layouts and synchronize their code representation in the background.  Just work on the design;) Now you will have one component library on which designers and developers will work.  At the same time! <br><br>  Protein turns the development upside down, primarily promoting the creation of components by the developer and then their use by the designer in the interface layouts.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/proteinio">Facebook project page</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/awinogradov/ss-48422586">presentation</a> . <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/48422586&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjdvtBrEzkzVYeT8ZAwcxIZ5aDzoA" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  <strong>CSS Shapes</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/02/the-making-of-in-pieces/">Insanely cool example of how with the help of trimming on the mask was created a site about endangered species of animals drawn by polygons</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>Web typography</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/live-font-interpolation-on-the-web">Andrew Johnson on web interpolation capabilities</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/17/responsive-typography-with-sass-maps/">Cheat sheet to create an adaptive font grid using CSS pre-processor SASS</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://letterror.com/dev/mathshapes/">A powerful letterror studio experiment on working with adaptive fonts and interpolation on the web</a> .
