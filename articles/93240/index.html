      The development of the world's first hybrid integrated circuit was made in 1963 in the Leningrad Research Institute of Radio Electronics.  It was the first in the world GIS with two-level integration, and not discrete chipless transistors were used as active elements in it, but the world's third R12-2 semiconductor integrated circuit, developed and manufactured in 1962. It was also a multi-component product functionally complete supplied to the consumer as an independent product.  GIS was produced until the mid-1990s, i.e.  more than 30 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/229/57d/0d5/22957d0d50eac9ce6d06efab89ea7f01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>And what about them</u> ?  The first foreign GIS was announced by IBM in 1964 in the form of STL-modules that were created for the new family of computers IBM -360. <br><br>  <b>The world's first computer million</b> <br><br>  The first computer in the world, whose performance exceeded 1 million operations per second, was developed in 1960-1963.  in Moscow Scientific Research Institute-37.  This is a second generation experimental computer (on discrete transistors) T340-A with a capacity of 2.4 million operations per second.  On its basis, the K340-A serial computer was developed, released by the industry in the amount of 50 sets.  High performance computers has been achieved through the use of modular arithmetic.  T340-A and K340-A remain the world champions in performance among second-generation computers.  And it was a computer with the lowest cost per unit of performance - 25 kopecks.  per operation per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3f/e59/f7f/d3fe59f7f880b4d88d57f3f42efd1a3a.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Especially curious is the fact that due to the high reliability and unique characteristics of the K-340A computer, they are still in operation! <br><br>  <b>The world's first computer of the 3rd generation</b> <br><br>  The world's first computer of the 3rd generation (computer made on the basis of integrated circuits - IC) was developed in 1963-64.  in Leningrad Research Institute of Radio Electronics.  This is an on-board aviation computer ‚ÄúGnome‚Äù, created on the basis of the world's first hybrid integrated circuits ‚ÄúKvant‚Äù (later GIS series 116) developed at NIREE.  Il-76 with a modification of the Gnome-1 in the image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/988/db0/2fb/988db02fb7af78808f5936abead2de2c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>And what about them?</u>  There are references to earlier 3rd generation computers that were allegedly manufactured in 1961 by a Texas company.  However, the information is not considered reliable because the company that posted this information did not have the appropriate profile and later did not confirm its development. <br><br>  <b>The world's first 16-bit consumer computer</b> <br><br>  The world's first 16-bit consumer computer, Electronics NTs-8010, was developed at the Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Precision Technology.  The computer is based on the original 16-bit single-chip microcomputer "Electronics NTs-80T" with the original architecture and command system "Electronics NTs", with a clock frequency of 8 MHz.  After several modifications, the household computer was produced by the Exiton plant (Pavlovsky Posad, Moscow region) under the name Electronics BK-0010, which is considered to be the world's first 16-bit serial consumer computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/a0f/18d/826a0f18d5647f1197a74e946d07c9da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>And what about them?</u>  Foreign home computers of those years were based on 8-bit microprocessors of types I 8080 (Intel), Z-80 (Zilog) and 6501 (MOS Technology) with a clock frequency of 1 MHz. <br><br>  <b>The world's first 16-bit PDA</b> <br><br>  The world's first 16-bit pocket personal computer (PDA) ‚ÄúElectronics MK-85‚Äù with a microprogram implementation of the Basic programming language was developed at the Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Precision Technology in 1985. The PDA is built on the basis of a special original 16-bit microprocessor KA1013BM1, which is software-compatible with personal computers type DVK and BK-0010 with PDP-11-compatible architecture.  Produced by Angstrom from 1986 to 2000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/db3/236/773db32361e6d223bda9c0bf7f958f36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>And what about them?</u>  The few foreign PDAs of those years were built on the basis of 4- or 8-bit microprocessors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93240/</a></p>
