  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I did a business with a turnover of 6 million on software development, without investing a single penny</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the middle of 2014, I quit working and started developing my consulting and software development business.  Until the end of 2014, I worked alone.  Sometimes outsource small projects to acquaintances where the risk was minimal. <br>  For six months I managed to earn more than working ‚Äúfor my uncle‚Äù.  But for this I had to work hard.  It came to be understood that such activities do not scale well and I began to look for people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Everyone wants a business, but no one wants to risk </h3><br>  A year ago <a href="http://blog.gandjustas.ru/2015/01/2014-year-summary.html">I wrote a post</a> in which I wrote that I was looking for partners who could develop a business with me.  I was looking for people who will share my values ‚Äã‚Äã(more on this below) and will want to develop as businessmen. <br>  During the week I collected 500 views on the blog and it is not yet known how many via RSS and received only 3 (three) responses.  This surprised most.  At the Habr√© and the forums, everybody constantly writes that they don‚Äôt want to work ‚Äúfor an uncle‚Äù, they want to do their job, etc. <br>  In practice, it turned out that there are much less willing to risk.  No one wants to leave the comfort zone. <br><br><h3>  Values </h3><br>  Below is a list of what I adhere to myself and demand from all partners and employees. <br><br><h4>  Win win </h4><br>  IT managers do not always share this position.  For them, there are ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äù and if ‚Äúthey‚Äù win, then ‚Äúwe‚Äù lose.  Because of this, there is no trust between IT people and customers.

      I always say: ‚ÄúIt does not happen that a client wants a strange one.  It so happens that you do not understand something. ‚Äù  It would seem simple - understand the problem, manage the risks of the customer, and your credibility will increase.  And this means that you will work with the client for a long time and earn enough money, and they will start recommending you. <br>  But not everyone can. <br><br><h4>  Professionalism </h4><br>  Professional pay money for solving problems.  Not for the fact that he was hurt by a bunch of unnecessary questions, not for the fact that he begins to shift the problem to the client, not for the fact that ‚ÄúI worked, but not shmogla‚Äù. <br><br>  In my team, all people understand.  ‚ÄúUnderstanding‚Äù is not a state, but a process.  Even if the area is completely new, then you find literature, video tutorials, ask questions, pick sources.  You do anything, but you solve the problem. <br>  The flip side of professionalism is responsibility for what you do.  If nakosyachil - fix it.  Even if you do not understand the client - this is your joint. <br><br><h4>  A good customer is a satisfied customer. </h4><br>  The client may benefit from your work, but not get satisfaction.  This happens more often than it seems.  IT managers work with computers, and computers do not have emotions.  Many start to communicate with clients as with computers. <br><br>  I can't do that.  It is necessary to speak with the client in the client's language, not to argue, not to be arrogant, not to be stupid as yourself.  If the client is nervous - call, find out what does not suit.  You can not eliminate the cause - find a workaround option that will suit everyone. <br><br><h3>  Business development </h3><br>  I found three people who started working with me.  Then they found several people and we were able to ‚Äúchew‚Äù several large projects.  The team is 7 people, all work part time.  Two of them are key partners who find projects, sell projects and manage them. <br>  Projects have become smaller, but their number has increased.  It has become harder to sell consulting and training. <br>  Revenue for the year amounted to 6.5 million rubles, and in December there was a record - just over 2 million. Business grew 4 times per year and this is in crisis. <br><br>  At the same time I did not spend a penny on advertising.  We sell through personal contacts, recommendations of friends and partners (companies with whom I previously collaborated). <br>  On the one hand, this shows well the power of personal connections, and on the other, it severely limits business growth.  But from me a useless marketer.  All my marketing knowledge is limited to the IBA marketing course and a couple of books. <br><br><h3>  MBA </h3><br>  At university I got a programmer‚Äôs education and was extremely far from business.  When I started developing my business, I lacked knowledge in almost all areas. <br>  I invested the earned money in training and went to study at the IBA program at the <a href="http://ibda.ane.ru/">IBDA RANEPA</a> . <br>  The IBA trains managers of large companies, and it is difficult to apply knowledge for small businesses.  But I am selling to large companies and I have become much better able to understand the processes that are happening there and where you can create value. <br>  And the IBA teaches how to count money.  Or, as it is more fashionable to say, ‚Äúmanage finances‚Äù.  Now I consider the options in Excel before making a decision. <br><br><h3>  Looking for a partner in the team again </h3><br>  At the end of the year, I analyzed the business and realized that you need to invest profits in marketing.  Almost no marketer from me, so I need a partner or even a mentor who will help me to attract new customers. <br>  I am looking for a person who has experience in Internet marketing and in promoting services in b2b, is ready to take on marketing or help create a concrete plan to attract customers.  I am ready to share part of the proceeds from each new client, and in the future be included in the founders. <br>  I will also be happy to sellers with a client base and specialists in Microsoft Dynamics CRM with customer outlets. <br>  If you are interested or you know people who might be interested, write to <a href="">stanislav.v@vnextsoft.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297608/</a></p>
