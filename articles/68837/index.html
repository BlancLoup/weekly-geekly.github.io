The unmanaged code was selected again (Intel C ++ stack, OpenMP), but this time I wanted to interact in a 64-bit environment.  Here's a story about how ‚Äúfun‚Äù it was. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd0.jpg" alt="These are some kind of irregular bees."><br>  What I do is a 64-bit C ++ Win32 DLL application ... and the first thing I see after the wizard has downloaded the files is this beauty: <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/1.jpg">

    <br>  To be honest, the x64 option appears as configurations about 50% of the time, and this happens for no particular reason.  However, I had to dig in the Internet in order to understand that you need to create a configuration in Configuration Manager.  No sooner said than done.  The x64 configuration can in principle be selected from the list. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/2.jpg"><br><br><br>  Having decided to save time on the configuration, I decided to copy the Win32 settings.  Everything worked fine with the exception that <em>all .Net projects in the configuration began to target Win64</em> .  But the project would be compiled, but I would not know anything - if I had not tied up PostSharp.  I don‚Äôt know what the jamb is, but PostSharp ‚Äúrendered‚Äù in a 64-bit config with such error messages that they didn‚Äôt fit into the screen. <br><br>  I had to change the configuration manually. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd1.jpg" alt="Stop, and where is my dll?"><br>  In general, to build a DLL, it is not enough just to open the file from the project and click the Build Project.  Unlike C # projects (as well as Microsoft C ++ projects), the Build Project option on an open file simply does not exist!  You have to right-click on the solution and choose Build.  I do not know who in Intel is responsible for usability, but IMHO is a serious joint. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/3.jpg"><br><br><br>  One puzzle that expects newbies in C ++ development in VS is that the DLL is generated, but then it cannot be found.  Attempting to find a DLL in the Debug or Release daddy of the corresponding project will result in this: <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/4.jpg"><br><br><br>  The problem is that Visual C ++ puts the DLL itself at the solution level, and not at the specific project.  So look for several folders above.  Perhaps there is some kind of logic in this, but I don‚Äôt see it as a point-blank. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd2.jpg" alt="We pay import duties"><br>  At this stage, refused to work <code>[DllImport]</code> .  More precisely, he did not begin to work.  .Net simply did not find tags, despite the fact that I correctly registered the Calling Convention.  Having spent half an hour in Google, I came to the conclusion that <em>DllImport does not know how to work with 64-bit libraries</em> .  It will work more precisely, but only after you make <code>DUMBIN /EXPORTS</code> and begin to define the P / Invoke methods like this: <br><br><blockquote> <code><font color="black">[DllImport( <font color="#000000">"Typografix.Bitmap.dll"</font> , &lt;br/&gt; <br> CallingConvention = CallingConvention.Cdecl, &lt;br/&gt; <br> ExactSpelling = <font color="#0000FF">true</font> , &lt;br/&gt; <br> EntryPoint = <font color="#000000">"?Coalesce@@YAXPEAE0HHH@Z"</font> )] <font color="#006400">// &lt;-- whoops!</font> <br> <font color="#0000FF">public</font> <font color="#0000FF">static</font> <font color="#0000FF">extern</font> <font color="#0000FF">void</font> Coalesce(IntPtr src, IntPtr dst, &lt;br/&gt; <br> <font color="#0000FF">int</font> width, <font color="#0000FF">int</font> height, <font color="#0000FF">int</font> stride);&lt;br/&gt; <br></font></code> </blockquote><br>  I will not comment here on the "elegance" of such a decision because everyone is surely so everything is clear.  Unfortunately, nothing still works at this stage. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd3.jpg" alt="There is a desire to &quot;score&quot;"><br>  In a super-mega-ideal world, .Net project at the time of gathering could cut through that if I registered his dependency on another C ++ project, then it would be necessary to copy the result of the dependent project's work into the Debug / Release folder.  And in the real world, the main project has to do the Post-Build Step, which will copy the DLL to the correct folder.  And it is desirable to do this for the C ++ project, since  building and launching a .Net consumer <em>does not always launch the Post-Build Step</em> .  The reasons for this, I think, are obvious. <br><br>  However, after all these manipulations, the project has earned.  Having gained impudence, I added support for OpenMP, after which the application safely fell with the error ‚Äúin incorrect format‚Äù, which, translated into human language, means that the lib is bound to <em>some other</em> language <em>that is not to find</em> .  Agree, the informational content of the error text is simply amazing - especially after you spend an hour picking up the project settings based on the assumption that you <em>really</em> started generating the DLL in some kind of "incorrect" format. <br><br>  In this situation, <code>DUMPBIN</code> saved me again.  It turned out that, unlike using OpenMP under the Microsoft compiler, Intel'evsky is tied up with a kind of <code>libiomp5md.dll</code> library which naturally doesn‚Äôt fall into the <code>bin</code> folder (and the <code>PATH</code> variable, of course, too).  We ruin.  It seems to work. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd4.jpg" alt="Last nail"><br>  The code for my x64 library was taken directly from the 32-bit project, so initially it did not want to work (due to changes in pointer arithmetic).  Therefore, I stupidly set a breakpoint in my DLL, turned on Unmanaged Code Debugging and pressed F5.  Result? <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/5.jpg"><br><br><br>  I will not describe here the grimaces and jumps that I did to make debugging work.  In short, the point was to register my managed program as a starting process for DLLs.  After numerous attempts, I decided to quit this venture.  Surely there is a possibility of such debugging, but personally it seems to me that it is necessary to sit and stupidly wait for 2010 studio where this problem is probably ruined. <br><br><img src="http://nesteruk.org/pix/9/hd5.jpg" alt="Close the case"><br>  Despite all my dissatisfaction with what is happening, I completed the library.  Of course, there is no need to talk about high-quality debugging, but I was lucky - the algorithms themselves are quite simple and, moreover, they were already tested in a 32-bit environment, so it only remained to clean up in my head the understanding that <code>sizeof(void*) != sizeof(DWORD)</code> .  Everything worked, and it works now, in the background, while I am writing this post (the algorithms are used for headings).  On a vskidku, these algorithms work 15-20 times faster than their .Net analogs. <br><br>  I basically understand that maybe you shouldn‚Äôt go into 64-bit development now, when for most tasks it is absolutely optional.  I just really wanted to try, ponastupat on a rake.  And despite the fact that some of the problems that I described are probably a consequence of my own stupidity and ignorance, the mezanism of developing 64-bit applications seems to me too complicated and confusing.  In addition, at the moment it seems to me more appropriate to use Direct2D and DirectWrite technologies for text drawing, which I actively study and about which I will probably write on Habr√©. <br><br>  That's all, thank you for your attention!  See you again! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68837/</a></p>
