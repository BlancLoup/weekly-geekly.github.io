  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Year of reading under strict control of the goal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  In this small article I want to share with you the results of the year of reading under the strict control of my goal in the form of a small service. <br><br>  In short, the number of books read increased 17 times compared to the previous year.  I wonder how it looks?  Let's get started then. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin, perhaps, with the fact that just a year and a half ago I was a typical representative of modern Internet youth: I read many articles, blogs, but not books.  My brains, formatted by articles, with great difficulty perceived the book, especially the volume of more than three hundred pages. <br><br>  At one point, my beautiful wife gave me two beautiful books.  It was last fall and was the beginning of something interesting and large-scale. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Following these two books, I read two more, then three more.  It all took me a month.  And then in the head a ghostly haze an idea emerged in the spirit of ‚Äúweak?‚Äù, Which at that time I voiced something like this: <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúRead 1,500 books with an average volume of 500 pages up to 70 years.</b>  <b>Articles and books read before this goal are not considered. ‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Being a person from the IT world, decided to use the gitkhab.  Here I will make a small digression.  Probably, some people remember an article in Habr√© in which the author cited the result of a forty-day programmer sprint.  At that time, this beautiful commit statistics had already appeared on the githaba and the marked article was decorated with a picture of a green stripe. <br><br>  Then it inspired me very much, but this time it prompted me a simple way to record the read volume of books.  As a pleasant bonus from the point of view of discipline, there was a moment that it was impossible to commit "yesterday". <br><br>  And I began every day to fix the number of pages read.  Over time, commits became overgrown with comments on what I read.  And after the book was completed, a small review was added to the commit. <br><br>  It looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/285/166/23a/28516623a029400f91495095d65c8e37.png"><br><br>  The inconvenience was that looking at this picture you can see what days I was reading, but how many pages were read.  It became clear that it was necessary to use a resource more suitable for my purposes. <br>  Not finding anything satisfying, in a couple of days I wrote my service, which met all my requirements: <br><br>  1. Visual display of reading progress. <br>  2. Visual display of reading statistics (when I read how much). <br>  3. Related statistics (average read speed, residue tracking, and so on). <br>  4. Simple, user-friendly interface. <br><br>  Actually what came of it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/fe1/8c0/569fe18c0a9d4466bf8acf3a5587b892.png"><br><br>  Let's see what information can be obtained at a glance: <br><br>  1. What days did I read books? <br>  2. How many pages I read on the respective days. <br>  <i>Note: if you hover the cursor on a checkbox, then in the pop-up tip there is a specific date and the exact number of pages read.</i> <br>  3. The average number of pages read by day of the week (to the right of the days of the week is a color box corresponding to the number of pages). <br><br>  In addition, inside the application you can find the same results, which were discussed at the beginning of the article: <br><br><ul><li>  Read 34 books </li><li>  ~ 20 000 pages read (accuracy lovers: 20 314). </li><li>  The average reading speed is 58 pages per day. </li></ul><br>  As you understand, before that I read an average of 1-2 books a year. <br><br>  If you look at the themes of the books, among them you will find: <br><br><ul><li>  Artistic </li><li>  Specialized (economics, statistics, quantum physics, etc.) </li><li>  Management </li><li>  Programming </li></ul><br>  On this, I will finish my story about how a clearly formulated goal, an excellent publishing house, family support and convenient service helped me to read as many books in a year as I had read in the previous 10-15 years. <br><br>  Read books and thank you for your attention! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  I answer at once to everyone who thinks that the goal should have included the ‚Äúinterestingness‚Äù of books, and not just their number: the fact that the goal will sound ‚Äúto read 100 interesting books‚Äù quantitative assessment will not go anywhere.  I am not a robot and not Wang: I do not read everything, but I cannot always predict whether the book is interesting for me (ratings and reviews, as practice shows, not an indicator). <br><br>  Immediately I answer the question ‚Äúwhy is there such a goal?‚Äù, A strange question for me: first, it‚Äôs fun, secondly, it‚Äôs useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399913/</a></p>
