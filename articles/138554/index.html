I think the equipment is redundant for such a device, if we talk about its standard functionality. <br><br>  I will say a few words about the operation of the device for its intended purpose. <br>  AdvoCam recorders feature is a natural HD video mode.  A common trick of Chinese manufacturers is interpolation (digital ‚Äústretching‚Äù of an image that has a real resolution, for example, 640 by 480 pixels to 1280 by 960).  The result is a blurred image. <br><br>  - The video is shot in 15 minute intervals ‚Äúoverlap‚Äù - in the intervals between them, time is not lost.  In the event of an accident or other unpleasant incident on the road in the recording there will be no loss of the event.  When recording "not in an overlap" between the saved video files, the interval of up to 3 seconds is not recorded. <br>  - Viewing angle on the diagonal - 160 degrees (horizontally - 110 degrees).  Usually for budget recorders the viewing angle on a diagonal is 120 degrees. <br>  - A sixfold digital zoom is a rare feature for car recorders. <br>  - Ability to shoot high resolution photos (3M, 5M, 8M to choose from). <br>  - ‚ÄúSports mode‚Äù photography - for a certain period of time in a row a specified number of shots are taken. <br><br>  It is difficult to test the automotive functions of the recorder when the car is in repair, however, I can say the following - in my opinion, the device lacks sensitivity.  But it is worth considering that in the light of headlights the result will be more acceptable. <br>  The photos are quite clear, with the effect of a fish-eye due to the features of the device, focused on panoramic shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c91/6b3/4da/c916b34da3d8541e9856d61fdc351095.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Photo with an approach.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c55/47d/642/c5547d6429a9972ee73024069825f133.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Photos from 2</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ca/39f/5fa/7ca39f5fa0af193ed1c8a41d967ca6d8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Panoramic photo</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5c/9ef/1ef/c5c9ef1efc6f63d40b67eaa438f5f656.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Portraiture</b> <br><br>  We should also tell about the other functions of the device in question.  Even in the basic package there are two options that make the recorder more than just a car security camera.  I'm talking about mounting on clothes and on the remote control on the device, which also has a clip for mounting on clothes. <br>  This makes it possible to use AdvoCam as a photo or video camera when visiting sporting events, simply during active recreation or when interacting with representatives of the police and other government agencies.  In this case, your hands will be free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e5/437/5b4/1e54375b451cc5054af8c3385151de64.jpg"><br>  <b>The remote control</b> <i>photo is taken on the Internet and belongs to the author, my camera finally died: `(</i> <br><br>  In part, I have already explained why I took the word autoregistrar in quotes - the device, thanks to the additional options that come with the basic package, has much more features than ordinary autoregistrars. <br><br>  Now about a set of additional options that expand the capabilities of the device even more. <br>  In my case, it was a kit of the Action Kit, which includes three options - mount on the helmet, bike carrier (it also allows you to mount the recorder to any pipe) and hermobox.  Options for such additional.  There are several sets for every taste. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc4/feb/386/cc4feb38680a4dd1120ed710b4e1f417.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62d/784/524/62d784524abfc66d3b7eb90ae5a36fb2.jpg"><br><br>  Mount on the helmet will allow you to use the recorder when doing winter sports, you can mount it on a helmet or on a mask when playing paintball.  In this way, you will be able to carry out ‚Äúoperational shooting‚Äù while taking up your hobbies, but not hold your hands, which can be very relevant. <br>  I have been playing role-playing games for a long time, playing paintball and I have many friends who are interested in airsoft - I think that many of them would not have refused the opportunity to conveniently record games and competitions in which they participate. <br><br>  The bike carrier is an adjustable clamp and fasteners for the recorder, so it can be used both on bicycles and, possibly, on motorcycles or scooters.  Since driving a motorcycle is much more dangerous for a driver than driving a car, this option may not be superfluous. <br><br>  The third option in the optional kit is a sealed box that allows you to shoot under water at a depth of 20 meters or simply in high humidity conditions, controlling the camera using the remote control. <br>  Separately, the remote control is a radio control that allows you to control the recording when the device is not in direct line of sight. <br><br>  In the basic package, as indicated above, there is not only a charger, but also a sync cable, as well as an AV cable for displaying images on a TV, which will allow you to share your impressions with relatives and friends anywhere, not just where there is a computer . <br><br>  Device Features: <br><br>  Viewing Angle: 160 ¬∞ (diagonal), 110 ¬∞ horizontal <br>  Sensor: 5Mp <br>  Working Resolution: 1280x720 <br>  Frame rate: up to 30 frames per second <br>  Power supply: 5V (through the converter 12 ~ 24V) <br>  Screen: there is <br>  Additional camera: no <br><br>  Memory <br>  Memory Card Type: MicroSD (TransFlash) <br>  Maximum capacity: 32 gigabytes <br>  Maximum recording time: 16 hours (max. Quality) <br><br>  Battery <br>  Type: Built <br>  Capacity: 1400mA <br>  Work time:&gt; 1 hour <br><br>  Now the most important point is the cost of the device.  AdvoCam is positioned as a premium-level autoregistrar, with a large number of additional options, a rich basic package and high quality workmanship.  The price of AdvoCam HD2 is from 5,633 rubles for a basic set + about 2900 rubles for a set of additional options.  It is worth mentioning separately that the mounts for the bike and the helmet allow using the recorder both in the hermobox (for protection against splashes and dirt) and without it. <br><br>  Sample video shot at home on AdvoCam HD2 (HexBug and cat included) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8tNSjxcdmA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4vfZdYqH5fhvGQJwVc0zed4_LRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yes, of course, the price of the device is not the lowest in the market of autoregistrars, but the undoubted advantage is the huge number of accessories already provided by the manufacturer, which expand the functionality of the device, the so-called  Action Kit. <br><br>  You can buy an inexpensive recorder and use it for its intended purpose, but there is no guarantee that, if necessary, you will be able to find additional fasteners and other options for it. <br><br>  Upd: On Youtube there are examples of videos in different modes. <br>  I correct my mistake, add videos to the post. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0U5C67qVwI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjabejqqZS0pTyWDh1z5A0BNMVKdA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>AdvoCam CCTV-mode</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJCFJktJwQU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQd0mMNg4JC8bncMSCvGmsaeREJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>AdvoCam-HD2 (720p) 2012 Daily Record in Sport Mode</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dA3tv0iEVI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj5mVzFqA7_qUQ-i7abi84qDMs9Mw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>AdvoCam-HD2 (720p) 2012 Sport mode, night</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138554/</a></p>
