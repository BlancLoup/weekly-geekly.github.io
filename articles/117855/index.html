Someone is trying to keep up and work more efficiently.  Another monitors their spending and optimizes cash spending.  The other is trying to change any habit - for example, to become a morning person. <br><br><img src="http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8549/3364337853605012325e.jpg" alt="Sense of time"><br><br>  As a rule, we are offered various techniques, which should be done in one way or another - to write down a plan once a week, or to get up every day at the same time, and to go to bed when you want to sleep.  But checking the correctness of actions is not always given due attention.  The guilt of the very people who do not read carefully, or of the wording in books and manuals, is not very important.  It is important that as a result, quite a few people do not reach their goals.

      My technique is simple and based on sensations.  Not for everyone, but for many.  The bottom line is that you should build work on some aspect of your life in such a way as to develop a feeling for this aspect.  For example, if you work with time management, you should see a ‚Äúsense of time‚Äù - allowing you to feel how time is passing, and a certain awkwardness when it goes to unnecessary things. <br><br>  Why it works and how it appears, the description inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As a rule, we cannot control our thoughts and actions at any time at any time (I don‚Äôt take cases of people who remember everything 100%, control themselves 100% and have 100% will power - such personalities are encountered, although rarely ).  Therefore, <b>it is necessary to somehow automate their actions</b> , to program themselves for the right actions. <br><br>  For this there are habits.  It takes 21 days to form a habit, on average, a few months.  During this time it is necessary to regularly and systematically perform the actions that need to be automated.  Further, these actions are transferred to the reflex level, to the subconscious, and there is no longer any need to control each step by the consciousness. <br><br>  Moreover, it has been proved many times that if the mind can operate with fairly simple quantities (few people can multiply five-digit numbers in mind), then the <b>subconscious has tremendous computational abilities</b> (many complex body movements in music, dance, martial arts, sports are a clear demonstration of our work subconscious).  There is only one problem - <b>it</b> is <b>difficult to establish a connection with the subconscious, it operates not with words, but with images, sensations</b> . <br><br>  In the case of any technology that is designed to improve our lives - material, spiritual, etc.  - You can use the method of developing habits.  Take time management as an example.  It is necessary to remember different matrices, lists, approaches, to work on a task from different positions, in general - a complex system.  It is difficult to keep it in my head, and it is difficult to plan, so many people give up.  In fact, <b>you need to strive to ensure that there is a feeling that allows you to evaluate the task at the level of intuition</b> .  And it will definitely appear after several months of systematic work. <br><br>  In a sense, it is a feedback signal.  Singers in the opera, for example, use the sense of vibration at the bridge of the nose to check whether they sound correctly - with the right sound, there is a slight vibration. <br><br>  But the feedback signal by any method, the <b>desired feeling does not appear from scratch</b> .  If this is a new feeling, you must first find it in yourself.  And in <b>order to find, you need to regularly, after a couple of months of practicing any kind of technology, set aside time and listen to yourself</b> .  Free yourself from thoughts and listen to yourself.  In the case of time management, when planning a plan for five minutes, you can simply look at the tasks, turn them in your head, draw your mind-map, but not strain your mind, not try to prioritize, but feel.  And one day you feel, looking at the tasks - which are important, which can wait, and which simply can not do.  This whole technique goes into the subconscious, and already all complex calculations will be done in a second. <br><br>  Or with expenses - having <b>watched your expenses during each day for two or three months, soon you will physically feel in the store how and where your money goes</b> .  And if they do not go to the articles planned in the budget, you will feel an unpleasant feeling of loss, based on which, you can easily stop yourself.  And if they only trusted the mind, each time they would have to go for the budget and the expenses-incomes. <br><br>  <b>We summarize.</b>  <b>To control the correctness of any technique, you need to transfer it to the subconscious level, and strive to develop a sensation for feedback in order to know at any time whether the technique works or not</b> . <br><br>  In conclusion, I can tell you how two prominent modern businessmen apply subconsciousness and sensations.  Theme Lebedev says that his decision is ready at the very moment when the designer has finished telling about the problem.  And Richard Branson, the billionaire, remarked in one of his books that it takes sixty seconds to make any decision (managing 350 companies and having several billion dollars, you need to make sometimes very difficult decisions that take thousands of factors into account). <br><br>  I hope the article was interesting and useful and prompted some thoughts and a desire to try. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117855/</a></p>
