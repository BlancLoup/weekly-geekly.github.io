It is localized in the spinal cord, central nervous system, various parts of the brain (pituitary, visual cortex, etc.) and so on.  The subconscious mind coordinates the vital activity of the organism, is a kind of envelope for personality and consciousness. <br><br>  Information from the surrounding world is transmitted to the subconscious, where it is processed in the way appropriate for the type of information (visual signals are the visual cortex of the brain) and is translated into consciousness, but not all, but that which consciousness asks for.  At the same time, the subconscious "does not trust" the conscious, some of the decisions, either by temporary criteria or by quantitative loads, but all the information can nevertheless be consciously obtained.

      A recursive analogy can be made to more adequately explain the proposed structure. <br>  Imagine 2 systems.  The first system - the consciousness - the subconscious - the personality. <br>  The second system - a flashlight - the human brain - man. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When we light a dark room with a flashlight, we see objects in the rays of light - a table, chairs, a cat, etc.  Accordingly, the information received is sent through the eyes to the brain, and the person decides whether to look at the object, where to shine further, etc.  As he studies, a person can find a more powerful flashlight in the room, see with his help some other objects that he had not noticed before, for example, a pen under the table, a button on a chair, a mouse tail in the teeth of a cat, etc.  In the end, he can find the switch in the room - and turn it on.  In this case, he will see much more, but will still be limited, as he cannot see at the same time what is happening in front of him and behind him, but if he saw what is happening behind him earlier, he may have an idea what is happening there, and build your behavior accordingly. <br><br>  eleven*. <br>  The problem of building artificial intelligence comes down to modeling human consciousness in a computer. <br>  At the same time, it is necessary to avoid possible errors in modeling, that is, to simulate the broadest possible consciousness (or the ‚Äúsubconscious-consciousness-personality‚Äù system) that will allow the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto more effectively solve the set tasks.  Since a computer has a speed of operations that is potentially higher than that of a person, then undoubtedly an AI can be useful to a person for solving his tasks. <br><br>  However, on the other hand, such a strong zeal for creating AI and the amount of hope associated with its design is absolutely incomprehensible.  If the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis positioned as a model of consciousness (more precisely, the system "subconscious-consciousness-personality"), then it is quite obvious that AI will have the same disadvantages (from a research point of view) somehow: <br>  - free will, i.e.  he can ‚Äúhammer‚Äù into work, and do what he ‚Äúwants‚Äù; <br>  - making mistakes, which is a natural companion when learning; <br>  - dogmatism in some terms, which in principle can be eliminated with time (but only with time); <br>  - etc. <br>  Those.  all the same disadvantages-advantages (which side to look at) as with a person. <br><br>  However, it is obvious that AI has one (perhaps several) indisputable advantage due to its ‚Äúnature‚Äù - the speed of learning.  That is, AI can in a relatively short time ‚Äúlearn‚Äù more than a person (at the same time), which is due to its ‚Äúdigital nature‚Äù.  You can also continue this thought and come up with some other advantage of the ‚Äúartificial‚Äù mind over the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù *: <br>  - lack of physical fatigue, <br>  - accuracy and speed of various calculations, <br>  - the speed of finding new information (due to full integration into the digital environment), <br>  - and others. <br><br>  * - there is no particular fundamental difference between these concepts, since many ‚Äúartificial‚Äù things are indirectly ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, as they are created by a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù person. <br><br>  13*.  From the point of view of paralogy, the intellect of man is only a tool.  In the same way as for a PC user, a computer itself is a tool that helps him to process a large amount of information during calculations, since  The ‚Äúintellect‚Äù, the logical part of the ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù of a person, is poorly adapted to operations with a large amount of information.  This is because most of the human brain is engaged in processing the subconscious information necessary for the functioning of the body, movement, etc.  The amount of information processed is several times larger than the volume processed by the consciousness, intelligence of information (‚Äúthe 3rd circuit‚Äù).  Hence the popular belief that ‚Äúa person uses only 3-5% of his brain‚Äù. <br><br>  From the above, two conclusions can be drawn. <br><br>  1. ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù and ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence is the digital equivalent of a person‚Äù * - things are essentially different.  Artificial intelligence can be considered a modern PC, because  it performs the functions of a logical module of the human brain, and even much more efficiently.  However, to create a digital analogue of the human mind, intelligence alone is not enough.  More non-logical modules, "subconscious", for example, based on neural or quantum computers, are needed. <br>  2. In order to effectively solve problems of vital activity, it is not enough for a person to use only consciousness, the intellect.  It is necessary to pay attention to the subconscious, intuition, i.e.  those structures that are not yet fully understood.  It is they who use the logic not of the Aristotelian, but of three or more significant. <br><br>  * - hereinafter in the text of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is similar to ‚ÄúIR‚Äù, and for ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù the concept of ‚Äúmodule of intelligence‚Äù (analogue of the 3rd circuit) will be indicated. <br><br>  One of the functions of the module of intelligence is the training of "subconscious modules", i.e.  within the framework of the ‚Äúdatabase memory‚Äù concept, modeling, checking the result and fixing it by repeated repetition of the connections between images in one and different situations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46915/</a></p>
