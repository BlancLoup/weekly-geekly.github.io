  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Favorite "iron" bug</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut><br>  <b>Larry Osterman:</b> my favorite bug is the one we found on ICL PWS-400.  It was a new platform from ICL (a <i>British company, bought by Fujitsu in 2002</i> ), and our task was to port MS-DOS 4.1 to this platform.  The project involved five - two from Microsoft and three from ICL. <br>  The PWS-400 hardware was quite unusual: for example, real-mode programs could switch memory banks page by page ‚Äî due to this, applications could run in the background without interfering with one another. <br><br>  We were five developers, we did not have testers;  so we tested the new system with everything that comes handy.  My favorite ‚Äútesting tool‚Äù was a game that Valori ( <i>wife</i> ) brought with her to study.  I don't remember exactly what the game was like;  but every time I played it and reached a certain place, the car suddenly rebooted. <br><br>  We hooked up to the ICE machine (in-circuit emulator ‚Äî a device that lets us know what's going on inside and outside the processor), and found that the processor receives a reset signal from the outside.  So at least the bug was not in the code.

      The guys who collected the car, took the game from me, and began to understand. <br><br>  A couple of days later they returned the game and told that they had found a malfunction.  It turned out that the track to the dynamics passed on the motherboard too close to the restart track.  When a signal of a certain type was applied to the speaker, electromagnetic radiation from the first track induced a sufficiently high voltage on the second track to be recognized by the processor as a signal to restart. <br><br><hr><br><br>  <b>Matt Williams:</b> I remember a couple of bugs that drove me crazy. <br><br>  The first story happened in New York City.  A mouse was connected to one of the computers, which randomly jumped when it only spent on a certain part of the desktop.  But it did not always work.  After some time, we discovered a pattern: the mouse went crazy only at a certain time of the day.  And the place on the table in which she was going crazy also moved with time.  We spent a lot of time before we found the cause of what is happening.  But first I‚Äôll tell you about the second bug: they are related to one another, although they have been separated for about 5 years. <br><br>  By the time I moved to California and purchased a used car.  Before you give it to me, the previous owners told about the strange features of the radio: spontaneously insert the disc for no reason at all.  They contacted the workshop several times about this, but they could not find a fault, and the mechanics simply replaced the radio tape recorder with a new, same model.  This did not help: the fault remained. <br>  Having traveled on this car for several months, I discovered a pattern: the tape recorder spat out a disc only when I was driving in a certain direction ... and, moreover, only at a certain time of the day. <br><br>  So what was the matter?  Both times the sun was to blame.  The mouse had a small gap between the buttons, and when the sun shone at it at a certain angle, the light penetrated inside the photo pairs and caused a reaction, as if from a ball rotating in all directions.  In the same way, when the sun fell through a skylight into the charging slot of the radio, the sensor of the inserted disc worked, and the radio was spat out. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102203/</a></p>
