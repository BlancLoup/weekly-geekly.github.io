In August 2013, a month of access to the TV shows on Turbofilm costs about 120 rubles.  At Vemeo, renting a VPN for a month is comparable in cost - about $ 4 or the same 120 rubles, but the payment options are incomparably greater, and access to the "remote" TV shows reappears by court order. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full text of the update on the Turbofilm administration blog.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hello everyone, I'm sorry that we write posts when we want, but today we begin a week of communication, a week of TV shows and a week of safe Internet.

      Let's start with the first - we will try to answer all the stupid and not stupid questions.  This time. <br><br>  Second, the week-week at Turbofilm is festively open.  What does it mean?  Every day, and even on weekends, 2 series will be released.  They will appear immediately in the TV series tab, without promotional banners on the main one.  We prepared it for a long time, so if we could confuse a sound or a series number somewhere, write right there in a secret connection.  In total, about 25 TV shows will be released, maybe even more.  Soaps there, rye, that's all! <br><br>  Well, the most interesting news is the third.  Our friends this summer did a cool service, which is now the most relevant for the whole situation with Runet.  As you know, in Russia a law ‚Ññ187- was passed on blocking sites on the territory of the Russian Federation.  In October, this law will be tightened and spread to music, pictures, lyrics, etc.  Plus, in addition to everything, we again hear the news of spying on personal data of Internet users.  So, in fact, they made the Vemeo service (we were told that they like the name and don‚Äôt have to laugh at it).  And yes, when using Vemeo - Turbofilm will be free and all TV shows will be available, because the law of the Russian Federation will not be violated, because your IP address will be outside of Russia, because it is right, because it is fast, because it is safe because it's cool. <br><br>  It so happened that now they have made a beta version, but they promise to stabilize it completely in the coming week.  We agreed on special prices for the Turbozheitel, the cost of Vemeo is $ 3.95 per month (all payment options are available, including cards, kiwi, webmoney and others) and access to Turbofilm is given as a gift.  For our part, we will be able to continue to support your favorite resource and please you with TV shows without restrictions. <br><br>  Vemeo is a VPN access system (your computer connects to foreign servers, all your traffic is encrypted with a key, known only to your computer and server).  This gives 100% protection against interception and no one can find out what you are watching, downloading or what kind of correspondence you have.  It works with all sites and can pass all your traffic through an encrypted connection.  Any sites, not only Turbik, of course.  For Windows, a special application has been released that is as easy to use as possible.  For Mac and Linux, they promise to make also convenient programs as soon as possible (now available through manual configuration).  Yes, they are looking for developers on Mac and Linux (if you can help, email dev@vemeo.com).  Yes, they are really cool, we helped them set up the servers, they have an API there, they promised us to do it.  And by October, through Vemeo it will be possible to watch Hulu, Netflix and other sites that are closed to Runet. <br><br>  Yes, as given Turbik as a gift.  You register on Vemeo.com, connect and login to Turbofilm using your login and all videos will be available without recharging the balance. <br><br>  Actually, if you have any questions, write directly in this post.  The guys are sitting under the login vemeo and if anything, we will kick them, so that they will also unsubscribe here. <br><br>  If you are the owner of vpn-services, and you want the Turbik to be available for your users, contact the secret connection, we will talk about how you can configure the server. <br></div></div><br>  The withdrawal of the site‚Äôs user base to foreign channels with traffic encryption is quite a logical step for owners of pirated sites, however, it will inevitably lead to a decrease in the total number of users due to the loss of a less technically competent audience and the need to use additional services in addition to the main one. <br><br>  However, in the case of Turbofilm, such a move has a maximum chance of success.  The site community is closed (even more closed than on Habrahabr) and access to all sections is done only by invitation, and the content is by sending paid SMS, so users can take a more philosophical way to communicate and watch TV shows. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190940/</a></p>
