But only one review of the program seemed to me a little and I decided to arrange an interview with the author of the assembly.  It was interesting to talk to a person who supports and promotes a specific program in runet;) <br><br>  What is it - a hobby or a job?  How is the assembly done?  And why was Maxthon chosen instead of some other browser?  These and my other questions were kindly answered by Vadim Popov.  The resulting interview seemed to me quite informative, so I decided to share it with the habra users =) <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> So, the first question that just suggests itself is to be asked :) Tell us about yourself - occupation, hobbies, etc.

      <strong>Vadim:</strong> My work is my main hobby :) I am engaged in consulting: marketing, advertising, promotion methods.  This year will be 10 years old like.  And Maxthon is like a hobby, for the soul. <strong><a name="habracut"></a></strong> <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> How long have you been using Maxthon?  Tell us how the idea to create your own assembly?  After all, this is no longer just a selection of plug-ins and setting "for yourself", but a much larger work.  And much more responsibility - to users.  Were there any difficulties in organizing the work? <br><br>  <strong>Vadim: I</strong> use Maxthon for more than three years - before that I was ‚Äúsitting‚Äù on MyIE2 (the project from which Maxthon had grown), and switched to Maxthon not immediately, because its first versions were not very stable.  I don‚Äôt remember exactly when it was - I remember that people constantly asked the question ‚ÄúWell, when will the Russian assembly be?‚Äù - many got used to the Russian assembly of MyIE2 (another person did it) and waited for something similar with Maxthon.  But the former collectors for some reason were not in a hurry, and then I wondered if I could do something like that.  After a while my first build appeared, it was almost 3 years ago. <br><br>  The very first version was done in a hurry - I was afraid that if I‚Äôm digging in a lot, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish it :) Literally, the versions were corrected and supplemented in accordance with the wishes of the users right away - good, the board allows you to receive feedback immediately :) The board assembly was distributed for the first few months and was named after him when the project received its own website.  The Maxthon user community on the board helped me cope with all the difficulties, for which I am infinitely grateful to him, and I express this in gratitude on the site, and in the comments to the assembly, and here and now. <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> Why did you decide to build Maxthon instead of, say, FireFox or Opera?  (I suspect that the answer is obvious - because you are using Maxthon yourself =) <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> Yes, and if Opera now has something like an assembly - Opera AC (there‚Äôs just a completely different approach), then FF still has nothing of the kind.  And the Russian assembly Maxthon was a continuation of the tradition - the Russian assembly MyIE2. <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> In that case, a completely fair question arises: did other browsers try and if so, why did you decide to stay on Maxthon?  After all, there are a lot of plug-ins for FF (I don‚Äôt know for sure about Opera, for sure there are a lot of them too) and you can build it with similar features.  (that is, the question can even be reduced to ‚Äúwhy the browser on the IE engine, and not some other?‚Äù, because the necessary functionality can be screwed up with plugins) <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> Of course, I tried (and try) other browsers, I still have 4 installed :) But Maxthon is more convenient for me personally than anyone.  Let's just say: other browsers have certain advantages over Maxthon, but it takes exactly the totality of its capabilities, their sum, which is generally not ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù by any other browser. <br><br>  It would be interesting to look at a similar assembly of FF, but as far as I know, so far nothing of the kind exists - although I think it would be in demand, especially for beginners.  And although the IE engine has its flaws, it also has a lot of advantages: general orientation to it on the network, compatibility, general settings, cookies, etc., use of the system resource - the engine does not need to be dragged along, as a result the distribution kit weighs less at times.  And users have a choice - and this is probably the most important thing.  Interestingly, Western observers often see the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù browsers exactly like this: FF, Opera and Maxthon :) Although in my opinion Maxthon is primarily an alternative to IE, and then Opera and FF, although he is quite able to contend with them that he successfully does :) <br><br>  Everyone just has to decide for himself what is more convenient for him to work with - and how else to do this without trying the program in action?  The browser is such a thing, in the choice of which you should rely only on your own experience.  Even I don‚Äôt have to believe in the word :) Just download and try, and you will know for sure whether it is yours or not :) <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> Maxthon, which you probably use, is still different from the build.  For example, some additional plugins ... If so, then tell me, will they be included in the build later? <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> I constantly test new plugins for Maxthon, selecting the most successful ones for inclusion in the build, so I have installed several dozen of them.  But only 9 pieces are always included and used :) About ten more I connect if necessary.  Maxthon, which I use, most of all looks like a testing ground for experiments :) Although the skin, for example, I have only one, is Ever.  There are a lot of small differences, of course - mostly preferences in the settings, the benefit of Maxthon allows you to change many things.  It is this flexibility that makes it so easy to use. <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> How many people are working on the project now and how much time does it take to support (including the site)?  Share further plans for the development of the project;) <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> One person works directly on the project, but it is me :) But without the support of other users, there is not much to do - there is such an ‚Äúactive core‚Äù about seven people, and the assembly is largely the fruit of our collective work.  The time is spent in different ways :) Since the project is non-commercial, it rests only on enthusiasm, and everything is done in free time from the main work, and this is always less than we would like :) I think a month or three or four working days will be released. <br><br>  There are plenty of plans :) But there is not enough time and other resources to implement them.  You need to do help for Maxthon2, you need to raise a forum on the build site, and there is still an idea to make such a ‚Äúone piece of advice per day‚Äù blog about working with Maxthon.  Who else would have done all this?  :) <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> Do Maxthon developers know about the Russian build?  Do you somehow agree on the work - for example, do they report on the release of new versions in advance? <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> Developers, of course, in the know.  Unfortunately, the release of new versions is not even reported to translators of language files in order to update them in advance in the distribution kit - for this reason files from previous versions are usually found in it :( But I hope this policy will change soon. Updating the build is not It‚Äôs a problem, especially since it takes time to test the new build, so it always comes out with a slight delay. I‚Äôm required not to violate the license agreement and indicate the authorship of the program, which I do. In addition, I support the official Russian language  site-screw Maxthon - <a href="http://www.maxthon2.ru/">http://www.maxthon2.ru/</a> <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> I‚Äôm finished with questions about the build :) Let's talk about free software in general.  What do you think, what are the prospects for free software in Russia?  Will people (in connection with the new copyright law) increasingly pay attention to freeware or continue to use the hacked software without fear? <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> It depends on several factors - the effectiveness of the legislation, the culture of users, their monetary viability.  I think, the warez will never die, just the proportion of people using it will eventually decrease.  And of course, people will always look at freeware with interest and use it, especially since now many programs offer related services, which are also free.  The share of free software will grow, but nevertheless, paid programs will not go anywhere, just legal users will be more.  There will always be competition between paid and free software - both of them have their advantages and disadvantages, and users have a choice - this is the main thing. <br><br>  <strong>Freealt.net:</strong> What free programs do you use?  What would advise readers of the blog? <br><br>  <strong>Vadim:</strong> In addition to Maxthon, I use Miranda, FeedDemon, Media Player Classic Homecinema, Comodo Firewall Pro, Download Master, Dynamic Security Agent, True Launch Bar, TrueCrypt, WinAmp, WinDjView, XP Tweaker and many more utilities that help me in my work - such like autoruns.  Everything that I have listed can be considered a recommendation :) Although, I think many users already have their own preferences.  However, if you haven't tried Maxthon yet, be sure to try it!  :) <br><br>  Questions were answered by Vadim Popov, author of <a href="http://maxthon.org.ru/">Maxthon Ru-Board Edition</a> , for which many thanks to him =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22212/</a></p>
