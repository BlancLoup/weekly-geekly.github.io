For two days, start-ups showed their products to investors, and investors, in turn, twisted their fingers at their heads and held tight to thick wallets.  However, some projects interested investors, and the three best ones received between five and fifteen thousand euros completely free of charge, in the framework of the start-up competition.

      <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155337/">I have already talked</a> about the first day of IDCEE, but I confess that the second day was more intense.  And most importantly, I received an answer to the most important question of the universe and all this: <br>  What do investors want?  During the day, I talked with both startups and investors (mostly angels), and am ready to share with you all the information gathered. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most important conclusion that I made following the results of the conference: there are a lot of niche investors, and for every high-quality startup there is a person who is ready to invest in it.  Investors are very different, there were investors <br>  non-venture: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to risk anything, just give money and watch the growth‚Äù, were niche, interested in musical startups, only advertising, only Ukrainian, only the CIS market, etc. The buyer had any quality product. <br><br>  And products were such: <b>Inventarium</b> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147631/">post on Habr√©</a> ) - support system, in style UserVoice, GetSatisfaction, but on mobile platforms. <br>  Founder (and I don‚Äôt have a team, I understand) asked to send him to advanced training courses in America, in one of the startup incubators.  <b>Penxy</b> project, on the contrary, is based in the USA <br>  (immigrant) and has already received 400 thousand dollars of investments for the service of "talking presentations" on the iPad.  The essence of the service is simple: using your tablet, you can show slides and immediately record your voice, upload your presentation to the Internet, without relying on video recording. <br>  However, not finding the HDMI connector for connecting the projector in the iPad, I was a little surprised.  It turns out that the presentation will be broadcast not to the projector, but immediately to the Internet.  Given the quality of wifi at various conferences, I am skeptical about this idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb6/f4a/fa8/cb6f4afa8c1b3abf9c486c5a4c9a39c7.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://refine.io/">Refine.io</a> is a startup grown in the framework of the Yandex incubator and intended for prototyping mobile application interfaces.  It looks very high quality, has beautiful UI-elements, and the ability to create functional prototypes. <br><br>  I would like to mention the startup <a href="https://www.kitapps.com/">KitApps</a> , because the mobile application of IDCEE itself is made on their platform.  By the way, investors are very praised the opportunity to plan their schedule and possible meetings right in the app.  In addition to applications for the organization of events, in the future programs for schools, restaurants, news agencies will be presented.  The company still does not receive a lot of profit (and their tariffs are $ 249 / year), but the project is quite young - just a year, and so far there is enough money to develop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f83/609/7dd/f836097dd4bcbd0bd11e2dcb53b54f18.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://yaware.com/">Yaware</a> - the embodiment of the ideas of George Orwell within a single company.  The automatic big brother will ensure that employees are less in social programs, and more work.  The application is difficult to deceive - if you have a Word open, and you do not click, and do not type the text - it already records you as a parasite.  The company is looking for patrons and is now expanding to Eastern European markets: to Poland and the Czech Republic. <br><br>  <b>PetCube is</b> one of the few non-software startups.  A cube with a laser pointer will be played with your household scion instead of you. <br>  The device was made first on the Arduino, and then redone on cheaper controllers from Texas Instruments.  The guys don't want money from greedy investors, because they don't want to share such a cool project with anyone.  Instead, they are going to run on Kikstarter.  They have grounds for success in crowdfunding, as they previously worked at Digital Media Agency and will be able to prepare high-quality video and presentation materials. <br><br>  <a href="http://cloudessa.com/">Cloudessa</a> is a very technical start-up, little understood by the average man, the main function is Wi-Fi authorization.  Among the cool features is the ability to log in to the network via a Gmail account, via LDAP, or ActiveDirectory.  A startup is being developed, most likely on the basis of the outsourcing model: there is a development office in Kharkov and management in the USA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd8/432/af0/bd8432af0baa571a2428c942f92974f2.jpg"><br><br>  Social project <a href="http://kuda-komu.net/">To whom</a> it allows you to deal with the injustice of the universe through the legally correct processing of complaints.  Ideally, a startup should completely replace the work of expensive lawyers.  The author of the project previously presented it to TechCrunch, there he distributed only 5 business cards, and at IDCEE they all ended on the first day. <br><br>  By the way, without business cards at such an event, even not worth it. <br>  Too many dating, new faces, companies.  According to British scientists, if you add up all the business cards distributed on IDCEE, you can gird the equator three times.  And if you add up all the money of venture investors, you can feed and educate all the starving children of Africa. <br><br>  And now about the competition.  The clear favorite of the startup competition was ... <br>  <b>Jelastic</b> .  Why suddenly a world-renowned company turned out to be a participant in the competition, I personally do not understand.  You are too cool for this - said investors, including Sergey Belousov, himself once invested in Zhytomyr PaaS company.  The main prize - 15 thousand euros - the judges gave the Russian startup <a href="http://kuznech.com/">Kuznech</a> with visual search technology.  The success of a startup at IDCEE, I think, owes much to the recent purchase of Ukrainian Viewdle by Motorolla.  Yes, exactly, as <b>Dmitry Sholomko</b> said (director of the Ukrainian <br>  Google): "we did not buy anyone." <br><br>  The second place and 10K of the European currency also received the Russian startup <a href="https://flocktory.com/">Flocktory</a> .  With the help of social networks and a specially installed widget, it allows you to improve performance in e-commerce.  The third place was taken by Czechs from <a href="http://realpad.eu/">realPad</a> - designing interior design on the iPad.  Now they will be able to return home by plane, because they traveled to Kiev in a bus for 24 hours, six of them having been left at customs.  Ukrainian border is such a Ukrainian ... <br><br>  The judges very clearly announced their selection criteria: each company had to demonstrate 1) product 2) team 3) market volume.  Kuznech, Flocktory, myPad handled this best.  Although ... A strange fact, but many strong startups in principle did not participate in the competition, but on the main stage of IDCEE there were many companies, even without a prototype product.  I do not understand how they should compete with the same Jelastic.  By the way, Jelastic was recognized as the best startup in the opinion of the audience. <br>  Nationwide love expressed stormy applause.  I want to note that <a href="http://zakaz.ua/">Zakaz.ua</a> is traditionally considered the best Ukrainian startup.  About this, I love to joke that a specially trained nano-boy running to the grocery store turns out to be a better Cloud Hosting company competing with Google.  But here <b>Elena Maslova</b> (Groupon Russia), noted precisely Zakaz.ua - pointing to the impressive momentum of the company. <br><br>  Then there was a grand closing, official speeches, loud music, a cocktail party. <br>  IDCEE was a success, visitors can only sort the kilotons of collected business cards and wait for the next days of the investor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155945/</a></p>
