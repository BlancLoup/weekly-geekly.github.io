  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who needs blog ads?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Who needs advertising on blogs and why is it needed at all if there is banner advertising, contextual and other various high-tech types of promotion on the Internet.  Is it even possible to advertise effectively in the blogosphere?  In this post I want to tell how you can use text ads on blogs. <br><br>  <strong>Example 1 - ‚ÄúInternet giant‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  A large Internet company is launching its new product.  Let it be a trendy video service.  He spends huge amounts of money on banners, contextual ads, optimizers, and maybe even 3 x 6 billboards on Pushkin Square in Moscow.  However, everyone uses Youtube and does not even think about switching to a new super-video service. <a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      With the help of blogs, you can create an information wave that, through recommendations and interesting articles about this new web service, will help to generate interest among the target audience and will allow you to dwell on the features of the site much more.  Maybe it is really much more convenient than Youtube, the video quality is much better, the volume of videos can be 10 times more, and even the authors pay money for adding videos.  It‚Äôs hard to tell about all the benefits with banners or a limited context, but blogs will do it the best they can. <br><br>  <strong>Example 2 - ‚Äúyoung programmer‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  The young programmer has created a brilliant program and wants to successfully sell it and receive honestly earned money.  He can borrow money from a friend and order a couple of thousand impressions on a very steep site, which will be enough for half an hour or more impressions on a less steep site where lovers of Varese come and no one will be seriously interested in buying a program for money. <br><br>  In the blogosphere, you can quickly create a large number of positive reviews about the new product, make it so that many readers feel that without this soft, they will no longer have a sweet life and work at their monitor.  Plus, you can get excellent feedback in the comments and understand what you can fix or add in future versions in order to sell even more copies of the product in the future. <br><br>  <strong>Example 3 - ‚ÄúInternet business‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  You have an online store.  It is not very big, but it is a decent time on the market.  You have gained a delivery system, payment, purchase of goods, everything works fine.  But it turned out that there is very high competition in your field and, no matter how much you spend money on search engine optimization specialists, you are still in the 25th position of all the main search engines and clients come to you most often by accident or on the recommendation of the former buyers. <br><br>  With the help of a high-quality, large network of bloggers, you can increase the number of positive reviews and recommendations about your store, as well as increase the amount of unique information about you on the Internet, which will have a positive effect on both reputation and SEO.  Bloggers will recommend you as if they were your client themselves and most readers will trust bloggers more than search engines. <br><br>  <strong>Example 4 - ‚Äúoffline business‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  A certain American company opened the first coffee house with a legendary name.  This is a very good coffee house with excellent coffee for every taste, various desserts and other goodies.  But something in this coffee shop pushes away Russian coffee lovers.  For example, a name that looks like a large network of low-quality hot dogs or a strange imposition of cups with lids, like at restaurants catering for eating a hot drink on the go. <br><br>  With the help of blogs, you can lucidly tell the whole story of the appearance of the legendary chain of coffee houses, convey its spirit, atmosphere, make it so that visiting this particular coffee house distinguishes people from mere mortals and places them among the most fashionable people who follow the trends.  And the unusual culture of drinking coffee on the go would additionally become an attribute of the modern inhabitant of the megalopolis. <br><br>  <strong>Example 5 - ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù.</strong> <br><br>  You are a major politician.  You definitely need to enjoy your electorate before the next elections.  And you get it.  You do a lot of good things, participate in charity, build kindergartens and roads, transfer grandmothers across the road.  But some bad people interfere with you and slander your bright name through the media through very black PR. <br><br>  With the correct management of public opinion through blogs, much can be achieved.  You can even become a new generation hero and a real fighter for a just cause.  Let people find out all real and maybe even slightly embellished facts about your competitors.  Let the true queen be revealed and people make their own choice;) <br><br>  <em>Of course, all these examples are controversial and all this can be achieved by other methods and methods.</em>  <em>It may even be that you find these examples quite primitive.</em>  <em>However, the blogosphere, with a skillful approach, provides unlimited means and resources for effectively managing public opinion and creating reputation.</em>  <em>After all, this is a direct and often imperceptible entry into the public consciousness of people.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>We do not say that the blogosphere is a panacea and the only correct and progressive type of promotion; however, with skillful use of an integrated approach, a symbiosis of traditional promotion methods with advertising in blogs can produce a very strong and manageable interactive effect.</em> <br><br>  And these are just the simplest examples :) <br><br>  via <a href="http://blog.blogmoney.ru/">Blogmoney</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14085/</a></p>
