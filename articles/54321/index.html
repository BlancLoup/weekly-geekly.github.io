  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Go to open source small office. Experience, reflections</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As promised in one of the comments - I am publishing my experience of switching to Linux.  The story will be somewhat chaotic.  Because I am not a writer and, in fact, this was the transition. <br>  It all started with planning a budget for 2009.  Making a budget, I carried his superiors.  Seeing the amount of 400 tr.  article "The cost of software," the authorities thought. <br>  - With Linux sign? <br>  - Well, at home worth ... <br>  ‚ÄúCan you transfer the office to them?‚Äù <br>  - It is necessary to leave the terminal server on Windows (1c and a number of other tasks), but the rest of the machines, in principle, are real. <br>  And so the transition began.  Distribution chosen ubuntu.  Firstly, because it‚Äôs friendly, and secondly, because I didn‚Äôt really communicate with the other distros. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Problems:</b> <br>  One of the problems was the fear of managers before going over.  Someone told them that Linux is more difficult and they firmly believed in it.  So when I went to the department with the distribution, everyone immediately got super-urgent things :) <br>  Fortunately, the authorities did not rush me, and I acted roughly as follows: in the fight against non-licensed software, anti-virus software was delivered to people (cautiously warning that information C should not be stored).  There were complaints.  A person comes and tells how the computer slows down, and how the network is buggy, but the printer does not print.  Then I explained the advantage of Linux on the example of my machine, which is available on the network, works stably and looks beautiful.  Send the first reinstall.  (Later, when I got tired of waiting for the most inert, I simply wrote out an order to transfer everyone within a month and signed him with the general, there was no way out for me or for the managers). <br>  Another problem was the desktop.  The client of the terminal server, which did not want to roll out of full-screen mode, print from us and was not very good at all.  It was replaced by gnome-rdp, in which you can set the resolution of the remote machine manually, the default layout is en-us, and some other advantages.  Until yesterday, there was a problem with part of the punctuation marks (full stop, colon, ‚ÄúB‚Äù - it was decided elementary. Thanks to the commentators of the topic about the transfer of French gendarmerie to open source).  Gnome-rdp works on the basis of the same rdesktop, these are alternative gui. <br>  In addition, people did not like pidgin, they say unusual.  Run Vine did not want to, therefore, tolerate.  They did not switch to the kutim because in the turnips the old version (and the new one is not very stable).  And there was no desire to put each of the main developers, to make make-install, by downloading libraries with the configuration.  While pidgin.  As soon as the kutim becomes more stable and in the office.  turnips will be updated - we will put it. <br>  The next confusion was the BENQ scanner, which was never going to be friends with Sane.  We decided to install another scanner, and I dragged Benk to the server for experiments.  and lying on the shelf, untouched. <br>  I installed xfce on some machines, because some of the computers have been preserved since very shaggy times, when 256 RAM was cool :) Under xfce, the samba did not always start automatically.  The problem was solved banally by adding /etc/init.d/samba restart to rc.local.  Restart, because sometimes all the same started and the start would lead to the launch of another one.  Although maybe not, I don‚Äôt rub a unicoid, I don‚Äôt know, I just decided that it would be easier, better, safer. <br>  I discovered the installation of ubunt in text mode, when on one of the machines the system did not want to run from X.  Since then, only I use it.  Convenient, faster, clearer what is happening at the moment :) <br>  Maybe there were some other problems that I forgot, and some will appear later, but this is not so important.  2,000 meters - normal flight!  :) <br>  <b>Results</b> <br>  Received a lot of experience, reprimanded for being late, saved 300 TR, got rid of problems with the virus.  (Even antiviruses did not always help out, earlier. Someone from the house will bring an autorun, someone will get a worm, someone will download a letter from the left ...) Besides, the number of requests about ‚Äúeverything broke and nothing works!‚Äù Has drastically decreased.  Due to this, time has been freed up to come to grips with Habr, niksovym servers and Frozen bagel :) Plans to implement help desk based on bugzilla, organize a local mirror of the repository and still refute the opinion of the unfriendly Nix :) <br>  It is possible that he did not disclose the topic, forgot to describe something, but instead of answering questions, instead of giving birth to new ones.  Specify in the comments - I will correct. </div>
