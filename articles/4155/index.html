Consequently, an increasing number of children will be involved in the field of activity of virtual ‚Äúone-armed bandits‚Äù. <br><br>  After these words, United Russia appeals to lawmakers to take measures to curb the activities of various kinds of ‚Äúvirtual casinos‚Äù, as well as to mobile operators with a call to stop providing services related to gambling.

      "Habrahabr" asked to comment on the initiative of "United Russia" service provider <a href="http://www.incore.ru/">"InKor"</a> operating in the market for additional mobile services (VAS).  According to Dmitry Luchkin, director of marketing for the company, mobile gambling only develops as a niche business in the market for additional services, so now he is balancing in search of his audience and growth points.  ‚ÄúStill, he is at the beginning of his journey in Russia, so excessive regulation can simply close this niche,‚Äù says Dmitry.  - Of course, the concerns of the legislators are not groundless, but at the present time not a single mobile service in the networks of a cellular operator will be ‚Äúpassed‚Äù into trial and commercial operation if it does not comply with the law.  Therefore, even under conditions of uncertainty, one cannot speak of the insane prosperity of mobile gambling in Russia.  However, the market needs clear rules - stable and aimed at the long term.  Perhaps the emergence of this law will remove all the questions on this topic, which is why niche players will benefit. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dmitry Lesnoy, the author of the Encyclopedia "Gambling House" and the chairman of the board of trustees of the Russian League of Intellectual Games, believes that the initiative of United Russia is premature, and the danger of hitting everyone and everything in gambling addiction is greatly exaggerated.  ‚ÄúOf course, it is necessary to create conditions for business so that unscrupulous businessmen lose, and not win: they pay fines and lose their license,‚Äù explains Dmitry.  - And these requirements should equally apply to all the realities of our life, including new ones, such as the Internet and a mobile phone.  But we can not stop the progress!  If the Internet has appeared in my life, then I will not refuse the pleasure of painting the ‚Äúbullet‚Äù without leaving the house. <br><br>  As for the SMS, as I understand it, appeals do not come from ‚Äúvirtual casinos,‚Äù as United Russia called them, but from sellers of all sorts of goods and services.  I believe that 90 percent is advertising campaigns that attract people‚Äôs attention to certain brands and brands, and the winnings are likely to exceed the amount collected as payment for mobile phone services. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4155/</a></p>
