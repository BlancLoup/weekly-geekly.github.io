  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accelerated off / on Windows XP</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>* Transferred from the sandbox, thanks for the invite :-)</b> <br>  Hello! <br>  I honestly looked for a similar topic in the search, but did not find it.  Today I want to tell you about what I learned by chance and even was a little indignant.  It turns out that Microsoft has a lot of useful utilities that work wonders!  It is even incomprehensible to me why they are not included as standard in Windows. <br>  <b>1) Accelerated unloading of Windows XP.</b> <br>  There is a utility on the Microsoft website: <b>UPHClean (User Profile Hive Cleanup Service)</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx%3FFamilyId%3D1B286E6D-8912-4E18-B570-42470E2F3582%26displaylang%3Den"><b>Microsoft.com/UPHClean</b></a> <br>  if for some reason you could not download, then you can from here: <br>  <a href="http://www.filehoster.ru/files/bd1910"><b>Filehoster.ru</b></a> . <br>  UPHClean monitors the computer during the process of uploading a user profile and closing open resources.  Honestly, I don't care about English, but as far as I understand, usually after unloading the user, Windows starts scanning the registry and reconciling something there, and when the utility is installed, all this work will be done immediately in real time as needed. .  This utility will register itself as a service and will always hang in the memory (from 1 mb to 5 mb. Each in different ways), and although I am very critical of services that are in autostart, this utility struck me so much that I could not refuse it: -) I turn off in 5-7 seconds.  earlier than 25 <br>  <b>2) Fast loading Windows XP.</b> <br>  I understand that this topic is not allocated enough space on the Internet, but here I will not tell you how to do it super fast by pressing one button. <br>  Bootvis tool <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/sysperf/fastboot/default.mspx"><b>Microsoft.com/BootVis</b></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  . <br>  download <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/BootVis.shtml"><b>here</b></a> <br>  I‚Äôll say frankly that this utility itself doesn‚Äôt really speed up the boot, but with the help of it you can find out exactly in how many seconds your machine boots and what processes, services, drivers cause problems when booting.  By the way, you can do a simple trick to check how much this utility optimizes the download (I think that the results are different for everyone).  Download the program and select Trace \ Next Boot, click OK, then Reboot.  Your machine will start to reboot, you only need to select the right user on time and as quickly as possible when Windows starts to boot :-) I only have one user, so I don‚Äôt have such a problem.  Then wait for the BootVis window to load, which will analyze something and eventually show you a list of diagrams.  On any of the charts will be in a certain position the vertical red line with the finish line.  this is the time for how much your machine loads (of course the number is less than it is for real, but apparently the fact is that this utility does not take into account the program from autoload that you set and counts only system processes).  In any case, this number will have to come to terms with as an abstract performance indicator in the 3D Mark.  Just memorize the number and hit Trace / Optimize System.  Click Reboot.  At the next boot it will already optimize the machine.  Wait for the reboot and output messages that everything went well and do the same at the beginning of Trace \ Next Boot.  Now we got the second number, which in theory should be less than the first.  So we learned how much faster our car is loading now.  For me personally, this utility is useful precisely in the measurement of time rather than in the optimization itself.  For example, I sat down to optimize my brother's computer, completely untouched by me) at first measured it was 70 seconds, after digging in the registry, services, and other garbage, the machine began to load in 35 seconds.  See and analyze the graphics, you can find out which demons start at boot time, what processes slow down the load.  Also very useful feature is Trace \ Next Boot + Drivers Delays.  It will show which drivers are loaded, and highlight in red with which drivers conflicts arise.  This will help in solving some problems ;-) good luck <br>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b>For this utility to work, you need to enable Task Scheduler in Windows services if it is turned off!</b> <br>  <b>Update:</b> During the optimization of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/windows/50367/">Comrade</a> , why the computer began to boot more slowly for 3 seconds, so if you already boot up within 35 seconds, you should not experiment. <br>  <b>Update2:</b> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/egorinsk/" class="user_link">egorinsk</a> warns: <br> <code>  ,    BootVis ‚Äî        ,     ,        perf.etl,        ,     .   .     BootVis.</code> </div>
