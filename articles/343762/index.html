    <h2>  Machine teaches another machine </h2><br>  Google <a href="https://futurism.com/googles-new-ai-is-better-at-creating-ai-than-the-companys-engineers/">‚Äôs</a> AutoML technology <a href="https://futurism.com/googles-new-ai-is-better-at-creating-ai-than-the-companys-engineers/">was introduced</a> in May as a system for automating the creation of machine learning models.  Even then she could design small neural networks that worked on a par with neural networks developed by humans. <br><br>  The Google method is based on two neural networks that are in constant contact, the controlling and the controlled (affiliated).  The child system is trained on the basis of feedback from the supervisor, which <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/google-automl-replicate-next-gen-ml-software-more-capable-human-made-system/">assesses the</a> effectiveness of passing tests.  This process is repeated thousands of times until the desired result is achieved.  In the Google experiment, the neural network was engaged in the recognition of objects in streaming video: people, cars, traffic lights, and so on. <br><br>  Google's AutoML is <a href="http://www.ml4aad.org/automl/">not the first</a> such system.  However, the uniqueness of the latest development of the Brain project lies in the fact that it does not just <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/31952-ai-google-machine-learning-automl">modify the</a> existing models, but selects and modifies them. <br><br><h2>  Why do you need AutoML technology </h2><br>  Development of machine learning systems from scratch is a <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/google-automl-replicate-next-gen-ml-software-more-capable-human-made-system/">resource</a> - <a href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/google-automl-replicate-next-gen-ml-software-more-capable-human-made-system/">intensive task</a> .  AutoML is designed to <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90152427/googles-new-ai-designs-ai-better-than-humans">accelerate the</a> development of new models of MO.  In addition, it <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/31952-ai-google-machine-learning-automl">reduces the</a> threshold for entry into the industry for future generations of researchers. <br><br>  Jeff Dean, head of Google Brain, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/technology/machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-ai.html">said</a> technology will help companies build AI systems, even if they lack extensive experience.  He also <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603381/ai-software-learns-to-make-ai-software/">called</a> automated machine learning one of the most promising areas for research. <br><br>  According to Gartner, by 2020, 2.3 million new jobs <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-will-eliminate-1-8m-jobs-but-create-2-3m-by-2020-claims-gartner/">will be created</a> in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.  The development of development based on neural networks has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html">made the</a> industry competitive, and the largest technology companies are willing to pay high salaries. <br><br>  Google and Facebook are <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/took-ai-class-facebookers-literally-sprinting-get/">creating special courses</a> on machine learning techniques to help their employees grow and attract new ones.  The development of courses, the preparation of methodologies and the writing of books are also carried out by large world universities. <br><br>  Therefore, further, we have gathered <b>useful materials and resources</b> that will introduce you to machine learning technologies.  The selection is based on the recommendations of Hacker News residents and participants of specialized threads on Quora, Reddit and Habrahabr. <br><br>  It also includes our own materials on the topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lq/ho/xe/lqhoxe7yioljvoqkkgl5ayl2lrq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bradleypjohnson/6104744825/">bradleypjohnson</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Books </h2><br>  <b><a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3385117/">Applied Regression Analysis, by Norman Draper and others.</a></b> <br>  A book with the basics of regression analysis.
