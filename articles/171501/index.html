      ‚Äú <i>They say that vulnerability has been found on the site, it is urgently necessary to eliminate it, and then tell me what kind of consequences will come! WHAT? What is the first question the business asks. At that, any profound statements about reputation, the seriousness of the damage, the importance of the consequences, the phrases "well, you understand everything" do not lead to anything. Business does not understand. Not because he is a fool, but because he understands only the question of money (I will exaggerate a little, of course). Show me what time a hole will pour out on the site ? In the money show! There is no direct damage? Show indirectly. You can not posch</i>  <i>a thief?

There are two ways out. Or safety technician understands the limitations of his view of the world and changes it, starting to perceive a much larger palette of colors in the IB world. Or The tech-technician decides to demonstrate in practice the reality of his statements about the seriousness of the consequences of exploiting vulnerabilities on the site.

From interests (and maybe even more from ‚Äúsharpening the brain‚Äù) that lead to writing books like <a href="http://bugtraq.ru/library/books/attack3/">‚ÄúAttack from the INTERNET‚Äù</a> (read one of the first publications in paper form, nostalgia), one of whose authors is Lukatsky (for 1999 the material was quite adequate and relevant), to the calculations of spherical horses in a vacuum.  Although, here I am exaggerating.  There is a place in the information security of course, and all sorts of estimates, and the development of tactics and strategies, and other all sorts of policies and high-level high-abstract cleverness.  It would be foolish to deny it.  But, IMHO, especially in our country, with our legislation and other realities, it‚Äôs all so disconnected from life that even such vacuum bison aeronautics miss hardcore and are not indifferent to the attacks of ‚Äúshkoloty‚Äù with red eyes from lack of sleep.
