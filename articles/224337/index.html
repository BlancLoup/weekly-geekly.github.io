On the other side of the screen at this moment there is a whole team working - the support of the largest Russian cloud hosting.  And today we want to tell you how it works from the inside. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  By default, the sales person is responsible for the online chat.  In this case, of course, there you can ask any questions relating to sales, technical issues and general questions.  If the questions are on the technical part, then the request is transferred to the technical support, which is already answered by phone, through the ticket system or by mail. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      The support is divided into three lines: <br><br><ul><li>  The first line of technical support deals with issues of accessibility and technical issues up to the OS level inclusive, gets tickets and advises clients.  In the case of queries that do not affect the data and do not relate to finance, customer issues can be resolved by any of the available methods. </li><li>  The second line of technical support deals with the level of hypervisors and operating systems, customization of client software, customization, log analysis, integration issues and deep support for customer information systems. </li><li>  The third line of support solves problems globally at the network level, at the level of data storage systems, and is responsible for the architecture and availability in general. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  If the support service receives a financial question, it transfers to the personal manager for the client, who identifies the client, advises if necessary, and adds the required additional services.  Additional services here are understood as some external things like L2 channel or transferring us a USB key, the client can change cloud resources independently and instantly.  In our service contract, almost all possible situations are stated, therefore when adding one or another additional service, additional agreements are not needed. </blockquote><br>  All three lines operate around the clock.  A total of 12 people support: five on lines I and II, seven on line III.  During the day shift there are five people, the <s>most notorious owls,</s> two duty officers of lines I and II, remain at the night stand.  Attendant III line works remotely. <br><br>  There are several ways to ask a question: in addition to the online chat on the site, these are tickets ("Client request" in your personal account), telephone and mail.  However, in the end, all requests flock to the ticket system.  In especially important questions, before processing the ticket, the personal manager contacts the client (the client‚Äôs contact person) and clarifies whether the client really wants to make the specified name, specifying the name of the contact person, contact email and organization name. <img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif"><br><br>  Most often, users have requests related to the administration of virtual machines on VMware and XEN or the functioning of the cloud: <br><br>  TOP3 most common questions: <br><ul><li>  How to log in to VM? </li><li>  How to expand resources (processor, memory, disk, network)? </li><li>  How to backup / restore from a copy? </li></ul><br>  On this all, of course, there are articles in our knowledge base with detailed descriptions and screenshots. <br><br>  Unfortunately, typical solutions like ‚ÄúTried to reboot?‚Äù In our practice almost never happen :) This kind of treatment is extremely rare. <br><br>  As part of customer support, we often have to add users to access their terminal server (active directory, remote desktop), create mailboxes, set up group policies, create dedicated private VLANs, install antiviruses, configure VPN, forward USB keys, administer MSSQL and 1C, plan and propose solutions to improve the architecture of client systems, etc.  At the same time, we try to advise potential clients as fully as possible and offer such solutions in order to avoid difficulties in the future. <br><br>  During the daytime, on average, operators are 70-85% of their time, of which 40% -50% II and III support lines are R &amp; D (Research and Development).  We use R &amp; D to improve current services, expand the functionality of systems, implement / configure monitoring systems, update current systems, test and introduce new equipment, expand the cloud, etc. <br><br>  At night, the average workload is 20-25%. <br><br>  The average time of communication with the client by phone is about 5-7 minutes.  The fastest conversation is less than a minute.  The longest is 15 minutes. <br><br>  On average, we process - including those not yet closed, but awaiting a response from the client for any other clarifications - 30 tickets per day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/469/aed/98a/469aed98ad648cfe31072d53d7416fc9.jpg"><br>  <i>Ticket system through the eyes of the operator</i> <br><br>  A record number of calls - 58 tickets per day.  We still do not know (as there were no problems with the infrastructure) with which it was connected - storms on the Sun or just such a day. <br><br>  Before closing each ticket, the client can evaluate the decision of the request on a 5-point scale.  In addition, personal managers contact clients to clarify the satisfaction of solving a problem and are interested in possible wishes. <br><br><h4>  What the? </h4><br>  Non-standard cases in our practice occur infrequently, but there are.  At the end of last year there was a serious DDoS attack with 5 million packets per second.  Since we, by the nature of the business (deployment of the infrastructure of corporate clients) were not aimed at protecting against large DDoS attacks, we had a hard time.  The attack was on our host, and on intermediate operators, watered all.  A detailed description of the attack we have laid out for our users on the website: <a href="http://cloud4y.ru/about/news/poyasneniya-k-intsidentu-svyazannogo-s-ddos-atakami-v-period-s-31-12-2013-po-05-01-2014/">cloud4y.ru/about/news/poyasneniya-k-intsidentu-svyazannogo-s-ddos-atakami-v-period-s-31-12-2013-po-05-01 -2014</a> <br><br>  But, as they say, that does not kill you makes you stronger.  To repel the attack, we: <br><br><ul><li>  introduced additional communication channels </li><li>  introduced traffic filtering </li><li>  increased number of uplinks </li><li>  added a secure peer, added the ability to transfer traffic through Voxility - the largest provider of Anti-DDoS solutions </li></ul><br>  In addition to DDoS, you can recall the case from one of our clients - a Russian system integrator and information technology provider for corporate customers, as well as a 1C solution provider.  the client for some reason did not backup.  Although we have repeatedly reminded him - you just need to put one tick in the cloud control panel.  The client has destroyed the meta-data on the ext3 file system and lost critical information.  As employees of this company told us, if they could not recover the data, they would lose at least 1.5 million rubles. <br><br>  Thanks to solutions from NetApp snap restore, we made snapshots and after several attempts ext3 was successfully restored.  This method was most appropriate due to the urgency of the issue.  As a result, all customer data has been restored.  Admins in the end did not even fired.  They also came to our <a href="http://cloud4y.ru/contacts/">office</a> to thank me personally, and they brought in very good beer. <br><br>  And today, our tech support has Habr's day.  Ask questions and we will answer them in the comments.  And thank you for your attention :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224337/</a></p>
