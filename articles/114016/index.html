We met for a chat, and at the same time I brought him two beautiful bags.  He ordered one for himself, another decided to give to his wife.  This was my first sale of bags.  For a friend, of course, at a wholesale price. <br><br>  We met, walked around the complex, looked into the boutique bags, looked at the prices, looked at each other, and a friend said: "Let's go, I will treat you to a chic coffee."  And it was from what: the bags cost him three times cheaper. <br>  Yes Yes!  If you only knew what kind of cheating goes on such a simple and ordinary thing ... This is incredible!  Three times!

      I have two shops on the Internet: my favorite is a tent-tourist and, behold, the second one, opened only recently, is sumochny.  And, if the tourism margin is only 20-30 percent, then they all give at least a hundred to the bags. <br>  And this is a very, very interesting moment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first story: in war as in war, or tell me your name</b> <br><br>  There is a typical scheme worked out in the unfair sector of the Internet market.  I cooperate with a supplier or manufacturer, he gives me RRP.  And the RRP is translated as ‚ÄúRecommended Retail Price‚Äù - the price below which I can‚Äôt go down.  And what's more, if I am a wholesaler, then I am obliged to give a hat to those my dealers who lower this price. <br><br>  The manufacturer regularly monitors prices online.  And so, he stumbles upon the price below the RRC.  And looking who is such, whose dealer, with whom to end the relationship. <br><br>  The standard situation is when such a dealer is diligently hidden.  He has a lot of customers, the goods are coming, the flow is adjusted.  Who wants to lose such a dealer? <br><br>  But here other dealers are wary.  And they start to worry: how is that?  What does he allow himself?  He spoils our business. <br><br>  Honestly, the situation is from the category of unpleasant.  In essence, it is close to the copyright situation.  After all, everything is stuck in the information exchange.  If you know where it is cheaper, then you go there.  Find where cheaper - here all the search engines at your service.  You can go to a regular store, touch, and then on the Internet - and where would it be cheaper? <br><br>  If you look, as it seems to me, objectively, then everything is quite simple: you cannot forbid people to rummage through the net.  Exchange information is also prohibited.  No matter how you resist high technology - the struggle has long been lost.  And there are two options: either re-educate people, or knock on the pumpkin sellers. <br><br>  In the first embodiment, we have a zombie.  This is bad.  And I will not talk about it. <br><br>  In the second version, we have a harsh reality.  Knock.  More like knocking.  Yes, but without much success.  It's like a fight with a hydra: one head will be cut down, two will grow.  You will catch one dealer - in another place their two new ones are sitting. <br><br>  And the way out?  Hmm ... I know that Adam Smith was an uncle of genius.  But he drew us utopia.  Children's utopia, naive, and therefore unviable.  Remember, he had about wool?  They say that wool is grown in England, because it is cheaper to grow there.  And carry around the world, because to grow it somewhere else more expensive than to deliver.  This is where our uncle Adam made a blunder. <br><br>  Take Moscow.  What do we have about the delivery in Moscow?  There are 200 rubles to any point within the Moscow Ring Road.  And it turns out that if everyone lives honestly, observing the RRC and kosher, the prices will be the same everywhere.  But where is the market?  Where is the competition? <br><br>  Already on Habr√©, everyone who is not too lazy has written that they need to communicate with the client, be polite, kind, come beautiful, sell nicely, take care of the client and take money with a bow.  I agree.  The client for us is a friend, comrade, food. <br><br>  I will say this: I have 80 percent self-delivery if you count Moscow.  Delivery is a rarity. <br><br>  By the way, no one wants to earn some money by courier? <br><br>  Uh ... back to the topic.  So here.  The client - if we talk about my client - is ready to break into a cake, make calls from a mobile phone one hundred times a day, spend a lot of time and money, if only to save two hundred rubles for delivery or to receive a hundred rubles from an order. <br><br>  And I can not throw him off.  I have a RRTS, but I want to live with the manufacturer peacefully and pleasantly.  Yes, I can deliver the delivery free.  But this is only 200 rubles.  These are not two thousand, which everybody throws off.  I live in such conditions that I have to play by the rules.  Not in favor, however, of the same client, whom you need to love, but it turns out that way. <br><br>  And so, somehow I'm going home at night and I think: what to do?  Just then a new dumper appeared.  And plug it fails.  Somehow, apparently, kickbacks are running where it is necessary and how it should be.  How to pin him down?  After all, no one knows whose dealer he is. <br><br>  Remember Archimedes ran naked?  So I almost did not run naked either.  In the thirty-degree frost. <br><br>  And when I got home, I did the simplest thing I was capable of: I found out the ip of the damper.  And then I got into the code and drew the simplest if there: <br><br> <code>if($ip=='xxx'){ <br> echo ' 100 '; <br> }else{ <br> echo ' 1000 '; <br> } <br></code> <br><br>  <b>History Two: Adam Lee Smith, or Gasoline Prices</b> <br><br>  Well, gasoline prices are rising, prices for delivery from the Chinese are falling, cars are running on nuclear energy, and we ride the 95th, millions with metro tickets do not complain.  This is all the lyrics.  Although ... if I had gone by subway, I would have been standing somewhere for a long time with a poster "In the USSR, the fare cost 5 kopecks." <br><br>  Do you know how much the delivery of a tent to Sakhalin costs?  And I know!  A tent worth 5,000 at the Sakhalin post office will cost 8 plus a percentage for a money transfer. <br><br>  By the way, this is all arbitrariness and mega-cheating.  I pay for the packaging, I pay for the shipment, I add all this to the cost of the order, and then another blatant mail takes from the client for the postal order.  I have a hundred times customers came to the post office with the blood, and the blood was not enough.  And in general, even where it was honestly written, how much the mail will take for the transfer.  It seems to be on the mail site is 6-10%, but perhaps 550 rubles - is six percent of the 3 thousand?  Or ten? <br><br>  Here's how to make the client know in advance what will be there and how will it be?  I understand, there are calculators of the cost of mailings.  Glitch, however, godless.  But they are.  Merry such.  Funny.  Index want to calculate.  And where is the index to take?  Will his client enter?  The client, my relatives, will never enter anything.  The client enters his name in the ‚Äúfull name‚Äù field about ‚ÄúLena‚Äù or ‚ÄúVasya‚Äù.  And you want an index. <br><br>  Have you already seen a naked man running outside?  Get ready.  The second time ran. <br><br>  There is such a nice service: <a href="http://ipgeobase.ru/">ipgeobase.ru</a> <br><br>  Honestly: I do not know how good he is.  It seems to be a little mistaken.  Yes, and I do not need much.  In general, just right.  We take. <br><br>  And we also take the base of the indices of the cities of Russia, merge together.  What is the result?  Right!  It turns out that when a person comes to me, I already know in advance how much he will pay at the post office.  Well, plus or minus a hundred or two hundred rubles. <br><br>  But this is already nice! <br><br>  And if you immediately play with the price of the goods?  Then even nicer.  A person comes to the site and sees: ‚ÄúOrder a bag right now and get a mega-price of 1000 rubles instead of 1500‚Äù.  The truth is that the delivery is 500. And in the end, the same 1500 are drawn.  What is not an advertising campaign? <br><br>  My bags - goods in the order is usually single.  Girls take one bag.  Not two, not three.  One.  And when you offer them this, they start writing letters of appreciation.  Oil to the soul. <br><br>  <b>Uh, thank you for your attention.</b> <br><br>  A fairy tale is a lie, but there is a hint in it ... Do not like it - do not listen, but do not bother to lie ... In general, gentlemen, a while later.  I still have not fed the cat and the wife does not kiss.  I'll go.  And thank you for the fact that my next midnight nonsense was read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114016/</a></p>
