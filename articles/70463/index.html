  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ways of student self-development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the advent of twitter, the amount of interesting material falling into my field of vision has increased.  I pay special attention to what is connected with self-development, as well as with work for students.  And the other day I came across this <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/yinmeetsyang/entry/developerworks_reaching_out_to_students_this_semester_talking_with_laura_niemi%3FS_TACT%3D105AGY83%26S_CMP%3DTWDW%26ca%3Ddth-mydw">article</a> .  It is called "The three main things that a student must master before getting a job in an IT company." <a name="habracut"></a>  The topic is close to me, since I am a student myself and self-development, as I said, I am very interested in.  I will not cite the whole article, I will give only the main thoughts: <br><br><ul><li>  Analyze the employment market, find out what is most in demand at the moment.  And do not forget to get new knowledge and learn from experience where it is possible - this will allow you to focus on really significant things. </li><li>  Be online, both for learning and to search for new contacts in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour interest. </li><li>  Use the resource like <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/university/students/%3Fca%3Ddth-mydw">Student Portal</a> with maximum benefit. </li></ul><br><br>  The article, in my opinion, is certainly an interesting, but more than an interesting topic was not disclosed there.  Therefore, I would like to write about my view on this aspect of student learning - preparation for entering a job as a programmer, as well as enhancing skills after. <br>  But first, a small lyrical digression.

      <br>
      Today I have been working as a programmer for 3 years and since September 1 I have become a fifth-year student.  I study at the Faculty of Informatics of one of the best universities of our city, and always thought that at our faculty are gathered for people who are interested in developing.  But as practice shows, many study only within the framework of the course that is given to them according to the curriculum.  And for a long time I thought that this was due to the fact that my fellow students are so static people.  But communicating with them on this topic, I realized that people simply are not aware of what is today.  Both in terms of technology and in terms of any means of obtaining new information, such as for example RSS readers or Twitter.  Therefore, to write this article I was motivated by the desire, to help those students who want to develop further, but do not know where to start. <br><br><h4>  0. Set yourself a clear goal. </h4><br><br>  To come to something, you need to know where to go.  Therefore, we must set ourselves clear goals.  For example, get a job in a particular company.  This will allow you to narrow down the field of studied technologies, as well as to begin contacts with representatives of this company, in order to understand the direction of further movement. <br><br><h4>  1. Start reading. </h4><br><br>  No matter how trite it sounds, first you need to start reading.  Read a lot and quickly.  Make it a habit and make it interesting for yourself.  On the day I look through 40 different articles.  I read some completely, some just flip through, some postpone for later, but I still read some time later.  In addition, through reading we get new information, reading replenishes our vocabulary and helps us further when we write and speak. <br><br><h4>  2. Start writing. </h4><br><br>  For example, you can start with a paper diary.  Or from an account in a live journal.  What to write?  Write your thoughts, ideas, status, just statuses. <br>  Why it is needed.  When we write, we formulate a thought.  Thus, while writing any notes, we learn to think correctly, correctly, concisely and completely.  Agree, this is a very important skill.  Mandatory re-read your notes, let's read them to other people.  After all, what seems right and logical to you may seem absurd to other people. <br><br><h4>  3. Start talking. </h4><br><br>  In principle, this is a logical continuation of the previous paragraph.  At first, just say what you wrote.  Then try to tell it, imagining that you tell it to the public.  Make reports at the institute, read essays by ear.  Very important is reading from memory.  Moreover, it is desirable to keep in your head not memorized text, but key theses, on the basis of which you can develop your thought further.  And we also learned to think in the previous paragraph.  As a hint, you can write out on a small piece of paper, or even on the hand, keyword hints. <br><br><h4>  4. Go online. </h4><br><br>  Probably it will be the most voluminous item. <br>  First, get yourself a normal mail, which contains your initials or full name.  In the future, you will be sure to send your resume to the employer‚Äôs company or to conduct correspondence on the network.  So, when I receive a letter with a sender like myasnik1989@somemail.ru, then the first desire is to send this letter to spam. <br>  Secondly, subscribe to well-known blogs, in the area that you are just interested in, in particular, the same Habrahabr.  For simplicity, get yourself an rss-reader, save a lot of time, since all interesting articles will be read in one place.  and two tips: <br><br><ol><li>  do not start too many subscriptions - you will be lost in the mass of messages </li><li>  I recommend the google reader, since this is a web application, and I really like the opportunity to fumble and read other people's shared entries, and it looks nice. </li></ol><br><br>  Also, I strongly advise you to create an account on Twitter.  For me, Twitter is one of the main sources of new information, since every day it discusses all possible technologies and finds solutions to a great many problems. <br><br><h4>  5. Try and do. </h4><br><br>  Be sure to try interesting technology for you.  If you just read an example, then there will be no benefit from it, because nothing will be put in your head.  First, just copy it.  Then try to change something, see what comes out.  Personally, this process often delays me, and such ‚Äúgames‚Äù with technology allow it to be better studied. <br><br><h4>  6. Learn to plan. </h4><br><br>  Having a class schedule in your hands, think about when it is more convenient for you to do this or that lesson, read the next article, write a new piece of code, and so on.  It is important not to forget about the rest.  Write all kinds of plans and schemes.  Written is not forgotten.  And it is important to keep all these records in sight, regularly view and keep up to date. <br><br>  These 7 tips in my time could help me a lot.  Hope they help someone now. <br>  Crosspost from my <a href="http://andrebrov.blogspot.com/2009/09/blog-post_23.html">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70463/</a></p>
