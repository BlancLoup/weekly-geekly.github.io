Below are the most interesting questions for the year and the answers to them in one place. <br><br>  <b>- What is emergency inter-network roaming?</b> <br>  This is a special mode of the network, when any call is perceived by the network as ‚Äúits own‚Äù.  Usually, the AMR regime is activated in disaster zones, for example, last year this was done during flooding in the Far East.  The subscriber will have a connection, even if his ‚Äúnative‚Äù base station is damaged.  In the usual situation, you can also use any available network for emergency calls: the phone 112 works even if it is in a foreign network.

      <b>- What will happen if I start talking in Moscow, and finish in Vladimir?</b> <br>  In the Beeline network, a call up to 30 minutes will be charged at the base station where it was launched, that is, at Moscow tariffs.  After 30 minutes, information about the current cell will be updated. <br><br>  <b>- Why when I speak on the phone, I always understand that I can hear, but on the voice communicator - not always?</b> <br>  Because the mobile phone generates ‚Äúcomfort noise‚Äù when the subscriber is present at the other end of the line.  This noise is almost inaudible, but it gives very clear feedback. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>- How do I move from one base station to another?</b> <br>  If there is a handover (subscriber transfer agreement) and the nearest neighbors are specified in the settings, the stations will agree among themselves and transfer you without interrupting the conversation.  If there is no handover, the call will be interrupted and the phone will switch to another BS.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/202498/">Details here</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Why are conversations longer than 40 minutes interrupted?</b> <br>  There is a time for the maximum duration of the call, this is not necessarily 40 minutes: it depends on the network settings.  When this time is reached, the connection is terminated.  This is done to insure the subscriber from the account, which can come if you forget to hang up.  In addition, sometimes the subscriber equipment has technical failures, due to which the call continues even when the person decided that he had hung up. <br><br>  <b>- Why when there are many people around, the network is inaccessible?</b> <br>  Physics can not be fooled: there is a limited number of channels in the range that can be processed by the base station.  If the channel capacity is exhausted, you need to wait for its release or move to another base station.  In 3G networks, even with a large number of subscribers located on the border of the cell (which is a very frequent phenomenon in complex premises), even if the capacity at the base station is not yet exhausted, the quality of the 3G signal (signal-to-noise ratio) may drop so much that the connection will be unstable .  Also, the effect of reducing the quality of communication is noticeable in large cities, when traffic jams on the road. <br><br>  <b>- Why then in traffic there is a good signal level?</b> <br>  Because we screw these <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/194000/">things</a> to the posts. <br><br>  <b>- Is there LTE on the iPhone?</b> <br>  Yes, in the Beeline network, you can access the LTE network on iPhone 5C and 5S (if you have connected for a long time, you need to replace the USIM with a new one that supports LTE, it‚Äôs free in the nearest office).  We can only promise for those certified by Rostest, but in practice it works for almost everyone.  iPhone 5 LTE has not yet received - it works in a different range that is not used in the Russian Federation.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/204894/">Topic with the details</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What does the "Forbidden" signature mean for almost every operator in the network selection list?</b> <br>  This means that this operator is not included in the list of priority network selection for roaming.  For example, if you go to the elevator and lose the signal of the ‚Äúnative‚Äù base station, but at the same time have the signal of another operator, your phone will not be able to connect roaming through someone else's network.  More info <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/204874/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What ranges are used by Beeline for LTE?</b> <br>  2600 and 800 MHz.  We will go to the regions from 800 MHz: with the fact that for it the allowed band is already, it allows covering the area 4 times more around the BS. <br><br>  <b>- Is it possible to heat the head with the radiation of the phone?</b> <br>  Yes, due to radiation - if you place the phone in the center of the head and turn on the maximum power, then by 0.01 degrees in 10 minutes.  Another thing is that a processor or other components can be heated in the phone, and this is what you will feel during a long conversation.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/202216/">Calculation</a> <br><br>  <b>- Where is the phone's radiation less?</b> <br>  Near the base station, when the reception is good, the phone uses the minimum transmitter power.  Therefore, it is better to make long conversations in a chair opposite the window, and not in an elevator, for example. <br><br>  <b>- What is the easiest way to reduce the power of the transmitter of the phone?</b> <br>  Stop covering the antenna with your hand.  90% of people hold the phone wrong.  Find where the antenna is and do not block it with the palm of your hand.  Most often the instructions have a picture of how to hold the phone. <br><br>  <b>- What happened to the connection in the Far East during a flood?</b> <br>  Here are the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/200784/">details about the restoration</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Is it possible to get a separate base station in the basement?</b> <br>  Yes, if you are a legal entity, you can rent a femto cell.  And after a while - and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/198804/">buy</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What can be done to have a good reception in a large building?</b> <br>  Here are some <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/194960/">examples</a> . <br><br>  <b>- How is the connection made where there is a distant plant, and there is nothing at all around?</b> <br>  For example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/178325/">so</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What are the service cases in the north that are not found in other regions?</b> <br>  Antenna <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/175069/">falls asleep with snow slide</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Which is safer: 3G / LTE or Wi-Fi in a cafe?</b> <br>  In most cases, definitely, a closed connection over an encrypted channel to the operator.  Paranoid <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/162913/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Why the status of the account abroad can be updated day?</b> <br>  Because the operator, in whose network you are located, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/162175/">does not</a> send data about conversations <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/162175/">immediately</a> . <br><br>  <b>- How is the connection in the subway?</b> <br>  Antennas are located at various points in the station lobby to cover it as efficiently as possible.  In the tunnel most often laid a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/151430/">special cable</a> with whip antennas along the entire length.  In the middle of the tunnel it is met by the same other cable from another station. <br><br>  <b>- Why do we need antennas that change the angle of inclination?</b> <br>  To more accurately cover clusters of subscribers at different times.  For example, in the morning, exit the subway, and in the afternoon - a traffic jam at a crossroads nearby.  Here's more about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/192430/">base station equipment</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What happens if the power at the base station turns off?</b> <br>  The station will work on the UPS for several hours, then leave the network.  Most often, during this time, either the power is restored, or an emergency command with a generator arrives.  Here is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/163279/">an example of the situation</a> . <br><br>  <b>- What outgoing channels do base stations use?</b> <br>  Most often - a cable connection or optics for communication with the core network.  Quite often - radio relay lines, on top of which IP works.  More rarely - ZSSS (satellite communication terminals), atmospheric lasers or other exotics. <br><br>  <b>- What happens when the main network breaks?</b> <br>  A brigade arrives, cuts 20-120 meters of cable, makes an insert.  Typically, the trunk line allows you to embed up to 15 kilometers of such inserts. <br><br>  <b>- Can I get an IPv6 address for a mobile phone?</b> <br>  Yes, but for now as part of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/207162/">test</a> . <br><br>  <b>- How resilient is the Beeline backbone network?</b> <br>  Rings are used everywhere, so you don‚Äôt even notice most accidents.  But two years ago, we broke the ring with two construction sites at once in two places, so now we are building cuts, turning the network into a mesh structure.  The same is done at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/206590/">level of urban networks</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208628/</a></p>
