Well, how do some people get to collect, for example, half a million bucks for the production of sunglasses?  And yet, it turns out.  And they give money.  And such projects - just heaps. <br><br>  Conventionally, all startups in the production of sunglasses can be divided into two groups.  The first, the most appreciative, is related to ecology and recycling.  The second is technological.  Lenses, materials and so on - focus on that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the first.

      <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hempeyewear/hemp-eyewear-hemp-fibre-sunglasses/description">Hemp Eyewear</a> - pressed hemp glasses <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/770/cd6/51f/770cd651f5974f9787de422ec9ba0e12.png"><br><br>  The project has collected almost 40 thousand pounds - about 70 thousand dollars.  What, I ask?  On the design, slicked by Oliver Peoples?  On the most common polarized lenses, is it true, for some reason, with an eco friendly friend?  No!  On the word Hemp on the bow, that's for sure.  Because of the pressed hemp, even with the addition of flax fibers, they have done everything a long time ago.  But the glasses did not do.  So here's your points for 70 pounds. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/255313600/stave-custom-fit-whiskey-barrel-sunglasses%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">STAVE</a> - wooden glasses by your standards <br><br>  It is not clear what a friend is counting on, but nonetheless.  Here are glasses made from Jack Daniels wooden whiskey barrels.  And make them under your individual sizes.  For only 525 Canadian dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53d/eb0/7ab/53deb07ab244435785567030d422dd11.png"><br><br>  Three models are presented - an exclusive exclusive, as spelled in the advertising text.  Each exclusive - only 99 pieces.  So if necessary - they are waiting for you.  Two backers are already there.  There will be three. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1532030130/chief-eyewear-unique-sunglasses-with-a-difference%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">CHIEF EYEWEAR</a> - glasses made of bamboo and recycled skateboards. <br><br>  Well, where do without recycled skateboards, which in Australia - and the project comes from there - more than kangaroos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e5/222/147/7e522214729f4ac09fe22628cf67ad85.png"><br><br>  Designed in the style of the classic Wayfarer, polarized lenses with colors to choose from, UV 400 UV protection, no plastic and the price of 70 Australian dollars at the funding stage.  Like?  Order <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1532030130/chief-eyewear-unique-sunglasses-with-a-difference%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">here</a> . <br><br>  Now let's go through the most technologically advanced glasses.  As it turned out, there is also a place for scientific and technical progress.  Let's start with models for athletes. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sealz/sealz-rapid-transition-glasses%3Fref%3Ddiscovery">Sealz</a> - sports glasses transformers <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b03/0db/425/b030db425391475380d95e0410f86860.png"><br><br>  Another project from Australian Extremes.  Sports glasses for almost any kind of sport - running, triathlon, surfing, sailing and even swimming.  ‚ÄúHow to swim?‚Äù - you ask.  ‚ÄúYes, for swimming‚Äù, - the inventors of the prototype will answer you and click on the buttons on the points of the glasses. <br>  A special system of tensioners will tightly fix the glasses on the head, and the soft silicone pads on the inside of the rim will not let the water get inside. <br><br>  Glasses, of course, everything is on the level - protection, polarization and you can‚Äôt scratch it just like that.  While they are asking for this functionality from 79 Australian dollars, then 179 are expected in retail. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johngalley/orion4sight-sunglasses-on-steroids/description">ORION4Sight</a> - the most popular points on Kickstarter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/76e/3d9/d7076e3d92e84cbcb429278ecc7bb5fc.png"><br><br>  It would seem that glasses like glasses, sports, the same Oakley has many.  But no.  With lenses here the situation is very complicated and patented.  The fact is that Orion Technology has been supplying glasses of this kind to the US Army, all kinds of cats and hawks for two decades.  And more simplified, without army frills version decided to test on Kickstarter.  The result is more than 300,000 collected bucks and almost 3,000 backers.  How these magic lenses work, read <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johngalley/orion4sight-sunglasses-on-steroids/description">here</a> , and there are only $ 190 points. <br><br>  From sport glasses and unique lenses we move on to the tech frames: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/objectiveelement/kolstom-classic-carbon-fiber-sunglasses/description">Kolstom Classic</a> - carbon fiber glasses. <br><br>  That just does not make of molded hydrocarbon fibers.  Now here are the glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a08/443/71a/a0844371a8cc4af9bd4001d6755cc6b8.png"><br><br>  Again, the classic Wayfarer design, multi-layered lenses with polarization and protective layers.  But the coolest here is the frame.  It is made of carbon with a characteristic woven pattern.  And they all seem to be good, but, as they say in <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5895870/carbon-fiber-sunglasses-sound-so-so-so-greatuntil-you-stop-and-think-about-them">Gizmodo</a> , something did not work out with the design, they are big.  And the head in them looks small and wooden.  For your blood $ 200. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093465669/jackhawk-9000-titanium-bottle-opener-sunglasses/description">JackHawk 9000</a> - glasses with titanium opener <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093465669/jackhawk-9000-titanium-bottle-opener-sunglasses/description">arms</a> <br><br>  Who says beer and high technology don't go together?  That super successful project ‚Äú <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chug/the-drinking-jacket-the-ultimate-drinking-accessor">Jackets for drinkers</a> ‚Äù, now here are the glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e60/927/751/e60927751d1c47ca869068fe394509cd.png"><br><br>  The sun practically does not heat up, does not break, the lenses are excellent.  What else does?  Only a bottle of cold, for complete happiness.  Yes, and $ 90 per pair. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2093465669/the-lume-aerospace-grade-titanium-sunglasses-that/description">The Lume</a> - Titanium Glasses <br><br>  The guys from the Commons Designs Group, who presented their pair of glasses with aerospace titanium arms, were more serious about the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fe/b61/b77/0feb61b77f2e4341b3a7841f0f77d011.png"><br><br>  Design in the style of the 70s, unique lenses with a new polarization technology, very light and balanced.  Plus, the original marking on the arms, the type of application on expensive Swiss watches, glowing in the dark.  And for only $ 189.  Well, if the clock is suitable. <br><br>  And we will finish the review of the most promising, in the opinion of startups, projects for creating sunglasses - an absolute champion. <br><br>  We present <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tens-the-real-life-photo-filter">Tens</a> points that collected almost 375 thousand pounds or almost 600 thousand US dollars on Indigogo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef9/c05/f13/ef9c05f130394499827cec5b9a3a7831.png"><br><br>  So what?  Soiled design, acetate frame.  And suddenly such a budget.  And the thing, as you understand, in the lenses.  Only the warm spectrum of sunlight is omitted, and the picture is obtained like on the good old Polaroid: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5a/5cf/3b0/c5a5cf3b06754cb585f3c040d2b81ca0.png"><br><br>  Cool?  Controversial.  But what is really cool is how this money is collected on color pictures.  Technologically, it is easy to find a filter.  But how to find out what exactly this consumer wants?  Only by placing the project on thematic sites. <br><br>  And finally, the most useful project of all projects.  Foldable <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alisonw/flipcase-a-collapsible-sunglass-case/description">Flipcase</a> case for glasses.  How many we lost them, how many frames we broke.  But now everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c2/59f/426/0c259f4265394004be5e5f0a50032b2b.png"><br><br>  A handy thing: a rigid box assembled, flat - disassembled.  Put in a pocket or bag, does not take up much space.  Yes, and fits almost all sizes of frames.  $ 22 is a small investment, if the glasses are expensive, agree. <br><br>  In general, as you can see, the original idea can be filled with any, the most ordinary thing - the same sunglasses.  And declare yourself to the whole world.  Good luck. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374857/</a></p>
