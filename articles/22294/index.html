  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Large Hadron Collider will create a time machine?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the coming weeks, the first time travelers from the future may appear on Earth. <br>  Physicists around the world are eagerly awaiting the launch of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the price of 4.65 billion pounds - the most powerful particle accelerator in history.  As expected, this device will provide new information about particles and forces acting in space, as well as reproduce conditions close to those that occurred soon after the ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù that gave rise to the Universe. <br><br>  Professor Irina Arefieva and Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences Igor Volovich from the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow believe that a large-scale experiment at CERN, the European Center for Particle Physics located near the Swiss Geneva, could lead to the first time machine in the world, the magazine reports New Scientist. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The launch of the collider, scheduled for early summer, can be a historical milestone, since time travel is possible - if they are possible at all - only in the past, counting from the moment the first time machine was created. <br><br>  Thus, 2008 could be the ‚Äúzero year‚Äù of time travel, scientists say. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtime travel was born when Albert Einstein‚Äôs colleague Kurt G√∂del, using the theory of relativity, proved the fundamental possibility of moving into the past. <br><br>  After the appearance of his hypothesis in 1949, eminent physicists often tried to refute such an idea, since time travel undermines the principle of causality and threatens with paradoxes: a time traveler can go back in time and kill his own grandfather, but then he could not have appeared to the light. <br><br>  By the way, 60 years have passed, and there are no fundamental objections as to why time travelers will not be able to leave historians out of business. <br><br>  According to Russian scientists, when the energy of the LHC is concentrated on a subatomic particle (a trillion times smaller than a mosquito), with the fabric of the Universe, which scientists call ‚Äúspace-time‚Äù, strange things can happen - this fabric can change. <br><br>  Earth's gravity slightly bends space-time, and the LHC is able to distort time so much that it closes in a ring.  This phenomenon of physics is called a ‚Äúclosed time-like curve‚Äù - it allows, at least theoretically, to return to the past. <br><br>  This scheme has something in common with the theory proposed in 1988.  Then Professor Kip Thorne and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena demonstrated that space-time tunnels - wormholes - could open the way to time travel.  This theory became popular due to the novel ‚ÄúContact‚Äù by Karl Sagan, which later was used to make a film. <br><br>  Professor Arefieva and Dr. Volovich are of the opinion that the LHC is capable of creating wormholes and thus providing time travel.  ‚ÄúWe realized that closed time-like curves and wormholes can appear as a result of particle collisions,‚Äù explains Professor Arefieva. <br><br>  However, before the emergence of Doctor Who imitators, many more obstacles will have to be overcome.  One of them is the fact that only subatomic particles can pass through mini-wormholes. <br><br>  As the researchers stated to the Daily Telegraph correspondent, the idea that the journey of subatomic particles in time to the LHC can open doors for people-travelers is a ‚Äúdeep and interesting question‚Äù.  ‚ÄúBoth these problems and many others require further study,‚Äù the scientists stressed. <br><br>  Probably the most we can hope for is that the LHC will show signs of wormhole existence, says Dr. Volovich.  If part of the collision energy in the LHC disappears, this can be explained by the creation of particles that pierce time through the wormhole. <br><br>  One of the pitfalls in the wormhole concept is an attempt to find an exotic force that can keep them open to time travel. <br><br>  Dark energy - the mysterious anti-gravity force, which is believed to act in the universe - may, according to scientists, be exactly what will allow to keep the wormhole open.  At least, supporters of one of the interpretations of this phantom energy, as it is called, think so. <br><br>  If a collision of particles, coupled with phantom energy, allows us to create a wormhole in Geneva this year, the civilizations of the future will probably learn about it from history textbooks, calculate this moment and use advanced technology to pay us a visit. <br><br>  ‚ÄúObservation data does not yet exclude the possibility that phantom energy exists,‚Äù said Robert Caldwell, a physicist at Dartmaus College in Hanover, New Hampshire.  ‚ÄúAs for the conjectures of Arefieva and Volovich, as if the LHC would make it possible to create a time machine, ugh on them!‚Äù <br><br>  One of the leading scientists who believe that time travel is possible, Professor David Deutsch from the University of Oxford, says: ‚ÄúThese are hypothetical fabrications, but it is essentially impossible to find fault with them.  However, I believe that this mechanism will not work for a number of reasons (that is, the path for messages from the future will not open), even if their guesses are correct. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dr. Brian Cox of the University of Manchester adds: ‚ÄúThe energy of billions of cosmic rays that have entered the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere over five billion years exceeds the energy that the LHC can create.  According to their logic, time travelers should already be here.  If these wormholes appear, I promise to eat my hat, which was presented to me on my birthday even before I received it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml%3Fxml%3D/earth/2008/02/06/scitime106.xml">www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2008/02/06/scitime106.xml</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22294/</a></p>
