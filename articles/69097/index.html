For those who have not yet discovered this project for themselves, or simply hurried on business, passing by, but forgot to return to get to know him better, and this article was written ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What was a year ago ... </h4><br>  Having visited the excavations of the cultural layer of the Internet, I found the following lines: <br>  ‚ÄúOn the Internet, a <a href="http://bookmix.ru/">social network of book lovers BookMix.ru has appeared</a> , where a unique atmosphere has been created that is conducive to communicating with like-minded people ... for those who want to express their thoughts about the books read and get to know the opinions of other participants ... reading books is not just a useful exercise, developing intellectual abilities and general knowledge, reading books is a way of life ... " <br><br>  It‚Äôs probably better not to say, although the project is definitely not only for ‚Äúreading fans‚Äù, here everyone can create a personal online library, decompose read books ‚Äúon the shelves‚Äù, get useful information about a particular book and save valuable time on reading what you really shouldn't touch.

      After some time, a local article dated to the first month of the project‚Äôs life was unearthed and carefully restored.  Better than the eyewitness of the first steps of the project, no one will describe these steps, therefore I cite a link to the description of the main functionality and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/38952/">what was before</a> you <a href="http://eretik.habrahabr.ru/">eretik</a> . <br><br><h4>  What now? </h4><br>  I myself have been on the site for about six months and the first thing that caught my eye and with what I first came across was the speed of reaction to the wishes of users.  If someone offers any really useful innovation, he can be sure that: firstly, he will be answered instantly, and secondly, after a couple of hours (yes, hours), the innovation will work full time on the project.  This, of course, is about some small functionals, but this is a fact - there was no chance to meet a more rapid support service. <br>  As regards the functionality as a whole, useful innovations take place here on a regular basis. <br><br>  The second is a nice design and user-friendly interface, which over the six months has been supplemented with various "usefulness" and has become therefore more convenient <em>(although there is still something to work on, the UI experts will support me :)</em> . <br><br><img src="http://s57.radikal.ru/i158/0909/b9/529d5c4786c2.gif" alt="Social network of book lovers BookMix.ru"><br><br>  Thirdly, now <a href="http://bookmix.ru/actions.phtml">reviews and essay contests</a> are held regularly with pleasant prizes for any reader.  And of the latest useful and long-awaited innovations, I will mark the beginning of a cycle of <a href="http://bookmix.ru/groups/viewtopic.phtml%3Fid%3D482">online meetings with the authors of books</a> , which is an undoubted and bold plus of the project. <br><br>  The fourth is an obligatory recommendation component in such cases, which makes it easy to find ‚Äú <a href="http://bookmix.ru/bestbooks.phtml">to read?</a>  ". <br><br>  Fifth, sixth and tenth - a pleasant social circle, overgrown with new interesting participants and discussions.  And although I am a reader rather than a writer myself, I don‚Äôt notice an increase in the mass of useful information coming from the fingers of the keyboard, the participants are growing every day. <br><br>  But in the twenties, I can not recommend to get acquainted with the project and, perhaps, to purchase for myself another resource from the category of "must have" in the bookmarks. <br><br><h4>  Finally... </h4><br>  I would like to wish the creators of the project success, the implementation of current plans, new ideas, user support and, accordingly, the next anniversaries! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69097/</a></p>
