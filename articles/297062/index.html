Imagine how many letters go nowhere. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Many brands use personalization of letters to make customers feel that they are not a regular mailing bot, but a real living person.  Personalization is a very important part of email marketing.

      <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9pisem%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest service</a> allows you to automate a personal approach to the client, so we constantly monitor this market to make your product even better. <br><br>  Personalizing letters is not such a complicated thing.  It can and should be done!  To prove this, I prepared 8 great personal emails from the Internet industry. <br><br><br><h3>  1. Trigger letter from jetBlue </h3><br>  This email (sent one year after starting to use the service) personifies the creative approach of the brand, which uses a very ordinary event to advertise a little.  Type: "Look, we have been together for 365 days."  JetBlue uses the client's registration date to remind him of himself. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/419/e98/47e/419e9847eac4611fab588de2bd246597.gif" alt="image004" width="567" height="1024"></a> <br>  <strong>Translation of the letter:</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Do you know what the date is?</i>  <i>What?</i>  <i>Do not say you forgot!</i>  <i>We have been together for a whole year!</i>  <i>-</i> <i>We send you letters 365 days already!</i>  <i>Not bad, right?</i>  <i>We have something to remember: remember that first time when you received your first sales letter or the time when you received a discount on your favorite destination?</i>  <i>We will even forget that time when you accidentally deleted our letter, we understand that it was not on purpose!</i>  <i>-</i> <i>It doesn't matter if you suddenly forgot about the anniversary - we love you anyway!</i>  <i>How about this significant date?</i>  <i>Sea, mountains, spa resort, whatever - choose and we will do it.</i>  <i>Everything will be on the highest level.</i>  <i>- The</i> <i>traditional gift for the first anniversary is a ticket to somewhere.</i>  <i>For example, on a plane!</i>  <i>Try it.</i>  <i>-</i> <i>Let's go!</i> <br></blockquote><br><br><br>  If you are a client of <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9pisem%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing">Carrot Quest</a> , there is a simple option - create <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/anatomiya-triggernyx-rassylok/">trigger letters</a> for different segments.  Just to divide users by the time of their registration, their actions on the site, interests and features.  Such letters are very easy to automate, they are sent after the user action, which you specify in advance (in this example, it is 365 days after registration), plus you can filter the audience (for example, send only those who actively use your services). <br><br><br><h3>  2. Client knowledge from Spotify </h3><br>  Here is another cool example of how to use the interests of the client to show him relevant and valuable information in a letter. <br><br>  Non-standard appeal in the letter is especially effective, since  it gives the letter a shade of reward: after all, the client has long been using the services.  For example, phrases such as ‚Äúbest listener‚Äù or ‚Äúone of the first‚Äù give the letter exclusivity - making the client feel special.  It is easy to set up when you collect data about the actions of each user on the site.  You do not need the help of a programmer; in <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/anatomiya-triggernyx-rassylok/">Carrot Quest,</a> every marketer or any other specialist can set up such scenarios. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/59f/79c/50d/59f79c50de8bee16198b2be4744b04eb.gif" alt="image006" width="537" height="881"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Translation of the letter:</strong> <br><blockquote>  <i>Thanks you!</i>  <i>You are our best listener!</i>  <i>Hey.</i>  <i>This is Charles Kelly from Lady Antebellum.</i>  <i>You have received this email, because</i>  <i>You are one of our top listeners on Spotify.</i>  <i>Thank you for listening to our music so much!</i>  <i>I am going on a solo tour and I want you to be able to buy tickets to my concerts one of the first.</i>  <i>Preliminary sales will start on October 14 at 10 am and will end on October 11 at 22.00.</i>  <i>You can buy up to 6 tickets.</i>  <i>Password - Believer.</i>  <i>I have a new single out and I would like you to listen to it on Spotify: ‚ÄúThe Driver‚Äù with Dirks Bentley and Eric Pasley.</i>  <i>I hope you will like it!</i>  <i>-</i> <i>BUY TICKETS HERE</i> </blockquote><br>  At the end of the letter is the CTA-button, which reminds the client to listen to the new song of the artist on Spotify.  And again, this button allows us to understand how the client is actively using the service. <br><br><br><h3>  3. Actual offer from Amazon </h3><br>  If you look at the costumes for Halloween on Amazon, after just a couple of days, they will send you a letter in which they offer products similar to a ‚Äúplastic pumpkin mask‚Äù.  Some masks look pretty cool. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e39/fd1/87a/e39fd187a870b886ab182a4c3a2e1216.gif" alt="image008" width="462" height="1024"></a> <br><br><br><br>  This letter is a great example of how to build communication with a client based on his behavior on the site and how to push him to purchase.  We offer our customers various options for mailing: <br><ul><li>  Manual mailings (when we segment users by their actions on the site: what products looked, what they were interested in, etc., after which we send the actual letter); </li><li>  Trigger mailings (letters are sent after a user performs an action; in the example, this is a review of Halloween pumpkin masks). </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/anatomiya-triggernyx-rassylok/">Here are some case studies like the Carrot Quest mailings</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  4. Gradual involvement from Dropbox </h3><br>  One of the coolest examples of how to use customer behavior to improve service. <br><br>  After the client enters Dropbox on several devices and logs in everywhere, the service will send him a letter in which he will remind him of the chips he did not know about.  Without any special effort, this improves customer involvement in the service. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/639/dc0/b26/639dc0b2697e4e12c9197e25adeba77d.gif" alt="image010" width="600" height="699"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Translation of the letter:</strong> <br><blockquote>  Hi, Cory.  Don't you have just one computer?  By installing Dropbox on each device, you can: <br>  - save the file immediately on all their devices <br>  - work anywhere and from anywhere. <br>  - access your photos, documents and videos from anywhere. <br><br>  Try it! <br><br>  Thank you for using Dropbox. <br>  Dropbox command. <br><br>  PS Get extra space here! </blockquote><br><br><br>  Telling your customers how to properly use your product, taking into account the peculiarities of their behavior, you greatly increase the percentage of their retention, while encouraging customers to make additional purchases.  Just think about it: the more a client uses Dropbox, the more space they need (and as you know, the extra space costs money). <br><br>  Consider how you can make your service or service the most ‚Äúaddictive‚Äù in terms of getting used to it and set up a newsletter that will allow users to learn about new products. <br><br><br><h3>  5. Creating a sense of urgency in a letter from ModCloth </h3><br>  A couple of ideas that you can borrow for your mailing, give us marketers of Modcloth.  If you are engaged in e-commerce, you should look at the chips of this letter. <br><br>  Everything in the letter is edited and imprisoned for maximum personalization.  For example, the main theme of the letter - ‚Äúdamn, what you liked, almost all have already sold!‚Äù There is even a smiley.  It is very important to adjust your tone, style of speech and other things in your letter. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9b6/586/03e/9b658603e62fc7c8c67fb3f493a639b2.gif" alt="image012" width="600" height="931"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Translation of the letter: <br><blockquote> <i>Hi, Lover</i> Modcloth <i>!</i>  <i>Your product in the basket has almost ended, bought up everything!</i>  <i>-</i> <i>Hurry up and do not miss the opportunity to purchase this cool product at</i> Modcloth <i>.</i>  <i>If you go to the site, and the goods are gone, do not be hard!</i>  <i>At least you will always have your good taste! :)</i> <br><br><br><br>  <i>Enjoy your shopping.</i> </blockquote><br><br><br>  By the way, this tactic, reflected in the letter, is based on the client's behavior on the site and facilitates the understanding of the client‚Äôs wishes.  In this case, the client received a reminder of an abandoned basket.  This approach is incredibly useful for e-commerce, especially in the pre-holiday period.  And during the holidays themselves will not interfere. <br><br>  We have already told how to <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/urok-8-personalnyj-triggernyj-email-marketing-na-primere-broshennyx-zakazov/">set up letters about abandoned baskets in the Carrot Quest</a> without any problems and with the help of a programmer. <br><br><br><h3>  6. Netflix knows how to keep a client at the screen. </h3><br>  To retain users, Netflix sends equally important emails with recommendations for viewing.  They are well aware that they have a huge content base in which it is difficult for the client to figure it out for himself.  Netflix in letters recommends new movies to viewers.  Naturally, all these recommendations are based on the interests of the subscriber. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/135/179/2d7/1351792d7474468405fed6731177e846.gif" alt="image014" width="588" height="662"></a> <br><br><br><br>  The letter is recommended film. <br><br>  By recommending a movie, Netflix confirms the fact that the user does not pay for a subscription for nothing.  In other words, by keeping their interest in movies, the service keeps their subscription. <br><br>  This approach can be used with any marketing materials: books, webinars, blog notes, etc.  For example, if you notice that someone has downloaded a book dedicated to tips on working with social services.  media, set up an automatic newsletter, inviting them to stop by and watch your new material on this topic on Slideshare. <br><br><br><h3>  7. Pinterest </h3><br>  Pinterest sends out personalized letters and offers new topics for viewing, given the user's past activity on the site. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9c0/410/3e1/9c04103e1da8a7b21ead9e042b6abca1.gif" alt="image016" width="596" height="1002"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Simplicity is especially important in this email.  6 topics to choose from are quite enough to interest the addressee, no more, no less. <br><br><br><h3>  8. Birchbox </h3><br>  Birchbox is a team that uses personalization as it should - they all hint at clients quite transparently, they say, "we spied on you and your purchases history a bit before writing this letter."  Birchbox assures that their offer will be interesting to me.  In fact, it is. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b56/792/f0d/b56792f0dd4d9faebeb2f334c404ba9f.jpg" alt="image018" width="326" height="1024"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Thanks to these letters addressed personally to the user, they assure their values.  All this effectively works on loyalty to your brand. <br><br>  Personalizing newsletters is a great way to increase customer loyalty. <br><br><br><br>  With pleasure, the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3D9pisem%26utm_campaign%3Demail-marketing"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> team is a service for automating Internet marketing (which combines eCRM, online chat, email distribution, pop-ups and web analytics). <br><br>  Some of the information was taken and transferred from the HubSpot blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297062/</a></p>
