And now I propose to focus on production aspects - testing, prototyping, mass production, delivery and after-sales support. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Samples and Tests </h4><br>  Obviously, the goal of all types of testing is to reduce the risk of unpleasant surprises in the following stages.

      So, we have completed the development phase, and we have finished prototypes.  What is it and why?  A prototype (or prototype) is a device that was assembled using prototyping technologies according to our design documentation. <br><br>  To make sure that prototypes meet all the necessary requirements, we carry out a variety of tests, they are never enough, they depend on the company and product.  The main tests include pre-certification tests, functional tests, EMC, electrical safety, climate control, etc. If the product works in a system, tests are carried out "in the field", usually they give much more valuable data than the synthetic tests of the device.  You can endlessly test the router on synthetic tests, but until you turn it on to the real network and start solving real problems, you cannot understand whether it works normally or not. <br><br>  Within the framework of one project, a huge number of prototypes can be made - for choosing materials for the hull and components.  There are things that can not be modeled even in the most modern CAD systems: tactile sensations, how pleasant the device is to hold in your hands, the marquess of the plastic, its brilliance, the sensation of the weight of the device.  Only a live comparison of different options allows you to make the best choice. <br><br>  In our realities, prototypes are made on equipment for mass production, but using other technologies.  For example, plastic is not molded, but milled or grown, since the creation of a molding mold is a long and costly step. <br><br>  The main goal of all tests is to make sure that the product is ready and what exactly the buyers want.  This concludes the development phase.  The next step is the production of products for mass production. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b0/13b/991/5b013b991a2a1543367869df4e282cb7.jpg"><br>  <b>An example in the photo:</b> working prototypes of the first in Russia commercial <a href="http://promwad.ru/portfolio/mnogofunkcionalnyy-mini-server-ak-systems-ip-plug">plug-in computer IP-Plug AK Systems</a> , developed by Promwad.  On the basis of the prototype created, the hull was tested for collection, various options for placing holes for the interface connectors, etc. were evaluated. <br><br><h4>  Production Phase </h4><br>  Now our goal is to create a device production technology in certain circulations with predetermined deadlines, cost and quality indicators. <br><br>  First you need to decide on the production site.  As a rule, large companies choose their production partners in advance.  For startups, the choice of production is a separate story, it is often at this phase that they think about the production process as such, not earlier.  Therefore, you can see a lot of prototypes, developed in various small companies and at the same time very few products that are sold in series. <br><br>  In electronics, as a rule, devices are developed for a specific production, since  it has technological processes, component supply, logistics, contracts, etc.  Otherwise, at the stage of putting into production we have to determine the technical processes, the supply chain, coordinate the logistics, link all this into a clear plan. <br><br>  <a href="http://promwad.ru/uslugi/postanovka-na-proizvodstvo">The choice of the production site</a> is like the choice of the bride.  I have carried out this procedure several times in Southeast Asia and sifted out unsuitable manufacturers in search of ‚Äúthe very one‚Äù who will provide quality and acceptable commercial conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5dd/c58/659/5ddc58659176e67552de14f5585c38e9.jpg"><br><br>  When production is selected and all the nuances are agreed, the real work begins.  One of the tasks - the creation of equipment. <br><br><h4>  Tooling production </h4><br>  An important milestone in putting it into production is the development and production of tooling.  The most common is a mold for molding plastic parts.  Any other equipment can be produced that allows for various technological operations: bending, stamping, etc. <br><br>  In general, tooling is important, the quality of the mold will directly affect the quality of the molded plastic. <br><br>  Another interesting point - <b>check the quality of equipment</b> .  One body can be examined, sniffed, measured and made sure: this is what you need.  But what if there are thousands of them?  As a rule, the golden sample is made - the same Golden Sample with which it is necessary to compare all other samples in case of doubts.  A sort of standard kilogram in the chamber of measures and weights. <br><br><h4>  Production quality control </h4><br>  In the production process, everything is tested and at all stages, since  any joint can cost a lot of money and it‚Äôs better to thoroughly prepare yourself for the tests.  In any case, it should be so. <br><br>  What is being tested: <br><ul><li>  Each component from the manufacturer of the components.  When these components arrive at the factory, they are retested immediately prior to installation (selectively or all in a row).  Most production tests everything in order to ensure maximum quality. </li><li>  Printed circuit board (and from the manufacturer, and before sealing). </li><li>  Optical quality control of installation. </li><li>  In-circuit testing of the already assembled board. </li><li>  Functional testing.  For complex devices, stands are created that can quickly and accurately test the functionality of the device and ensure that everything works. </li></ul><br>  Still, after all these manipulations, the average quality indicator for the industry is 0.5% of the percentage of defects.  For China, 1% is acceptable, i.e.  every hundredth device will be with a jamb.  That's quite a lot for the series, so good companies set the bar at 0.1% or even lower. <br><br>  Somehow we communicated with a representative of the Chinese trade fraternity about the acquisition of one electronic component.  On the open market, its price was about $ 15 apiece, and this guy offered for $ 2.  To the question ‚Äúwhy is it so cheap?‚Äù, He answered: ‚ÄúBecause there is exactly 30% of the marriage there.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo exactly 30%?  And if there is more? ‚ÄùWe asked and in response received a tempting offer:‚Äú Then I will fill you with more ‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, counterfeit components are a serious danger for any production.  The number of fake, non-working and defective components on the Southeast Asian market is amazing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/095/096/3e7/0950963e7f6ba3870189c3c7a35a5474.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Issue installment party </h4><br>  So, we have the equipment ready, we have brought the necessary components, we understand our testing plan and are ready to start production. <br><br>  It all starts with a small series, for example, with 10 devices.  On them we catch errors in technological chains.  There may be problems with the components, with the tests, with the workers, with the phase of the moon.  All these things must be tracked and made so that it does not affect the quality and performance of the product.  The necessary corrections are often made so that everything works like a clock. <br><br>  After all the problems are fixed, a little batch is issued.  Say 100 pieces. <br><br>  Different markets impose different requirements for certification and verification.  Certification is often done on devices from the first batch, after which it becomes possible to legally install the cherished CE, FCA, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee2/5c0/aac/ee25c0aac07cbfd4d289ab55bba4bd18.jpg"><br>  <b>Example in the photo:</b> the same plug-computer (mentioned above), but already from the installation batch, which passed the CE certification (European conformity).  The body is made on the basis of the injection mold. <br><br><h4>  Batch production and supply phase </h4><br>  Serial production in management theory is a good and understandable process: somewhere there is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù into which you load the cache, and it issues finished products that can be loaded into ships / airplanes and sent to buyers. <br><br>  In practice, production is an everyday solution to problems, not just technological ones.  For example, the component went up.  Or comes a request to replace the component without any changes in the release dates.  Or, worse, as a result of ‚Äúcost optimization‚Äù, the device stopped working. <br><br>  As a result, it is necessary to keep the engineering staff, which will understand the problems, finish the documentation and, of course, finish the software, at the stage of the production and the production itself. <br><br>  But all problems are solved, sooner or later everything starts to work and after that the focus moves to measuring the quality of the finished product. <br><br><h4>  Support and service </h4><br>  You should think about this already at the stage of product development.  It is necessary to answer the questions: will the device be serviced at all or after a breakdown should it go to the trash can?  Who will serve him?  In which countries / regions will support be provided? <br><br>  Large companies often form their own technical support centers close to sales centers.  Smaller companies outsource this. <br><br>  The cost of support is usually initially included in the price of the goods.  Companies have statistics on their product, industry averages, and their own targets.  For example, a bar is set at a cost of $ 2 per device.  And then managers puzzled over how to organize it.  Thus, support is a purely costly part, and, therefore, its quality is not very good. <br><br><h4>  What is left outside the engineering department? </h4><br>  I mentioned in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/171269/">first part of the</a> article that some of the components of the product development process remain outside the engineering department: <br><br><table cellpadding="5" width="700"><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>  Packaging </li><li>  Brand </li><li>  Logistics </li><li>  Production </li></ul><br></td><td><ul><li>  Sales channels </li><li>  Service maintenance </li><li>  Infrastructure </li><li>  Intellectual property (patents, etc.) </li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Most of these questions are within the purview of the <b>product manager</b> , who, in essence, is responsible for ensuring that the product is successful.  What should be the planning process, how to count the product ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù, how to make up the requirements and interact with the contractors to make it good?  I would like to devote a separate post about product management in electronics to the answers to these questions.  Traditionally, with the interest of readers. <br><br>  Questions, comments and clarifications are welcome. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> No production worker after reading this article was hurt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172771/</a></p>
