It is possible that many of you are already familiar with Qihoo 360 products - someone has already installed an antivirus for their friends and colleagues, someone just tried out promising software, and someone even saw our logo for the first time and wants to know how to secure the computer as much as possible. <br>  Here we go? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Simple, powerful and ... free? </h2><br>  I bet this is the first thing that comes to mind?  Why is an antivirus with such characteristics and declared virus omnivorousness distributed right and left to everyone?  Why not make money on sales? <br>  Internet security remains one of the basic needs of modern man.  Understanding this, we have developed a powerful antivirus that can protect data on computers, tablets and smartphones.  Distributing it for free, we have created a user base that is constantly growing - users try, understand what works, recommend to friends, and they pass the baton on.

Having such a base, we monetize it unobtrusively by offering paid applications and products of our partners - web games, online video, travel, etc.  It is important that banners do not occupy 60% of the screen space, annoying our customers, and all products are offered in a special store. <br><br>  Everything is transparent and simple, friends.  We make a quality product, increase the user base and monetize it through the sale of applications and partner products.  Do you doubt?  Ask questions in the comments and you will get comprehensive answers to them. <br><br>  In the meantime, let us explain why the number of users of 360 Total Security antivirus is growing so fast. <br><br><h3>  One solution to computer problems </h3><br>  From the very beginning we decided that to offer the user only computer protection is the last century.  It is much more logical to use the capabilities of modern software in order to solve all the problems of optimizing the device, including the operation of RAM, hard drives and secure online social networking in one fell swoop. <br><br>  Naturally, this had to work on the filling.  We combined several popular engines and anti-virus systems in one product, including the 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãCloud Scan Engine, 360 QVMII AI Engine, Avira and Bitdefender, which provide a full set of anti-virus tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/680/09e/68b68009eefb08c1dd08a088b0e6b6f6.png"><br><br>  <b>As a result, instead of the usual protection, we offer simultaneously 5 functions:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Quickly check all the parameters of health and safety with one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f9/5f5/898/8f95f5898627457e8faabc63627d96c1.png"><br><br></li><li>  We find and eliminate viruses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ded/775/8f7/ded7758f702145228c359878dcf5f00f.png"><br><br></li><li>  We configure services, including autoload, plug-ins and optimization of Internet connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa2/757/53a/aa275753aa3a42ea95d94096bb9795d4.png"><br><br></li><li>  We clean up hard disks from junk or obsolete files that the user does not use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d8/0d0/103/1d80d01039144eee899cf076df490826.png"><br><br></li><li>  We offer a set of additional tools - browser protection, sandbox, 360 Connect function, firewall and disk compression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/a92/86b/f2ba9286b53a4a7cb2456f30e1af6509.png"><br></li></ol><br><br>  Separate words deserve technical support for the product.  You can email us with any question and suggestion or not wait for an answer and find it in frequently asked questions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/791/238/e2d7912387e54a70b4a13f5962df1bd1.png"><br><br><h3>  Now in Russian </h3><br>  Starting with the seventh version of the antivirus, users have access to a fully Russified interface.  Although intuitive icons helped to use 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãTotal Security without any problems earlier, now the number of fans among the Russian-speaking population has increased dramatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/444/864/16a/44486416a922449ea5ce99a8aaf8dc6d.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Mobile security </h3><br>  Taking into account the amount of mobile traffic, we could not ignore the tablets and smartphones that were left defenseless.  Development in this segment began in November 2009, so we were among the first to think about gadgets.  To date, all developments have resulted in a full-featured product 360 Security, which is friends with Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58b/4c8/4ef/58b4c84efd824fb3bb281b821e412a9b.png"><br><br>  Mobile application provides multilayer protection: <br><ul><li>  anti-virus databases are updated in real time, so that even the latest Trojan or worm will break its teeth; </li><li>  stop the "brakes" in the work, because the program monitors the optimal distribution of RAM and instantly disables secondary tasks; </li><li>  garbage in the form of pieces of old programs and useless APK files does not accumulate in the device‚Äôs memory; </li><li>  Under additional protection are personal data - logins and accounts, account numbers, contact lists. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/adf/1eb/4cdadf1ebc524f3bbc5592747bbf4b10.png"></div><br>  In China alone, more than 800 million users use our product, and this number is growing every day! <br><br><h3>  Have you tried 360 Total Security? </h3><br>  We honestly told about our product.  Now you know why our antivirus is free and what is inside it. <br><br>  Our blog is a convenient way to ask a question to developers or suggest a topic about which you want to know more.  Write - it is very important for us to know the opinion of the Russian-speaking audience.  Therefore, if you didn‚Äôt like something while using the antivirus or there is a reason why you deliberately bypass our products, tell us about them. <br><br>  <b>It was nice to meet you and see you in the comments.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278205/</a></p>
