Knee-deep in Mr. do not go to the house on the dark alleys, in which to go something scary. <br><br>  There is no hope for the government and officials, and there can be no - they just don‚Äôt need to equip anything, they took care of themselves.  And alone you can only improve some very small details. <br><br>  On the other hand, there are not so few people around who also want the environment in which they live to stop causing disgust and despondency.  And some of them are even willing to invest in this time or money.

      The question is how to unite these people, how to make a tight rope woven from thin strings.  By joining forces and ceasing to think that someone owes us something other than ourselves, we can take the initiative in our own hands. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the basis of the map-api, you can make such a service.  There is a map of the city, you can mark problems on the map, for example, potholes in asphalt, lack of lighting, dirty lawn, etc. A person can look at the problems in his habitat and tell how much he is willing to invest in solving this money problem. <br><br>  Contractors look at what problems how much people are willing to spend money, and if an interesting amount is accumulated - to put forward their commercial offer.  Next, the site administration considers the proposal, collects money, interacts with the contractor to solve the problem.  Taking it while a percentage of the money received.  All reporting, cost estimates and results should be open.  If the contractor or administration fails, others are selected.  If they do it, they get new and new orders from other areas. <br><br>  That is, the site administration and contractors will earn money, and those who fold off will receive a well-kept and safe living environment. <br><br>  In fact - it turns out a system of voluntary taxation.  Naturally, people pay taxes and so, and all of the above should work without the initiative of citizens, but if you wait for it to work and the officials start working honestly, you can live your whole life in the mud. <br><br>  Moreover, not everyone living in the area will pay for the improvements, but to reap its fruits (or even destroy them) - everything.  Reasonable question: we will pay, and they will use for free?  It turns out that way.  But again, what is more important: to live in a normal environment or not to allow neighbors to live in it for free? <br><br>  As I imagine examples of typical scenarios. <br><br>  For example.  In the high-rise building in which you live a moody lawn, dogs walk on it, throw garbage, trample down grass.  In the high-rise building an average of 100-200 apartments.  If 30% of people throw off 1,000 rubles, it will turn out 30-60 t. P.  This amount is enough to buy lawn grass and hire a janitor for the whole summer, who will clean the lawn from debris and dog shit, cut it, etc. <br><br>  If you expand the idea for the whole district, then with the money raised you can hire not a separate janitor, but an organization that will be happy to follow all the lawns in the district.  And at the same time you get well-groomed areas throughout the area, and not just in front of your house, but it costs one person as much. <br><br>  Well, with a lawn, everything is just more or less.  But what to do with the roads?  They are municipal property, and for their own re-laying it is possible to have problems, because it is illegal? <br><br>  But after all, nothing prevents to collect money, hire an organization that knows how to properly lay the roads, and let them order these works in the appropriate municipal organization, but at the same time ensure the quality of their implementation.  Everyone will get the money, no one is offended, everyone is happy. <br><br>  Or you have a lot of unlit areas on your way home.  This issue is also solved with the help of municipalities.  Moreover, for a subscription fee, you can agree with the police party organizers or private security guards to patrol sections of the road from parking lots and public transport zones to entrances. <br><br>  In general, the scheme is simple: <br>  Identification of problems; <br>  Accumulation of the money supply; <br>  Contractor selection; <br>  Quality control. <br><br>  That is, all that should provide good municipal structure.  But qualitatively and on their own. <br><br>  I understand that the idea is perhaps naive and idealistic.  Therefore, I really want to hear your opinion in the comments. <br><br>  Thank. <br><br>  PS: The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice is inspired by reading the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nickmitin/" class="user_link">nickmitin</a> : <a href="http://nickmitin.ru/blog/%3Fgo%3D2011/04/12/1/">nickmitin.ru/blog/?go=2011/04/12/1</a> <br><br>  <b>UDP:</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/horzerus/" class="user_link">Horzerus</a> in the comments provided a link to a video with Artemy Lebidev, in which he covers the problem of the ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxF63VvcJdw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRrHZ6U_niniQ2U54-4zOxJph-sw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Perhaps, in fact, people who do not give a damn about the environment in which they live units. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117947/</a></p>
