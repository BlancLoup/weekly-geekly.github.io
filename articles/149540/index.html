  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Restoring a netbook to factory settings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In recent years, most notebook manufacturers do not bother to put a system recovery disk in the box with the device they purchased. <br>  In most cases, this situation is typical if you purchase a netbook. <br>  Is there usually no optical drive? <br>  This means that the restoration of the system must be done somehow differently. <br><br>  Of course, most manufacturers offer various utilities to restore the "snapshots" of the system or even the original "factory" state. <br><br>  But there is one "BUT". <br>  In 99.99% of cases, the manufacturer assumes that you still have a Windows partition, and the Recovery partition is in the right place, that you, as a bona fide PC user, have read the instructions and made all kinds of BackUp. <br>  Yes, it also assumes that Windows is generally loaded.

      Naive, yes? <br><br>  Under cut, one of the options for doing if everything was "as always." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It so happened that I needed to restore the netbook to the ‚Äúfactory settings‚Äù. <br>  Those.  - get its original appearance: ‚Äúas it was from the store‚Äù ... <br><br>  The situation was complicated by the fact that the device did not have a boot disk. <br>  A good friend before selling copied all the necessary data and made the full format of everything that I could reach. <br>  How he got it is not so important, it was necessary to do something. <br><br>  Luckily, the playful pens of the device owner did not touch the partition with Recovery. <br>  Apparently something somewhere all the same clicked in the brain, and he survived, but, alas, he was not bootable and lay in a completely different place on the disk (most likely someone who was humane and prudent used sometime utilities like Acronis Disk Director or gParted). <br><br>  At that time, I had only a bootable Windows 7 flash drive from the ‚Äútools at hand for solving Wndows-problems‚Äù. How to search for it on the Microsoft website, you will be offered this option if you purchase Win 7 for a netbook.  There is a special utility that makes such a trick from the already downloaded ISO. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1:</b> thanks for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149540/">exact comment</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/tigora/" class="user_link">TIgorA</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> Please note, I had <b>ONLY</b> this flash drive, and nowhere in the reach was Windows installed. <br><br>  Booting into the installation, I chose "System Restore" in the lower left corner of the window. <br>  In the opened window I found the ‚Äúconsole‚Äù - the one where the cursor flashes in the ‚ÄúC: \‚Äù prompt. <br><br>  My cursor blinked on "x: \". <br><br>  I suppose everyone knows what the CD and DIR commands are for. <br><br>  It was with their help that I found out that there was only an absolutely clean ‚ÄúC: \‚Äù drive on the ward. <br>  And also the ‚ÄúD: \‚Äù disk in which there is a handful of Win 7 boot loader folders. <br><br>  In one of the folders I found ‚ÄúFirmware.wim‚Äù. <br><br>  Searches by brand of device manufacturer and the name of this file led to a simple explanation: <br>  This is the system image - factory settings. <br><br>  Those.  it was quite appropriate to do everything ‚Äúas needed‚Äù. <br><br>  It remains to understand how it can be "unpacked." <br><br>  Repeated searches gave the name of the utility: "IMAGEX.EXE". <br>  It was immediately downloaded to my installation flash. <br><br>  Booting into the console the second time I entered the command: <br><br> <code>IMAGEX.EXE /apply __Factory.wim 1 : <br></code> <br><br>  And after 10 minutes I received an answer that, they say, everything was done. <br><br>  I suppose that everything is clear except the number "1" - this is the number of the image in the WIM archive. <br>  The fact is that there may be several images in it. <br>  I came up first, I did not dig further. <br><br>  But, the computer did not boot. <br><br>  Run from the installation flash drive. <br>  But, instead of the console, we now select ‚ÄúStartup Recovery‚Äù, this happened three times in my case. <br><br>  1. At first it turned out that there are no boot disks. <br>  2. There was no boot sector on the disk <br>  3. There was no loader itself. <br><br>  As a result, it was loaded ... <br>  The first time I saw a laptop is loaded "for the first time." <br>  It was a long time, but very interesting. <br><br>  Then a bunch of updates went, everything is standard, but this is another story. <br><br>  Conclusion: be prudent, make backup; ^) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149540/</a></p>
