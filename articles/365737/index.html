  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ultrabook inside out. Acer Aspire Switch 12 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The market of compact computers, it would seem, is already simply crowded.  Previously, only laptops were represented on it, but now the head is spinning from a variety of devices.  This and old netbooks, and modern ultrabooks, and Chromebooks.  There are tablets that turn into a laptop, there are laptops that turn into a tablet - in general, gadgets for every taste and color.  But Acer went even further and made a device that turns from a tablet into a laptop, and from a laptop to a desktop computer.  Do not believe?  Then climb under the cat. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/acer/blog/252730/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee6/218/72c/ee621872c44a43d78a72c3f133137015.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/797/791/2a4/7977912a47eb46cb83d5c908e8eea2be.png" width="30">  Design </h4><br>  Perhaps the first thing you notice when you take this device in hand is its non-standard appearance.  Switch 12 looks like a standard tablet with a keyboard, but only until you open it.  Usually, hybrid tablets in the assembled state are no different from a regular laptop, right there the screen turns out to be outside.  The design of this device is different, in the unfolded state, it looks like a laptop, whose display base was moved closer to the middle of the bottom.  In the photos it is clearly shown and, as they say, it is better to see once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e9/5ef/c8b/3e95efc8b12943e590bd500749ec7156.jpg">

In the box with the device is a charger, which resembles, rather, charging for a laptop than for a tablet.  In addition, there was a leather case.  Wearing an Acer Aspire Switch 12 without a case is not recommended, because it is not possible to close the screen at all so that it is protected.  This, of course, a small minus.  In addition, in the case there is no pocket for the charger, so you still have to use a backpack or bag for transportation.  The set does not have a stylus, although the tablet has support for this accessory, but the price will remain minimal, and the digital pen, those who need it, will always be able to purchase separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/696/4ae/93c/6964ae93c340410694a2646f09b80b5e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/726/758/d66/726758d66a0c40eb812802e6b729d8bd.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet itself (laptop? Console? PC?) Is made of matte black ribbed plastic.  Of course, this may seem boring, but such material looks as strictly and stylishly as possible, while being quite practical.  Fingerprints are not visible on the surface.  The only weak point is only the glossy screen cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/837/5ad/64c/8375ad64ce63435d989f07c6c69ec8b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d2/256/f0e/5d2256f0ef56429dbde2b95baae2e4f2.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget is quite weighty, without a keyboard, its weight is 1.1 kg, and the whole kit (case, keyboard, charging) is 2.1 kg.  Agree, this is not so little, so, judging by the weight, it is rather a laptop, not a tablet.  The case is durable, and the design is rigid, so the tablet practically does not react to twisting and bending.  Yes, and the Switch 12 is assembled soundly: the loops are reliable, all the elements fit perfectly, it is clear that the product is premium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/330/975/8a63309752744cdb8d9e391b4a955157.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99c/cb1/1f5/99ccb11f5ed246229c7739195a3adcce.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, I was pleasantly surprised by the thoughtfulness of such trifles as tilting the device.  For laptops, a test is sometimes performed to see if the screen opens easily with one hand.  Ideally, this test passes only the MacBook.  So, in the case of the Aspire Switch 12, of course, it is not necessary to test it, but we still checked the design for stability.  Even with a very wide screen and a disabled keyboard (it changes the center of gravity), the tablet does not fall, which is important.  Yes, and in the assembled state on your lap the gadget is comfortable to hold, although at first it is unusual that the screen is so close. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d72/a9b/715/d72a9b715b574a84aa90b9267ec9653d.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, I completely forgot to tell you about the options for using Switch 12. They are already with him 5. The first and most understandable is, of course, a tablet.  Only the screen and nothing more.  The second option is a laptop.  We connect the keyboard in front, raise the screen and here we have a well-known form factor, except that the screen is slightly shifted closer to the keyboard.  The third case is the so-called console.  Turning off the keyboard, flip the tablet, open the stand and set the corner on the table.  It turns out an inclined display on which it is convenient to draw, read or watch movies.  The fourth option is just a display, but everything is quite simple.  Turning off the keyboard, open the screen and now, in front of us is a monitor on which you can also watch photos or movies.  Well, if you put a keyboard in front of it, then this will be the fifth option - a PC, unless you have to plug in the mouse for complete happiness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/f10/9da/bbcf109dacfa4196b82f5bd42efa40fe.jpg"><br><br>  The screen size is 12.5 inches, which is already a lot for tablets, not enough for laptops, but just for such a device.  When working does not create the feeling that you need a display more or less, it really is, picked up the size perfectly.  The screen is covered with a protective glass Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The display resolution is 1920 √ó 1080 pixels, which is a good indicator for such a diagonal.  The quality of the screen is high, the picture is clear, bright and contrasting, so that even in the bright sun there is no problem, except that the glossy glass slightly glares. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb7/030/170/cb7030170bf44e43a02b4e54d934733b.png" width="30">  Interfaces and Keyboard </h4><br>  Despite the fact that this is a tablet, there is a stand and keyboard, which means there must be some kind of connectors.  Well, it is necessary to look more closely.  So, at the base of the only full-sized USB 2.0 port, which is useful for connecting a USB flash drive, external hard drive or mouse.  On the tablet, there is microUSB 3.0, but it is unlikely that you can connect anything there without an adapter to a full-sized USB.  Although, if you have a USB flash drive with microUSB, then you can easily connect it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/4da/217/dcf4da21781245adb4e26980d25ec5a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f94/ce4/671/f94ce46716ea4f6fa13b5c12cec64279.jpg"><br><br>  The device is charged via a separate port, so both USB are always available.  Alas, only two ports, and even then, one of them requires an adapter - this is too little for a laptop, and even more so for a full-fledged computer.  Of course, we all remember the new Apple MacBook, in which only one USB Type-C port is for everything, but the Switch 12 USB hub will also obviously have to be bought if you want to connect something besides a USB flash drive and mouse, and even more so if you plan to use it at work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e3/d13/702/7e3d13702a5d465ead0b75d3e985627b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2c/e27/60c/a2ce2760c9cd4e378627022e213129ce.jpg"><br><br>  At the top, next to the power button, there is a card reader, but it is only for microSD cards.  Alas, if you want to see photos from the camera, you will have to carry with you an external device for reading memory cards, because there is hardly any microSD in your camera.  Next to the microUSB port is the micro-HDMI video output, so at any time you can connect the tablet to a TV or external display, if, of course, there is an adapter.  Unfortunately, to fully utilize all the features of Acer Aspire Switch 12, you will have to purchase various adapters that are not included in the kit, if all you need is, of course.  The set of ports is not bad here, but it would be much better if there were two full-fledged USB, standard HDMI and an SD card slot (although you can definitely do without it), because the size of the case allows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/6f7/fb9/a866f7fb92a0421bbf5c2c663558375b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/831/ff4/51b/831ff451be4f4f9b82141269460619ba.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard in the Acer Aspire Switch 12 is both an integral part and an accessory.  When you connect the keyboard to the device, it forms a single unit with it.  But it only works wirelessly.  You can charge the keyboard only if you connect it to the back end of the stand, there are no contacts on the front.  And of course, no third-party devices for charging the keyboard are provided separately.  The keys here are slightly rough, so that the fingers do not slide off, and the arrangement is island (when there is a gap between the keys).  The course is not very big, typing is convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c2/32c/7c2/5c232c7c2d644b6cbcb9e4643340e93e.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the keyboard is very compact and many of the buttons here are either completely absent or combined with others and are proposed to be used in conjunction with the Fn button.  Interestingly, for the sake of compactness, Acer removed the touchpad from the keyboard.  Instead, they made a joystick - exactly the same as we saw in IBM laptops (and now Lenovo) ThinkPad.  But the buttons remain, they are very invisible and are under the space.  It is convenient to control using these elements, but I would still prefer a mouse (the touch screen is enough on the way). <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a37/0a5/e8b/a370a5e8b980460f8f8b89db449ac0b7.png" width="30">  Filling </h4><br>  There are, of course, wireless modules in the tablet.  Since Switch 12 is built on the base of the Broadwell processor (but more on that later), it is equipped with an Intel Wireless-AC 7265 module, which, as the name implies, can work in Wi-Fi networks 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, as well as with Bluetooth 4.0.  In addition, it supports WiDi technology (Wireless Display) for transmitting images to external displays without wires, and it works with competing Miracast.  Enough to have the necessary receiver, then you can do without cables and adapters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec6/5bb/7b3/ec65bb7b3f7a461f85a4e81e3c362425.jpg"><br><br>  Very conveniently placed in the tablet speakers.  So it turns out that at any location of the device, they are always aimed at the person.  Two stereo speakers are located on the front of the stand and are hard to miss.  The quality is quite tolerable, for watching movies and even for listening to music they are enough.  In extreme cases, you can always output the sound through the 3.5 mm jack (it is also present, of course). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6a/47b/c32/e6a47bc32c914796a795ea2bd9f8be85.PNG" width="497"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84a/2ea/996/84a2ea996f2b49ebb7244c43432c9336.PNG" width="497"><br><br>  The Acer Aspire Switch 12 is built on the basis of a modern, cost-effective Intel Core M-5Y10c processor from the Broadwell family.  This chip has a wide frequency range, adapts to the current load and is not particularly heated - thanks to this, by the way, there are no coolers in the laptop, all cooling is passive.  The processor, of course, is not very powerful, but to work with documents, surfing the Internet is enough, well, for games it is better to look for other devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e7/a37/97f/7e7a3797facb4dc6b5b0d7e2e07805d1.PNG" width="497"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de6/8a3/81c/de68a381c14040dfa2c34e761c923c7a.PNG" width="497"><br><br>  The device has 4 GB of RAM and 60 GB SSD for data storage.  The solid-state drive, by the way, is quite fast, which is especially noticeable when the device is turned on and exited from sleep mode, since it takes a few seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d54/270/c69/d54270c69d8e4f0b95254175d1897fb7.png"><br><br>  As for the video card, here, of course, the integrated graphics, HD 5300 are used. For some low-powered toys, it is even enough, but if only at the minimum settings.  Another question is that in games the processor will warm up more than in office tasks, which means there will be a decrease in frequency and, as a result, brakes will appear.  So you shouldn‚Äôt play on devices with Core M, they are not made for that. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/219/24d/2d721924d9644564b84503ee76392bbc.png" width="30">  Battery and Charging </h4><br>  The gadget is charged with proprietary charging - it gives out 45 W, although the tablet only needs 17 W even under high load.  The battery in Switch 12 is not very big - a three-compartment lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 3220 mAh is used.  However, here all the advantages of the Core M processor are revealed, since  even with this capacity, the gadget can work up to 6 hours, while showing the video.  If you want to read a book, then the battery will last for 12-14 hours. <br><br>  The gadget does not charge for a long time, but in principle, if you work on it all the time, then you can not take it off at all.  The only thing that upsets a little is that you need to reconnect the keyboard in order to charge it. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d7/8e1/09b/5d78e109b3b949d88438d16c96220f1e.png" width="30">  Summary </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a63/20a/c47/a6320ac4740c459a99037dc37c3e7b54.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <b>pros</b> </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/c38/bb6/3b6c38bb6f314247803f5dddf1a12f44.png" width="12">  Compactness <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/c38/bb6/3b6c38bb6f314247803f5dddf1a12f44.png" width="12">  Silent operation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/c38/bb6/3b6c38bb6f314247803f5dddf1a12f44.png" width="12">  Functionality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/c38/bb6/3b6c38bb6f314247803f5dddf1a12f44.png" width="12">  Versatility, many modes <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/c38/bb6/3b6c38bb6f314247803f5dddf1a12f44.png" width="12">  High quality screen <br><br><h5>  <b>Minuses</b> </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adc/3c1/70a/adc3c170a64d4f948939fd7f6d53c8f5.png" width="12">  Always wear a carrying case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adc/3c1/70a/adc3c170a64d4f948939fd7f6d53c8f5.png" width="12">  There is no usual touchpad <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adc/3c1/70a/adc3c170a64d4f948939fd7f6d53c8f5.png" width="12">  Somewhat heavy <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adc/3c1/70a/adc3c170a64d4f948939fd7f6d53c8f5.png" width="12">  Adapters are required to complete the work <br><br>  Acer was able to make an unusual, but interesting hybrid tablet.  Of course, it is different from everything on the market, and it is not yet clear whether this is good or bad.  But it is convenient to use the device (despite the unusual form factor), and this is important.  This device will certainly appeal to everyone who works everywhere: at home, at work, on the road, since everywhere it can be used differently and to benefit from it.  This gadget will have very few competitors, it is too unusual and it is difficult to find analogs.  Today, only Asus Transformer Book T300 Chi can be offered from the alternatives, as well as Lenovo ThinkPad Helix 2, but these are boring models with a standard appearance, when the keyboard is attached to the tablet and it becomes a laptop.  However, all these devices are made on Intel Core M, which means that if you choose something for yourself on this platform, then from the above options. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365737/</a></p>
