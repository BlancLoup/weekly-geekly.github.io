After the collapse of the USSR, from all the Soviet republics, only the Baltic countries came to normal society and European standards of living (and I‚Äôm not sure, because I know the situation only by stories, but I haven‚Äôt been there yet, who was - tell the truth) , all other countries remain in the so-called.  They do not strive for the ‚Äúscoop‚Äù, but they are constantly complaining all the time that there is chaos in the country, complete ass, the salary is low, and no one is doing a normal job! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://talk.estrabota.com.ua/index.php%3Ftopic%3D121.msg1271">It turned out</a> that finding a normal job for oneself in our country (and I think that the situation in the neighboring country of Russia is similar) is quite possible, just no one is looking, and visitors from other countries, where the work will actually be worse, are found in our the country itself is a good lesson. <br><br>  "Scoop" we dissolved the brain with the knowledge that the state owes us something, that we have the right to rely on subsidies, free medicine and education;  some also believe that going to the army, not spitting under their feet and not pissing in the stairwell is the lot of selected idiots, but this is a topic for another conversation, although it also characterizes us all well.

      In a country in which he goes to church, he knows prayers and rites, honors the commandments, etc.  from strength only 5% of the population, for some reason, church holidays (!) suddenly became public.  In the Labor Code there is an amendment that people of non-Christian religions have the right to have a day off to celebrate their holidays.  I believe that for Christians should be exactly the same.  If you believe, write a statement and celebrate Easter.  Questions of the truth of faith and whether a person writes an application for a day off because he believes, or simply wants to get a mess, let us leave on the conscience of those who write a statement.  If this happens, you will see how many lazy people in our country are lazy to write a statement and just come to work on a holy day. <br><br>  There are already many holidays in our country!  This is absolutely unacceptable when a country cannot get out of a series of crises of a different nature from political to economic.  We started squandering too early the time that we could spend on building our own state, in which, after its establishment, holidays themselves would arise that they would like to celebrate and the celebrations would not be to the detriment of the state itself. <br><br>  What I offer (trite, very simple to implement and absolutely impossible in practice): <br>  On Labor Day, the first of May, we must work!  because  This is a celebration of work. <br>  If the holiday falls on a day off, then there is nothing to endure it, because  falls out of the cage immediately a few days; <br>  On the eighth of March, everyone also needs to work, because  On this holiday, some men get drunk, but this is not their holiday (!), not women, and women then stand and do the dishes, which means they still work.  In the most extreme case of March 8th, you can give a well-deserved day off only to women; <br>  Military holidays have the right to celebrate ONLY the military and no one else; <br>  Church holidays have the right to celebrate only those who actually believe (it is easy to determine according to the facts of violation of the commandments and following the canons, or simply leave on the conscience of the one who wants to get a day off on this day, see above); <br>  Remove from the Labor Code for commercial non-governmental organizations any mention of the 40-hour working week, time off due to spent weekends, double the rate for night work, etc.  Nobody does it anyway.  Plus, in a commercial organization, everything happens on a commercial basis - either you work overtime for the money you get paid, or you don‚Äôt work, or you bargain with the boss about the rate hike.  All the same, the market will align everything and put it in its place, who has a clear program of motivating their staff, the Labor Code does not need it; <br>  Reduce the number of public holidays.  Remove Constitution Day, the Day of Unification of Ukraine, March 8, May 1, May 2, Christmas, Easter, Trinity, everything else, officially credited on weekends.  Leave only New Year, Victory Day and Independence Day, because  these are truly public holidays; <br>  I do not propose to shorten the holiday because they stumble; <br><br>  Well, now the answer to the question asked in the title.  Do you know why there are so many posts on the blog in the last two days?  Yes, because Ukraine has another holiday, Constitution Day, and on this occasion, we have not two, but four days off in a row!  I finally have time and reach out with you to share all that has accumulated over the past month in my brain. <br><br>  Personally, I continue to work on the weekends, comb my projects, write to this blog, although I have a little time to relax, I think that I have achieved little, I earn little, and that time is running out too quickly, but many people did very well on Constitution Day , 3 days of vacation at your own expense + days off + piled from the middle of the working day last Saturday, when they worked for this Friday + Sunday after this Saturday, and it‚Äôs not a fact that they will appear on Monday at 9 am <br><br>  After that, I do not believe that there is a crisis in my country, people live poorly and earn little! <br><br>  <a href="http://estrabota.com.ua/blog/view_topic.php%3Fid%3D144">Original blog post about work and online recruiting</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://estrabota.com.ua/blog/view_topic.php%3Fid%3D143">Separately, I remind you that I write and publish announcements of Jobsites for free</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11821/</a></p>
