  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to deal with the human factor in the introduction of software?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tired to bang your head against the wall!  Employees of organizations in which we implement software do not use its capabilities completely, or do not use them at all. And this, in principle, happens not only in our country, but also in other developers / implementers in organizations of all sizes.  But what to say, inside your company, the implementation of various bug-tracking / version control / project management / snippet-storage is creaking.  And this is among the programmers! <br>  I will give three examples: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Organization of 50 people </h4>  The average age of a team is 20-30 years, the level of computer skills is low to medium.  Software developed by us and covering almost all aspects of the organization.  The software consists of 5 modules, and for 2 (!) Years of use, they still use only 1. One would think that the remaining 4 are inconvenient / buggy / low-functional ... Long licked to shine, tested, tested by responsible persons and found useful / convenient / understandable.  But they do not use them ... And still they run around with paperwork in the old manner, call up, chat in chat rooms and so on. And then at the end of the month they spend a lot of time and give up ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù reports. <br><br><h4>  2. Big state organization. </h4>  1000 people.  The level of computer skills is average (since all jobs are connected with the computer).  Age is different.  Software is a well-known workflow system.  They implemented it for almost half a year, trained all the employees: first, with general lectures and presentations and then each person personally - they showed how to work with an example.  The need for the system is very large, since the document flow and reporting are simply enormous in terms of volume, and the time taken to ‚Äúwork out‚Äù the documents is relatively small.  Because of all this commotion, naturally, even though a small part, but the documents are lost, lie in the tables and a lot of effort is spent on reporting.  In the system - until you personally approach and do not "kick" - they do not work (for a million different reasons). <br><br><h4>  3. My programmers. </h4><br>  People with higher education, with experience of 2 years in programming, are ‚Äúkeen‚Äù interested in the quick execution of projects.  Together we choose a convenient and suitable software - we install, we learn ... And the first three days we work.  Then everything is thrown ...

      In this and in another case, the <b>benefits of using the software are obvious</b> and this is recognized by the employees themselves.  There is a very great desire of the management to introduce these projects.  The manual is quite tough, but even this is not enough for people in the programs to start working as it should. <br>  It turns out the situation "everyone understands, wants, can, needs (!) - but there is no result." <br><br><h4>  What tried to do: </h4><br><ul><li>  a) convince employees, show them benefits, train each person personally and answer all questions </li><li>  b) to make special reports for the management, so that it could be seen who is working in the systems and who is not - and you can make decisions. </li><li>  c) to talk with the management ... Although what to convince them?  They ordered and paid for this software.  The most important thing is their desire, opportunities, including the possibility of "carrots and sticks."  Gatherings are gathered, tasks are set, deadlines ... and "things are still there." </li></ul><br><br>  Dear Habrovchane, share who and how struggled with the human factor, what else can you try?  Maybe there are some "recipes"? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77581/</a></p>
