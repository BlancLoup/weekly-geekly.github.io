  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPhone: applications for working with Russian services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8b/156/c5f/d8b156c5fddacc1fb08a64fe320f6f35.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Since July last year, when Apple opened a store selling apps for the iPhone and iPod Touch, not many programs for working with Russian-language services appeared in the App Store.  Russian developers have made quite a few applications for language learners, games (of which only <strong>Tetris is</strong> worth) and many other things for American users of iPhone and in order to earn extra money.  But a week ago, an application from the creators of ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù appeared in the App Store, the next day - from the developer ‚ÄúYandex. Stock‚Äù, then from ‚ÄúKommersant‚Äù. <br>  I would like to hope that all this is not just a coincidence, and the Russian Internet companies suddenly noticed the half-million audience of the owners of ‚ÄúiPhones‚Äù, and the creators of other good services will now follow the example of ‚ÄúV kontakte‚Äù.  In support of this trend, we decided to talk about nine applications from the App Store (you know, write in the comments) that simplify work with Russian Internet services. <br><br>  <strong>BashOr</strong> ($ 0.99) <br>  A simple reader of the latest quotes from the <a href="http://bash.org.ru/">Bashorg</a> collection and <a href="http://ithappens.ru/">IT Happens</a> .  In addition to the fresh and sometimes funny conversations of Internet users, you can read the best quotes for the day, everything in general (‚ÄúThe Abyss‚Äù), the top of this ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù itself and vote for the quotes - in general, it seems that everything to do if you put a humorous quotations bookmarks in the "Safari". <br>  However, it is somewhat more convenient to read ‚ÄúBashorg‚Äù in a special application, but only real fans of ‚ÄúBash‚Äù will probably agree to spend money on it. <br><br>  <strong>BFM.app</strong> <br>  An application for working with another, much more serious, information service <a href="http://bfm.ru/">BFM.ru.</a>  The main program screen displays the main news feed, currency rates and stock exchange indices.  Separately, you can see the news of each section of the portal, the latest materials and the state of the markets (as opposed to the native Stocks, without graphs of growth and decline, but with some additional information). <br>  The application is free, but there are banner ads on all pages and in the download window.

      <strong>iMobbit</strong> <br>  In fact, the only tool to work with the new geosocial network iMobbit.  Immediately after launching, the application caches the Google map and shows other network users within a radius of ten kilometers from you.  To fully utilize the capabilities of iMobbit, you must enter your email address and password.  The application is still available with limited functions: you cannot add people who are close to you, become friends, become ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù, write comments to objects on the map and there is no status history (read: microblogging) - this will all be in the next version of the program. <br><br>  <strong>iMobilko</strong> <br>  "Aymobilko" - a new and well-designed online store with electronic and audio books, music and movies.  Before its opening, the creators conducted a noisy advertising campaign: on the website ‚Äú <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/everything/iwhoilco/">Ay *** lko</a> ‚Äù developed in Lebedev Studio, it was suggested to guess the image by opening fragments.  All those who offered at least one answer option received some amount to their personal account in the opened online store. <br>  The application for "iPhone" specializes in books sold in "Aymobilka".  Through it, you can find them, buy them and immediately read them by pre-setting the font and background color. <br><br>  <strong>Jams.Moscow</strong> ($ 9.99) <br>  The functions of the application fully describes its name - it shows Google maps and traffic information from Yandex (the company, I remind you, in the summer bought SMIlink, which collects, processes and provides information about traffic jams on Russian roads).  Four zoom modes are available from the A107 federal highway (‚Äúbetonka‚Äù) to the Garden Ring, auto-detection of your position on the map, and real-time update mode. <br>  The app is not cheap, but it seems worth it. <br><br>  <strong>Kommersant</strong> <br>  Similar to BFM.app (and to all other reading room applications for news sites) the Kommersant newspaper version allows you to read the latest news and articles, including for certain categories from five different magazines of the publishing house: Kommersant itself, Vlast , Money, Weekend and The Secret of the Firm.  Separately, you can view fresh photo galleries, search for materials and add your favorites to your favorites. <br>  The settings indicate the frequency of updating texts.  To force the content of the section to be updated, you must click the button in the upper right corner of the screen. <br><br>  <strong>LiveJournal.app</strong> <br>  The ‚ÄúLive Journal‚Äù client for ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù allows you to write in LiveJournal and correspond with other users via internal mail service.  The form of adding a new entry is not inferior in convenience to full-fledged clients: through it you can easily publish a photo taken on the iPhone, and write a note with a title, tags, special userpic, links, formatting and location indication (it will be determined automatically).  If you accidentally exit the program, the autosave of the typed note will work, and the annoying signature ‚ÄúPosted via LiveJournal.app‚Äù can be turned off in the settings. <br><br>  <strong>Vkontakte</strong> <br>  The application from Vkontakte, according to my brother‚Äôs testimony, who actively uses social networking capabilities, is an excellent substitute for a service site.  Through the program, you can chat with friends, upload photos from your phone‚Äôs camera footage, search and add to friends of other users. <br>  Many complain about the "dampness" of the application and the resulting glitches and "fall" of the program.  But almost no one of the applications described in this article is yet without cost.  After a few updates, this should be corrected - the stability of the native Safari has been improving for the past two years. <br><br>  <strong>Yandex.Fotki</strong> <br>  As in the case of Jams.Moscow, the application for working with the Yandex service is an initiative of one person, only this time he works in a company.  Photo client for ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù allows you to take photos, upload photos to the Yandex server, edit photo data and post pictures to the blog on Ya.Ru.  You can upload a photo immediately after shooting or later, at a convenient time for you, and before downloading edit the name, tags and size of the photo. <br>  The application is available for free download. <br><br><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.internetno.net/">www.internetno.net</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52363/</a></p>
