  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Try to assess the cash capacity of the regional web development market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãestimating the price volume of the site development market came to me in the process of working on the material ‚Äú <strong>Promotion on the Internet will reduce advertising costs</strong> ‚Äù, which we published in one local magazine.  I think, according to the same approach, it will be possible to calculate an approximate monetary capacity for any of the regions of Russia.  This can be interesting, first of all, to regional companies that are engaged in the development of sites and want to assess their market.  Believe me, the data will surprise you. <br>  All of the below analytics refers to Chelyabinsk and the region <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My colleagues, when they studied the <a href="http://w74.ru/analytics/domains/domains_15.html">results of the annual analysis of the number of domains in Chelyabinsk for 2008</a> , added very interesting criteria by which they made a sample.  This is the binding of the domain to the region by the region's digit (we have the digit ‚Äú74‚Äù) and the transliteration of the name of the city of Chelyabinsk (looks like ‚Äúchel‚Äù).  Seeing these numbers, I immediately realized that before my gaze there is nothing more than approximate information on the capacity, in monetary terms, of the Chelyabinsk web development market. <br><br>  See what we have: for the past 2008 (without December), 15101 domains have been registered for the share of Chelyabinsk and the region.  In this total mass there are domains that were not registered to do Chelyabinsk sites with them (domains).  They made general or industry websites out of them, that is, it is not necessary that it was a Chelyabinsk office that made a website for itself (just a company website).  But sampling by region and transliteration of the city name is the most likely case of a client order (company website).  According to the data obtained in our 2877 domains out of 15101 have the prefix "74" in the name and 1539 domains have the prefix "chel".  Total of such 4416 domains.

      Let's now determine the price of developing the site.  This price has a wide variation.  From 5000 rubles to infinity, in fact.  I was told that students in Chelyabinsk and for 1000 rubles some sites do, I did not take this into account, because those who understand what a site development is, also understand the order of works and their cost. <br>  I have data from a small pre-crisis marketing research.  According to this study, the average Chelyabinsk company is ready to spend on the development of a site for its company no more than 20,000-30000 rubles.  In the understanding of the average Chelyabinsk client, this is the most normal amount for the implementation of their website.  There are, of course, such companies that understand what they want;  they understand the price level for their whims, because they go to professional developers (they do not start with students) and that price range is already an order of magnitude higher.  But there are few such companies and, for a negligible number of such companies, these data can be neglected. <br>  So, we believe that the bulk is ready to pay an average of 25,000 rubles for the development of the site. <br>  <strong>I</strong> Consider "in the forehead": by not complicated work 4416 * 25000 = 110.400.000 rubles.  It turned out a little over a hundred million rubles.  But it should be understood that of these 4,416 people who have registered domains, not all are representatives of the very layer about which I wrote above. <br>  <strong>II</strong> Now remember the course of higher mathematics of the university, namely: the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">normal distribution</a> .  The number of people from 4,416 who are willing to pay 20,000‚Äì3,000 rubles for their website fits the definition of a value that obeys a normal distribution (a <strong>value submits to a normal distribution when it is influenced by a huge number of random interference</strong> - just our case).  For a long time I normalized these figures, drew graphs, recounted.  I will not lay out all the material from MathCad here, I will only say that I have got the figure of ~ 2000.  That is, in reality, these are the very people who are ready, on average, to give 25,000 rubles for the development of the site.  We recalculate 2000 * 25,000 = 50,000,000 rubles. Approximately such a figure from Chelyabinsk and the region over the year is deposited in the pockets of students, freelancers, small development teams, and ordinary web developers. <br><br>  And note that this is the minimum figure, because  in the calculations taken the minimum possible cost of 25,000 rubles. <br><br>  And we have enough miracle developers in the city, believe me.  Recall the registration schedule: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/254/13a/d31/25413ad315139be0f3b884421bfc285c.png" alt="The trend registrations Chelyabinsk domains"><br>  You see a surge of registrations in August 2008, this is one Chelyabinsk desk <a href="http://sculptorss.org/page01.php">decided to earn extra money on cybersquatting</a> .  Do not need a domain for rent?  :) <br>  And here you are <a href="http://www.uralsait.ru/market.php%3Frid%3Dmagazin">offered to buy already ‚Äúready‚Äù, ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù sites in the ‚Äúonline store‚Äù</a> .  Prices from 80,000 to 1,000,000 rubles.  I still do not take their prices seriously.  Such a bad joke.  And this joke, by the way, almost a year! <br><br>  <strong>The Chelyabinsk web market is very harsh</strong> , in every sense of the word (both comedic and material).  And this is not an allegation, but a conclusion from all of the above. <br>  The last few paragraphs are the lyrics from <a href="http://sergey.pavlenko.org/%3Fp%3D81">your blog entry</a> .  <b>Rate the approach to the calculation</b> .  Maybe someone according to a similar principle considers their region?  It would be interesting to know how things are with colleagues in the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46807/</a></p>
