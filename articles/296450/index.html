The companies from the SPARK-Interfax base and the RBC 500 rating that were registered earlier than 2011 were considered. Their annual revenue growth should be at least 20% from 2012 to 2014.  Their revenue should be at least 1 billion rubles in 2011 and at least 3 billion rubles in 2014.  To get into the rating, the company must be private or the share of private shareholders in it must be at least 50%, <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/news/6498/">writes</a> Firrma. <br><br>  "Yulmart" takes 8th place in the ranking.  Retailer revenues in 2014 amounted to 50.1 billion rubles compared to 11.2 billion rubles in 2011.  Yandex ranks 31 in the ranking.  Its revenue in 2014 amounted to 50.8 billion rubles, compared with 20 billion rubles in 2011.

      Number 2 in the ranking is the online store Wildberries.  The head of the company, Tatiana Bakalchuk, is usually kept in the shadow, and the retailer itself, to put it mildly, is not spoiled by media attention.  Nevertheless, according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa.com</a> , in the category ‚ÄúShopping‚Äù, it ranks seventh in terms of the audience in the world standings and stably the first in Russia.  His closest competitor, <a href="http://www.lamoda.ru/">Lamoda.ru</a> , is ranked 15th in the world and 2nd in Russia. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Initially, the Wildberries.ru product range consisted of products from the German Quelle and Otto catalogs.  Now they can choose from more than 100 thousand items from 1.9 thousand brands.  Wildberries.ru was one of the first on the market to introduce a single tariff for regional delivery.  Later, the retailer gave customers the opportunity to refuse any purchase already delivered. <br><br>  In 2010, Wildberries.ru had the first pick-up point equipped with fitting rooms: today there are over 180 of them in more than 100 cities of Russia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe see an absolute slowdown in the growth of the online trading market,‚Äù complains the co-founder of <a href="http://www.datainsight.ru/">Data Insight,</a> Boris Ovchinnikov.  The total turnover of online stores in Russia in 2014 grew by 31%, to 612 billion rubles.  At the end of 2015, growth is not expected to exceed 25%. <br><br>  However, the revenue of Wildberries.ru for 2014 amounted to 23.4 billion rubles.  This is almost 75% higher than in 2013 and almost 10 times more than in 2011.  At the end of 2015, the company expects a growth of 40%.  However, since 2012, the company‚Äôs net profit margin has fallen: two years ago, this figure was 2.1%, at the end of 2014 it dropped to 0.9%.  The volume of loans and credits in the past year increased by 1.8 times, almost to 1.8 billion rubles.  Accounts payable doubled to 7.5 billion rubles. <br><br>  From the beginning of 2015, Wildberries.ru introduced a new settlement system: the retailer switched to pay-for-sales - a model that many sellers use during the crisis period.  The company explained this by the fact that they want to ‚Äúbecome more flexible and dynamic‚Äù and ‚Äúwithout an increase in the budget for the purchase of goods, give a chance to Russian designers.‚Äù <br><br>  However, Wildberries.ru has received 17 lawsuits from its counterparties worth over 86 million rubles so far.  They are trying to recover overdue payments for services rendered and goods delivered. <br><br>  Perhaps by paying unhappy partners an amount equal to the daily turnover of the store, Bakalchuk will again offer customers something radically new to the market, RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/18/11/2015/564b7fac9a794772a455b791">writes</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296450/</a></p>
