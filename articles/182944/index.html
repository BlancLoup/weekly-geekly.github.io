For various reasons, there are 2-3 more or less permanent participants.  The first time went with us somehow slowly, but after going on vacation, I found more time for that.  And here meet the first prototype.  In fact, it is already possible to fully play, but bugs and some inconveniences are possible, but I hope not critical.  With the improvement of the game the status of all players will be saved. <br><br>  And then I even planned the second stage of the game.  But about everything in order ... <br><br>  But you can not read all this, but immediately play :) - <a href="http://cybernet2.no-ip.biz/">Browser game "Cybernet"</a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is implemented? </h4><br><br>  Here I will describe the scenario that has already been implemented. <br><br>  The game character (hereinafter the agent) at the beginning of the game is placed in a random region.  Initially, the agent has 5 characteristics: (1) Energy - the initial value is 100%;  (2) Health - the initial value is 100%;  (3) Cheerfulness - the initial value is 100%;  (4) Physical strength - initial value 1;  (5) Intellect - the initial value is 1. <br><br>  The basis of the gameplay is improving the complexity of the world and increasing the characteristics of physical strength and intelligence of the agent.  In this case, the health of the agent should not be 0%, which symbolizes the death of the player.  Initially, in the region where the agent is located, there are only plants, animals and fossils.  Their prevalence is determined at the time of the first use of the agent at random.  An agent can carry out operations on plants, animals, fossils and objects in order to obtain other objects in accordance with the ontological graph.  Items can accumulate and they are characterized by quality.  A special group of items is food.  The agent can use food as food, thereby increasing its energy.  Energy spent on the implementation of all actions.  After each action, except for the time of sleep, the agent automatically searches in the stores for what can be eaten and eats; if there is no food in the stores, he remains hungry.  The agent must also sleep.  After each action, 25% of cheerfulness is lost.  And during sleep, vigor is not lost, but is restored by 75% (but not more than 100%).  At 0% health begins to lose health, and action does not lead to an increase in strength and intelligence.  Hazardous actions may result in loss of health.  Health can be restored with the help of treatment, while spending energy.  Actions to sleep and treated should be included in the action planner.  The level of intelligence of an agent determines how many changes a player can make to an ontology graph.  In addition, performing actions gradually increases levels of physical strength and intelligence.  After that, when performing actions, higher-quality items are obtained and the amount that an agent can do is increased. <br><br>  Time in the game is conditional step by step.  In one real hour, 6 hours pass in the game.  The player has a scheduler in which he assigns an agent's action plan for the day.  Time is discrete and the minimum time in the plan is 6 game hours (which is equal to 1 real hour).  Planning can be done for 30 gaming days, which corresponds to approximately 5 real days.  Player actions are performed in accordance with this plan, in which there are 120 cells of consecutive actions.  1 game day = 4 real hours 6 game days = 1 day 30 game days = 5 real days = 120 actions. <br><br>  The game has a barter market in which players can enter into transactions to exchange one item for another. <br><br>  Improving the complexity of the world means clarifying and expanding the ontology graph.  This is done through the issuance of licenses for a particular method of production of the product.  Therefore, in this game, the complexity of the world is controlled by the players, and accordingly, the greater the complexity of the world - the more opportunities and challenges in this world - but everything is in your hands. <br><br><h4>  Scenario "Unite under the banners of cities" </h4><br><br>  There is one scenario that you can do to improve the game.  I ask you to evaluate how much it will improve or, on the contrary, spoil what is already there. <br><br>  We give the opportunity to "rob the cows." <br><br>  After 5 real days from the moment of registration and in the presence of player activity (the last action was performed no later than 15 game days ago), it can be robbed.  Occur this will be so added to the statistics page of active players registered for more than 5 days.  There will also be an opportunity to say that I want to attack this or that.  A new product will be introduced sword (and other weapons can be on an equal footing with the other themselves).  In the struggle between the players will be counted nat.  strength and availability of a better sword.  In order to avoid an attack, the player will first be asked to give 50% of his reserves, otherwise the winner will take all the reserves if they lose.  A new type of product will be introduced - real estate, if it is available, it will be counted as an opportunity to add.  protection, the ability to save from 10 to 20% of stocks, but will be destroyed when you lose.  Of course, health will suffer, energy and vigor will be expended (depending on the difference in strength). <br><br>  At the same time, it will be possible to move to another city, for this you need to leave all your reserves.  But players located in the same city will be able to create a fortress and organize the defense of the city.  Then, when attacking a player under the protection of the city, the attacker will have to deal with all the players by ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù (you cannot attack the group).  In the city, the players themselves will decide what role they will have for a warrior or a simple resident or a foreigner.  Warriors participate in the defense, but the warriors set a fee for the protection of ordinary residents, which they must pay (with goods).  Without paying a fee, the role of a resident is automatically - a foreigner who is not protected by warriors.  The fee is distributed between the soldiers, depending on their physical.  strength <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><br>  I ask all comments, criticism and noticed bugs to write either right here or to our <a href="https://github.com/tac14/CyberNet/issues%3Fstate%3Dopen">bugtracker on github</a> .  Programmers are also invited to participate in the development.  I also ask you to make a discount on the fact that there are no active participants yet, and therefore the barter market and the use of licenses are not developed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182944/</a></p>
