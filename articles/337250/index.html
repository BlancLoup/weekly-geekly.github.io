  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Negotiations that work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img2.ntv.ru/home/news/20130914/10_volskiy_geneve2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Remember how the sellers in the market, smiling broadly, persuaded you to buy something that you absolutely did not need?  Or cases when angry neighbors, loudly knocking on the door of your apartment, demanded something to stop, although you were not at home at that moment?  Or talk to your boss about raising your own salary when you didn‚Äôt know how to start?  If something like this happened in your life, then you were a participant in the negotiations when the initiative was not on your side. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a large number of trainings, video instructions, literature on teaching people how to speak publicly, how to conduct conflict negotiations, how to work with objections, but they all have one unifying criterion - they are aimed at selling something.  My colleagues and I work in the telecommunications telecoms operator of the Big Three.  Our task is to find platforms for locating base stations anywhere and build long-term relationships for the long term on the conditions on which it will be beneficial to all parties, even in the conditions of modern greed. <br><br>  The number of negotiations conducted by us is over a hundred every day.  And the result of using the scheme described below is to reduce operating expenses by several tens of millions of rubles a year. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  Despite the opinion that improvisation is the sister of talent, not everyone has the skill and ability to resist conflicting, accusatory dialogues.  More often than not, at the moment of the angry tirade against you, you simply cannot formulate an answer.  First, you need to collect the most accessible information about previous experience with the client, and make your "foundation" of arguments that prove the steadfastness of their own position.  In case your opponent, in front of you for the first time use the ‚Äúgolden rule of morality‚Äù.  One of the important factors influencing the success of the negotiations is working out how much you can give in to reach an agreement and what your goal is.

    <h2>  "Pump over" yourself </h2><br>  In our work, we are faced with different ways of negotiating, be it phone or in-person meetings.  If, regarding telephone conversations, in most cases it is enough just not to give up positions and have a confident voice, then during face-to-face meetings it is required to pay increased attention to yourself.  Every time you plan an in-person meeting, imagine diplomats in the international arena.  Remember what they are?  Presentable appearance, calm diction, confidence in words, emotions ‚Äúin check‚Äù.  It is this kind of preparation that is required during the meeting.  This does not mean that you should keep a tie and high-heeled shoes on hand, but the absence of bright and ‚Äúbeach‚Äù clothes will significantly increase your chances of success.  If you feel that your voice is trembling or you do not know what to say next, then it is recommended to conduct several training-rehearsals, like at home in front of a mirror or involving your colleagues. <br><br><h2>  Be flexible and negotiate "ashore" </h2><br>  The success of your negotiations does not always depend on the use of clever tricks, such as a demonstration of power or the transition to personality.  The dialogue may not go exactly according to the scenario that you intended, for example, if your opponent is in a bad mood or is in a hurry somewhere.  Therefore, it is very important to have "aces up your sleeve" in order to adjust to the situation.  To do this, you must clearly follow the goal of your negotiations so that your opponent cannot confuse you by agreeing to a small part of what you want from him.  Feel free to ask for more.  Look for points of contact, such as the meeting place, the opponent's goals.  Control the entire negotiation process from start to finish, do not relax after the first consent.  Try to pronounce all the details of your future agreement so that there are no unpleasant surprises for both parties that may have negative consequences for your transaction.  The strategy of building a long-term relationship with your opponent is very important.  Remember that even if you are standing in a corner and have a gun at you, then there is always a way out, either to pierce a wall or take away a weapon. <br><br><h2>  Get a signature </h2><br>  Quoting a film about lawyers: ‚ÄúAny words and agreements are worth nothing until you have signed the contract.‚Äù  To exclude cases where the parties interpret the agreements reached differently, try to record the result.  This may be a signed agreement or a protocol of negotiations.  Eliminate the possibility of withdrawing a deal from your opponent. <br><br>  Many of the approaches are applicable in our daily life, which can be used in any of your cases, ranging from buying on the market and ending with recruitment. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337250/</a></p>
