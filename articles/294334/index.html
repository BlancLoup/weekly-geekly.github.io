  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shopping from mobile devices: new trends in mobile shopping in Ukraine and the world (infographics)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the report of Juniper Research, the number of online purchases in the world by 2018 will reach 125 billion. According to experts, a significant increase in online purchases will be due to mobile devices.  Earlier we shared global indicators of <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/wayforpay/blog/15814/">mobile payments in infographics</a> , in this material new numbers and trends of the Ukrainian market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eed/489/ba0/eed489ba04d144a5a3470c6ccc8538f3.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to Juniper Research, the main factors that will affect the growth in the number of purchases from mobile devices are ‚Äúpurchases on the go.‚Äù  Users will use their free time in the presence of high-quality access to the network (growth of free Wi-Fi access points, 3G) for online purchases, for example, while waiting for transport or on the road. <br>  According to the analysis of purchases, through the <a href="https://wayforpay.com/">WayForPay</a> system, in the summer period there is an increase in the number of purchases from mobile devices.  In the summer, the share of the number of purchases from mobile devices reached an indicator of 18%, while in May the indicator was at the level of 13% -14%.  This growth could be due to the launch of 3G in Ukraine. <br>  Also, when analyzing purchases from mobile devices via the WayForPay system, it is noted that Ukrainian users are more inclined to use mobile phones for shopping than tablets.  The share of mobile purchases was 11%, while purchases from tablets accounted for about 7%. <br>  In addition, Ukrainian ‚Äúmobile‚Äù customers are more likely to use Android devices, but at the same time, buyers with IOS have higher average checks.  The average purchase using Android devices is 475 UAH, and for iPhone and iPad fans - 686 UAH. <br>  In the global mobile payment research by Adyen, payments via the iPhone accounted for 36% of all payments made by mobile devices.  The average transaction amount is about 83 euros.  The size of the average payment from Android devices - 75 euros. <br>  At the same time, Android users tend to make purchases more often on Sundays, purchases from IOS devices occur on Fridays more often.  The most successful time for purchases after 19.00 <br>  The highest average check in the category ‚ÄúComputers / TV / Multimedia‚Äù when buying from mobile devices is about $ 242.  Approximately $ 198 is the average mobile purchase in the Books, Music, Games category.  Comparatively, the lowest average bill when buying flowers and gifts is only $ 41.  In Ukraine, the top 3 categories for buying from a mobile device are ‚ÄúTickets, Tourism‚Äù, ‚ÄúClothing and Accessories‚Äù, ‚ÄúFood and Drinks‚Äù.  The highest average check in the category ‚ÄúTickets, tourism‚Äù - more than 1800 UAH.  This category includes the purchase of tickets, train and bus tickets, as well as hotel reservations. <br>  The active use of mobile devices in everyday life undoubtedly gives the online business motivation to improve the ‚Äúmobile channels‚Äù of sales.  But while most use mobile gadgets as a tool to search for goods and services.  So according to Pymnts.com, 91% of buyers use mobiles to make purchasing decisions.  55% - use mobile devices to find the best price.  But, nevertheless, an audience is already forming that likes to buy from a mobile and prefers to choose and pay for the goods as conveniently and simply as possible.  22% of buyers said they would be happy to use the ‚Äúone click‚Äù payment option when buying from a mobile. <br>  Mobile commerce is growing 3 times faster than ecommerce.  The transition to the ‚Äúmobile‚Äù sales format should have a high-quality implementation by the Internet business in order to convert the visitor from a mobile device into a full-fledged customer.  Enough attention should be paid to the development of the application, the mobile version of the site, and the correct implementation of <a href="https://wayforpay.com/">receiving payment</a> from mobile devices.
