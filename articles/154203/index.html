  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Office supplies that may disappear in the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bf/d19/341/4bfd1934190d010fc6f55330102019d8.jpg"><br><br>  The realities of the modern world show us that the situation with the workplace is changing.  We often work from home, if we talk about office workers, we often go on business trips and sometimes we just work on the road.  In the situation with freelance, I think many also see changes with the objects that they have to face in carrying out their activities. <br>  LinkedIn conducted research, which was attended by about 7,000 professionals who assessed which office supplies and trends are likely to disappear by 2017. <br><br>  Below is the top with my brief comments on each item: <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. Tape recorders / tape recorders (79%)</b> <br>  I would also add CD players here.  They, it seems to me, are almost nonexistent. <br><br>  <b>2. Faxes (71%)</b> <br>  We are only faxed by SPAM.  We use extremely rarely.  Is that in the government to send a letter. <br><br>  <b>3. Post-it (sticky papers, stickers) (58%)</b> <br>  More and more information is recorded in the electronic storage of notes, sent by e-mail.  So that you can then track who I wrote and what notes I saved. <br><br>  <b>4. Standard working time (57%)</b> <br>  Standard 8 o'clock "incubates", probably, only office staff.  But let me remind you that this survey was conducted among specialists.  Although it all depends on how to build your work schedule. <br><br>  <b>5. Fixed phones (35%)</b> <br>  I‚Äôm not sure that they will live out of us for another 10 years. But the fact that mobile and Internet negotiations now take up an increasing part of communication is a fact. <br><br>  <b>6. Stationary computers (34%)</b> <br>  Everyone knows that laptops are lighter, take up less space, are portable and can be taken on trips and work from anywhere. <br><br>  <b>7. Official business clothes (suits, ties, etc.) (27%)</b> <br>  Everything is moving towards convenience and increased work efficiency.  Naturally, official meetings are still held in costumes.  But if you look at what are the tops of companies at various conferences, the trend is visible.  Yes, and in everyday life works better in comfortable clothes. <br><br>  <b>8. USB-drives (flash drives) (17%)</b> <br>  Everything gradually goes to the clouds. <br><br>  Technologies and things that people increasingly mention and see in their work look like this: <br>  - laptops / tablets.  Easy, convenient, mobile.  (55%) <br>  - cloud technologies.  You can use from any place, the main thing that was the Internet.  (54%) <br>  - flexible working hours and smartphones (scored 52% each) <br><br>  And finally, a small list of what people would like to see in their office world: <br>  - an assistant who will assist during work (25%) <br>  - a place in the office where there is sunlight (25%) <br>  - a place where you can take a nap (22%) <br>  - the ‚Äúquiet‚Äù button, when clicked, colleagues will not hear what you are talking about (22%) <br><br>  Naturally, this does not happen in all areas of activity.  In many professions, these or other items or technologies will remain for a very long time, but the fact that everything gradually changes is a fact and we are witnesses of it.  Yes, and we push out many things from our lives.  Behind myself, I began to notice that I was ceasing to use notebooks, preferring electronic planners.  The exceptions are meetings with new customers.  Yes, and then the notebook there is more used for reliability. <br><br>  What about you?  Do you notice for yourself that you stop using any objects during work? <br><br>  PS: Data is taken <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/08/linkedin-10-office-tools-and-workplace-norms-that-are-going-extinct/%3Fgrcc%3D33333Z98ZtrendingZ1Z0Z0Z0Z0%26icid%3Dtrending1%26grcc2%3Dd71915172800a7d192086254a821f836~1349771349497~fca4fa8af1286d8a77f26033fdeed202~01e8f6f172cd349b0216825b02b2f82a~1349761797127~98~0~0~0~1~0~0~0~9~6~6~14~-1~-6209247310083208701~~">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154203/</a></p>
