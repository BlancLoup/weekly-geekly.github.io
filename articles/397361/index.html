  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lasers and 4K in the Wonderful Mansion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCnkSLdockk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  On August 24, we made a presentation for the press of new models of bright installation projectors.  Directly at the presentation one could see in the work two new projectors with a luminous flux of 7000 lumens, Epson EB-G7905U and EB-L1200U.  In the case of the latter, the letter ‚ÄúL‚Äù means ‚Äúlaser‚Äù, which explains its special significance.  In addition to the letters in the name of the model, the new Epson laser projectors boast, above all, the official guarantee of 20,000 hours, or 5 years, when operating in 24-hour mode, 7 days a week!  If this is not a sign of reliability, then what?  - "Put and forget." </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-laser-business/">EB-L1000 series</a> laser projectors have brightness from 6000 to 12000 lumens at WUXGA resolution with support for the 4K Enhancement function, significantly increased contrast (both native and dynamic), automatic color retention with the help of the built-in camera color reproduction for multi-projector installations), flexible brightness adjustment in 1% increments instead of the standard set of several modes (the resource of the light source can be increased by 2-3 times), plus installation at any angle  reduce lamp life that is characteristic of the projector lamp.  This fall is also expected to begin shipping the EB-L25000U projector with a brightness of 25,000 lumens, which raises the bar for Epson projectors more than 2 times. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fe/bdc/9a1/2febdc9a175848e993cf61bbc52feea9.jpg"></div><br><p>  As for the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-g7000w/">EB-G7000</a> series of lamp projectors, they are also models with excellent reliability and color reproduction, they also have improved contrast and laser analog capabilities such as displaying a 4K signal using the 4K Enhancement function, which, by the way, was an object close attention during the presentation itself and made it possible on the basis of this detailed acquaintance to draw conclusions not only about its ability to effectively deal with the pixel grid, but also really reproduce the 4K signal with a clearness  yu, very close to 4K.  Although the EB-G7000 and EB-L10000 Series projectors have a resolution of WUXGA (1920 √ó 1200) matrixes, the 4K Enhancement technology reproduces the 4K signal without downscaling to WUXGA / Full HD - the demonstrators had the opportunity to see for themselves. </p><br><p>  The secret of technology is in using an optical image shift by half a pixel diagonally every second frame, although few people know about this ‚Äúshamanism‚Äù at all.  What does this mean in practice?  - Only that the value of the mentioned projectors increases significantly, but the price does not.  Of course, it is also assumed that the ‚Äú4K Enhancement‚Äù function can and should be used in combination with upscaling when playing Full HD format.  In the projectors menu for this there is a bunch of settings for various sharpening algorithms, the main thing is not to ‚Äúoverdo‚Äù. </p><br><p>  And, of course, the main plus of installation projectors based on our proprietary 3LCD technology is the same high brightness in white and color in the brightest projector mode, which, combined with excellent color accuracy, allows you to get a beautiful image at the maximum brightness declared, not switching to less vivid ‚Äúprecise modes‚Äù (which, of course, also exist). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52f/bb4/95c/52fbb495ca404d5cb4610c515a993be1.jpg"></div><br><p>  Now a little about the event itself.  It took place in the <a href="http://aliceforkids.com/index.html">‚ÄúWonderful Mansion‚Äù</a> (exhibition ‚ÄúAlice in Wonderland‚Äù, Myasnitskaya 71).  In the exhibition itself, many different types of Epson projectors are used to create an atmosphere of surrealism.  In combination with the characters of Carroll‚Äôs universe, who helped conduct the event, a truly fantastic effect was achieved, which was greatly facilitated by a visual show using only two Epson EB-Z projectors with a brightness of 10,000 lumens projected onto two walls of the main hall.  At the same time, the walls smoothly passed to the ceiling, and the projectors were positioned so that it was possible to demonstrate both the flexible possibilities of screen shape correction and keystone correction (one projector was inclined), and the use of ‚Äúlens shift‚Äù (another projector was parallel to the floor, but the image was optically up). </p><br><p>  After this show, the formal part was held, during which the presentation of new projectors was read by Epson‚Äôs projection equipment manager, Nikolay Akhmetdzhanov, and then everyone went to play croquet accompanied by the Queen and the Mad Hatter.  Only enthusiasts did not participate in this, with their heads immersed in viewing pixels during the testing of the 4K Enhancement function. </p></div>
