Problems are found in both the general design and the astronaut security systems. <br><br>  The agency has the full right to issue warnings to its partners, since both companies work with NASA under a contract.  SpaceX previously received $ 2.6 billion, and Boeing - $ 4.2 billion. Both companies pledged to develop a rocket and a capsule so that the United States could again launch astronauts on the ISS on its own.  Last time it was done in 2011. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each year, the agency inspects the progress of program implementation by partners, this and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371481/">last</a> year is no exception.  During the inspection, the agency revealed problems with the Boeing capsule - it is exposed to external factors above the norm after thermal protection is activated.

      For SpaceX, the problem lies in the vulnerability of the missile tanks (NASA did not forget about the explosion that occurred in 2016), as well as in the process of refueling the missile ‚Äúon the move‚Äù while the astronauts are in their ‚Äúworkplace‚Äù.  Usually, rockets are fueled without people, since there is a non-zero explosion hazard during the refueling process.  But SpaceX decided differently, in part to speed up the process, so that the cooled fuel would not be heated too much during the preparation of the rocket for launch. <br><br>  In addition, NASA has comments on the parachute capsule system of both companies, both SpaceX and Boeing.  ‚ÄúWe have identified serious problems that may affect the implementation of the work plan for both SpaceX and Boeing,‚Äù the report says. <br><br>  According to Reuters sources, NASA has many more comments than noted in the report.  For each of the partner companies, the agency made about three dozen comments.  Unfortunately, it is not clear what these problems are - neither NASA nor the agency‚Äôs partners have yet commented on the situation.  Nevertheless, experts say that both companies must solve all the problems before the launch of astronauts (and cosmologists) into near-Earth space. <br><br>  The report ships are CST-100 StarLiner (Boeing ship) and Crew Dragon (SpaceX ship).  On March 2, the first unmanned launch of the Crew Dragon was planned, and it should have taken place even earlier, but it was constantly postponed due to various problems.  Flight tests CST-100 StarLiner also changed, the schedule shifted from March to April.  The SpaceX piloted launches should have begun to implement since July of this year, Boeing - from August.  In addition to the ships themselves, NASA partners are developing spacesuits for the team.  Not so long ago, the company Boeing presented its development, which was called "Boeing Blue". <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/CST-100_Starliner">Under the terms of the contract</a> with NASA, spacecraft must accommodate a crew of at least four people.  Also in the compartments, according to NASA requirements, it should be possible to accommodate 100 kg of payload.  The device must be able to remain docked to the station for 210 days in order to ensure the delivery of astronauts and astronauts to Earth, and, if necessary, to perform emergency evacuation of the team.  NASA believes that working with new Boeing and SpaceX ships will increase the station‚Äôs crew by up to seven people.  This <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/285160/">will increase the</a> amount of time that can be devoted to scientific research. <br><br>  A Boeing spokesman made a statement that the company had ‚Äúclosed‚Äù the risk of a ship‚Äôs capsule being vulnerable, so the test program conducted in January was successful.  According to experts of this company, the Boeing ship and all its elements not only meet the safety requirements of NASA, but even surpass them. <br><br>  Approximately with the same comment SpaceX spokesman James Gleason made a public comment.  He stated that his company had developed "one of the safest and most advanced systems of manned spaceflight ever existing." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441454/</a></p>
