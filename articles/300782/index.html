      Every day, every hour and every minute we literally ‚Äúswim‚Äù in the boundless sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfeedback.  Companies have created for consumers a huge ‚Äúfield‚Äù for feedback - comment boxes, smiles with thumb-ups, virtual applause, winks, sad little faces ‚Äî you can list them endlessly.  Almost all websites have consultation pop-ups that cover most of the content on the page.  Such freedom of action "spoiled" customers, gave them the confidence that their feedback was simply necessary for each company, regardless of subject matter.  What do we see as a result?  There is a huge amount of feedback, most of which is simply useless. How can you find really important opinions in this infinity that can influence the development of the company and contribute to the progress of its development? <br><br>  All feedback received from users is officially called ‚Äúbig data‚Äù.  The difficulty is that the amount of information is not always equal to its quality.  Sometimes a smaller amount of data is better for a business than a surplus.  Correct feedback = good feedback. <br><br>  And in this article we will try to figure out how to get the maximum benefit from feedback. <br><br>  <b>Qualification</b> <br><br>  No need to take every comment as the ultimate truth, users can not be qualified absolutely in everything.  But you, as a company representative, should.  <u>Before giving feedback, make sure that you are sufficiently knowledgeable in the question under consideration.</u>  <u>Prioritize your answers.</u>  With a large volume of requests from users, it is important not to disperse attention, but to concentrate on the most important topics.  If additional time is needed to give customers feedback, let them know about it, so they will see their importance for your business and, at the same time, a serious approach to the question, and not tick-off answers. <br><br>  <b>Prehistory</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Before answering the question asked, find out why feedback is important for the client, for what purpose he wants to get an answer, if possible, ask about the background of the problem.  This will help you clarifying questions.  So you are fully immersed in the subject and can provide high-quality feedback and achieve the most loyal attitude to your brand. <br><br>  <b>Standardization</b> <br><br>  Feedback is most useful when it meets certain customer expectations.  Here we give a slightly metaphorical example, which well demonstrates a possible scenario of the situation. <br><br>  <i>You were asked to provide information about the employee.</i>  <i>And here you need to understand what kind of information may be of interest to the consumer.</i>  <i>Of course, you do not need to talk about what interesting reports Ivan Ivanov is preparing for weekly meetings, or what interesting stories he tells in ‚Äúcorporate events‚Äù (unless your company organizes holidays, for example).</i> <br><br>  <u>Exclude from your answer a subjective assessment.</u>  <u>Only clearly formulated, useful and filtered information that is directly related to the subject matter.</u>  Based on certain standards when building a feedback, you can achieve the most effective communication with the client. <br><br>  <b>Focusing</b> <br><br>  Decide for yourself which feedback you will pay more attention to - the one that requires you to follow the standard scheme of communication with customers, or the one that pays attention to atypical situations and malfunctions. <br><br>  In the first case, you focus on working out the feedback process of your brand, and not on private difficulties.  In the second version, feedback helps to eliminate single gaps in work, which, undoubtedly, is the growth point of the company.  Both options are good and useful for business development - decide what is more important for your specific activities. <br><br>  Detailed feedback, with a description of the problem, is much more important than just smiling smile or ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù.  No emoji will help you understand what the difficulties of your business are and how you can deal with them.  <u>Try to pay more attention to exactly that feedback, which gives a clear picture of your shortcomings.</u> <br><br>  <b>Giving is getting</b> <br><br>  All of the above recommendations relate to the provision of feedback from companies.  But at the same time, they help and receive quality feedback from customers.  No need to ask to give feedback all in a row - only those whose opinion is really supported by knowledge and important for your company.  The so-called "opinion leaders".  It is not necessary to directly ask them to leave a review - explain why their opinion is important to you.  At the same time, tell us what kind of information you are interested in obtaining from clients, so you will provide yourself with useful data that will really help in the work of the company.  Direct the process in the right direction. <br><br>  A new era of Internet development dictates its own rules.  Today, most people already ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the ‚Äúworld wide web‚Äù.  We are surrounded by terabytes of information - pictures, posts, blog entries.  And in such an abundance it is very difficult not to descend on ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù communication, when comments are left for comments.  <b>By focusing on the four steps described above, you can increase the value of feedback within your organization and systematize the work with feedback, obtaining the most useful data for improving the work of the company.</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg12052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300782/</a></p>
