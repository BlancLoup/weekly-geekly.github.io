  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smoshniki whitewash</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here is a press release below.  In short: 5 agencies decided to start with spam, bots and other nastiness in social networks.  The trend of whitening SMO is clearly visible lately, here the work before was primarily on the part of the social networks themselves, for example, multiple blows to the advertisers from Vkontakte this year, and now the agencies have taken the initiative.  Perhaps this will help customers understand that the numbers on the counter are not as important as the actually interested people, that a pair of sales does not pay back multiple reputational costs from spam and, by and large, spam is harmful even for free, and paying for it is completely strange.  So, the press release (carefully, pathos!) <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Advertising agencies runet unite to counter dirty methods of working in social networks</b> <br><br>  Five runet advertising agencies working in the field of social media have announced their desire to put an end to the wild market and develop a code of rules for working in social networks and the blogosphere in order to make this area cleaner and more transparent. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Working in social networks and the blogosphere is the most promising method both for advertising and for solving other marketing tasks, such as studying the audience, increasing brand awareness and even direct sales.  Other tools cannot compare to social media in terms of efficiency and diversity of opportunities. <br>  However, the methods of work in this booming market are not always fair and open.  Even more - they often contradict ethical norms, common sense and current legislation.  For example, for promotion of groups in the social network "Vkontakte" hundreds of thousands of bots are used, which are essentially hacked accounts of real people.  This is despite the fact that hacking even a single account is a criminal offense.  Mass mailing of spam to the walls of groups and private messages, cheat ratings for contestants, flood bots known LiveJournal, issuing bots for real people in front of clients: all this is an objective reality of a booming wild market. <br>  The story is not new, if we recall the search engine optimization market 10 years ago, it was just as promising and as wild as the SMM / SMO industry now.  Doorway, cloaking, spam, all this was enough in abundance, and only the formation of large players, as well as the opposition of search engines made the market for search engine optimization civilized. <br>  Today we announce the beginning of the transition to a civilized social media.  At the beginning of this journey, we take a small, but concrete step and refuse any offers to wind the counters for participants in any competition with material prizes in general and participants in the Alexey Navalny <a href="http://navalny.livejournal.com/625374.html">competition navalny.livejournal.com/625374.html</a> in particular.  As before, we work within the framework of the existing right margin and do not deal with hacked user accounts, sending messages or invitations without targeting (i.e., spam).  We reserve the right to refuse to work with any customer, if his goals seem unethical to us. <br>  In the near future, our agencies plan to develop a set of rules for working in social networks.  We hope that other market participants will join us in this. <br><br>  Initiating agencies (in alphabetical order): <br><br>  Advertising agency MediaTarget, Moscow <br>  Internet marketing agency Reclaim, St. Petersburg <br>  Studio SMOpro, Moscow <br>  Agency SocMediaMarketing <br>  Internet Advertising Agency TOP-SMO <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131675/</a></p>
