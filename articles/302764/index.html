      Before Google conducted a mobile update in April last year, <b>40% of all existing sites were not adapted for mobile devices.</b>  Today it is still quite difficult to find brands that will not only actively develop a mobile strategy, but also adhere to the ‚Äúmobile-first‚Äù direction, when the audience communicates with the company, primarily through mobile devices.  Such companies not only adapt the amount of content for small screens - they create unique content and connect additional features for mobile users based on their specific needs. <br><br>  In this article, we will look at global brands such as <b>Hotwire</b> , <b>TurboTax</b> and <b>Walgreens</b> , in order to understand how and why they decided to go beyond the limits of mobile devices in the practice of so-called ‚Äúmulti-screen‚Äù.  And let's start with what they are distinguished from competitors. <br><br>  <b>Company data is equally well and qualitatively available on all mobile devices.</b>  The advantage is that users can use the full functionality of mobile versions of brands, regardless of the device selected.  Walgreens and TurboTax have responsive sites with server-side elements, and for mobile devices, the Hotwire site uses mobile URLs;  but they all allow users to access the full functionality through multiple screens. <br><br>  <b>They go beyond content and take advantage of mobile devices</b> ‚Äî for example, a camera and a GPS navigator ‚Äî that provide users with more advanced features than on a regular site version.  At Walgreens, for example, there is an application that knows when you are in one of more than 8,100 stores throughout the US and offers personalized promotions for those who are currently in the store ‚Äî incentive programs, special offers, and coupons.  The TurboTax application allows tax clearance and tax return filing specialists to scan their W2 tax form (employee wage deduction) and import this data into the program, and also gives them direct access to specialists through a video call. <br><br>  <b>They integrate with wearable devices to demonstrate the value of users who actively switch to mobile-first</b> .  The Hotwire app integrates with Apple Watch to send reminders during your trip and even ‚Äútells‚Äù users the cost of the next gas price when it returns the car. <br>  Given the unstable economic situation, it is quite difficult to convince companies of the need to allocate a budget for the development of a mobile direction, not to mention mobile-first.  What do the representatives of the brand leaders of this sphere say? <br><br>  <b>Courtney Ferguson, Senior Mobile Product Manager for TurboTax</b> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow, in times of explosive popularity of mobile devices, <u>not to use the mobile-first strategy in the company is destructive</u> .  <u>The world is changing at lightning speed, and companies must evolve with the times in order to delight customers and remain always relevant.</u>  Two years ago, we decided to switch to mobile-first at full capacity - starting with design and ending with customer service.  Like most brands, the behavior of our customers is changing dramatically;  they are more mobile and more limited in time.  We have to be where they are, and formulate a convincing benefit for them, quickly and often on a small screen format. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alex otrezov, senior director of paid search operations at Hotwire,</b> said that for his company, which has extensive experience in the application, it is quite simple to implement the mobile-first strategy.  The user is authorized in the application, respectively, the company has enough data to work with.  ‚ÄúSince mobile application users are quite advanced in mobile, it was very important to adapt the mobile platform for travel needs,‚Äù says Alex. <br><br>  <b>Benjamin Weiss, mobile product manager for Walgreens,</b> notes that their company is focusing on both the web and mobile, but the important point is that users need to provide unique capabilities within each individual channel. <br>  <b>How do mobile-first leaders work?</b> <br><br>  In Hotwire, the main strategies chosen feedback with the audience.  They listen to users, explore the characteristics of their travels, and even conduct focus groups in which the company observes the principles of audience interaction with the product.  ‚ÄúWe analyze the trends and needs of customers during their travels and try to solve their problems by offering new opportunities.  We think over situations that consumers may have during their movements and find ways out, ‚Äùsays Alex. <br><br>  Walgreens Weiss considers <u>mobile as an extension of the company's overall strategy and increasing user experience for customers.</u>  Taking into account the interests of consumers and simultaneously solving their problems, the brand improves communication with the audience and makes it as effective as possible.  <u>Helping to solve life issues, marketing communication increases customer loyalty to the brand</u> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor us, a mobile is to provide users with new ways to establish‚Äú communication ‚Äùwith Walgreens (like printing photos and cards, access to coupons,‚Äù says Weiss. ‚ÄúWe spend a lot of time testing new products before they get into the hands of to consumers, ‚Äùsays Walgreens mobile manager. <br><br>  <u>‚ÄúPain points‚Äù of clients and their elimination through competent marketing communication of the brand - this is the area that must be developed by the company that decided to move to the mobile-first.</u> <br><br>  <b>Why does it make sense to switch to a mobile-first-strategy?</b> <br><br>  Mobile-first can provide users with more advanced content and functionality than in the web versions.  This approach increases customer loyalty to the brand and the frequency of their access to branded applications. <br><br>  The ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of brand communication with users is increasing, which means that they are no longer only as representatives of a certain company, but also as platforms that allow solving urgent problems.  Such ‚Äúthinking‚Äù of companies increases organic traffic, relying on clients' behavioral characteristics and their needs, which will bring positive results of marketing strategy much faster. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr06062016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302764/</a></p>
