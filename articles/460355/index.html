The last 10 of them I lead: 200 people were under my command at different times. <br><br>  Interestingly, I remember everyone who quit and for whatever reason.  I remember, not because I have a good memory, but because they rarely left. <br><br>  In this article I will tell you what, from my point of view, keeps a person in the team.  I will share techniques on how to encourage people to have a different attitude to work and ultimately overcome the problems of demotivation.  And also - to speculate about how we are inside we are heating up different thoughts and interests, what burns people out the most, drowns people, and why drowning people cannot always get out themselves.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/j5/j0/bij5j0y_g0jk0zrtvopmj58v_ii.jpeg"><br><br>  I spoke on this topic at <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/badoo/blog/457084/">Badoo TechLeads Meetup # 4</a> ( <a href="https://youtu.be/zMkkTTfbSzA">video</a> ).  My story is most likely not suitable for those whose team is more than 100 people: I will talk about the level of team leader, technical director, technical director of a small company.  I myself started with a small company.  When I came to the mos.ru team, we had three engineers.  Over the year we have grown to 40, in two years to 80. Now, at different times of the day and depending on the weather, we have up to a hundred people. <br><br>  I will tell you about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Problems </h2><br>  What are the problems?  Burnout and demotivation. <br><br>  Who have them?  Yes, almost everyone. <br><br>  Can anyone give a definition of at least one of them? <br><br>  Most likely no.  Because everyone is sick in his own way, and talking about everyone will be too abstract. <br><br>  Therefore, I will focus on simple, frequently encountered questions: <br><br><ul><li>  I stopped liking this project. <br></li><li>  I want new, interesting tasks. <br></li><li>  Tired of it all.  I want something else fresh. <br></li></ul><br>  At the interview you ask the candidates: ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù - ‚ÄúInteresting tasks!‚Äù - ‚ÄúWhat is interesting tasks in your understanding?‚Äù At this moment, there is often a pause, because very few people can explain what an interesting task is.  Nevertheless, everyone believes that they should be at work. <br><br><h2>  The reasons </h2><br>  All these problems are, of course, a consequence.  The investigation has its reasons. <br>  Some of the reasons are probably familiar to many of you.  First of all come to mind: <br><br><ul><li>  process dictate: bust with processes that torments everyone.  When they tell you to do it this way and not in another way. <br></li><li>  Deafness and blindness of colleagues and superiors. <br></li><li>  Routine. <br></li><li>  Boredom, uninteresting tasks. <br></li></ul><br>  If we now begin to list everything, then we will type at least a hundred.  And each will have their own, unique reasons, which are often embarrassed to talk about. <br><br>  Fight them start only when the problem is already there.  Most people who suffer from these problems are already seriously ill.  But when you, as a team leader, go and look at the team, the team looks calm enough: everything is fine, everything works. <br><br>  The leaders at this moment have a <b>false sense of stability</b> : you look at the situation from the outside and think that everything is fine.  And if you start picking up this business with a knife or file a file, it turns out that this is not at all the case. <br><br>  In addition, a related problem arises - a <b>false sense of control</b> .  You start to think that the whole process that takes place in your team is controlled by you: you are well done, you know what happens to people and how, what bad and good things are. <br><br>  In the end, it turns out that you are all so good, but at the same time everything burns around, your people are burning.  They get bored, for some reason they leave.  The reason they usually call it is more money.  But if you talk more closely with people, it turns out that this is not the problem. <br><br><h2>  Receptions </h2><br>  How to prevent such situations?  I will tell you about the techniques that I have been using for years and which, from my point of view, can make people‚Äôs life more comfortable. <br><br>  Before this, talk a little about yourself.  The team I'm working on now makes the portal mos.ru.  We are exactly the same as most IT companies: we have a legacy, a zoo of technologies, a lack of documentation.  Requirements vary with cosmic speeds. <br><br>  By and large, we do not differ by anything except one fact: we grew up from the very beginning, using these techniques. <br><br><h3>  Reception # 0: movement demonstration </h3><br>  We show how our team moves forward: it develops, reaches heights, it messes up (who doesn't messes up, he does nothing).  Demonstrations are constantly. <br><br>  Previously, only team members came to them.  For half a year, we have been inviting all those who see the system to move to the demonstrations.  We conduct internal meetings, where we discuss what new cool things have been done.  These meetings are not only thematic - for example, for the backend.  No, everyone comes to the back-end metap, including the designers.  They are interested to listen, talk, find out what's going on. <br><br>  An important point, which many people forget about, is the influence of the external conjuncture: what is happening around us, around the team, the project.  People are interested to see how the movement inside the team corresponds to the movement that occurs around. <br><br>  How does this technique help in everyday life?  We, like many, sometimes have to recycle: to linger in the evening or go out on Saturday.  I never force reprocessing, but I will definitely explain what is happening and why.  For example, that there is a new large project, socially important for Muscovites, where city residents will be able to see what improvements will occur in his area in the near future.  With 500 people passed through these yards, they counted and recorded the necessary information.  The developer understands that he is involved in a large and complex process, he knows why he works this way.  And in most cases, ready to help. <br><br>  For some reason they usually do not like to talk about such nuances, although they have no secret. <br><br><h3>  Reception # 1: Do not hide </h3><br>  The team should understand what is happening and why.  Where we are at the current moment in time, how this corresponds to plans and promises, what our future is. <br><br>  Lack of plans is a thing that strongly influences a person‚Äôs internal state.  When he realizes that the WP-blog, which he is now programming, another five years will be a WP-blog, which he will program, the developer is very sad.  Therefore, we are trying to tell what changes will take place in the near future in the external conjuncture, what will change, what large projects will be. <br><br>  We managed to agree with the management that periodically, every six months, we are given information about this.  And we learn that, for example, we are not doing anything new just because something new and cool is being prepared. <br><br>  By the way, in order to make something new and cool in the city, for example, to translate some process into an electronic form, very often you need to prepare documentation, a legislative base. <br><br>  Take, for example, a child‚Äôs enrollment in a pioneer camp.  It would seem that it could be simpler: come, fill the mold - and please.  And then the details begin: how to equate the rights of those people who applied physically, and those who submitted it through the electronic form? <br><br>  Everything connected with the state and society is serious enough.  Therefore, it is necessary to explain why everything is so, and not otherwise.  Sometimes we do not release, because a certain resolution does not reach the phase where we can release the product.  This is an infrequent effect, but nevertheless it happens.  If the developers know about it, they understand that we are not ‚Äúcrammed and abandoned‚Äù - we just have such a mode of operation.  They begin to take it calmly. <br><br><h3>  Reception # 2: to give clearly regulated freedom </h3><br>  Freedom is good.  But complete freedom is bad. <br><br>  We are accustomed from childhood that someone cares for us.  At first parents followed, then teachers in the kindergarten, then teachers in the institute, then the head.  If the impression is created that the boss is not following you, the most often the question arises: maybe he doesn‚Äôt care, maybe he is not interested in all this, he wanted to spit on it at all?  Total freedom ends up being a problem.  Therefore, freedom must be given, but not full, but limited.  Telling people that there is a canvas, and within the framework of this canvas they can move. <br><br>  For example, we agreed that we are programming in PHP - it happened historically.  Inside this are libraries, approaches, OOP, not OOP, to write one way or another, some patterns - this, please, you yourself.  But in PHP. <br><br>  When people come and say: ‚ÄúI want Go‚Äù, I say - ‚ÄúLet's think about how your‚Äú want ‚Äùcan be realized in‚Äú I can, ‚Äùinto something useful.‚Äù  As a result, the developer knows that he has the opportunity to put forward proposals, but in order for these proposals to be rolled into production, it will be necessary to work.  They know these rules of the game, they know that there is such an opportunity.  Some use it: so we have not only PHP, but also other programming languages. <br><br><h3>  Reception # 3: let in processes </h3><br>  We let people in processes, but with some restriction.  The limitation is that we have nine teams, nine processes, and there is a root process - a release that regulates the output to production.  He is one for all. <br><br>  Around this process, guys do what they like best. <br><br>  Our grocery and business processes are quite different.  For example, the command that saws the search is internal.  Search requirements are most often generated by us.  There are commands that program mobile applications, there is a completely different kitchen.  There is a web that exists as a separate product, there is a web that exists as a news editor with an admin panel.  There, too, everything is different, but the release processes are all the same. <br><br>  Limited freedom looks like this: do what you want, but don't touch this piece.  Due to this, I have already forgotten what critical production errors are.  Because there is a clear rule that says how to do it.  Do you want to play - play: in fact, we now have not a single process, except for release, is not documented.  At the same time, people feel comfortable. <br><br>
<h3>  Reception # 4: rotate the drum </h3><br>  A tricky trick: we call it "rotate the drum", but you can rotate the carousel or concrete mixer - call it whatever you like.  The point is that we do not consciously tie people to tasks. <br><br>  We do not have such that someone from the frontend, backend or from DevOps could not do some other task.  Code ownership - we just don't have it. <br><br>  First, it adds interest to people, and second, it increases the notorious bus factor.  Thirdly, I can calmly transfer people between teams, collect teams from four other teams for large projects.  They start working literally in two days: two days they finish their tasks, and then they get together - and they drive. <br><br>  The largest and most important project I mentioned above made three teams.  And one had never before interacted with two others: the guys just came and accepted the rules of the game.  On average, we do such projects with a hodgepodge of guys every six months.  Due to the fact that they are generally not tied to any specific responsibilities, they feel great. <br><br>  There is one more feature that we try, and we succeed, we don‚Äôt just let people go, we try to keep them in a team, even in another area. <br><br>  Suppose I had an automation engineer, a tester.  I wrote auto tests on Python.  He was tired of testing, he said that he wanted to be a Python-developer.  It would seem that one could say to him: ‚ÄúGo and program in Python‚Äù.  But at this moment it turned out that we need a Python-developer in a mobile phone.  We sent him there: firstly, we did not lose knowledge in autotests, secondly, the person was not lost, and we saved on search. <br><br>  I have several such stories.  When we implemented the release management process, we converted two testers into release managers, and they feel great.  Maker-ups we turn into front-end developers.  I recently found out that one of the PHP developers is programming on Python at night.  It would seem that you can also let go, but we decided to play the game: I came to the search team, who have a Python backing, and asked to give me a complex non-urgent task.  What difference does it make that it programs in Python at night?  Let him program something we need.  If it works, we will define it there by a junior Python developer from a senior PHP developer.  Happens such a desire among people, what can you do? <br><br>  At these receptions, I did not lose 5-6 people from the team, I just redirected them. <br><br><h2>  The most important moment </h2><br>  I talked about the techniques that I use.  In fact, these are common things, that is, the impact on the whole team.  This applies directly to the whole team, all the guys until the very last junior engineer. <br><br>  But the truth is that the issue of burnout, motivation, everything else is quite personal and intimate.  They need to do a little closer to the people than I just said.  Therefore, I have built a rather complicated monitoring system. <br><br><h2>  Monitoring </h2><br>  She lined up long enough.  In this system, by and large, the whole team is involved. <br><br>  Monitoring should not be confused with complaints, with squealing, it is just a way to get information about what is happening at the current moment in a team.  From timlidov, from heads of services, with one-on-one meetings. <br><br>  Moreover, at these meetings I do not lock myself with someone in a meeting room the size of a meter by a meter, I do not put a person in front of me and do not stick a lamp in his face: "Piss."  No, I do not do that.  More often it is everyday talk when you catch a colleague near a coffee machine and ask how are you.  Or communicate in the smoking room, or give him a link to the event, which you advise to go, and simultaneously clarify something else. <br><br>  This, including, HR: periodically it brings very interesting news.  Despite the fact that we now have a whole one HR, he copes. <br><br><h2>  What am I talking about? </h2><br>  Everything about everything: about the weather, about the hobby, about a guitar accidentally noticed by a colleague.  I know who cares for whom, who has what cars, who is at the dacha, who is not at the dacha, who is mushrooming, who has what hurts.  I listen to the classic whining about the fact that testers are rascals, that the infrastructure is not working. <br><br>  It is important for me to understand what a person is interested in.  Labor veterans have already come to terms with the fact that they have chosen the wrong path, and the youth is still torn between React and Angular, 500 other languages ‚Äã‚Äãbetween PHP, Python, Go.  Most often they are interested in something.  In some cases I can satisfy their interest. <br><br>  It turns out that people do not tell anyone about their interests, not because they are reluctant, but because no one asks them about it.  When you come and ask what he would like, he says that he would like to study architecture, but he does not succeed, because we, scoundrels, have already invented architecture, and it is iron. <br><br>  You give him a book: let him go and read.  He reads it, begins to review the architecture that is.  He begins to propose some solutions, and so we remove his problem and pain, that he cannot do anything new. <br><br><h2>  Why all this? </h2><br>  The more you know about a person, the greater the chance that you will offer him a fairly simple and comfortable solution that will satisfy you all.  And he will not be lost, will cheer up, and you will not lose him.  Such a portrait of a person is needed to understand how to work with him as an individual, a person with his own problems. <br><br>  Have you seen a herd of horses running?  One is separated, and everyone looks around: "Where did she go for a break?"  But continue to run forward.  Then the most unstable breaks down after her.  There are already two of them.  And so on. <br><br>  These processes are cumulative.  You can sit and wait for a very long time, and then it will all explode.  Therefore, you need to know how everything works, and respond to signals as quickly as possible. <br><br><h2>  Ticket on will </h2><br>  But you should not forget that sooner or later it is all covered with a copper basin.  Already there is no way to influence a person: he just burned out.  You come, he does not react to anything, he says: ‚ÄúLeave me alone!  I do not want.  I will not.  I don't like anything. ‚Äù <br><br>  Most often, these people are then found somewhere in Bali.  They sit there half the belly up, do nothing, program some start-ups and believe that everything is great. <br>  It may happen that a person can no longer.  It is important to understand the causes, motivation and demotivation so that this does not happen again. <br><br>  Typical conversations with HR: ‚ÄúWhy are you leaving?‚Äù The most common answers are the same: ‚ÄúTired‚Äù.  Most likely, this is true.  Most of us change jobs because we‚Äôre tired.  Slightly less often due to the fact that they pay little, and more often because they are tired, and there is also more money.  Few people leave for some deeper reasons.  And in some cases for a good salary, we are ready to endure all sorts of bullying. <br><br>  To this must be prepared.  And most importantly, you need to be able to prepare people for this so that the horse will not work.  It is quite obvious that those who work in our industry closely understand that the average duration of an employee‚Äôs work in a team is 2‚Äì2.5 years.  Some studies show that it‚Äôs less than 1‚Äì1.5 years, and that‚Äôs it, people change jobs. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusions </h2><br>  We are all different, we all burn at different speeds.  Therefore, the group therapy I wrote about is good, but not very good.  It still does not affect people in such a way as to ensure that all problems are covered. <br><br>  Inside each of us has our own strength.  Typically, this force is not associated with any material goods: more often it is an opportunity to participate in something.  And this can be managed - but in the end you will still have to work one-on-one, earning the benefit primarily for yourself.  A saved employee is the key to your peace of mind. <br><br>  We live in the world of instructions.  For example, there is an instruction on how to distinguish a drowning person from a non-sinking person.  If suddenly you do not know her, I tell.  People drown with shouts, waving their hands, only in cartoons and movies.  In life, people drown in silence: just picked up and drowned.  This is a grim metaphor, but the meaning is clear: most often people burn out silently.  The only way to understand that something is happening is either to keep an eye on it all the time, or to be constantly ready to look for new colleagues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460355/</a></p>
