Thanks to the recommendation.  However, my todo differ from the standard and previously described, it is possible that the description of how I conduct them will help the developers of the corresponding software, well, or other people to quickly find the optimal form for themselves. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  0. I always carry my todo's with me - you never know what you need to write.  Therefore, if you write software to manage todo-lists, then it should be completely portable.  We must write it on ...

      No, they did not guess, not on java (although it is possible on java, of course), but the main thing is that it is an executable file without external dependencies (yes, yes, old, kind statically linked .exe or a.out will be ideal for this situations).  It is not always possible to download the necessary components from the Internet.  The program should work directly from the archive c flash drives. <br><br>  This, by the way, is a common problem area for any small utilities for performing various jobs.  They themselves are small, but sometimes they want non-trivial components installed in the system.  And if I'm sitting in an internet cafe, how easy will it be to install .net 3.5? <br><br>  WEB 2.0 won't help here, because many todo's are secret.  Well ... At the very least, the server will need to have a powerful cryptosystem. <br><br>  1. My todo - wooden.  That is, they have a nested structure.  Some goal may have subgoals that have sub-goals and so on.  When you have to do several projects (otherwise it‚Äôs not interesting to live, imho), then you need to somehow group things together. <br><br>  2. Mandatory is the item DONE.  Where in a solemn (more or less) setting, under the friendly cries of cheers and festive dances around the fire with tambourines (of varying intensity), completed cases are transferred.  This is perhaps the most important item on the todo list psychologically.  Until I began to lead DONE, todo did not help me. <br><br>  3. It is highly desirable to have the INPROGRESS clause, because you need to visualize your current load.  And how busy the head is.  Imho, the latter is quite important.  Personally, I am not always able to control what my inflamed mind decided to work on :).  He is able, however, to record this in inprogress, in order not to take on additional obligations, or to choose those that correspond to the moment from todo. <br><br>  4. Planning time for Joel, who is on software, does not work.  For one simple reason - it is difficult to predict how long it will take to achieve a particular goal.  And precisely for the reason that there is no practice.  We have to perform very different actions, and the skill of estimating the duration of work on a particular task is not developed.  Therefore, attempts to estimate how much all this will take are useless and only take precious time. <br><br>  Here it is.  Happy doing and thanks for the fish :) That is, for the attention. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24382/</a></p>
