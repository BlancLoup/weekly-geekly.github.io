But this is only part of the research in a large number of projects.  About American studies have heard almost everything, turning to European projects over the past few years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a scientific network called Future and Emerging Technologies ( <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/ist/fet/">FET</a> ), which is part of the Community Research &amp; Development Information <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/">Sevice</a> ( <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/">CORDIS</a> ), organized by the European Union.
