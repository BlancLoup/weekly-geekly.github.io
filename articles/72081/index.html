The appearance of the keyboard is not tied to the entered text, you can turn on the display of any keyboard layout or disable this hint at all. <br>  In the future, it will be possible to upload your texts, which can be mixed (for example, Russian and English), so there is no limit on the choice of layouts, depending on the selected text. <br><br>  After selecting and loading the language and the lesson (the first list below), the call to the server no longer occurs, you can continue to work in offline mode.  The text is entered line by line, at the end of the line, you must type either a space or Enter (denoted by). <br>  On the new line, you can stop and rest.  Until you start typing the text does not count, if you stop in the middle of the line for more than 15 seconds, you will have to type this line again, so you can leave the exercise at any time, for example, when the phone rang.

      Text is entered into a regular text field, so you can use any text editing features, you can even ‚Äútrick‚Äù the simulator by copying the entered string through the clipboard and show your colleagues a screenshot of the ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù results;) <br>  This approach to text input was made specifically; if an error is made, it will be seen which one.  Until you correct the error, you will not be able to complete the input string.  Some other simulators do not even see what was entered incorrectly. <br><br>  In addition to the current input line, two more are displayed, this is necessary so that you can not stop when you enter text when we go to the next line, and the display of erroneously entered characters, which are highlighted in yellow 7 positions forward.  The more mistaken, the more yellow will be in the lines of the text.  The goal of training is not speed, but accuracy, try to make the text box be white, and you will see how much faster the speed and quality of the text is. <br><br>  Above the text line displays information on the speed of text input (characters per minute), and the percentage of errors, the first parameter relates to the last line entered, the second - just a session. <br><br>  Basic lessons are still being formed, they will be expanded, and, I repeat, in the near future there will be an opportunity to print on your texts.  To the left of the choice of language and lesson there is a button for reloading the current lesson without resetting the statistics, this can be useful with broken text if it contains an unprintable character, or if you just do not want to print the currently selected line. <br><br>  Now there is no hint of a key being pressed on the keyboard, this function will appear soon, and a hint will not appear immediately, but in a second, which will save experienced users from unnecessary fading. <br><br>  The simulator works on jQuery, and, accordingly, supports browsers in which this JS framework works. <br><br>  About the "competitors" I know how web development (clavogonki, vse10.ru), and software (solo, verseq, stamina, ktouch, klavaro).  I made this simulator first of all for myself, and just the way I imagine it.  Moreover, it was not difficult. <br><br>  I hope that you will enjoy the simulator, and will benefit both beginners and those who want to improve print quality. <br><br>  I look forward to constructive criticism, and suggestions for additional features. <br><br>  upd. <br><br>  PS Thank you all for the feedback and suggestions, yesterday I did not know whether I would develop this simulator further, today I know that I will :) <br><br>  PPS I received an e-mail from Alexandr D. I was offered to do something similar to Klavarog, but aimed at learning foreign words.  Perhaps even within the framework of the keyboard simulator, there will be a function for memorizing words where the word is proposed, its variants in another language that need to be printed, and not just selected from the list, if the wrong version is typed, you will need to type the correct one several times as a fine and for better memorization. <br><br>  upd2. <br><br>  the version has been updated, the preservation of the selected keyboard and language has been added to the cookie, the color of the keyboard has been changed, it is possible to turn off the color, the starting positions for the fingers are highlighted, the layouts are added - Russian typing and Russian mac. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72081/</a></p>
