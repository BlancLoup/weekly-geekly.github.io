  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In defense of TurboFilma!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Honestly, having discovered changes on the TurboFilm website, I was expecting some interesting article and discussion on Habr√© regarding the monetization of the project.  About what decision the creators found to recoup their costs.  Instead, he found some <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_2_0/72932/">shameful</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_2_0/73379/">topics</a> , where everyone suddenly began to attack the creators of the site and turned their backs on the project, which they admired and enjoyed using during the past few months. <br><br><img src="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/2694/turbofilm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  No, I did not expect that everything will be perceived by the habrosobschestvom.  From my first acquaintance with TurboFilm, I didn‚Äôt doubt for a minute that its creators were obviously from our midst and probably long-time guests of Habr, just like you and me.  Why?  To get started, look at the design and functionality of the project.  On which side do not look, everywhere you feel reasonableness.  Immediately it seems that the project was done primarily ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù and ‚Äúfor our own people‚Äù.  Just to make it always convenient to brighten up the evening with friends or relatives.  All hotkeys \ double clicks \ volume control from the keyboard.  All this as it does not even cause doubts about what circle of people the creators of TurboFilma belong to.  Also, pay attention to the series of TV shows ... But can you doubt for a second that the guys are obviously from the IT environment!  And you damn pirates, pirates ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Suddenly everyone forgot how comfortable and pleasant it was to use this service.  It was great not to roam the torrent trackers in search of a fresh series, but just go to the site and click on the playlist.  I do not understand this attitude.  I, frankly, terribly sorry for the guys!  There are not many such thoughtful and sensible services in Runet.  You can count them almost on your fingers.  For myself, I have already concluded that this year TurboFilm has become for me one of the most interesting and useful projects. <br><br>  Do not want to pay, do not pay!  No one is forcing.  Look at the general server of the site or download the latest episodes via torrent.  But why do we need to throw mud at people who have done such a useful job and have invested their time and energy in doing something useful for you and me ?!  Is there really not a bit of respect for these guys in you for their work?  I think it was not so easy for them to take this step.  But it is also logical that the creators of the site want to go at least to self-sufficiency.  The content of the servers, the running of such amount of traffic and the time spent on all this time, in my opinion, is worth the small amount that they so shyly asked their visitors. <br><br>  I do not urge you to pay for this service.  The realization that you need to pay for the services must come to you from the inside.  Perhaps after creating your own projects, you will understand why all this hurt me so much.  But I consider it our duty to show minimal respect for the authors of the project, not to make them enemies of the people and criminals.  Why?  If only because all this was done initially for you and me ... Frequently Habrahabr and other IT and geek communities.  Show at least a bit of respect for the authors and do not put them on the same list with the pirates in the transition. <br><br>  PS I went to look for WebMoney wallet details.  Although this way I will thank them partially for their work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73458/</a></p>
