      If the news were brought to us, it would certainly be nice.  Unfortunately, life is a little more complicated: publishing only what the publication ‚Äúbrings‚Äù quickly falls behind competitors, who also find something themselves, lose their name, audience, and ultimately collapse. <br><br>  There are some quite working technicians who help to ensure their publication is claiming to cover business issues with ‚Äúmeat‚Äù - news for the sake of which they will go to you. <a name="habracut"></a>  I will talk about three of them: <br><br><h2>  Focus on what you write thing that no one has </h2><br>  This point is important for the reason that as soon as you start writing something that no one else has, and at the level of business analysis a little higher than ‚Äúsofa analytics‚Äù, you immediately receive as an audience employees of companies from that sphere about which you write. <br><br>  At the same time, ‚Äúsomething that no one has‚Äù is not necessarily some kind of superexclusive, obtained at the risk of life in a night ambush, when you watch Arkady Volozh and Mikhail Rogalsky at the exit from the restaurant after signing a contract <a href="http://roem.ru/2014/06/16/rogalsky_krasava101364/">to sell Auto.ru Yandex company</a> , not at all.  In fact, these may be simpler things that appear practically out of thin air, <i>as it seems to an outside observer.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Summary of several events</b> (Yandex bought several large media projects and the AdFox advertising network - there is a reason why this was done, you can write about it) </li><li>  <b>Verbalization of well-known, in plain sight of the facts</b> - "The king is naked!".  ‚ÄúAvito.ru launched a new advertising campaign on TV‚Äù, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äôs Traffic Generation sets records in September‚Äù.  You can ensure the value here by taking the comments of market participants: they are often interesting to other players. </li><li>  <b>Conversion threads from other areas</b> .  For example, the purely financial news <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2586088">"The Central Bank is struggling with cashing out across the country"</a> gives a signal to Internet companies that are cunning with taxes that they should be whitewashed, sooner or later they will force.  Taking into account the fact that the payroll of IT people occupies a significant share of expenses, the topic of taxes is always very painful </li></ul><br><br>  ‚ÄúSomething that no one else has‚Äù may be not only information that has never been published before, but also a glance at already known events from the side of the market participants you are writing about. <br><br><h2>  You must understand the business of "their" newsmakers. </h2><br>  Unfortunately, practically nothing from the above list you can not put into practice, if you do not understand what and how it works in real life. <br><br>  In this sense, it was easy for me: I am the founder of Royem LLC, which makes Roem.ru and its CEO.  As a rule, this situation is rare: the task of the editor is, like, only texts.  Of course, administrative duties take me a considerable amount of time, but it is thanks to them that I can more or less understand what is better, online accounting or 1C out of the box, what taxes are paid on employees and how the government‚Äôs attitude to taxation of business changes. <br><br>  It is clear that this way can be recommended not to everyone, but healthy curiosity, communicating with newsmakers not only on working issues, but also ‚Äúfor life‚Äù, is quite capable of forming a much more detailed picture of the world around the journalist.  Even if not personal communication, then at least reading interesting blogs, good publications and interesting commentators on them.  And the best is both <br><br>  It should be understood: you will always be where to strive for knowledge.  You are outside the business you are writing about, and not inside, you will <b>always</b> understand what is happening worse than an insider.  If it seems to you that you understand everything - you are mistaken.  Or in front of you a newsmaker about a project that should not be written.  This sometimes happens too. <br><br><h2>  Constant monitoring of the news background, ongoing events.  And for a </h2><br>  It is important for a journalist not only to write but also to read: to fill up a box of knowledge about the world around him.  Otherwise, he will not be able to be at the forefront of the information front. <br><br>  One of the best IT journalists in Russia, Pavel Kushelev, told me that he spends a day, purposefully, on reading the news, for a couple of hours.  It is not known when all this reading is useful to him and to what extent: maybe in a week, maybe in six months. <br><br>  From this there is one more conclusion: the cognitive abilities of the brain are important for the journalist, it is advisable to keep the read in mind in order to understand what to talk about with newsmakers.  Smoking and alcohol lead to a reduction in productive careers, not to mention short-term consequences. <br><br>  And the above-mentioned news about WMZ for 38 rubles and the message about the search for Nikolai Zayarny were born from a hike to the post office, where I noticed the agitation about selling WebMoney cards and reading Facebook, where I was not ashamed to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ilya.S.Novikov/posts/10202169450117520%3Fcomment_id%3D10202170292298574%26offset%3D0%26total_comments%3D7">tell lawyer Zayarny</a> that the topic was interesting to us . <br><br><hr><br><br>  Of course, all of the above is not a set of dogmas to be followed.  Moreover, their compliance does not guarantee success in the profession.  But I hope that you will understand the work of the media a little better and will make a little less mistakes when writing about someone and reading articles related to your professional subject area.  Do not shoot at journalists - they really work as they can. <br><br>  If there are any questions on the topic, I am ready to answer in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361873/</a></p>
