The Moscow monorail is included in the transport system and works with single tickets; switching from / to it using a single card is counted as a free transfer.

It moves not to say that it is somehow particularly silent or smooth.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the news is constantly being written about closing it or turning it exclusively into a tourist attraction.  Alas, in its current form, it can not compete with our usual transport. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  The exhibition "Russian Space" in the Multimedia Art Museum </h4><br><br>  <b>Admission</b> : 500 p. <br>  <b>Photographing</b> : Free. <br>  <b>General assessment</b> : To go only if you are not at all sorry for time and money, or you love contemporary art. <br><br>  In the lobby visitors are greeted by the descent module "Vostok-1", on which Gagarin made his flight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d14/7c0/eda/d147c0edaa6643c7867861413c19c4ec.jpg"><br><br>  The descent vehicle is permanently stored in the museum of NPO Energia, where it is a little more difficult to get into, and here it is set temporarily.  It is very curious that on the lower part of the descent vehicle, where the greatest thermal effect is when braking in dense layers of the atmosphere, the thermal protection is collected from the rings, and not installed in a continuous layer.  A similar design was on subsequent ships, for example, when speaking about the flight of the Voskhod-1, Feoktistov mentions these rings.  Only on later devices does the thermal protection look solid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9de/336/a2b/9de336a2bee24c5ab432e9dc2161b0fc.jpg"><br><br>  Fee for connection to the aggregate compartment (burns in the atmosphere) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38c/703/498/38c703498e3e478db1e56e43599b025f.jpg"><br><br>  The device "Vzor" to build a manual orientation of the ship on braking, view from the outside.  When properly oriented to the periphery of the round window, the horizon should be displayed, and in the center the ground should run from the bottom up.  Notice how the reflection of my hands with the phone is cut off - obviously, the device consisted of two optical parts in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc0/498/1df/dc04981df57d480d84a1b2119627b8c4.jpg"><br><br>  Parachute compartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61b/205/087/61b2050878b44b7da87388ae06fe64a8.jpg"><br><br>  It is assumed that after the hall visitors will climb to the top, seventh floor, and go down.  Do not do this.  Emotionally, the exhibition looks better if you go up through each floor on foot. <br><br>  <b>Second floor</b> <br>  The second floor is dedicated to Russian cosmists, both the beginning of the 20th century and the modern one.  There is a feeling that ‚ÄúVostok-1‚Äù at the entrance is a bait, because the general impression from the second floor is this: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/dr6bn%3Fmaxheight%3D315%26maxwidth%3D560&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvKatfah2et6dgwJX3Xq6Jkk4bzw" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe><br><br>  This is, for example, clearly modern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4f/32c/482/c4f32c4825a543ceae82b7a562986bed.jpg"><br><br>  And here are sketches of a certain ‚Äúcenter of cosmic energy‚Äù, the beginning of the 20th century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/223/969/15e/22396915e7ce472399bf058bab6de01f.jpg"><br><br>  General form.  On top of something designed to symbolize Tsiolkovsky's airship (the most famous project in cross section is round, not quadrangular, like this), on a separate stand, an auditory tube (stamp!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/739/c18/31b/739c1831bf9d4abb88d793b78b6ebb76.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Third floor</b> <br>  The third floor shows how, in the opinion of the Rodchenko school, the school of contemporary art should look.  Imitation of training classes with various equipment.  On the walls hang samples of creativity, which is created in such conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9f/1eb/04a/e9f1eb04a97846e586dc96ae39c1ec55.jpg"><br><br>  It symbolizes ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f1/87e/b16/3f187eb16e8f4d1d9f7e1a8af87ec561.jpg"><br><br>  The most terrible exhibit of the entire exhibition.  Without some annotation, the beginning and end of the film goes.  The girl jumps on the beds.  The girl in a wedding dress lies and listens to the story of an older woman.  Several ladies in age.  The old woman talks about the war. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19d/759/4e8/19d7594e8568457491baa2c8b2085301.jpg"><br><br>  The exhibit is heavy, depressive and absurd so much that I can not stand it and call my wife to return the feeling of the reality of the world.  The memory of the program ‚ÄúThe Magic Journey‚Äù from the Strugatskys ‚ÄúHabitable Island‚Äù spins in my head: <br><br><blockquote>  ... deaf stuffy rooms, endless corridors filled with furniture that suddenly sprouted in giant spikes;  spiral staircases, screwing off into the impenetrable darkness of narrow wells;  barred basements filled with stupidly swarming bodies, between which painfully immobile faces looked out, like in the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch - it was more like a crazy fantasy than real worlds </blockquote><br><br>  It's also absurd, but at least funny - make a cat a scout and a saboteur.  Exhibit with a link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMvOnfFoueHkT9eEr80S21Q">on which you can watch the</a> video that is played in the boxes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/1d6/436/45f1d6436b334e808927a57f67b7d4b7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Third floor</b> <br>  Exhibition Grand Tour Florence.  Nothing particularly interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da6/503/b77/da6503b7744347079afc1ed7acf2a673.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Fifth floor</b> <br>  Again school Rodchenko.  Some exhibits.  Depression is getting worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a6/caa/c07/0a6caac07e7743b5b63ac07f0692e8b4.jpg"><br><br>  The voice constantly repeats: "Moscow is bad."  Well, yes, with such exhibitions ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/d1c/274/453d1c27417b416c83287bd48dddb87e.jpg"><br><br>  Conceptual selfie sticks, in the background, sensors collect some information from the cabbage (rather, they pretend to collect, the same humanities did).  The shiny bag at the bottom right just "breathes."  Looking at all this, I am beginning to want a canon in art ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/10f/fb4/c5d10ffb4ec54de4b7616460191b7674.jpg"><br><br>  Students make remakes.  The school did not have enough exhibits? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e8/c50/fd5/1e8c50fd541e475796ee5baebeb7dfbd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sixth floor</b> <br>  The exhibition "Russian Space" begins again.  Mood further fall nowhere.  Two very conceptual buckets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e81/574/5f0/e815745f04f34b068de67f466b1e0bbb.jpg"><br><br>  In a dark room there is a looped film about a man wandering in the snow with flightless wings behind his back.  ‚ÄúMagic Journey‚Äù, yes, yes, yes ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/48b/dc7/e9048bdc74dd477990e0b6ea1d37e716.jpg"><br><br>  And here, against the background of all this trash, photographic plates of observatories appear.  Working days of astronomers of the past.  Like Maxim Kammerer's mentograms, with their realism they paint the room with romantic naturalism.  Seriously, I hardly see such a beautiful Andromeda nebula soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac7/433/dba/ac7433dba7db40518bd888842f562c03.jpg"><br><br>  The Orion Nebula, how beautiful you are after a sad Shiza! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/8c0/bea/1048c0bea9f442428c2840b654c86047.jpg"><br><br>  Photos were taken exclusively for work.  For example, many photos of Mars on one plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/1a6/5f3/bda1a65f3ad8499dbacefe46821a9bef.jpg"><br><br>  Modern art again.  In the monitor men fly and look sternly at you.  Nothing, after photos from astrographs you are no longer scary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/d6b/b27/423d6bb279da4c28999ee16e850753f8.jpg"><br><br>  But this is even cute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/958/94f/f6a/95894ff6a2754901af5eb2ae7af5b537.jpg"><br><br>  And this is just so cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/862/02c/ad586202ccc2492fbb440456c7101086.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Seventh floor</b> <br>  And here we are met by the rarest and coolest (after the "East-1") exhibit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/1fa/3c5/fb51fa3c527642618d56376642a7c12f.jpg"><br><br>  What do astronauts who fly to Mars do, and have not yet invented personal computers with the Internet?  You will not take a lot of books with you, news will go little and rarely.  How not to die of boredom?  Watch ‚ÄúIndicator‚Äù - a device that will show something new and interesting with its noise and moving lights, all the time.  This device was made by order of S.P.  The queen and little known.  Here he is at work. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1dZymLJwZw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjPI795qKDGqoH0tdixbNuadjslCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Figure S.P.  Queen, donated by N.M.  Vasilyeva, an employee of the experimental design bureau during her trip to the Baikonur cosmodrome.  An exhibit from the collection of the S.P.  Queen, here he is very relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e71/f9a/65f/e71f9a65fde7415db680460f7c520ccf.jpg"><br><br>  Another work of Galina Balashova, which is already familiar to you on the first day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6a/509/9a2/b6a5099a22214c41a4df448cdfa6d45f.jpg"><br><br>  Not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/832/ae9/2d4832ae911c4c7d844ff9a38865422b.jpg"><br><br>  A letter from Kondratyuk (the one who came up with the landing on the moon with a meeting in the lunar orbit, according to this scheme Apollo then flew) to Tsiolkovsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee0/5a0/7f4/ee05a07f4d2b4b5f9c74898f3a41dd6c.jpg"><br><br>  Already at the exit, I happen to meet a representative of the administration and ask about the meaning of the chthonic film from the third floor.  It turns out that this is just a symbol of the lack of communication between generations.  It is probably worth equipping such exhibits with plates with detailed explanations of what exactly the author wanted to say ... <br><br>  On the ground floor there is a watch company advertising exhibition in the corner.  After the abundance of modern art, simple and understandable mechanisms with cosmic history look very good.  In a vacuum or on the moon, astronauts needed, including watches, NASA turned to existing watch companies, and they, in turn, used the fact of collaboration in advertising. <br><br>  Curious photographs of vacuum and thermal tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/4ca/587/8fe4ca587cca4116a41d0c3c5a7bde15.jpg"><br><br>  It is unlikely that these watches were in space, but here the autographs of Stafford, Brand and Slayton are probably real. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/488/cdc/35f/488cdc35f420401c84378801c99506aa.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The second day of the festival "Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãClarity" </h4><br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AzjMyo7XDwU%3Ft%3D33m34s">33:35</a> <br>  Lecturer: Prokopyev Evgeny Valerievich, test engineer of RSC Energia. <br>  Theme: ‚ÄúSoyuz lifeboat‚Äù: device of a space suit ‚ÄúSokol- <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AzjMyo7XDwU%3Ft%3D2h29m22s">2:29:22</a> <br>  Lecturer: Irina Ogneva, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Associate Professor, <br>  Head of the Cell Biophysics Group, SSC RF-IMBP RAS. <br>  Theme: Weightlessness and Early Animal Development. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AzjMyo7XDwU%3Ft%3D3h45m45s">3:45:45</a> <br>  Lecturer: Phillip lozga Terekhov, a popularization blogger. <br>  Theme: "Heavenly mechanics without a single formula." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzjMyo7XDwU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-WWYfYUjTeB_YLHsIxoYU3hbJmA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396295/</a></p>
