  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Over the past year, about 10 Chinese software and hardware developers have entered the Russian market.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2014, about a dozen Chinese manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and software have entered the Russian market.  In addition to such large companies as <a href="http://www.huawei.com/ru">Huawei</a> and <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/ru">Lenovo</a> , smaller companies are also trying to occupy free niches. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In Russia, according to <a href="http://www.kartoteka.ru/">Kartoteka.ru</a> , in August 2014 LLC Inspur ru was registered.  This is the representative office of the Chinese manufacturer of telecommunications equipment <a href="http://ru.inspur.com/">Inspur</a> .  The company has entered into a contract for the supply of servers at FSUE Scientific Research Institute <a href="http://www.voskhod.ru/">"Voskhod"</a> for more than $ 200 million.  Voskhod is a government agency dedicated to automating the work of the authorities.  Further, Inspur's partners were the system integrators <a href="http://www.i-teco.ru/">I-Teco</a> , <a href="http://croc.ru/">Krok</a> and the distributors <a href="http://www.navicom.ru/">Navikom</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlion">Merlion</a> and <a href="http://www.marvel.ru/">Marvel Distribution</a> .  Inspur positions its products as a replacement for IBM servers.  According to Gartner, in the first quarter of 2015, Inspur was in fifth place in terms of server shipments worldwide, with a market share of 3.4%. <br><br>  Three months ago, the Taiwanese <a href="http://www.askey.com.tw/index.html">Askey Computer Corporation</a> entered the Russian market.  It is a subsidiary of Asus.  Askey Computer develops and manufactures telecommunications equipment: routers, gateways, set-top boxes.  At the end of 2014, Askey revenue amounted to 34.9 billion Taiwan dollars ($ 1.1 billion).

      ‚ÄúAmong those companies that are just entering our market, <a href="http://www.cyphy.net/">Cyphy</a> and its storage systems are of interest.  At the moment, this manufacturer does not have a large number of Russian partners, but I am confident that the company will still declare itself in our market, now its representatives are actively promoting their server platforms, ‚Äùsays Boris Bobrovnikov, Krok CEO.  As reported on the <a href="http://www.cyphy.net/ru">Russian-language</a> site Cyphy, its partner in Russia is <a href="http://stnt.ru/">Standartlekom,</a> a manufacturer of equipment for cable television and communication networks. <br><br>  In 2014, <a href="http://www.fiberhomegroup.com/">FiberHome Technologies</a> , a Chinese developer and manufacturer of fiber optic telecommunications equipment, had a representative office in Russia.  True, the cooperation began long before that.  The revenue of FiberHome at the end of 2013 was $ 3.5 billion, the company's staff - more than 20 thousand people. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Asian iron market has grown strongly in recent years in terms of technology: customers are already seriously considering the possibility of using it.  But until the confidence in the same Chinese brands has been formed, many stop the risks of loss of system performance, ‚Äùnotes Boris Bobrovnikov from Krok.  According to him, not much is known about the Asian software vendors in the Russian market.  ‚ÄúThere is even a feeling that the Chinese themselves are not particularly promoting it.  In addition, in our country there are no specialists working with Chinese software.  After all, Russian programmers themselves are highly competent, ‚Äùhe adds. <br><br>  One of the largest software developers in China is <a href="http://www.neusoft.com/">Neusoft</a> Corporation.  Its capitalization is almost $ 3.2 billion, revenue for 2014 - 1.1 billion.  Neusoft develops software in the field of enterprise management, provides IT and engineering services, and also develops and manufactures medical equipment.  In January 2015, Neusoft Medical System Rus LLC, the official representative of the Chinese corporation Neusoft in Russia, was registered in Kazan.  The CEO of Neusoft Medical Systems Rus, Gleb Anikiev, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2791908">told</a> Kommersant that the company had been supplying medical equipment to Russia through distributors for several years, but decided to open a representative office just now. <br><br>  For any new vendors, large customers are extremely cautious, always in such cases require testing or a pilot project, said Vice President of Sales for <a href="http://www.technoserv.com/">Technoserv</a> Andrei Bogomolov.  ‚ÄúThese are companies with a smaller scope of business that are well aware that the current situation gives a chance to move into the Russian market.  For them, this market is new, so they are looking for Russian partner companies, ‚Äùhe concluded. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293810/</a></p>
