  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The secret of educating smart children (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The second and no less interesting part of the article.  The impact of attitudes on work and personal life, recommendations for the upbringing of the "right" children, as well as my additions and the best comments to the first part <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/33920.html">on Habr√©</a> and <a href="http://payalnik.livejournal.com/614877.html">LJ</a> . <br><br>  <strong>In the fight against weaknesses</strong> <br>  Persuasion in the constancy of the intellect also reduces the desire of people to admit mistakes or to struggle and get rid of their shortcomings in school, at work and in personal relationships. <a name="habracut"></a>  A study published in 1999 examined 168 students who had just entered the University of Hong Kong, where instruction and study is conducted in English.  I and three of my colleagues found that students with a setting for improvement, who did not pass the entrance exam in English, were much more inclined to take a corrective English course than students with a permanent set-up who did not know the language well.  Students who understand intelligence as something immutable, obviously reluctantly recognized their shortcomings and therefore missed the opportunity to correct them. <br><br>  Constancy can similarly hamper communication and promotion in the workplace, forcing managers and employees to ignore or disapprove of advice and constructive criticism.  Research by psychologists Peter Esslin and Don Vandewall of the Southern Methodical University and Gary Lefem from the University of Toronto shows that managers with consistency are less likely to seek or approve feedback from their employees than managers with attitudes to improvement.  Presumably, managers with attitudes to perfection see themselves as ‚Äúunfinished‚Äù and understand that they need to receive feedback in order to become better, and bosses with persistence see in criticism the exposure of their lack of competence.  Considering that other people are also unable to change, such bosses rarely teach their subordinates.  But after Eslin, Vandewall and Lefem explained to managers the value and basics of the installation for improvement, they were more willing to teach their employees and give them advice.

      Attitudes can also affect the quality and duration of personal relationships, because they affect the willingness and unwillingness of people to cope with difficulties.  People who are set to consistency less often than they are set to perfection, reveal problems in their relationships and try to correct them.  This is evidenced by the results of a study conducted in 2006 by me, together with the psychologist Lara Kammrat, from Wilfrid Lourie University in Ontario.  After all, if you think that a person‚Äôs personality traits are more or less unchanged, the correction of relationships seems to be largely meaningless.  People who believe that people are changing and growing, on the contrary, are confident that resistance to relationship problems will lead to the resolution of these problems. <br><br>  <strong>How to praise</strong> <br>  How do we nurture a cultivation attitude in our children?  One way is to tell them about the achievements that have become the result of hard work.  For example, conversations about geniuses-mathematicians who were born with a particular mind-set develop a constancy setting in details, but the description of great mathematicians who have fallen in love with mathematics and who have achieved amazing results develops an attitude towards perfection.  People also educate attitudes through praise.  Although many, if not most, parents believe that they should develop the child, without ceasing to tell him how talented and intelligent he is, our research indicates that this strategy is wrong. <br><br>  Colombian psychologist Claudia Muller and I conducted a study in 1998 among several hundred fifth-graders, asking them questions from the non-verbal IQ test.  After the first 10 tasks that most children did well, we praised them.  We praised some for their abilities ‚ÄúWow ... this is a really cool result.  You think pretty well. "  We praised others for our efforts: ‚ÄúWow ... this is a really cool result.  You must have tried a lot! ‚Äù <br><br>  We found that the praises of the intellect caused the installation of constancy more often than the approving pat on the shoulder for the efforts made.  Those who were praised for quick thinking, for example, were afraid of a difficult task - they wanted it easier - much more often than those who were praised for their efforts.  (The majority of those who were rewarded for their work asked for difficult tasks, solving which they could learn in a new way).  When we gave everyone the challenges, the students who were praised for their intelligence were disheartened by doubting their capabilities.  And their assessments, even for simple tasks that they were given after complex ones, were weaker in comparison with their previous results of solving the same problems.  On the contrary, students praised for their zeal have not lost confidence in the face of complex issues, and their results in solving simple problems have noticeably improved after solving complex ones. <br><br>  <strong>Creating your own installation</strong> <br>  In addition to bringing up a cultivation setting through praise for hard work, parents and teachers can help children by clearly instructing them that the brain is a learning machine.  Blackwell, Tresnievsky, and I recently held a seminar for 91 students whose math grades were getting worse in their first year in high school.  48 students attended only classes on the subject, and the rest also attended classes, where they learned about the installation on perfection and its application to school classes. <br><br>  In the installation class, students read and discussed an article entitled ‚ÄúYou Can Grow Your Brain.‚Äù  They were taught that the brain is like a muscle that becomes stronger with frequent use, and that learning causes neurons of the brain to become overgrown with new connections.  After such instructions, many students began to see in themselves the trainers of their brain.  Hooligans and bored sat quietly and recorded.  One particularly violent boy looked up during the discussion and said: "Do you mean that I will not necessarily be stupid?" <br><br>  In the course of the semester, the math grades of children who studied only on the subject continued to deteriorate, and for those who went through the training for improvement, they began to return to their previous level.  Despite the fact that the teachers were not aware of the difference between the two groups, they reported noticeable changes in motivation in 27% of students attending extra classes, and only 9% of students in the control group.  One teacher wrote: ‚ÄúYour classes have already brought results.  L. [our exuberant boy], who never put in the effort and often did not pass the task on time, once went to bed late in order to complete the task ahead of time and give it to me for checking, so that I could check it and give me the opportunity to correct it.  He got 4+ (although he usually studied in triples and twos). ‚Äù <br><br>  Other researchers repeated our results.  Psychologists Katerina Good in Colombia and Joshua Aronson with Michael Inzlicht at the University of New York reported in 2003 that a setting for improvement helped improve grades in math and English for seventh-graders.  In a 2002 study, Aronson, Goode (then a student at the University of Texas at Austin) and their colleagues found that college students started to like school more, they valued it more and got better grades after completing the training that brings up the perfection. <br><br>  We put this course into an interactive program called Brainology, which will be widely available in mid-2008.  Its six modules tell students about the brain - what it does and how to make it work better.  In the virtual laboratory of the brain, users can click on areas of the brain, get a description of their functions, or on nerve endings, watching the formation of connections in the learning process.  Users can also recommend tasks to virtual students in order to learn how to cope with school difficulties;  In addition, users keep an online diary of educational practice.  [skipped paragraph about reviews aboutBrainology] <br><br>  Teaching children such knowledge is not only a trick to get them to learn.  People really differ in intelligence, talent and capabilities.  Yet research leads to the conclusion that great achievements, and even what we call genius, are usually the result of many years of passion and self-denied work, and not a natural consequence of the gift.  Mozart, Edison, Darwin and Cezanne were not only born talented;  they cultivated it with hard and long labor.  In the same way, hard work and discipline are much more helpful in learning than IQ. <br><br>  Such lessons apply to almost all human endeavors.  For example, many young sportsmen value talent for more hard work and because of this they become untrained.  Nor do people achieve much at work without constant praise and encouragement to maintain their motivation.  If we cultivate a commitment to improving at home and in schools, we will give our children the tools to achieve success in their goals and become them as the best workers and citizens. <br><br>  Ps.  Personally, I really liked this article, I, like many others, recognized Jonathan in myself, but I urge you to be wary of the notion of ‚Äúattitude to perfection‚Äù.  Raising this setup may well lead to excesses;  the child will not be happy in life.  In the end, the task of education is not to teach children how to earn twice as much money, but to teach them to realize their desires, their inner potential, and more often to get high on the realization of their ideas and desires - the strongest and most positive of our internal drugs. <br><br>  From comments: <br><br>  Joke on: <br>  The Russian mother scolds the naughty son: ‚ÄúVanya, are you a fool?  Why are you doing like this?" <br>  Jewish mother (the situation is the same): ‚ÄúOsya, you are a smart boy!  Why are you doing like this?" <br><br>  The main thing is not to force the child to try.  ‚ÄúI try‚Äù is a very destructive statement.  It can put a person in a ‚Äúdiligence‚Äù scenario.  Only usually this effort completes nothing.  Since in the scenario itself there is no final result (for example, ‚ÄúI will do it‚Äù), but only the process of achievement.  So you can try all my life) <br><br>  A lot of students face the difficulty of passing exams at the university, especially those who at school have given homework for no more than half an hour and have never read theory and have passed it in class on "4" and "5".  Enrolling in a higher education institution, but also often settling in a dormitory%.) These students initially understand the same school curriculum, do not try to learn something new ... and learn from the boredom in the world, which opened to them in freedom from parental control and in companies of many new friends. On exams for such students it can be very very bad ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúI believe that even genius can be overcome by hard work‚Äù ¬© one courageous man. <br><br>  like us, Jonathan, a lot, eh! <br><br>  I have several such periods right, at first everything works out, then you think that you are so smart from the beginning, and after that you stop to develop until you start to feel sick of yourself.  Inborn qualities give odds, but if you don‚Äôt move you will be overtaken. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18840/</a></p>
