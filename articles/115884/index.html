And yet there are specialties, where without our service absolutely nowhere.  One of them is journalism.  Today we are publishing an interview with Maria Molina, the news editor of Vokrugsveta.ru, the special correspondent of RBC magazine and the editor of Slingomamia.com. <br><br>  Maria is a very active user of Evernote and for sure her many-sided experience can be useful to many readers. <br><br><img title="Maria molina" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/MG_4366.jpg" width="150" height="225"><br>  <em><strong>Name:</strong> Maria Molina</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>Profession:</strong> Journalist</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/news/">Around the World</a></em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href="http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/news/">mashenke</a></em>

      <strong>- Tell us a little about yourself.</strong>  <strong>What do you do?</strong>  <strong>How is your working day?</strong>  <strong>What are the specifics of the workflow?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Russian philologist by profession, I work with words.  I earn money in journalism of various kinds, I have several unrelated projects and jobs.  In addition, I want to continue my scientific career in the future and do something with the materials of my thesis. <br><br>  My working day is very flexible, it can start at six in the evening, and maybe at eight in the morning.  It happens that he travels on a trip, sometimes at home, sometimes at conferences and similar events, and sometimes, of course, at a computer in one of the editions in which I work.  Therefore, there is not and cannot be a permanent machine on which my documents would be stored.  Sometimes this is a full-fledged workstation under Windows, sometimes an iPad, sometimes a terminal in an Internet cafe, sometimes a netbook with an unstable mobile connection. <br><br>  The most difficult thing for me was always to ensure that the latest version of working papers was at hand.  Considering the fact that there are a lot of projects, which means that there are several current versions that you may need at any time, it was incredibly difficult to keep things in order.  All the time there were intermediate files that had to be requested to send to the online box and compare with each other.  Some of the information was lost, some of it was not available on time.  Part of it was fundamentally tied to only one place of work, which limited my opportunities. <br><br>  <strong>- How and why did you start using the service?</strong>  <strong>What platforms do you use with Evernote?</strong> <br><br>  The first sign was the appearance of Google Docs.  For some time I kept some of the work there and gradually got used to throw out the most urgent information on the Internet, either as a document to Google, or as an attachment to a letter in the mail service.  But it was still uncomfortable.  It was always necessary to have good access to the network for work or to spend time downloading (and then uploading back).  Then, access to office programs was far from being everywhere or the software package was working too slowly.  The appearance of Evernote just turned my working life around. <br><br>  I found this service completely by accident.  Last fall, in the search for materials for an article about people who were in their profession in Russia, and then moved to work abroad, I learned about the existence of Stepan Pachikov (the founder of Evernote - editor's note) and became interested in his business.  Deciding to see what Evernote.com is, I created a trial account and uploaded some of my data there. <br><br>  The real discovery was the presence of applications for <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/get.php%3Ffile%3DWin">Windows</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/evernote/id281796108%3Fmt%3D8">iPad</a> .  Machines in one of my editions are surprisingly slow; standard office programs cannot be started there if you want to have time to work.  But I needed some kind of text editor.  At first I worked in a browser, and then I downloaded and installed the Evernote application on the workstation. <br><br>  It turned out to be very thoughtful, covering all my needs, including data classification (thanks to the tagging system, first and foremost).  And most importantly, the application synchronized with the server all the changes, and I could be sure that all the latest versions of working papers are available from anywhere. <br><br>  Having mastered the Windows application, I tried Windows Mobile, but this version, unfortunately, turned out to be non-working for me.  As a result, as a matter of fact, for the iPad application, I bought this tablet myself.  And never regretted.  Now all my bundles of papers are quickly accessible to me anywhere, but can be edited offline.  I am not tied to any place, I can instantly switch from a workstation to a tablet or a web browser in a mobile phone, work offline, from time to time connecting to the Internet for synchronization, or work online if there is good access to the Web. <br><br>  <strong>- What are the features Evernote like most?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  In the iPad version, I really like the style in which the application is executed, as well as the ability to turn on the microphone and make a voice note.  I use this as a voice recorder at press conferences and interviews.  True, the recording is not very clear, it is not suitable for work in the hall, but a directed voice from a short distance takes it completely.  I do not like that it is impossible to preserve the formatting of notes made under Windows.  But this does not prevent work - the application allows you to save a copy in a simple format.  It is also worth noting the ability to quickly and easily send a note in the mail. <br><br>  In a Windows application, I really like the visibility of a set of notebooks.  I can easily see what documents I have in my work, and I can switch from one text to another without special saving, by simple click.  Very convenient is also the function of sending by mail and printing text.  I also want to highlight the convenient feature "Simplify Formatting".  If it were still possible to simplify it to such an extent that the iOS platform would automatically accept the note, this button would not have a price.  What is sorely lacking is the function of counting the number of words vital for a journalist. <br><br>  I appreciated the ability to put photos, tables and other necessary files in the notes.  I believe that all those text-processing features that are not covered by Evernote (text editing, formatting tables and texts) can be implemented in office programs and are simply drawn to the note ‚Äî well, there are almost no such cases in my work. <br><br>  <strong>- How did the nature of working with the service change in the process of using Evernote?</strong>  <strong>Maybe some of the functions you started to use more actively?</strong>  <strong>Apply service in new areas of work?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  The most important thing for me is the availability of Evernote applications.  Working in a web browser is not very comfortable, but the applications are worth a lot.  If we talk about new areas of work, then I unexpectedly discovered that I can at the same time save data of checks in Evernote and keep records of my expenses, and also that it is very convenient for me to keep records from the library.  I have not tried it yet, but probably, with the help of tags and notebooks, I will be able to adjust the classification of my library of Old Russian words by creating something like a dictionary based on Evernote.  I would be grateful for advice on the organization of such a system for recording words, vocabulary values, vocabulary nests, which could accommodate my extracts from ancient Russian dictionaries. <br><br>  <strong>- Can you give any recommendations to users on the use of Evernote?</strong> <br><br>  First of all, I can give a recommendation to actively explore Evernote applications and their functions, as well as creatively approach the capabilities of this service.  The data classification system offered by Evernote may come in quite unexpected ways in many different areas. <br><br>  <strong>- Can you recall the case when Evernote was particularly useful and timely?</strong> <br><br>  Somehow at a press conference, shortly after I put an Evernote on an iPad, I happened to be without a familiar notepad and pencil, and also without a dictaphone.  The only thing left was to open the iPad and write there.  It was then that I saw that I could make a voice recording, save notes along the way, keep them fast enough to cover the speed of discussion during a press conference - and that it is very convenient and does not require any extra equipment.  It is noteworthy that at the press conference it was a question of using cloud computing and placing data in the clouds. <br><br>  <strong>- What would you like to see in Evernote in the future?</strong> <br><ul><li>  Stability of data synchronization (sometimes they can crash when it crashes on iPad or in Windows). </li><li>  The ability to count the number of words. </li><li>  The ability to see the original formatting of data on different platforms. </li><li>  A better voice memo recording (if it depends on Evernote in any way), that is, the ‚Äúvoice recorder‚Äù function. </li><li>  A more stable iPad application (it can fly if the tablet goes into stand-by mode or if the connection to the network is unstable). </li><li>  The Evernote interface for working through the web interface has practically no beautiful features and is poorly designed.  If it looked like an application, it would be much more pleasant to work. <em><em>[Here Maria just guesses our plans, a completely redesigned web client interface will soon be released.</em></em>  <em><em>- approx.</em></em>  <em><em>edition]</em></em> . </li><li> I really want a working application for Windows Mobile (but, as I understand it, there is no hope for it).  Or at least a special compact mode for mobile network connectivity (maybe it is, but I still don‚Äôt know about it?) <em><a href="http://www.evernote.com/m/">Evernote client</a> .</em>  <em>Also, active work is underway on the version for Windows Phone 7 - approx.</em>  <em>edition]</em> . </li><li>  It would not hurt the ability to send notes to Facebook. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115884/</a></p>
