  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Casio Protrek PRG-240-1ER watch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Peace to your homes and your families, dear community.</b> <br><br>  About 2 years ago, my wife gave me a Casio watch for my birthday.  Their peculiarity and attractiveness for me was that they had two solar batteries - small segmented panels above and below the screen.  I love unusual things.  But the trouble is: after a year and a half, I damaged the ear in them, behind which a stainless steel strap is attached.  In general, I was left without a watch.  About a year went without them, but the rhythm of life still requires you to watch time not on a mobile phone, but also to have easy access and always with you something more than just a watch.  Therefore, while on vacation in Sevastopol, I took great interest in the watch shop that was a step away from the port and eventually became the owner of three hours: two wrist watches (myself and my son) and one wall clock with huge numbers.  I want to tell you about one of them.  By the way, I note that I have no keen love for the Casio brand.  Quite the contrary.  She already become boring, chtoli.  But Gamin was not represented in this store, and I will consider Tissot, Q &amp; Q, Orient when buying a fashionable suit for myself.  As a result, I looked at the shop windows for several days in a row and searched for strict, beautiful and functional watches. I didn‚Äôt stop at Casio‚Äôs watch with some initial regret.  And it is on the bulky protected versions.  Then regret vanished, but it later.  I chose one watch in which everything was the same, except for a compass and a more decent appearance.  Then the next day I went and changed it to these, more than 2 times more expensive.  The soul could not stand the simple solutions. <br><br>  <b>So, I won the Protrek Casio watch.</b>  <b>What did I get?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The watches themselves are quite large.  But I'm not small.  Therefore, everything is harmonious.  They sit well on the hand, but it is felt that the plastic of the strap should still ‚Äúget used‚Äù to cover exactly my hand.  The design of the watch is strict, pleasant, with bright elements like a pair of keys and some significant inscriptions.  What is very good is the usefulness of every detail, every point on the screen and a very harmonious balance of all this together.  They seem to annoy me with good solutions, but at the same time they either have the floor of the screen covered with some kind of fake plastics, or some useless pontovy mugs and squares are spinning and flashing / running around the screen, or it all looks like hello from childhood.

The numbers are not high and not wide.  Not small.  Read quickly.  Everything in its place.  Already to the delight :).  The graph at the top left displays a barometer graph with a fixing period of 2 hours.  The last measurement made flashes like a cursor.  Dynamics that is called on the face.  There is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: if you descend or rise, say, to a tall building, keep in mind that atmospheric pressure rises and rises with you, so the readings will shift to the height at which you are at the time of measurement.  Top right shows the current date.  Bottom right - seconds of current time.  At the bottom left - mnemonic designations of enabled modes.  In the event that the clock goes into sleep mode (it can be turned off), on the screen in this place only 2 PS letters are displayed. <br>  The solar cell is a round ring on which Casio is inscribed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19c/036/36c/19c03636cb69a21ae05561cfb20e388e.jpg"><br><br>  Here are the barometer readings.  I am now on the eighth floor of a residential building and we have cloudy weather outside.  Everything corresponds to reality.  It must be admitted that since I hadn‚Äôt had anything to do with the barometer before, I have to study what kind of thing it is and how its readings depend on my height and the ambient temperature.  Slowly getting used to.  Here, in fact, there is nothing unclear or some sacred knowledge. <br>  Top right - the temperature from the built-in thermometer.  It should be understood that being on the hand watch is not able to correctly give you the ambient temperature, because it affects the body heat.  But if they are 15 minutes off the hand.  At the bottom of the screen - the current time.  The graph is also relevant, it is two hours long, but only the ‚Äúcursor‚Äù does not flash and the measurements of the barometer are fixed in digits every 5 seconds.  After 20 minutes, he will take measurements every 2 minutes.  I chose in the settings. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb6/82f/168/fb682f168db12967c754b9c5e70c413e.jpg"><br><br>  Altimeter.  He barometric hours.  This means that while you were rising or falling, the ‚Äúfloating‚Äù atmospheric pressure will affect the readings.  But not scary.  Accuracy here is quite conditional.  You can press the left yellow button at the entrance or at the foot of the mountain and the clock will remember the base value.  The increase / decrease in height and the graph of its change over time you will see at the top of the screen.  Below - all the same current time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ef/04e/4a3/1ef04e4a3249d13cb5cec3d95cd2003e.jpg"><br><br>  The launch of the compass is accompanied by illumination.  Apparently, Casio‚Äôs engineers dug heavily with it when developing, asking programmers to make it beautiful.  4 filling beams run across the screen and only after that the actual determination of the cardinal directions is triggered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f12/0d2/cf8/f120d2cf84253ca808782389b3f22033.jpg"><br><br>  The readings are displayed for only 20 seconds, after which the compass turns off and the readings become dashes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/79d/508/d94/79d508d94ed6e82fbf1ae96f47f81213.jpg"><br><br>  I can only guess why it is so done.  Perhaps the work of the compass is associated with a strong power consumption. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b2/9fa/50d/2b29fa50d041e882d34d2c0a38491252.jpg"><br><br><br>  If the settings ‚Äúforget‚Äù the latitude and longitude of your location, you can enjoy a properly working function of determining the sunrise and sunset.  As for me, the function is of little use, but surely someone very necessary.  In the middle of the clock is the time of sunrise, at the bottom of sunset  The date on which you look at the time of the working day of the sun can be selected with buttons.  Default is today. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/439/23e/de7/43923ede76c25c365dc3be1c8fe339b4.jpg"><br><br>  The clock collects statistics on the maximum and minimum altitudes, as well as the elevation differences that they were able to record.  There are 2 such counters. This allows you to remember the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the entire path with one counter and use the other for specific short segments.  The value of the second maximum height counter is displayed here.  The train journey from Simferopol to Minsk.  I did not even notice when we climbed so high.  At night, chtoli ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aad/849/a35/aad849a35003e990fc474b1ffd9729a9.jpg"><br><br>  World time.  You can look at specific belts.  Down there is still your local time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41a/b30/68b/41ab3068bb7b9fc7131db385a625ca71.jpg"><br><br>  Stopwatch, timer - everything is like everyone else, only steeper.  This is my cool watch! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/631/9ea/88e/6319ea88e726c0d85d4afd91bbadfd81.jpg"><br><br>  Alarm clocks: 5 pieces <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c9/33c/556/6c933c55664062679ada4030535f5564.jpg"><br><br>  Views from the sides <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/888/5f4/9de/8885f49de4dff582c277f72d0f83eb59.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e68/5a0/e83/e685a0e834aa020a9ce5c92ec461f32d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/280/9d5/cb5/2809d5cb56ca6405c4e440f3d48ea6e2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/694/96d/69f/69496d69f9bf96bbaf13ce6bf71f8f7e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4aa/98a/27d/4aa98a27d6bbcd1b35ebd1e349256a6d.jpg"><br><br>  Well and a container in which all this is delivered.  A box of high-quality cardboard, inside a thick manual and a beautiful wooden box.  And in a wooden box, in a nice antistatic bag, on a roll of foam rubber - a clock. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b2/32e/662/3b232e6626c91302757506791c7ed6ab.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/b9b/910/821b9b91048e400f5a4a69e8f4b9ea05.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike my first choice, I am very pleased with this watch.  I do not regret that I paid more than the first ones were worth (it‚Äôs not about the wife‚Äôs gifts).  These watches do not seem childish, durable, a kind of "SUV" in the world of watches.  And I love SUVs. <br>  What else would you like to see in them?  Well, a GPS receiver with at least a minimal set of functions: determine the position, memorize it, and return to it.  But I think it will be my next.  Otherwise, everything is just fine! <br>  In less than two weeks after the purchase, I bathed with them many times in the sea, washed in the shower, measured the temperature of the water in the bathroom - everything is just fine. <br>  The instruction does not recommend pushing buttons in the water.  I understand them and do not do that. <br><br>  PS I apologize for the not very clean strap.  It seems to try, washed and wiped them before shooting. <br><br>  PPS By the way, I missed the review: in this watch you can enter a software correction for everything.  Including compass. <br><br>  ********************************************* <br>  At the request of the spread pictures on his hand <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c7/b9d/3e9/4c7b9d3e9d1fdcab1431b31f5d963984.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/502/8d0/408/5028d04081c9b647a0e6daf05a7b959f.jpg"><br><br>  ********************************************* <br>  An example of a sharp drop in pressure and, accordingly, a sharp change in the weather.  It rains all day and a strong wind blows.  Outside the window 13.7-15.2 ¬∞ C. <br>  The bar on the right of the figures shows the current pressure deviation from the previous planned measurement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a7b/ab5/9c4/a7bab59c47c0e48c86157ea3017b2ac8.jpg"><br><br>  In this case, the watch is washed after working with a professional punch.  I did not notice how from under the drill straight on them flew concrete. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149433/</a></p>
