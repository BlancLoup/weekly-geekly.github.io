What happens during this period and what elements does it consist of?  Today we will touch upon this stage, which precedes the first steps to build your own project.  We will analyze in detail the ‚Äúfundamentals of the basics‚Äù and show how to apply and what to do with it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/d11/7bc/9fed117bc0c74f268a261aa95fc7c2bf.png" alt="Whereparking"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We try to separate start-ups from the creation of a classic business, although with all the differences, they have a common essence: this is an independent activity at your own risk and risk in order to achieve a certain success.  Many people are used to using the phrase ‚Äúfree floating‚Äù instead of a similar wording, because, like the captain of the galleon in the 16th century: we do the work ourselves, we manage it ourselves, we bear all the responsibility and risk.

      At the same time, it should be understood that the first steps to implement your startup - oddly enough, is not the very beginning of the process.  They are already the result of our thoughts and internal changes.  In turn, the peculiarity of such reflections is that, in contrast to a typical situation, when ideas are only ideas, in this case they have led to concrete actions.  Therefore, analyzing directly my experience of creating a project from scratch, in this article I will pay attention to the ‚Äúbeginning of beginnings‚Äù, and to be specific, I will try to answer the question: what causes us to start doing our startup? <br><br>  In my opinion, this is a whole small ‚Äúleading to action‚Äù system, which consists of the following elements: <br><br><br>  In order for my hypotheses to be objective, they must be tested on real cases.  But when I first voiced my thoughts on this topic, in response, I heard ‚Äúwait a minute, but I know a man who started his business only at 40, 20 of whom he worked for someone else‚Äôs uncle;  someone, on the contrary, almost from school, could call himself a real entrepreneur.  At the same time, one of the ghost examples in general received the position through an acquaintance, and perhaps such a person should generally be placed in a separate category. <br><br>  Moreover, after all, sometimes unnoticeable factors also play their part: watching a film-autobiography, advice from friends, attending special courses.  Also, should financial status and education be taken into account?  How does all this generalize? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fc/aa8/2c7/1fcaa82c793e4af98575a427d895036a.png" height="450" width="620" alt="Whereparking"></div><br><br>  In fact, all of the above is a consequence of certain actions or circumstances that can be broken down into common elements.  At the same time, our "case" is not a specific status and position of a person (after all, this is the final result), but precisely those prerequisites that initially led to concrete actions to create their own project.  The peculiarity of these actions is that: <br><br><ul><li>  The man decided to do something new for himself; </li><li>  I decided to do it all the time; </li><li>  With a specific goal; </li><li>  But at the same time, to be honest, I could well manage without all of this and just live like most of the people around him; </li></ul><br><br>  But after all, a similar description of ‚Äúactions‚Äù may fit not only the first steps in creating a business, but also some kind of exercises in the morning or that a person began to throw cigarette butts not where he was, but only in the ballot boxes.  No matter how funny the comparison of the creation of a startup with the cultural ejection of "bulls" looks like, these actions have common prerequisites that are logically written using the above system.  How? <br><br>  So, the meat part time.  Basic components consist of three elements: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/932/6c5/690/9326c56900764c28a732236253101da8.png" height="250" width="800" alt="Whereparking"></div><br><br>  <b>1. Internal need</b> <br><br>  Perhaps this is the most obvious and understandable element, but you should not treat it as something that you have already heard a hundred times.  Usually, when they begin to explain it, they give examples of successful people, for example, from Eastern countries who have succeeded, being initially poor.  But nevertheless, they managed to start something at an early age to change their lives.  That is, their desire, their inner need to achieve something was the main source of motivation, which was expressed at the beginning of active actions to create their own business. <br><br>  You ask, and to me, so what?  Well, some Hindu has achieved success, let's rejoice for him and like the translation of his biography.  <b>How does the reader of this note apply this element to himself?</b> <br><br>  If other people have an internal need may be a sufficient factor to begin to act actively, you should carefully examine yourself.  If, now, sitting in the office and occasionally dreaming about your own business, you, nevertheless, have not begun to actively engage in them, this means that your inner need for you, unlike the above examples of people, is not enough at the moment and follows: <br><br>  <b>A)</b> Strengthen the internal need.  People base their startup for a variety of reasons.  For some, this desire to get rich, for others - to achieve recognition and respect, for others - to give the world something of their own.  It can be as one of the listed factors, and maybe the whole set.  You need to understand why you own a business and, having determined it, how to develop and focus more strongly on this component. <br><br>  <b>B)</b> Internal need - an important, but not the only element.  Perhaps, if you can‚Äôt motivate yourself properly, you should try using other elements from the basic components. <br><br>  <b>2. Wednesday (Environment)</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddb/63a/083/ddb63a0830494451bb9b73466c43e8db.png" height="350" width="800" alt="Whereparking"></div><br><br>  I think we all remember that man is a social being.  This is usually expressed in the need to communicate with both familiar people and openness to new acquaintances.  But if we consider the environment of a person as an element that influences him, then remember the proverb "who you will lead from, and you will gather."  It is not as negative as it seems at first glance.  It only means that your environment and your communication environment have a direct impact on you and changes you in the direction in which your environment is located (consider the value system).  And even if it seems to you that the environment does not affect you, it only means that you either imperceptibly make certain efforts to disengage from it, or mislead yourself. <br><br>  Long before work began on Parking, I very clearly felt how my peers influenced me when, after studying at school (where I was a typical good), I entered the first year of university.  There were guys in my group who, despite the fact that they were quite funny and interesting people, could safely go about their business and at the same time have very high academic performance.  In order to join the team and take their place in it, it became important for me at the subconscious level to be at least as good as the others.  As a result, after 10 years of studying as a ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù, for the first time in my life I became an excellent student. <br><br>  I do not think that I am an exception.  I am sure that you also felt the influence of the people around you on yourself.  <b>How to apply it for yourself?</b> <br><br>  You need to be and be surrounded by people who are eager to create something new or are determined to do something for themselves.  You can start with the simplest - blogs of famous entrepreneurs, because they love and appreciate what they do.  Here it is worth adding meetings and events dedicated to entrepreneurial activity.  However, remember that the goal is not to hang out in coworking with interesting people, but to recharge your batteries and start doing your own thing. <br><br>  <b>3. External circumstances</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/08a/fae/eb708afae1b641a9ad847503d9ffa664.png" height="390" width="600" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In contrast to the first two categories, which rather help independent decision-making, external circumstances are factors that put pressure and force something to do.  An example is a dismissal from work, when a person loses a stable source of income and, no longer having the ability to maintain his lifestyle in the usual way, is forced to start doing something new.  After all, if he does not do this, troubles will not pass. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the example of dismissal is an unexpected thing, external circumstances can be predicted and used at your own choice.  As far as I can see, this element quite effectively began to use various courses, both related to entrepreneurship, and very third-party from it.  By imposing strict conditions and requirements for the fulfillment of tasks, they force a person to act.  Thus, in their person they create an additional source of motivation, forcing you to jerk in the right direction. <br><br>  A pretty good example from a slightly different area is the fitness trainer.  For most people, its effectiveness is not in the fact that it has some kind of secret knowledge, but in the fact that it simply forces you to do what is necessary. <br><br>  <b>How to apply this element to yourself?</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, with him you need to be as careful as possible.  Yes, dismissal from work will force any person to do something, because money tends to run out.  But in case of failure, what will be its price?  I do not presume to recommend something specific, it is better to be honest with yourself and choose the option that suits you best. <br><br>  Even such a simple thing, like what you tell your close people about your plans, will already be an additional source of motivation for action.  After all, the reputation of a person who only scratches the tongue no one likes, which means you need to do what was said. <br><br>  Summarizing the above, any of the elements of the triad of "basic components" is sufficient to become the basis for your first actions to create your startup.  If they are not strong enough yet, understanding how they work, they can be fully strengthened.  They are called ‚Äúbasic‚Äù not by chance, because sometimes you can hear such excuses as ‚Äúno money, no connections, no rich dad, there are some gangsters in the country ...‚Äù and many others.  Is it really?  As practice shows, these problems are either contrived, or solved in the process of working on a project.  But, in any case, the role of such things is only auxiliary and secondary to the basic components; they are not capable of replacing them.  By purposefulness and diligence very often money comes, but in the reverse order the situation occurs much less frequently. <br><br>  In the second part of the article we will examine ‚Äúcatalysts‚Äù (accelerating factors) and the scope of all elements.  But before publishing it, I would like to know if you are interested in such material? <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292282/</a></p>
