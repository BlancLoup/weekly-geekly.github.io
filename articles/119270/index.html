After cleaning, he asked to connect to iTunes.  After connecting iTunes said: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/90eb233e/58565cae/cd334ef9/077d652d.png"><br><br>  After 2-3 attempts with the same result, including attempts to connect to another computer, I was really scared - after all, the device worked 100% before cleaning. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Googling showed that this problem began approximately yesterday (May 13, 2011 3:47 PM), in any case, the first message to the Apple Support Communities <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3055805%3Fstart%3D0%26tstart%3D0">forum</a> - <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3055805%3Fstart%3D0%26tstart%3D0">link to the forum</a> .

      At the moment there are 8 pages of discussion, from which we can conclude: <br>  1. The problem is not only with the iPad, but also with other devices (eg iPod). <br>  2. Does not depend on the region - USA, Australia, Europe, Russia, Japan, Chile ... <br>  3. Does not depend on the OS of the company - tried iTunes on Windwos 7, Apple MacBook Pro (even someone from Linux tried to do something). <br>  4. Presumably the problem is with the Apple activation servers. <br><br>  In addition, those who called into the support of Apple told that they were told that their device is most likely broken and can be replaced with something else for free. <br><br>  Well, or as an option, they want to be paid $ 29 for an ‚Äúincident‚Äù (per incident) or $ 79 a support subscription (ongoing support). <br><br>  The devices, of course, are not jailbroken.  iOS 4.3.3 (the latest at the moment). <br><br>  Personally, I tried to completely flashing through the DFU-mode.  When I completely lost hope, I started trying all sorts of RecBoot and TinyUmbrella-in FixRecovery without any result. <br><br>  In general, if you are thinking of updating your device or cutting through the settings, I advise you not to risk it, because there is a real chance to get an ‚ÄúiBrick‚Äù as long as there are no options to remove it from such a mode (except perhaps a jailbreak, although I don‚Äôt know if this is possible without SHSH and working device) <br><img src="http://earth911.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/single-brick.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So, as before me there is such a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù, I will actively monitor this issue and publish an update in this topic as soon as something is clear. <br><br>  <b>Update (0:30 MSK)</b> Apple activation servers began to rise around the world.  At the moment, almost all countries confirm the successful activation of devices - starting at 20:00 in the US and then Europe, Asia, etc.  At the moment I have successfully activated my iPad (iOS 4.3.3) <br><br>  <b>So if someone waited, you can update!</b>  The servers are now working at least for me and for somewhere around hundreds of people who unsubscribed on the Apple Support Community forum.  As a result, I have a dead night of googling, installing various firmware, jailbreaks and terrible curses against Apple. <br><br>  Some questions were not answered: <br>  1. Why did Apple write that there was a problem with the devices?  Even when they called for support they advised to change the cables, to overload the computer and even to come to the store on Monday to exchange for another device. <br>  2. Why for about 30 hours there was no action and no comments <br>  3. And ... damn it, what the hell was that?  Do not break their server as it was with Sony? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119270/</a></p>
