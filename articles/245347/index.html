As a result of automating the accounting of incoming applications, as well as the work performed on them and processing parameters, it becomes possible to analyze, plan, monitor and evaluate the activities of the IT department and IT employees on the basis of the actual indicators of their work and create an appropriate motivation scheme.  In this article we want to discuss one of the problems that often arise when building such a motivation scheme in IT departments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that even ‚Äúboxed‚Äù versions of the Service Desk systems can already generate information that can be easily and quickly used as indicators of the quality of work of IT employees.  For example, the number of processed applications, the timeliness of their execution, etc.  These data are taken in most cases by IT managers as the basis for building a system for assessing the quality of the work of their specialists and the corresponding system of motivation.  However, the use of such indicators without additional processing and preparation as a tool for evaluation and motivation may not always be useful.  Why?  We show by example. <br><br>  So, the raw data.  There is an IT department consisting of several departments and providing IT services to users of their company.  It operates an automated system for recording customer requests from the Service Desk, processing applications, and the results of this activity are monitored by the parameters of quantity and deadlines.

      The motivational scheme for IT staff is based on bonuses, which make up a significant part of the total remuneration.  To calculate bonuses, the number of timely completed applications is multiplied by the complexity factor, the value of which, in turn, is a subjective assessment of the head of the department. <br><br>  From the point of view of employees, such a system of motivation is unfair, since the total bill includes applications that, by themselves, even in the framework of one provided IT service, require different labor costs.  For example, preparation of workplaces for employees is related to the processing of so-called ‚Äúlong‚Äù applications, while eliminating errors in the work of standard applications, applications can be both ‚Äúlong‚Äù and ‚Äúshort‚Äù, but the issues of providing access and advice on the work of standard applications are almost always solved quickly.  In the current automation system, such applications are not typed by the type of work performed.  Calculate the coefficient of their complexity is possible only through a rough estimate of the head of the department, which, in addition to the shortcomings of ‚Äúsubjectivity‚Äù, also carries the possible inaccuracy of information processing for each application in a fairly large array of all completed within a month. <br><br>  Such a system is also inconvenient for a manager.  Besides the fact that every month you have to spend a lot of time analyzing data on all closed requests, there is also a basis for conflict situations both in relations with subordinates and between the employees themselves, eager and not so much.  In addition, the top management demands improvement of the unit performance indicators.  And they (indicators) in such a situation are clearly reduced: someone, picking up a large number of applications, does not have time to process them in a timely manner, "long" applications often sag. <br><br><h4>  <b>Problem</b> </h4><br>  The performance indicators used and the motivational scheme built on their basis do not suit either the head of the IT department or his staff. <br><br><h4>  <b>Decision</b> </h4><br>  We consider one of the most successful solutions to be implemented by us in a project to develop a system for the professional development of IT departments in a large energy company. <br><br>  Based on the analysis of the current activities of the IT department, we proposed to group the employees in the IT departments by the type of work they do.  For example, an administrators group, an IT services user support group, a VIP users support group, a user workspace management group, etc.  Each employee was a member of only one functional group, although he could be in several support groups for IT services.  For each such group, the respective areas of responsibility were assigned, including the processing of application types, developed their own indicators that characterize the quality of work of its participants and take into account the specifics of the work performed by them. <br><br>  Next, we developed a methodology for calculating indicators, a technique for using them in a motivational scheme and a matrix of competencies that provides the necessary level of quality.  Taking the principle of objectivity and measurability of all indicators as a basis, we tinker a lot, figuring out how to ensure the possibility of obtaining them through the Customer‚Äôs Service Desk.  Something managed to take from the current system of accounting applications.  But to build a reliable picture, of course, it took the system to be refined, including additional categorization of the processed applications. <br><br>  The motivational scheme was now based on objective indicators for each functional group.  Bonuses were divided into two parts: one - for the high-quality performance of work in their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, the other - for additional activities in other areas and in the development projects of the division.  When calculating each of the parts, we used our own work quality indicators.  In order to ensure the flexibility of the motivation system, the coefficients of influence of both parts of the award were also taken into account, allowing them to comply with the target areas of the IT department development in future periods. <br><br>  The competency matrix was based on performance indicators and included the necessary and sufficient set of knowledge and skills that team members must have in order to provide the required level of IT services. <br><br><h4>  <b>Result</b> </h4><br>  The following tasks were solved: <br>  - the head was provided with a thin (‚Äúground‚Äù) tool for managing employee performance by: <br>  ‚Ä¢ building a motivational scheme that takes into account the specifics of different types of work; <br>  ‚Ä¢ formation of knowledge about the competencies necessary to perform these works with the required level of quality; <br>  - the process of distribution of applications has been optimized: certain areas of responsibility are assigned to group employees, which should lead to an increase in the level of work of the IT department; <br>  - Employees received a transparent system for assessing the quality of their work, an objective system for calculating bonuses, knowledge of the required set of their competencies and targets for further professional growth. <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  As the saying goes, if you want to do a good job, first grind the tools. <br><br>  The described solution confirms once again: for effective management, it is important to consider an approach to building control and motivation systems.  Regarding the activities of IT departments, it can also be said with confidence: with a competent approach, the capabilities of the Service Desk class system are sufficient for effective organization of employee quality management. <br><br>  Dear readers, we are also interested to learn about your experience in solving such problems and discuss similar problems that have not yet been resolved in your organization.  Perhaps together we will manage to find a way out of the situation.  ÔÅä </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245347/</a></p>
