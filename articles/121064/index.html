    <h5>  Alexey, in what market does your project work? </h5><br>  Market video and video advertising.  The video is developing on the Internet at a tremendous pace.  Now for the month on Youtube and Facebook more videos are being uploaded than shown on the TV channels ABC, NBC and CBS in the entire history of their existence. <br><br>  The video is getting bigger, but there is no effective way to monetize it.  In fact, the video on Youtube is no different from the arrival of the train on a white sheet shown by the Lumiere Brothers - the same sheet, only digital.  We create tools to turn an ordinary video into an interactive one!  What became of the text when it turned into hypertext.  The user no longer needs to just watch the video, it can influence the development of the plot.  Buy items from a video in one click, get new information about objects. <br><br>  <b>And, of course, a new type of advertising!</b>  Convenient and non-interfering, no annoying prerolls and pop-up windows are needed.  The user clicks on the object and see it if he is interested or even buy.  The advertising model is the most effective way to monetize projects on the Internet.  Large sites are interested in new technologies that will allow them to manage advertising, create new formats, expand the range of services for the advertiser.  On the other hand, advertisers are interested in increasing the effectiveness of their advertising costs. <br><br><h5>  How quickly can a project like this attract investment? </h5><br>  Quickly enough, if the solution is claimed and is at the stage: implemented.  We received investments after the investment session on StartupPoint.  Vitaly Akimov and his team do a great job.  Thanks to them.  I will try to be on the <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/event/32679">27th Point in Moscow</a> , June 23rd. <br><br><h5>  When it comes to technology, what innovation has the Actio.tv advertising market offered? </h5><br>  Ability to create rich media solutions using video.  Rich media is essentially interactive banners or other media.  Using Actio technology, an advertiser can insert interaction with any objects into video clips, embed a chat with a consultant, a form for recording for a test drive, links to Facebook and Twitter companies, put a product in a basket or participate in a survey, etc. And do all this ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù without much effort and special knowledge, then upload the resulting content to the Azure cloud and show where it needs it, Rutube, Facebook or your own website or blog. <br><br>  That is why Actio.tv is so interesting for both investors and players in the advertising market.  Our technology will improve the efficiency of dying banners and monetize video content.  The project solves a pressing problem - people get used to advertising and start reacting worse to it. <br><br>  Moreover, we have implemented a statistics system that collects information about the actions of the audience in the hyper-video clip, that is, you can find out not only the number of views, but also the degree of audience involvement in advertising.  The advertiser likes to count! <br><br><h5>  Well, that‚Äôs already done :) And what niches in the advertising market are still empty in Russia? </h5><br><br>  There are a lot of ideas and opportunities.  Allow the advertiser to measure the effectiveness of advertising.  Develop new channels: we don‚Äôt have Admob yet.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121064/</a></p>
