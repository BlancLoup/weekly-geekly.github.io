Therefore, of course, every day I come across video hosting sites now, and not disks.  Below I set out my observations as the user of both services.  All these observations are very subjective, do not pretend to any analytics, but simply are a review of the user who used both themes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Yes, everyone was happy with Ex.yu until the default happened - a famous story.  Against this background, the video hosting of F.S.  First of all, everyone found out that he just is.  And secondly, they discovered that at some points it is much more convenient:

      1. HD-quality is played without problems. <br>  2. You can choose audio tracks, and there are titles, it seems. <br>  3. A more logical system of comments and directories. <br><br>  Disclaimer: I am not a fan of Fs. Jul, and they are also often brought in with advertisements (as described below), and there is a lot to work on. <br><br>  From this moment on, Fuji has experienced her takeoff.  But, as usual with our managers - greed began to crush.  FS stuffed so many advertisements into your videos that it overwhelmed the spammers - the commercials were spinning: <br><br>  1. Every time you change the track <br>  2. Every time reloading the movie / page <br>  3. During the pause some more crap was shown. <br>  4. Plus teasers of Marketgid were loaded <br><br>  They got to the point that in broad daylight they turned ads and cigarettes.  It came to insanity: you put children cartoons, and then cigarettes, almost <s>phone sex</s> service.  I wrote to them, like, do you guys have brains?  And they answered me: like, we do not violate the law on advertising, if you want to not show you a booze - register, indicate that you are under 18 (although there is, of course), and that's all - such advertising will not be for you, but if I I want an erotic film to look, what do I have to enter another account, where am I 50 years old?  I believe that this is a blunder - the video hosting is open, it‚Äôs almost like a TV channel, so besides the law on advertising and greed, you need to turn on your brains. <br><br>  Then ex recovered, but still with big bugs: many files were inaccessible, and again it was impossible to return to ex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ca/353/011/3ca353011c771890d7ecd50c7c84af41.jpg"><br><br>  But Ex carried out a lesson, and now he at least has the opportunity to skip the commercial, such a button appears when 16 seconds have passed. <br><br>  Then you can see that the FS also turned on their brains, or the advertisers piled up, which is more likely, and now they have left only market teasers teasers, who, of course, have been bitter, but if they are not noticed, then they are normal, they are in the fields, they are not in the movies climb. <br><br>  Now ex has released a client application ex + - <a href="http://www.ex.ua/view/8911891">www.ex.ua/view/8911891</a> , for viewing without visiting the site.  I did not use the application yet. <br><br>  I do not know who will replay whom in the future, but it‚Äôs good that: a) there is a choice (if there is no movie there, I checked there, if not, I climbed onto torrents), b) the competition does not allow both hosting companies to relax. <br><br>  These are the observations of an ordinary viewer of the Internet cinema.  I am sure there are a lot of video hosting users here, what do you say?  According to your feeling which is better?  What is more convenient?  With tz.  An ordinary viewer, of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288924/</a></p>
