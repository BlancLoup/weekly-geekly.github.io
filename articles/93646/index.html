  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the concept of open production</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In connection with the change of the main activity, from the development of software to the design of equipment and production issues in general, there was a desire to try all the usual paradigms from a previous life to new situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Apparently my life shift is a standard metamorphosis of ITshnik and nothing new, as it turned out, I did not discover, however, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopen production hooked me so much that it paralyzed the main mental activities and forced me to pour out the accumulated thoughts in the head to the court of respected employees. . <br><br>  For those unfamiliar with the field of open production <habracut>  I will very briefly describe: these are attempts to transfer ideas close to open source in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãproduction of material products.  Yes, in fact, the name turned out by analogy, perhaps even not entirely successful, but as far as can be judged by the English.  linguistic sources quite well established.  Naturally, objects of the material world differ significantly from software, and the main difference is that instantiating an instance (turning a project into a matter) requires non-zero costs, both for energy and materials.  Nevertheless, in my personal conviction, the spirit of open production fully corresponds to the social trends (global) in the virtualization of the workplace, the decomposition of businesses into material and informational, the improvement of consumer skills - the transition from ideas is good that is cheap (and the rest is expensive), to Ideas that is good exactly what I need (and not something averaged) <br><br>  I began to look at how this idea was doing in RuNet, due to the lack of interesting information, it flowed smoothly on the DIY theme, and also close sources, such as forums of different production planners, and then there was an insider who could not let go.

      Again, briefly (as I can): there are plenty of resources in the network where people of one subject area discuss technical issues (machine operators, foundry workers, molders), and like any other form, questions arise from time to time the same, i.e.  the cumulative knowledge of the members of the forum rises at a certain, fairly low level, some of the audience is lost, etc.  This, in my opinion, applies to all forums focused on practical activities, ranging from repairing machines to the same software development.  And even more harmful factor <habracut>  that questions are renewed, but the answers are either not published at all or are lost on the 123 page.  God forbid that someone from the old-timers remember that the topic was discussed and will give a link.  In general, reading the forums, in order to find answers, rather causes a sense of a daunting problem that everything is bad and nothing can be done.  I felt it especially acutely reading the machine repair forums, when you read horrible opinions before the evening, you come in, you tighten the nut and everything is ok - well, yes, this is a digression.  Returning to the idea, aspen!  because really people solve a certain range of similar tasks, respectively, perform a certain set of work to make the right PROJECT decisions - and the PROJECTS themselves are not formulated anywhere.  The Google code and sourceforge.net immediately surfaced in my head.  And why are there no such projects for the subject of open production and for production in general ?!  Further more, starting to communicate with production workers, I realized that such projects not only can exist but are fundamentally necessary, moreover, in a social form and with functionality to support the product and project life cycle in particular. <br><br>  Lord Habravchane, if among you there are specialists in specific areas of production and product lifecycle management, and indeed with practical experience in the enterprise in the field of knowledge management, leave your coordinates and comments.  I am fully committed to working and thinking in the direction of open production.  While this is not yet a startup, its scope has not been determined, but the direction of the search becomes clear.  Waiting for your answers <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Michael </habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93646/</a></p>
