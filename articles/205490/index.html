  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT was not expected</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you understand, jokes do not just appear, they appear about.  And the phrase ‚Äúfrom paycheck to paycheck‚Äù is also not taken from the air.  Most of us, in one way or another, plan a budget for the next month on this day and at the same time take into account the financial commitments made: payment of loans, if any, private lessons or sports sections - to ourselves or to a child, payment of the Internet and cable television, cellular communication ... Apart from the Soviet times, the cost of housing and communal services, the three letters of the housing and utilities sector, stands apart in this whole business.  This system itself is most often associated with a bureaucratic iceberg, which, due to its slowness and conservatism, makes ridiculous mistakes.  Unfortunately, in our time, no one should be surprised by the line ‚Äúusing the elevator‚Äù in the receipt for payment, coming to the residents of ‚ÄúKhrushchev‚Äù or paying for hot water, while it is turned off for preventive works.  And, again, unfortunately, everyone understands that going to prove the absurdity of such accounts is akin to fighting windmills: a broken amount will not be comparable with the time and nerves spent. <br><br>  Is it all hopeless?  For an example of solving such problems, we went to Tyumen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  From Wikipedia: Tyumen - the first city in Siberia, the administrative center of the Tyumen region, the administrative center of the Tyumen region.  The population of the city is 634,171 people.  (2013), 19th place in terms of population in Russia, 4th in Siberia, 3rd in the Urals Federal District.  Together with subordinate rural settlements, within the boundaries of the urban district, the population of Tyumen is 657,011 people.  (2013). </blockquote>

      In the city itself, we are interested in <a href="http://itpc.ru/">OAO Tyumen Settlement and Information Center</a> (TRITS), a company that has been providing billing services in the housing and utilities sector in the city and region for 10 years.  Yes, this is not a typo: it is the billing and it is in the housing and utilities sector.  The company's services are a kind of intellectual link between individuals - consumers, and legal - companies that provide services to the population in the housing and utilities sector.  Let's try to figure out how this happens and what are the advantages of this approach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/ceb/267/fe6ceb2671b6a806f84b45f356520af6.jpg"><br><br>  A person living in an apartment consumes certain resources, services provided to him by relevant organizations.  Starting from the usual to everyone: heating, hot and cold water, electricity, the above-mentioned elevator, removal of household waste, lighting of common areas, etc., to particular cases, such as, for example, using an intercom, security at a nearby area or video surveillance of parking places.  According to the experience of the company, such parameters can accumulate up to 40. Now we imagine a standard picture: at the beginning of each month, the most responsible family member begins a painstaking process of filling and collecting all receipts, coupons and roots for later payment in different cash desks and ‚Äúwindows‚Äù ¬ªCompanies, organizations and partnerships.  With queues, lunch cashiers, weekends and holidays and force majeure, resulting in a hastily glued "for technical reasons" sheet in the box on the door.  The prospect, though familiar to many, is far from being the most optimistic.  In the case of using the services from TRIZ, the situation changes greatly. <br><br>  You, as a consumer, with the help of electronic services of the company, form your single receipt for payment of resources consumed by you.  That is, you can fill in the meter readings yourself, for example, in your personal account or on the company's website, indicating your personal account.  In addition, the meter readings can be transferred to the operators of the company via ICQ, by telephone, or to come to any office of TRIZ OJSC.  In addition, you may not agree with the invoice issued to you, for example, for payment of intercom services, if it has not worked for some time.  To do this, you need to specify the reason for the shortage of services, and the service company will take this into account by verifying the data with the internal documentation for repair requests.  It is worth noting that at present in modern homes it is increasingly possible to find telemetry meters that can transmit readings on a specific date via Wi-Fi or using a SIM card installed in them.  And although their use is still more exotic, the specialists of the company have carried out work on the integration of such systems and their connection in the future does not cause problems.  Speaking of technical innovations, it is impossible not to mention the increasingly frequent heat meters (there are some), which is especially important in the conditions of Siberia.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the calculation of benefits, which is also carried out on the company's servers for almost the entire service life.  Employees of TRIZ OJSC, not without pride, note the fact that one of the first Tyumen completed the program for the monetization of benefits.  As a result, consumers receive their benefits in monetary terms and can dispose of them at their discretion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/909/f3a/f94/909f3af94501b327ef4f558be05ae17c.jpg"><br><br>  After compiling a single receipt can be sent to you in the traditional way on paper, formed for payment in your account or sent by e-mail.  Payment methods are also quite wide: the invoice can be paid in the ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù of the bank you are a client of, or you can pay on the website of TRIZ using a credit card (Visa or MasterCard).  Finally, the receipt can be printed out and paid at any branch of any bank, Russian Post or through the terminal of large payment systems.  The very ideology of organizing the payment system not through its own cash desks, but with the help of banks and terminals was at the origin of the TRIZ architecture.  This is the only way to facilitate the payment process and make it as flexible and convenient as possible for both the consumer and management companies, for which timely receipt of funds is often the determining factor. <br><br>  In general, the company seeks to reduce movement and time costs to a minimum.  For this, the ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù works directly in the system itself.  Having activated this service, you can set up an ‚Äúauto payment‚Äù system if you are a client of Sberbank of Russia.  To enable this service for free, you will have to come to the service center with a passport once.  This is due to the need for a personal signature on the agreement on the processing of personal data.  By the way, TRIZ is professionally engaged in ensuring the security of confidential information, which is confirmed by the licenses obtained by FSTEC and the Federal Security Service of Russia.  After that you will be able to carry out all operations on the calculation of housing and communal services without leaving your home.  In addition, IT-specialists of the company carried out preparatory work on working with digital signatures.  So, if such an ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù is widely introduced, the necessary infrastructure for it is already worked out and ready for use.  In addition to the features described above, the ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù client version with very extensive functionality is quite actively used.  With it, for example, the management company can generate financial reports for the selected period. <br><br>  The practicality of this approach is also present in such a moment as the ‚Äúdepth of history‚Äù.  Here it is simply not there.  The system stores all the data from the moment of connecting to the customer service, in the history of the company itself.  In your personal account, at any time you can independently view the history of all payments for housing and communal services for the next 3 years.  If you need a certificate on the absence of debts for payment (for example, when selling an apartment), you must contact any subscriber station and you will be given it on an official letterhead with a standard seal within three minutes.  We emphasize: absolutely any point of TRIZ OJSC in Tyumen itself and in cities that use the company's system throughout the Tyumen region.  All you need when contacting any question you are interested in is the number of your personal account and your passport. <br><br>  The advantages of such a system are obvious.  For the consumer - cost transparency, convenience of payment, time saved, which is always where to spend and, finally, saved nerve cells, which, as you know, are not restored.  For the supplier, and at the moment it is more than 400 large and medium-sized companies, there is always an actual client base, identifying debtors, monitoring the supply of resources and planning further development of the structure in areas based on workload.  By the way, about the debtors: we know at least one illustrative example when, using expensive equipment, to the malicious defaulter they blocked the sewage system.  This case is not ordinary, rather indicative, but nevertheless it had a place to be. <br><br>  To provide all these advantages, a settlement and information company must ensure that its services are available around the clock and that information databases are preserved.  There are two large segments in the company's infrastructure: the reporting server and the billing system itself.  The main load on the reporting server and data center is from the suppliers.  These are financial reports and monitoring of resource consumption, and at any time and for any depth of sampling.  In addition, since the start of its project, TRITZ OJSC provides a service for keeping citizens' passport registration.  Government agencies are engaged in this, but use the power of the company's data center.  The classic Dell <a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pedge/en/pe6850_specs.pdf">PowerEdge 6850 servers</a> , the <a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pedge/en/pe1955_spec_sheet.pdf">PowerEdge 1955</a> blade server and <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/powervault-md1000/pd">PowerVault MD 1000</a> disk arrays, which are located in three racks in the company's central office, have been consistently responding to the 24-hour availability of the entire system.  Backups are done on <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/powervault-tl4000/pd">PowerVault TL4000</a> tape drives, and all internal switching is built using <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/powerconnect-5500-series/pd">PowerConnect</a> gigabit solutions.  Proper forecasting of consumed power, coupled with the technical support of the manufacturer, still allows us to provide services at the highest level throughout this period.  Paradoxical as it may sound, the shortage of today's capacities is predicted by the company's specialists and is expected by next spring.  The technical details of the upcoming upgrade have not yet been disclosed, but you can definitely say whose decisions will be used. <br><br>  It is necessary to take into account the fact that such a business is largely socially oriented.  Refusals in the operation of such a system can negatively affect the situation in the region itself, and unplanned downtime of more than 15 minutes can lead to a call from the highest leadership of the region.  That is why at the very beginning, at the stage of development and establishment of the project, the choice was made in favor of Dell solutions, and for all products without exception, where possible, the extended warranty of ProSupport Next Business Day was issued.  Moreover, in the early stages, the company's computer park was attended by solutions from other vendors, but later they were completely replaced with products from the Texas IT giant, right up to workstations at customer sites.  The reason for this was the ongoing technical support of the company.  If you look at the map, you will see that Tyumen is at a decent distance from the central cities of Western Siberia, and especially from the capital.  And at the same time, the company's specialists point out an unsurpassed level of timely and competent technical support.  It is because of this support that for the entire time that OJSC Tyumen Settlement and Information Center exists, it does not know what is a long idle time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205490/</a></p>
