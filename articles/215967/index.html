    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7b/cd8/bbd/c7bcd8bbd65edbeddea88a484e4a1c4b.jpg"><br><br>  As you probably know, despite the slightly changed design, the layout of the main elements in the Meizu MX3 remains the same as in the Meizu MX2.  On the top of the smartphone there is a power button and a 3.5 mm audio jack, a microUSB port is located on the bottom, and a volume rocker is placed on the left edge. <br>  Has not undergone special changes and the body itself.  As before, it is based on a metal frame cut from a single piece of stainless steel.  The back cover is made of two-layer plastic, which is also familiar to us from the company's previous device.  The method of fastening the lid remained the same - to fix it, a special bracket is used, which is located on the left edge of the device.  But the plastic retainers have changed a bit.  If earlier they were located only along the edge of the lid, then now several more clamps, located closer to the center, were extracted to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33f/dca/bfb/33fdcabfbc88b7f888eb6ac00bc3ff0f.jpg"><br><br>  As in the Meizu MX2, in the new MX3 all the "stuffing" is hidden under a special protective casing.  The casing itself now consists of a single part and is entirely made of plastic.  Due to this, even despite the increased dimensions of the device, the weight of the smartphone has remained almost the same - the difference with the Meizu MX2 is only one gram.  In addition, it became much easier to remove the casing - now it is enough to unscrew 11 screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99c/c23/fb0/99cc23fb0ada7a5b8bd754f6e7752c4b.jpg"><br><br>  The second noticeable difference in comparison with the MX2 was a different arrangement of the protective glass of the camera and the flash LED.  If earlier they were located on the back cover of the smartphone, now they have been transferred to the protective casing.  That is why <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/products/aksessuary/zadnyaya_kryshka_dlya_meizu_mx3/">inexpensive replaceable covers of different colors</a> are already available for the MX3, whereas for the MX2 this part of the case was more expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7e/594/114/d7e59411429ea478ee3a179d9bc2a373.jpg"><br><br>  After the cover is removed, you can remove the battery.  The main thing is not to forget to disconnect from the main board a flat cable that goes along its top.  A similar cable is located in the upper right corner of the battery and is used to connect an NFC antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/688/f7e/c60/688f7ec60f8e1d2f5b1b63bb429d7922.jpg"><br><br>  A special mount for the battery is not provided, it is simply glued to the body with double-sided adhesive tape.  And, although it is peeled off without much effort, in the process it can be accidentally damaged, you need to be careful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f65/77f/93c/f6577f93cd60184a6ccb04c3f7a39cf3.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the smartphone is a small board with the Home key sensor and a micro USB port.  As in the past, the company's smartphone, the sensor surface of the central button is covered with a layer of fluorescent paint.  Thanks to this solution, the button glows even when the smartphone is completely off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abe/9e4/23e/abe9e423e7c451cf84ae2c2c629d6506.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/937/941/fa7/937941fa70e154b32eab4151581344a5.jpg"><br><br>  It connects to the main board with a long loop that runs under the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/fac/3ad/da9fac3ad4a5dc82da480083a0626798.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the volume rocker is a vibration motor module, it is mounted on two screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cad/86e/2b3/cad86e2b39cd3c84bde080f9af6ace17.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper right corner of the smartphone is a white audio module with a 3.5 mm jack.  It is also attached with just two screws and removed in a couple of seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c66/46b/e00/c6646be0047bb090bfa8874bd56fbdf9.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side of the module there is a row of five contacts through which the signal is transmitted to the main board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f57/555/175/f575551756165ec4637b55fb1cdda58b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/330/d75/bc6330d756f0f08b73adfcbdc51bca32.jpg"><br><br>  Let us turn to the most interesting part - the main board.  As a base, the black PCB, which is usual for Meizu, is used, but its shape has changed a lot.  The photo below shows the rectangular Meizu MX3 board and the L-shaped Meizu MX2 board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd6/ccc/0b5/fd6ccc0b5d512302000b6637232dc1c8.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, the outer side of the board is almost completely covered with aluminum protective screens, which were not too easy to remove without special equipment.  But its front side is almost completely open, the protective screen covers only a group of chips in the upper right corner.  Over it passes a cable from the camera module to the board itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e0/fb5/ab1/7e0fb5ab168a06d4530d4169e60fc4ef.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc9/0b3/8b2/fc90b38b22c22fa70abfb66f774293b3.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, about the camera.  The Meizu MX3 uses an 8 MP module (a Sony Exmor BSI sensor, an IMX179 CMOS chip, a 1.4 Œºm photosensitive element), and five lenses.  F / 2.0 aperture, 74 ¬∞ angle. <br>  After all the protective screens have been removed, you can proceed to the analysis of the main modules and chips located on the board.  Let's start with its front side, which is facing the screen of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f2/790/b70/5f2790b700c5f869303b040de505f133.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, pay attention to the bottom of the board.  This is where the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone is - SoC Samsung Exynos 5410, also known as Exynos 5 Octa.  It is worth noting that a similar solution was chosen by Samsung and for its flagship Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500. <br>  This is one of the world's first eight-core CPUs.  It is based on eight cores: four low-cost ARM Cortex-A7 and four powerful ARM Cortex-A15, no more than four can work at the same time.  This is precisely the feature of the big.LITTLE architecture, which allows to reduce energy consumption by switching between the productive and economical four cores in time.  More information about it can be obtained on the official website of Samsung. <br><br> <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/products5octa_5410.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/845/230/46e/84523046e92360b0b2f7d6e7507eaa88.jpg" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/products5octa_5410.html">Summary of SoC</a> <br><br>  To work with graphics using a three-core graphics processor SGX544MP3 with a clock frequency of 533 MHz.  Of its features worth noting hardware support for DirectX 9, OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenCL 1.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b2/1e4/486/5b21e4486a7ca20dd41a35a403658b98.jpg"><br><br>  The right corner of the board is almost completely occupied by the microSIM card tray.  Between it and the processor is a small bright black chip - ‚ÄúDC-to-DC Controller‚Äù Maxim MAX776, which is responsible for power management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ff/c3b/06b/0ffc3b06b067c639c9948529e317c3c3.jpg"><br><br>  Closer to the left side of the board, you can see quite a tiny chip "bipolar power supply for display" - TPS65132 from Texas Instruments, capable of working with TFT-LCD panels up to 10 inches. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65132.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/cc6/9e0/278cc69e0b38bab9d63999e7d8e00880.png" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65132.pdf">Chip description</a> <br><br>  But the chip to its left has a much larger size.  This ISP or Image Signal Processor, responsible for the camera.  As in its previous devices, Meizu decided to use the Fujitsu ISP chip.  However, the chip itself is slightly different - not the MBG048, as in the two previous smartphones, but the S20AB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3b/5fc/496/b3b5fc4967f77f09f5e0dceb371955f9.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go to the top side of the board.  On the left side of the cut-out for the camera module is another chip, which has also been upgraded.  We are talking about the Broadcom chip, which is responsible for the operation of wireless interfaces.  If the Meizu MX2 was used for this purpose by the Broadcom BCM4430, then in the MX3 it was decided to install Broadcom BCM4334.  Unfortunately, there is very little information about the BCM4430, therefore it is difficult to say exactly what the difference is between them.  It remains only to be content with the description of the BCM4334.  According to him, the new version of the chip has less power consumption than the past, supports the standards of Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0 + HS and technologies such as Wi-Fi Display and Wi-Fi Direct.  Another feature of Broadcom BCM4334 is support for FM radio (which, however, is absent in the smartphone itself). <br><br> <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions/BCM4334"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/845/230/46e/84523046e92360b0b2f7d6e7507eaa88.jpg" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/Wireless-LAN/802.11-Wireless-LAN-Solutions/BCM4334">Chip Summary</a> <br><br>  Let's now consider a group of chips placed to the right of the cutout for a camera module.  It is this part of the board that was covered with an aluminum shield. <br>  RF6260 is used as a ‚Äúpower amplifier module‚Äù, a chip responsible for the operation of a smartphone on 2G / 3G networks.  Curiously, the RF6260 also supports 4G, which is not available in the smartphone itself.  A similar chip was used in the past of the company's flagship, the Meizu MX2. <br><br> <a href="http://www.rfmd.com/CS/Documents/SL_Eurasia%2520RF6260_0109.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/cc6/9e0/278cc69e0b38bab9d63999e7d8e00880.png" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.rfmd.com/CS/Documents/SL_Eurasia%2520RF6260_0109.pdf">Chip description</a> <br><br>  Next to it is the blue module - Epcos D602 RF filter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77c/ddc/da7/77cddcda7010fcf881776a354c864e07.jpg"><br><br>  Slightly closer to the center is the RF PMB5712 radio transceiver.  Together with the PMB9811 modem, which is located on the opposite side of the board, it is part of the Intel XMM 6260 platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/796/70a/d9f/79670ad9f93b49c55fcee98e78e4a54f.jpg"><br><br>  Now it's time to turn over the board and see what's interesting is on its reverse side.  Like last time, let's start from the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14a/df4/ab3/14adf4ab3043c18cda6dede825d40a65.jpg"><br><br>  In the left corner is a group of power-related chips ‚Äî the barely noticeable DC-DC Converter RF Micro Devices 6560 and the slightly larger Integrated Controller Maxim MAX778. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/604/1e9/6e76041e91b4557700fcd062006fcb4b.jpg"><br><br>  The next module, Atmel 32UC3, is located almost in the center of the board.  This is a 32-bit microcontroller of the ‚Äúsystem-on-chip‚Äù type, created on the basis of the AVR32 UC RISC-processor with an operating frequency of up to 50 MHz.  According to the manufacturer, the main focus of this microcontroller was placed on high performance with low power consumption.  More information can be found in the PDF file. <br><br> <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-32145-32-bit-Flash-MCU-UCL0_summary.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/cc6/9e0/278cc69e0b38bab9d63999e7d8e00880.png" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-32145-32-bit-Flash-MCU-UCL0_summary.pdf">Chip description</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/e73/53f/132e7353fbb4d1d547458a2021bdea7b.jpg"><br><br>  The entire right corner is occupied by a large memory module with a well-distinguished Toshiba brand.  Interestingly, in the photographs of the board that had previously appeared on the network, the memory module was from SanDisk.  The same module was used in the past, the company's smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22d/4df/b5e/22d4dfb5e37a81d33a0f28764342d0c4.jpg"><br><br>  Another Toshiba memory module, this time already operational, is located in the left corner of the upper part of the board.  In our case, we couldn‚Äôt see its labeling, but, according to the Chinese resource bbs.meizu.cn, this is the Toshiba D8 + Toshiba Y8A0A111434KA module.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to find its detailed specifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/33e/cb5/94a33ecb50c173f429f23592fd672b00.jpg"><br><br>  A little to the right is the modem Intel PMB9811.  Let me remind you that it is part of the Intel XMM6260 platform, already mentioned above.  It should be noted that this platform is not a new, but proven and reliable solution.  It was originally developed by Infineon and was called X-GOLD626.  And even then it was used in a number of well-known smartphones, for example, Samsung Galaxy S2.  Later, after Intel acquired the Infineon Technologies wireless division, this solution was given the name Intel XMM6260. <br><br> <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/platform-briefs/mobile-xmm-260-1-brief.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/cc6/9e0/278cc69e0b38bab9d63999e7d8e00880.png" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/platform-briefs/mobile-xmm-260-1-brief.pdf">Chip description</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/584/be3/f29/584be3f2913e06cc586bb575468168e3.jpg"><br><br>  Just above the camera cut-out is another Broadcom chip.  This chip belongs to the third generation of GNSS solutions (Global Navigation Satellite System or Global Navigation Satellite System) and can provide simultaneous use of four navigation systems at once - GPS, GLONASS, QZSS and SBAS.  For fast positioning, Broadcom BCM4752 supports work with a number of additional sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, an atmospheric pressure sensor, and others. <br><br> <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/GPS/GPS-Silicon-Solutions/BCM4752"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/845/230/46e/84523046e92360b0b2f7d6e7507eaa88.jpg" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/GPS/GPS-Silicon-Solutions/BCM4752">Chip Summary</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15c/1b3/043/15c1b30430a217e9077b17a196e2f556.jpg"><br><br>  Virtually the rest of the board‚Äôs corner is reserved for working with sound.  Given that the Meizu MX3 is a music smartphone, this part of the board is of particular interest to us. <br>  First of all, attention is drawn to the large square of the audio chip.  As you can see, Meizu almost always prefers Wolfson audio chips.  For example, in Meizu MX and in Meizu MX2, Wolfson WM8958E was installed.  The latest flagship of the company, the Meizu MX3, which also features the Wolfson chip, but already a new model, the Wolfson WM5102, was no exception.  According to the company, it is thanks to this chip, compared to last year‚Äôs flagship, the sound quality in the MX3 has been greatly improved.  The power of the head amplifier has increased by 3 times, the level of harmonic distortion has been reduced to 0.002%, and the signal-to-noise ratio has been increased to 113 dB.  Another distinctive feature of the chip is support for Dirac HD technology. <br>  Wolfson has long been known on the market for audio chips for portable devices and audio chips from this company can be found in mobile devices from a variety of manufacturers.  In particular, the Wolfson WM5102 is used in the Samsung Galaxy S4 16Gb GT-I9500.

This module can provide 2.6 watts RMS power, while most analogs provide only 0.5 watts. <br><br> <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/short_data_sheet/TFA9887_SDS.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/cc6/9e0/278cc69e0b38bab9d63999e7d8e00880.png" width="48" height="48"></a>  <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/short_data_sheet/TFA9887_SDS.pdf">Chip description</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7a/68c/f97/c7a68cf978b4ba2edffaa206618b8ef7.jpg"><br><br>  In the end I would like to say a few words about the cooling of the board.  As the company representatives have already mentioned, the heat sink is carried out on both sides of the printed circuit board, since the heat transfer goes in both directions.  The use of thermal paste, graphite and nickel-copper alloy coatings can effectively dissipate heat. <br>  Under the main board there is a module with a light sensor and a proximity sensor, a speaker, and a front camera module (2MP, Exmor R). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/def/c05/ed9/defc05ed98cb358600e7ebd810bf282e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/803/160/27d/80316027df5c6698fe078bdac6ecf600.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/386/c53/c1d/386c53c1d1b86ade28eea1dae82586cf.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the fully disassembled Meizu MX3 looks like (the lid was left overs). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32a/544/552/32a54455218d41e1ff6408dd6759c6b2.jpg"><br><br>  Smartphone Meixu MX3 can not be called a revolution, rather, it is a quality update of the previous model.  On the one hand, the smartphone continues the traditions of the Meizu MX family, on the other - it has a number of improvements.  We see that when selecting components, the company remained true to old partners, while many of the components of the device were substantially updated.  Moreover, this year, special emphasis was placed on the audio part.  The internal design of the smartphone is also improved.  This is a more practical and convenient protective casing, and another layout of modules.  Particularly pleased that the LEDs of the flash and the protective glass of the camera are transferred from the back cover to the inside of the smartphone.  Due to this, it will be much easier to change the cover. <br><br>  Articles about the opening of Meizu MX3 on other resources: <br><br><ul><li>  Disassembling the Meizu MX3 at <a href="http://forum.meizu.com/redirect.php%3Ftid%3D14978%26goto%3Dlastpost">http://forum.meizu.com/</a> </li><li>  Disassembling the Meizu MX3 at <a href="http://www.meizume.com/front-page-news/15299-mx3-inner-beauty.html">http://www.meizume.com/</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br> <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e8/ee8/524/4e8ee8524aefe7ebca24fc5d6745fa07.jpg" width="58" height="38"></a>  Meizu smartphone online store in Russia <a href="http://mymeizu.ru/">http://mymeizu.ru/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215967/</a></p>
