  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nearby Entertainment Literature</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every representative of any IT-profession, it does not matter whether he is a programmer, a system administrator, or whoever he likes - he likes to read.  Otherwise, he would hardly have gone into this profession, with endless articles and documentation. But books are not only a source of knowledge and other people's experience, it is also great entertainment.  And let Saturday be on the calendar, in terms of its functional parameters, is the real Friday, and therefore I propose to share in the comments your favorite entertainment books and stories about ITshniki and for ITshnikov! <br><br>  Under the cut - the first 5 titles with descriptions from me, for starters. <br>  <b>update 1.</b> There are 10+ titles in the comments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Diary of the tester / Chronicle tester.</b> <br>  <b>Author</b> - Yuri Alekseevich Brigadier <br>  Small in length collections of humorous stories, sketches from the life of a Russian pirate office, engaged in the production of counterfeit CD with software.  It is written in a very lively and colloquial language, is not shy about the mat, but exclusively in the case, is conducted on behalf of the entrant, and later - by a student who works as a tester for the resulting disks in this office.  And in the description of the office, its environment or its heroes, everyone will surely find themselves or familiar faces, familiar situations.  Reads quickly and easily.  Be sure to read. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://lleo.me/arhive/mim/altshift.htm">Gleb Altshifter</a></b> (and others) <br>  <b>The author</b> - Leonid Kaganov <br>  The author has a very specific style and style, you either love it, or it will seem strange to you, but you should definitely try to read it, at least try it.  I started with this story, which is why I would recommend it.

      <b>9600 baud and all everything all</b> (as well as continuations, for example " <b>14400 baud and the same all-all-all</b> ") <br>  <b>Author</b> - Andrey Shcherbakov <br>  How to briefly describe the plot ... Times of 386-486 / first Pentium, Winnie the Pooh is a cool hacker, Ia-Ia too, but hacks programs solely for the love of art, Piglet is hacked in Prince of Persia, SAVA (original spelling) draws telephone through the forest lines, Tigra works at the telephone station, Rabbit keeps the BBS at home, Christopher Robin holds the bank, and the Elephant Crawler ... Well, all right, I won‚Äôt disclose all the cards, for it‚Äôs interesting, fun, and I recommend it again. <br><br>  <b>A maze of reflections</b> (trilogy) <br>  <b>Author</b> - Sergey Lukyanenko <br>  The curious idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan alternative story is taken as a basis - virtual reality was invented, but at least in a non-standard way.  A person with special light effects plunges into a special state, like a trance, and it <i>seems to</i> him that he is inside a game / three-dimensional chat or something.  In reality, he is here, in our reality, presses the buttons and moves the mouse, but does not feel it, and the brain completes the rest of the environment.  The idea is good, the limitations connected with this are initially logically written ... At least, the first book is definitely worth a try. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.wasm.ru/article.php%3Farticle%3Donebyte">One byte history</a></b> <br>  <b>Author</b> - Dmitry Galuscenko <br>  Recently emerged in the comments on HabraHabre.  The story of the programming of iron, about the philosophy of programming, just try to skip it!  ;-) <br><br>  This is so far all that I could recall right away that something else will pop up - then I will add in the updates.  And waiting for your favorite stories and books in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164327/</a></p>
