      By sales: <br><br>  1.Samsung (6.05 million) <br>  2.Apple (3.25 million) <br>  3.Lenovo (2.22 million) <br>  4.Nokia (1.79 million) <br>  5.Sony (1.59 million) <br>  6.LG (1.06 million) <br>  7.HTC (852,000) <br><br>  By profit: <br><br>  1.Apple ($ 2.14 billion) <br>  2.Samsung ($ 1.45 billion) <br>  3.Sony ($ 425 million) <br>  4.Lenovo ($ 417 million) <br>  5.Nokia ($ 285 million) <br>  6.LG ($ 239 million) <br>  7.HTC ($ 234 million) <br><br>  According to analysts, in 2015, an adverse economic environment will adversely affect the market, and there will be no further growth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  The Sun will create a mobile platform with its games and payments. </h3><br>  Sun Play - this <a href="http://app2top.ru/industry/bul-varnaya-gazeta-the-sun-vzyalas-za-razrabotku-mobil-ny-h-igr-51237.html">will be the name of the</a> new mobile project from Nektan for the tabloid newspaper The Sun.  From the press release of the project, it became known that a number of games will be released in which it will be possible to play for real pounds - how this will be implemented is not yet revealed. <br><br>  On the one hand, it may seem rather strange and desperate for the newspaper, especially at the height of the media crisis, when everyone is trying to somehow stand out in the market or, on the contrary, save and reduce 90% of all employees.  But it is worth paying attention to the fact that 7 million people read the The Sun newspaper every day, and the target audience has already been studied and there are ideas about its interests - if not to make mistakes with the games, then the publication is clearly not deprived of traffic. <br><br><br><h3>  Localytics on application activity peaks </h3><br>  Localytics <a href="http://apptractor.ru/measure/user-analytics/localytics-pik-ispolzovaniya-prilozheniy-prihoditsya-na-8-vechera.html">conducted a study</a> that reveals activity peaks throughout the day in various types of applications.  This information can help you decide on the timing of your next promotion or announcement, holding a contest or update.  As a result, all the information can be divided into 4 points with their own charts: <br><br>  Application start at 7am and peak at 8pm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6c/a3b/357/e6ca3b357f01490888b0fa9ccbd134e7.png"><br><br>  news, travel and weather are used more in the morning from 7 to 8 o'clock, and the second peak is at 5 pm for travel and closer to 10 for news and weather; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/7dc/898/d5c7dc8986b3422db3bb4cfc806340dd.png"><br><br>  business, finance and music are used equally throughout the day and evening; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/492/31e/ac6/49231eac64f44570ab2b9149e25f7780.png"><br><br>  entertainment and social applications are more used late in the evening and at night, although users of media applications are active even at night. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a1/46f/907/7a146f907b2a4b2da7c1bc3c4556f362.png"><br><br><br><h3>  New game from Zeptolab </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38a/966/d8f/38a966d8f83d4f66aa1bb1a1255c2be9.jpg"><br><br>  Just recently, Zeptolab released their new game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/king-of-thieves/id952715194">King of Thieves</a> , and discussions have already erupted around those who liked it, and those who did not like it.  I rather belong to the second, so be careful, do not take my words for granted :) <br><br>  Probably, this is a sign of a good game, that users did not remain indifferent and actively discuss.  In my opinion, the game turned out to be a niche, for those who love platformers who do not forgive mistakes.  You need to be very patient, dexterous and attentive.  I do not think that the modern casual player has these qualities.  Not without an evil random, which can suddenly interrupt a gaming session, forcing either to watch ads or pay.  But, in general, the game deserves at least that it was set, watched and formed an opinion. <br><br><br><h3>  Birds fly to China </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/d50/923/9a1d50923a2246d9bb9f824f152a4533.jpg"><br><br>  We all understand how powerful and promising China‚Äôs mobile market is.  And Rovio, who have been doing a lot lately, too.  No, they did not decide to publish a <a href="http://stormsisters.rovio.com/">book</a> for Chinese children about Laoway bird fowls, they made a more interesting move.  Rovio was <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/60850/rovio-kunlun-angry-birds-china/">informed</a> that they had signed an agreement with Kunlun, a Chinese publisher, but not just publishing games for the market, with some small localization adaptations in art, as most do.  No, it seems that there will be a complete processing of the product for the market, and China will see its specially designed version of Angry Birds, <s>with blackjack and Stella</s> . <br><br>  It is not often found such a serious approach to the conquest of the market!  Although it‚Äôs not new, Disney also reworked its Where is My Water into a popular Chinese character.  We are waiting, waiting for Angry Ni«éol√®i! <br><br><br><h3>  Statistics of the most popular categories in the App Store.  Games they rule! </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ca/2cf/348/7ca2cf3489cc499c8aa7cef1b59e4575.jpg"><br><br>  Games <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/270291/popular-categories-in-the-app-store/">confidently lead</a> the App Store in the number of downloads.  Over the period beginning in the summer of 2014, 75 billion applications were downloaded, and 21.14% came from games! <br><br>  In second place, with a large margin, applications from the category of training, their share is only 10.1%.  In the last place are social networks - 1.95%, but this is not surprising, there are few social networks, and a great many games. <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
