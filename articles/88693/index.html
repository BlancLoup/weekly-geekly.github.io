      It's about an application to call a taxi in a mobile phone.  The first part of my review about what it is all about, why it is much more profitable, more convenient and more interesting than calling a taxi by phone number. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Attention, all customers, addresses, telephones and drivers in this review are specifically fictional, any connection with reality is an accident.</i> <br><br>  To become a client of our taxi, you just need to download the application to your phone, enter your phone number and select your city.  You need to do this only once, and then you will immediately proceed to the application.  I will make a reservation in advance, that this is a great find for those who often move between cities - no need to look for taxi numbers and talk with dispatchers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c20/b70/e35/c20b70e3567505b5311416de3a23d350.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br><h4>  <b>one</b> </h4><br>  The technology is arranged so that there are no more dispatchers.  You apply directly to taxi drivers.  Few people like to communicate with dispatchers.  Caught and impolite, and incompetent, or simply very tired.  Although I sometimes come across exceptions, but rarely.  :) <br><br><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/1003/e8/21e05144ff6e.png" alt="Taxi application"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71a/fa2/bbd/71afa2bbdbf69ece41eb4a08266156b4.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br><h4>  <b>2</b> </h4><br>  Next you need to select the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city and fill out an application.  Here we went to meet customers by making auto-complete.  This is the essence: the application remembers all the entered addresses, and the next time it automatically substitutes the address as soon as you enter the first letter.  Substituted also the name of the street, and the house, and the entrance.  If several options were previously submitted to the same letter, then an asterisk can be switched between the options. <br><br>  <i>It turns out that the filing of an application becomes a matter of only 10-15 seconds.</i> <br><br>  Apply to a regular taxi will take about the same time.  If you get a competent and sleepy dispatcher, you quickly speak and get through immediately, then you can even overtake the application by speed, but such a coincidence is unlikely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dae/a4b/36a/daea4b36ace7e7d85d3c80e3ae8aba14.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br><h4>  <b>3</b> </h4><br>  Further, more interesting.  The application is sent directly to taxi drivers who are in your area.  And here you have a legitimate and, undoubtedly, a very pleasant right to choose a driver, who will have the honor of taking you (by the way, I, with open testing, really liked this privilege). <br><br><img src="http://s43.radikal.ru/i099/1003/bf/1088c0dbe6dd.png" alt="Taxi application"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f20/839/fb6/f20839fb643a5b1bc93319abe3ed9ba3.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br>  As you can see from the example, you can choose a car according to your personal preferences - either the ‚Äúcoolest‚Äù one, or the one that comes the fastest, or for the price, if everything is not so good with money.  Each driver rides on his personal rates - they can be listed as a fixed price, either by mileage, or by price per minute.  Depends on the city.  For example, in Tolyatti they ride mostly at fixed rates, but there are firms operating by mileage.  Often it will be possible to meet an economical option, because there will be competition between drivers, and some will carry cheap if they are close to them or for other reasons known only to them. <br><br><h4>  <b>four</b> </h4><br>  So, we chose a driver.  By the way, I personally do not know a single telephone taxi offering a choice of car.  I haven't seen anything like this anywhere (except, possibly, capital cities and a vip-taxi). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fb/18b/2d7/9fb18b2d702c53c80b6c39bc91ab97bd.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br>  A counter will appear on the screen with a countdown from the time specified by the driver.  You can leisurely gather and know when you come.  But let's face it - in most cases, the claimed time is not true.  Most often you go out into the street, and there is no car on the horizon.  You have to wait, which is not very pleasant - bad weather, for example.  Or on the contrary, you leave, and the driver has long been on the spot and demands payment for idle time. <br>  In the application everything is thought out.  As soon as the driver arrives at the scene, an inscription appears on the phone, and also it vibrates and beeps ‚Äî in other words, by all possible means it informs the client that the driver is already at the door.  While testing was going on, they called taxis even on minor matters, since  I really liked these features.  Surprisingly, the driver came to the place only once after the end of the counter. <br><br>  As long as I traveled in an ordinary taxi, it was always the other way around - you go out and wait, even there was a habit of going out 5-7 minutes later than the dispatcher said (I think most people do).  Apparently, the motto of our taxi is quite justified. <br><br><img src="http://i056.radikal.ru/1003/13/2cdb8a79a6c1.png" alt="Taxi application"><br><br><h4>  <b>five</b> </h4><br>  <b>Convenience</b> - now you can call a taxi from any noisy places, for example from clubs.  Given that taxis are very often called from clubs, then for such a category of people it will be a real find. <br><br><h4>  <b>6</b> </h4><br>  <b>Saving.</b> <br><br>  Call costs through the app: <br>  <i>- GPRS 8R./MB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- To call a taxi takes 5-6 kilobytes.</i>  <i>It turns out, it is 5-6 kopecks.</i> <br><br>  Calling by phone is definitely more expensive, if anyone is interested, it can count, depending on its operator.  Although it is a trifle, but still nice. <br><br>  <b>In general, we openly declare:</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe are always ready to listen to the wishes of our customers.</i>  <i>The advantage of any application is that it can be expanded to the needs and preferences of customers.</i>  <i>And we are open to listen and implement them. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Another ‚Äúgood‚Äù purpose of the application is to enable deaf-and-dumb people to call a taxi.  Though it is strange, but after all such an opportunity exists and a person with disabilities can now take advantage of such a convenient taxi. <br><br>  Also, the application has a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù tab, which allows you to adjust customer feedback and constantly improve the service. <br><br>  So, I tried to describe to you the obvious advantages of new technologies and our taxi, as well as share your own emotions from trips. <br>  You can download the application from the official taxi website: <a href="http://taxolet.ru/5">TAXOLET.RU</a> or torrent <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2827100">HERE</a> . <br><br>  <b>Testing has already been completed, and a minimum base of customers and drivers in Russian cities is being recruited.</b> <br>  In the next part I will tell you how the driver's application is arranged, and in the third about the taxi partner program, thanks to which you can at least take a taxi for free, and at the most - quit your job and live on the income from cooperation with our company. <br><br>  Thank you for attention. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/89217/">Taxi in the mobile - the driver's side.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/89217/">(part 2)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/taxolet/blog/92413/">Taxi in the mobile - our success is the success of our partners.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/taxolet/blog/92413/">(part 3)</a> </li></ul><br>  PS Topic posted at the request of the author of the project. <br>  PPS Dear Hubs, could you explain why you are minus this startup review?  (do not apply to those who plus). <br>  If you put a minus to this topic - please take the time to write a comment with a justification of your negative opinion.  If you have nothing to say, is it really difficult to just pass by? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88693/</a></p>
