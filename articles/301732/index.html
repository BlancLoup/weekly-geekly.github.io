We thought about this problem for a while, and then in turn launched several conferences, which we decided to tell you about in this post today. <br><br>  So, from 3 to 5 June in St. Petersburg at the Park Inn Pulkovskaya hotel a festival will be held for programmers from three conferences in a row: <br><ul><li>  June 3 - <a href="http://dotnext.ru/spb/">DotNext</a> conference for .NET developers; </li><li>  June 4th - <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/">Mobius</a> conference for mobile application developers; </li><li>  June 5 is the <a href="http://holyjs.ru/">HolyJS</a> conference for Frontend and JavaScript developers. </li></ul><br>  We have already written the details about each conference, and today we decided to tell about one important element that allows us to experiment with new directions and expand the range of conferences held. <br><br>  Surely, you know that besides the organizers, the conference is formed by at least three more components: <br><ul><li>  Speakers (our Russian gurus, guests from abroad and in general all those who have something to share with the professionals). </li><li>  Participants (this is you or your colleagues and friends). </li><li>  Sponsors. </li></ul><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/p/301732/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/60e/dfb/64e60edfb2e04cce82963cfd34391e12.jpg">

    </a>  <b>We will talk about sponsors today.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why precisely about them?  We talk about speakers often, and lately it‚Äôs always constant (in our blog you will find 10 interviews in 2 weeks - these are not jokes), and this is the cornerstone of the conference, as well as the participants.  At the same time, no one discusses partners and sponsors: no heated discussions and conversations, although it is thanks to them that new directions often open up for us. <br><br>  In order not to be unfounded, I offer you the TOP-5 comments from the evaluation of partners at the conference (most of the reviews are not related to the format and quality of the stand): <br><ol><li>  Give out cool T-shirts - black, and notebooks are cool! </li><li>  Little merchandise and stickers! </li><li>  Chet puzzles for two days did not come up - too lazy, or what? </li><li>  I liked the freebie-oatmeal in the form of mugs, T-shirts and tasks. </li><li>  I want to know more about projects and the team &lt;...&gt; </li></ol><br>  We have not been abandoned for a long time by the idea that people do not think at all about how many sponsors invest in conferences.  And this is not only and not so much about the financial side of the issue: most often large companies act as sponsors with large-scale projects, rich in unique experience and their own experiences that they share with participants, as well as at their stands do not let the latter get bored during the breaks . <br><br>  Accordingly, we appealed to the sponsors of our festival of developers and asked them a couple of questions about what it really is, support the conference, who needs it, and what difficulties / doubts do the conference sponsor have? <br><br><blockquote><h3>  Please tell us about the purpose of your participation in the conferences and the criteria for their selection. </h3></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ede/3ca/103/ede3ca103b4242ee851e32eb6a4feedd.png" align="left">  <b><i>Kirill Shiryaev, Head of the global team of recruitment and promotion of the employer's brand, Kaspersky Lab:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúFor Kaspersky Lab, the goal of participating in these conferences is primarily to strengthen the areas in which the company is developing.  That is, we are interested only in technical conferences in areas that we have in the company, whether it is mobile development, .NET or C ++.  In fact, this is one of the main criteria by which we choose whether we go to this conference or not.  Also, our guys who attend such conferences learn a lot from the program, they look at known problems in a new way: because when you are developing a single product, the eye is ‚Äúwashed out‚Äù.  And the opportunity to see how the problem is solved by other companies, which new approaches or standards are used, or in general they somehow think outside the box, exactly help our work. <br><br>  And at the poster events themselves, we have guys who understand very deeply and know how the company works at one level or another, and can tell people interested in real-life how they work.  This is probably the main goal.  An additional goal (I will not hide it) is to get to know the community, find out where, which teams work, and find out who they need. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/f07/452/834f07452d294e409a9382aacb875ee9.png" align="left">  <b><i>Sergey Shkredov, Head of .NET, JetBrains:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThere is sponsorship in the Russian and non-Russian - we choose them differently.  That is, we mostly go to non-Russian conferences with product reports, describing products and going there with the goal of selling products.  We do not consider the Russian conferences as some significant source of customers, we come here with the aim of promoting our company, promoting our team, our development processes and technical issues that we are doing.  Well, therefore, when we choose conferences, we go with a booth to the ones where we tell something. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dc/e58/c6e/8dce58c6eac541db8019d6e7bb8e6465.png" align="left">  <b><i>Christina Steinberg, Odnoklassniki Head of Project Personnel</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúInitially there were several reasons.  The first is help in developing Java, the second is the opportunity to tell more about the social network as a place to work and a professional team. <br>  At first there was a Java conference, the very first.  Then we realized that the mobile direction is developing dynamically, but the circle of specialists who communicate with each other in St. Petersburg is not - no one talks about what is happening in the industry, what news is, technologies, how people and companies cope with the problems that they have a mobile development exist. <br><br>  Our goals are: first, to show the speakers;  secondly, to talk about the really topical issues in the industry - how we started using new technologies or how we deal with big data.  And you can even go without a stand - if the company has good speakers, then this is practically 70-80% of the success of all the money invested and the forces that were in the sponsorship package. <br><br>  At the same time, a presence with a stand also gives positive results.  This is the place where a participant can come and ask a question to our developers.  If a question arises, and I want to know more about the company and its technologies, our guys at the stand will always help and give feedback. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66c/2e6/5b3/66c2e65b36504cb09190a350ad3665d5.png" align="left">  <b><i>Polina Panyukova, Marketing Specialist, EPAM</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúEPAM has recently started participating in IT conferences in St. Petersburg, literally since last autumn (the first event was the Joker conference).  The main goal, of course, is to tell about the company, about how EPAM is growing and gaining momentum in St. Petersburg, what projects are being developed.  The second goal is the opportunity to attract talented developers to work in EPAM.  The selection of the conference is carried out according to several criteria: first, the technological subject.  We participate in those events where we can share our expertise in technologies that we actively use in the company;  and secondly, the popularity of the event among the developers and our need for specialists in one direction or another. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc0/9f9/bfc/fc09f9bfc6a74b2b87a45259334ebf86.png" align="left">  <b><i>Anastasia Tikhomirova, B2E Marketing Specialist, Luxoft</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúOur main goal at conferences is to tell people more about the company, our expertise and projects.  Luxoft participates in various conferences, both Russian and international.  We always try to bring to the presentations of our technical experts, those who could share their own experience of working on projects in our company, talk about the technologies that we use and the possibilities within Luxoft. <br>  We choose conferences depending on the technologies that will be presented there and the popularity of this event among our target audience. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/277/812/f0e/277812f0e08b40068207413cbd2141b0.png" align="left">  <b><i>Sergey Zvyagin, Lead Developer, DevExpress</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWhen we talk about goals, it should immediately be noted that the Russian market is not the key for us at the moment: we are much better known in North America and the European Union, therefore we are now working to improve our visibility in Russia.  In general, of course, we go to Russian conferences not so much to promote as to receive feedback, questions from the participants, discuss with them about our products and generally about modern technologies, understand what can be done better, and of course share our experience with ours. companies will soon be 17 years old, there is something to tell fellow developers. ‚Äù <br><br><blockquote><h3>  At conferences supported by you usually there are reports of your developers.  Is this part of the sponsorship package or independent reports? </h3></blockquote><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Shkredov:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe are talking about what we are doing.  Our reports, they are about ‚Äútechnology‚Äù mainly: algorithms, technologies that we use ourselves to develop some products, in general, such reports about how we make our products. <br>  Very rarely there are reports about what we are doing this or that feature, grocery reports - we don‚Äôt have a lot of such reports from .NET.  Only when we saw something completely new and interesting.  Probably more about what we ourselves use to write our code. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f4/387/d01/7f4387d01e7f4dd2984c37cfc54bac28.png"><br><br>  <b><i>Kirill Shiryaev:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe, as a company that has been engaged in commercial software development for many years, have a lot of groundwork and things we have come to, or where our guys learned that they are working in foreign markets: they are always happy to share these groundwork with this or that community. <br><br>  We, in fact, speak at the conference only with reports on the topic of the conference.  And it is the stories about the company - if we do, then in the order of two or three minutes, within the framework of the opening of the conference.  Still, we believe that we can talk about the company on the stand, but about something so interesting, narrowly focused, there may be no more opportunity. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/d41/4d9/fa9d414d977e498b8163e23a16d35303.png"><br><br>  <b><i>Anastasia Tikhomirova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe speeches of our speakers are not part of the sponsorship packages: our specialists prepare such reports with which we are not ashamed to come to a high-level conference.  For example, Vladimir Krasilshchik is a kind of guru, and his speeches always get a good response.  We are very pleased that we have such talented employees :) ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/9e9/939/b149e993951d4a37aad20c82c08ac1c5.png"><br><br>  <b><i>Polina Panyukova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúSpeaking about the speakers, it is important to understand that we invite speakers regardless of our status at the conference.  EPAM has a story to tell: these are our own technologies and the technologies we use.  There are interesting cases on projects that you can share. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/938/320/c8b/938320c8b0284be0aa472ea5927200f6.png"><br><br>  <b><i>Christina Steinberg:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúFirstly, we help to ensure that the conference was attended by good quality speakers, proven.  You always want the guys to listen to some really cool speaker who is valued in a professional sense. <br><br>  Secondly, Odnoklassniki is not just a website.  We are a large project with a highly loaded system, and in Russia there are practically no such projects, there are very, very few of them.  And the information about the experience that we get at work (for example, highload on 8000+ servers), what tasks we cope with is interesting. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fc/a0c/d37/8fca0cd37176479bad8f549f41810cb0.png"><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Zvyagin:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe also believe that the connection is not so big.  An interesting report will always be a man where to speak.  And here it is not necessary to be sponsors in order to make a report. <br>  On the other hand, the sponsorship package gives you the opportunity to make a report about your product - that is, not so much technical aspects that will help people in their future development experience, but some advertising things.  We think so and try to act the same way when we go to the conference with reports, that advertising is advertising, everything is good - we earn money on it, we all want money - we all want to eat, but we ourselves, as developers, believe what is more interesting to talk about experience, transfer knowledge - less advertising, more than some practical advice. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c0/adc/ff3/4c0adcff346a4bc0b05e18726874dfc6.png"><br><br><blockquote><h3>  Tell us what is the most difficult for you at the conference? </h3></blockquote><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Shkredov:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúIn general, in support of the Russian conferences, we are putting tangible efforts into the selection of reports, because when DotNext gained momentum, these topics only emerged there.  Now everything seems to have been told, and new technologies do not arrive every day - just so that it is interesting.  The report is not easy to pick up.  Well, on the other hand, DotNext itself sets the bar high, and we are no longer the only participants there, as before - many other interesting reports arrive. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/def/06b/96b/def06b96bfa448cb916608a1bed4f8bd.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Christina Steinberg:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that putting a stand and engaging in recruiting at this stand is not at all the approach that we like, because in most cases we get a negative from the developers themselves who attend the conference. <br><br>  Some come - there were such cases, and they ask for a test task: ‚ÄúPlease give us the‚Äú test ‚Äù, we want to solve an interesting problem.‚Äù  In fact, it is very difficult to build a scheme that works for real loyalty.  We used to do lotteries, collected contacts, but this does not work.  Conference participants will be loyal to the company only when they are offered really interesting and important knowledge.  This should be a place for people who can communicate freely with high-level specialists. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/a3e/1f8/e2da3e1f8af94c4cb1aae713be9e7861.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Polina Panyukova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe difficulty is that with quality work at conferences (and this necessarily includes every every aspect, ranging from logistics, stand design, searching for speakers to collecting feedback and evaluating the real result), I also want to come up with something useful and interesting for audience.  Of course, after several successful events, after a personal meeting and meeting the participants, it becomes easier. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25a/dfb/191/25adfb1917424ce2b73c52522a48cde3.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Anastasia Tikhomirova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe conferences, of course, differ from each other: sometimes at a good big event, people are positive and there are many of them, but this is not exactly our audience.  For example, we are looking for programmers, coders, and at the event mainly managers, marketers or project team leaders.  Fortunately, this happens infrequently. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b3/0dd/237/8b30dd237d8548149f0be6b876a9294f.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Zvyagin:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúIt is difficult to find the right approaches!  My colleagues and I communicate, we constantly think about what to do so interesting, so that people would come to us and then come back from the conference and tell everyone what a cool conference was, how great it was to communicate and exchange experience.  Some conferences focus on reports.  Reports are good because they also provide information to people, but information can be found on the Internet.  And some conferences focus on communicating with each other in the process.  And we even pattered a little bit, looked at your rich program at conferences - on the one hand, great and many interesting things, and on the other hand - there are very few breaks and it will be difficult for people to talk. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0a/e65/ff1/a0ae65ff196543e1a3fe18afbe32563b.jpg"><br><br><blockquote><h3>  You are not the first to support us, and some time has passed from past projects.  Tell me, is there a tangible result from conference support, or is it all on the air? </h3></blockquote><br><br>  <b><i>Christina Steinberg:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe are taking different steps in order to show in the technical community that we are a company with great experience and knowledge.  I cannot say that the conferences helped us become more recognizable, the awareness of our speakers helped - this is only one of the steps, one of those areas where we move.  For example, we are still in JUG. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdc/307/4e1/bdc3074e1f884649b44594c88d7808e7.jpg"><br><br>  Since last year, we started doing research on the hr-brand and see what changes there are.  True, we started it quite recently, so we cannot say: ‚ÄúHurray!  we won, we did everything right. ‚Äù  We check everything, we look, but it‚Äôs a fact that we didn‚Äôt stop there.  Another fact is that we are going to be among those who come to the conference year after year. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b><i>Polina Panyukova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWhen we first came to Joker last year, we received a huge number of questions,‚Äú and who are you? ‚Äù,‚Äú What are you doing, ‚Äùetc.  I can say that at the event that was last week, very few people asked such questions - people really recognize us, and the communication is already more substantive.  Of course, this is a big plus for the development of the company's brand, we are very pleased with the results, some of those with whom we met at the conference are already working with us :) ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a2/d08/6ed/2a2d086edc9b452dac4457a981489d5e.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Shkredov:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúYes, there is, of course.  People come to the interview, and the conversation begins like this: ‚ÄúI was on DotNext, and you said this and that, and I have since accumulated questions.‚Äù  That is, such feedback goes constantly, and this means that exactly as employers we are celebrated there and then remembered.  Well, not to mention the device to us to work.  Accordingly, having met there, having communicated on some common topics among the speakers, among those who came to the stand, we eventually get people to our team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c32/b8c/9f5/c32b8c9f57ad4d87bcea09c2f5db43b6.jpg"><br><br>  We are an informal company, we have, if we talk about the processes of recruitment, management, marketing, it is in sum different from other companies.  We do not try to do any formal procedure for participation in conferences, therefore our sponsorship participation is organized not by the HR department, but by the developers.  And so we try to talk with programmers about our common problems, in the same language, and it works! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b><i>Kirill Shiryaev:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt have official statistics on whether someone has been hired, although I think that yes (and we have such cases on several occasions).  Because after the conference, it turned out to be quite warm and close communication with those with whom we met at the event.  In general, the fact that we are going to you for the second time is already an indication that the last time everything went as it should. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cae/8c6/8d0/cae8c68d045a474195272bfd14db91a0.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Anastasia Tikhomirova:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúFor us, the conference of the JUG.RU Group team is always hit the bull's eye: we are usually interested in the developers, and we understand that when we come to you, we will meet them.  I am also pleased that every year we see new faces at conferences, there is no feeling of static, although we are also always happy to familiar faces. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b0/4c6/f68/3b04c6f68c204464bedb25b0dc1e1b63.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>Sergey Zvyagin:</i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt deal with huntings or sales, in fact, we don‚Äôt deal with these conferences, basically our goal is to recognize the brand and get feedback.  During the December conference in Moscow, we talked once again with our already custom customers, who were again met, who approached the stand, asked questions.  We got some feedback from them - tried to apply it.  We also talked to people who did not know about us, and now we believe that there is already a well-prepared audience in Moscow who can ask the right questions.  If you go there, people at least recognize us, coming up to the stand of the DevExpress, they know that DevExpress make funds for developers, user controls and tools to improve developer productivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfa/578/d5a/bfa578d5aa6b4c7e82fc3bd8aefc78f0.png"><br><br>  For example, in March we went to Novosibirsk to CodeFest, and there, in principle, people do not know about us, that is, they approached and said: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?  Tell us! ‚ÄùTherefore, from the good, even for these six months that have passed since DotNext, the fact that people are now aware of what we are doing, they already have specific questions, they are ready to ask them on the stands purposefully.‚Äù <br><br>  _________________________________ <br><br>  We hope we have succeeded in opening the veil and allowing you to look at the stands that you see at any conference from a new point of view.  With a new look to see the work of colleagues who gave us an interview, it will be possible very soon - 3-5 June, at the <b><a href="http://fest.jugru.org/">Petersburg Festival of Developers</a></b> (will be held at the Park Inn Pulkovskaya). <br><br>  And to make sure that the sponsors are making cool reports, we suggest you to watch their video: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbQjy0kZzd2Y">Andrey Akinshin, JetBrains</a> , at DotNext 2015 Moscow; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmoHNujaeD2I">Andrei Pangin, Classmates</a> , on Joker 2015; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6kcupzyHXwg">Vladimir Ivanov</a> at Mobius 2015 as an engineer at Kaspersky Lab; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmB4TKsIz5Sk">Dmitry Ivanov, JetBrains</a> , on DotNext 2015 Piter; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJZiQKgx2HJM">Oleg Anastasyev, Classmates,</a> on Joker 2015; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVuqpar3MDmw">Alexey Zinoviev, EPAM</a> , at Mobius 2015; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6diWfNb-yXg">Yuriy Buyanov, Classmates</a> , at Mobius 2015. </li></ul><br>  This is not all videos, the rest are looking on our Youtube channels. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301732/</a></p>
