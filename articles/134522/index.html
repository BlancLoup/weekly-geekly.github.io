But this smartphone, unfortunately (and perhaps fortunately - do not forget about the price!) Is made of aluminum.  It was meant, of course, not the material, but its power and size. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Titan is indeed enclosed in an aluminum shell.  It does not have a back cover in the usual sense of the word, and the gadget is completely inserted into a durable all-metal case with a pair of plastic covers so that the signal passes.  This design is also used in models of Sensation.  In general, it looks and feels super-reliable, but if the gadget should fall down with a glass face down from a sufficient height, I think it will not be good for him, and no Gorilla Glass coating will save him.  The classic cover could fly off, the battery too, and thus the impact energy would dissipate, but here everything is monolithic ...

Better about sensations and ergonomics.  "Titan" is huge and heavy, while it is not bad in the hand, but for some reason it is not very jeans.  Smart is only 9.9 mm thick, but it seems rather plump and pretty pockets bulging.  However, this is not critical for me personally - I‚Äôm quietly carrying the Galaxy S II in my pocket too =) <br><br>  To the touch Titan pleasantly rough.  Such a chance will not slip out of my hand.  All the buttons seem to be ‚Äúin place‚Äù, although with such dimensions, in my opinion, it would be a bit more convenient if the power button was on the left side of the upper end, and not on the right.  For the camera key, a special thank you!  But this is probably not HTC, but Microsoft should be addressed, since these are its requirements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/897/d79/467/897d794679d5da586e5f1f9237d4660c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 8-megapixel camera on the back panel is strongly protruding beyond the body and collects all the dust that it finds.  In addition, I think that with time on the edging of the photo module there will be ugly scuffs - from contact with shelves and tables. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  After the appearance of monsters like the Samsung Galaxy Note, the diagonal of the "Titan" 4.7 "does not seem so big.  But after close examination, it is still so.  Not in an absolute sense, but in a relative.  With a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, it turns out to be a painfully small density of dots per inch, and the graininess is striking.  Someone will say that in many monitors this figure is even lower, but one should not forget that they are usually much farther from the user than smartphones. <br><br>  As for color, brightness and viewing angles, here the S-LCD shows itself from the best side.  The display remains readable in bright light, although the colors are still somewhat ‚Äúfade out‚Äù - in this it is not an AMOLED'am rival. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Titan is based on the Qualcomm MSM8255T chipset with overclocked to 1.5 GHz, graphics Adreno 205 and 512 MB RAM.  The gadget's own memory is 16 GB, but the user can use no more than 12. I think it‚Äôs impossible to expand it, although there are such rumors on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea5/e21/972/ea5e21972a95393436d1de68ca624ee8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you believe the WPBench synthetic dough, this gadget is now one of the most powerful Vindofonov, because  he scores 96.91 points.  In fact, this results in the absence of brakes.  However, windscreens are usually hezzy and do not slow down :) <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Eight megapixels with 28 mm lenses, f / 2.2 aperture and dual LED flash seem to hint that taking pictures with the HTC Titan camera should be good.  And so it is, in general, but with one reservation: not bad for HTC, which for some reason has traditional problems in this sense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fc/574/9eb/3fc5749eb6748763b0fd30d2865f31db.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Take a look at the seven-pizza dude closer!</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/990/839/384990839ca954f9c92acbc80a3927e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Consider the vibrissae for a long time not combed kote!</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b79/79c/019/b7979c01949413f3ad38d880eca81122.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Understand what is happening on the TV!</a></i> <br><br>  With the video the same situation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgUaPUwonNc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhidCn4ZJQD_GJJhfg3rx2LzfSfVdg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  In the case of Windows Phone to talk about some special software on the manufacturer's smartphone is difficult.  Microsoft does not allow to customize the interface, so HTC (and all the others) have to limit themselves to minimal interspersing of their own developments.  HTC has its own section in the Marketplace called HTC Apps, has its own hub with weather, promotions, etc., as well as a small set of pre-installed programs: Notes, Media Manager, Flashlight, Photo Enhancement, HTC Watch and Locations. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  1600 mAh - this could be a lot, if it were not for the big screen and overclocked processor.  On average, the gadget asks to the outlet once a day, which looks very good against the background of most androidophones.  But, for example, the recently tested <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nomobile/blog/133889/">Samsung Omnia W</a> can live up to 30 hours without any problems, so this is not the limit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c19/16d/cbf/c1916dcbf1ae7aaff680373ae90f3b47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  I am plagued by vague doubts ... It seems that smart is beautiful, durable, pleasant to the touch.  He is, after all, powerful as hell knows what!  But for some reason does not cling.  I thought for a long time that I didn‚Äôt like it, and came to the conclusion that it‚Äôs most likely a very large Metro interface.  On smaller diagonals with the same resolution, it looks much nicer, and more comfortable to manage it.  Would I buy for 27 thousand rubles?  I do not know, I would rather give my preference to more compact models with a lower price. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> WP7.5 Mango (7.10.7740.16) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> ARM 1.5 GHz (Qualcomm MSM 8255T) <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512 MB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 16 GB (12 available to user) <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.7 ", S-LCD, 480 x 800 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth 2.1, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> micro USB, 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> 8 megapixels, dual LED flash, autofocus + 1.3 megapixels.  for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1600 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 131.5 x 70.7 x 9.9 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 160 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 26900 rubles </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134522/</a></p>
