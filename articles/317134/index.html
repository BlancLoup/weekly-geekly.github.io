The article contains a complete guide on how to make customer relationships transparent and effective with the help of a data- <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dnoresults">driven</a> marketing management service - <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dnoresults">hopox.com</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From you, as from the customer, it will take only two hours a week for effective management of the performer and Internet marketing.  Under the hood of the method are flexible methodologies (Agile Marketing) and practical marketing (Agile Marketing), but everything comes up against two simple rules: <br><br>  Two rules for managing effective marketing.

      1. It is required from the customer of Internet marketing services two hours once a week at the same time to communicate with the contractor and to <b>coordinate tasks for the next week</b> and only for it. <br><br>  In today's chaotic marketing, it makes no sense to do complex advertising campaigns, we must act with very short iterations, immediately receive the market response and optimize the campaign further.  So, the first rule is regular meetings and many small tasks that can be started and checked in one, maximum two weeks. <br><br>  2. <b>Each task</b> that is agreed upon at the meeting of the customer and the contractor <b>must be linked to changes in specific indicators</b> .  This may be a conversion on the site, the planned number of clients with contextual advertising or retargeting, etc ... It is very important to make assumptions in numbers. <br><br>  However, do not scold the performer, if the assumptions are wrong.  Once again - modern marketing is changing very quickly and what works in one case is unlikely to work in another.  You have to make assumptions in numbers, first, to measure the result after completing tasks, and second, to cut out obviously unsuccessful ideas, thinking about the result in advance.  Third, you will constantly learn from your mistakes. <br><br>  Working in such a simple mode, you will always know what the contractor is doing and where your business is going.  You will keep your finger on the pulse, and spend a minimum of time on it. <br><br>  The attentive reader will notice that the scheme is very similar to Agile Development, where the customer, he is also the Product Owner, is responsible for the direction of product development, is in close contact with the programmer's team, shares responsibility for strategic success and failure.  In Agile Development, the team quickly and efficiently fulfills the will of the customer, and due to the rapid achievement of results and feedback from customers, the customer makes new flexible decisions about the next steps.  Very similar mechanisms are also applicable in marketing, only instead of tasks - smart tasks (or hypotheses) with an indication of the planned result, instead of the programmers department, marketers, and feedback is collected based on changes in customer behavior. <br><br>  Limitations: <br><br><ul><li>  Of course, the customer must have expertise in marketing and in the terminology of Internet marketing; <br><br></li><li>  If a business does not have paying and at the same time happy customers, then this scheme does not always work.  It is much more difficult to formulate the value of a product for customers than to scale an existing success.  In other words, it is an order of magnitude more difficult to travel from zero to one than from one to two. <br><br></li><li>  The presented methodology implies a strong combination of team actions with project analytics systems.  The customer usually has no time to dig into Google Analytics and figure out how the CTR has changed, how much has come and at what price from the channel.  However, the handwritten reports of the performers also do not inspire confidence.  For quick automation Agile &amp; Lean Marketing created hopox. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dnoresults">hopox allows you to quickly implement work based on data and short iterations</a> in a few simple steps. <br><br>  1.
