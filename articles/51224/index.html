But let's say easier.  Marketing - it means to acquaint some interesting people with the work of others, from which all in the end it becomes better to live. <br><br>  Although, regardless of the severity of the definition, marketing appears only as an intermediary between those who do and those who buy.  But even in such a role, things happen that definitely deserve an assessment of ‚Äúworthy‚Äù. <br><br>  These, in my opinion, include the advertising campaign under the slogan ‚ÄúComputer has become personal again‚Äù ( <b>The Computer Is Personal Again</b> ), which HP began in 2006 in conjunction with the advertising agency Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners (GSP).  The active phase of the campaign passed without affecting Russia, but its echoes (for example, this <a href="http://h30418.www3.hp.com/index.jsp%3Fauto_band%3Dx%26rf%3Dsv%26fr_story%3D28e1d5f277b86cd8938ef27c82a004093995d3da">video with the participation of the luxurious Fergie</a> ) are still being heard to us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Its main element (by the way, for the first time in the history of large IT brands, such a large-scale campaign was focused mainly on the Internet) became ... <b>hands</b> .  The very hands that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyjLR29FCjcY">make</a> wonderful things, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRVyofNRyGzA">set</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-K8GYl5-xrM">records</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfsE0g-8CDQo">write</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkDAdTdWMZ5g">music</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOaybo46kMC8">embody</a> fantastic literary worlds on paper and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRWPuPNhtxQE">make the</a> fantasy become almost real on the silver screen.  Yes, and simply our and you hands, with which we create and fulfill our dreams every day.

    <img src="http://hport.ru/photos/sample/images/43358/original.aspx" alt="image"><br>  But let's not talk about high.  In the era of the explosion of new media that make word of mouth to the main media of the 21st century, people no longer believe the snow-white smiles of TV stars broadcasting on screens about the wonderful charms of anything.  And here the brilliant discovery of GSP creatives was born - now we all began to appreciate more the real talent and recognition that a person receives for his real work. <br><br>  In a series of video clips that were laid out on a special site and were on TV in the US, Europe and Asia, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list%3Fp%3D8015F3155CC2A5CA">people</a> like singer Jay Z, America‚Äôs most popular wedding dress designer Vera Wong, tennis player Serena Williams, writer Paolo Coelho, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list%3Fp%3D8015F3155CC2A5CA">told</a> about their affairs director Michel Gondry and others from those who quietly determine how our time looks, sounds and feels.  And the problem of the annoying smile from the TV screen was decided cardinally - the head of a person in the commercials simply does not fit into the frame.  In the foreground, as you have already seen or guessed - hands. <br><br>  And one more thing that united all these celebrities - HP computers help them build and live.  And, by the way, the participation of the stars did not cost us millions of dollars - we can say that they were all shot ‚Äúfor love‚Äù. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing started after!  And this time the scene of action was not film sets and studios of special effects, but at home of ordinary people around the world.  One after another, videos began to appear parodies and imitations of the style and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãadvertising The Computer Is Personal Again.  On YouTube, a whole new movement has gained momentum: now HP computers have ‚Äúadvertised‚Äù <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/JRACk9ttdtA">Steve Jobs</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMmD1U6Gqaco">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMZ8s95e6vR8">Keanu Reeves</a> , who (in the present) certainly nobody paid anything.  And along with them - a lot <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBbcfAnISYhk">of</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfuBDcsFhZKg">students</a> eager for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBbcfAnISYhk">creativity</a> .  And here are the most amusing videos: with the participation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRsDYXhmMKvQ">George W. Bush</a> and residents of the famous ‚Äúblack ghetto‚Äù <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dtz-qVsFSZfg">Highland Park</a> (yes, also ‚ÄúHP‚Äù :) in Detroit ... In fact, there are already tens of these clips - you can easily find them by reference. <br><br>  And you know what I mean?  Yes, it's just that it's cool when for ‚Äú <i>attracting and saving consumers</i> ‚Äù you can just be natural and do funny things :) <br><br>  Come to the <a href="http://hport.ru/">HP corporate blog</a> - HPort.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51224/</a></p>
