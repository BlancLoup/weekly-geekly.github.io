Just because this functionality is present in the software, it is now impossible to run through all the disks according to the file extension template.  But if this happens, the application will not last more than 48 hours in the store. </li><li>  The security service will be able to immediately receive copies of all versions of the malware, and will be able to update the database of fake developer accounts centrally. </li><li>  Now it is not enough just to write and encrypt anything, send it to their common distribution points.  Every time you have to create or buy fake developer accounts with certificates, or buy stolen ones.  There will be a surge of Malvari which changes the source code (there have already been such). </li><li>  When a Linux user wants to install a new program, what does he do most often?  That's right, it goes to the <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/117579/htg-explains-how-software-installation-package-managers-work-on-linux/">repository</a> , and only sometimes to the search engine.  Someday this will be true for Windows users; time and / or skilled marketing will teach you to turn on the Windows store first.  Search programs through the browser will go into the category of exceptions, the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download">Drive-by download</a> attacks will decrease, because  updates have become mandatory for the initial editions. </li><li>  Most of the desktop applications will be transferred to the store.  Crackers will find it harder to do good to people (hello WSService Tokens Extractor), and those who love the joyers will have to be content with only a percentage of the current audience of their bots.  Photoshop, AutoDesk, 3DMax, Visual Studio, Antivirus ... whether their distribution model (attack) will remain the same, the question. </li><li>  Big money pays for upgrades to Windows XP, but ATMs don't last forever, and someday they will be replaced with the OS anyway.  Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, the period of their support will not be infinite, they will still go to Windows 10. </li><li>  But if / when 0day is found, the Windows store will play in the opposite direction, in minutes millions of users will be infected.  Thanks to the automatic update, which will probably be turned off immediately after the attack. </li></ol><br><br>  But look at the analogue, Google Play.  The number of Malvari in it is large, there are some ways to bypass the robot auto check, few people read permissions for programs, people rut their devices themselves, use custom firmware of unknown origin, install applications to bypass the store, etc. It seems that Microsoft in this sense simply redirects attack vector in a more controlled way, the store is not a panacea, but definitely a step forward (and total control over the process, Windows as a service will swallow us entirely). <br><br>  This does not apply to the store, just leave here. <br><br>  In the theme of firmware - "everything is cool there, I myself watched."  There is a <a href="https://youtu.be/pScPkgGGT9Q%3Ft%3D2744">video</a> "Natalya Kasperskaya and Alexey Viktorovich Lukatsky, Cisco Systems FSB".  Even in commercial software, things are not so smooth, in recent years there have been news about backdoors in well-known brands. <br><br>  The first computer virus was created in ~ 1970 (this is not the Morris worm in 1988), and until the 2000s their quality was very high (correct, who wrote them? There was no computer in every home).  As soon as PCs went to mass, the overall level declined on both sides of the monitor, but today's realities gave rise to a new kind of business, with multi-million budgets and the complexity of SharePoint: D.  It has been 45 years, what will happen next is not clear whether all platforms will have their counterparts of shops (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Steam), and third parties (intermediaries between the developer and the owner of the platform) simply have no place to get or something better will appear.  But viruses as a phenomenon are definitely early to retire. <br><br>  For everyone, the ‚Äúgeneral level‚Äù is not 100%, I also read the quarterly and annual reports of anti-virus companies and heard about Carberp with others, even watched <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7heEYEbFim4">License to Kill - Malware Hunting with the Sysinternals Tools - Mark Russinovich (Stuxnet, Flame)</a> , <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/press/news/7900/">PHD</a> reports on how to deal with them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270623/</a></p>
