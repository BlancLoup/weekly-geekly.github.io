  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are Russians Good or Bad?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/russia_forever/46712.html">topic</a> that, they say, in vain we, Russians, so underestimate ourselves. <br>  I agree with the <a href="http://samlowry.habrahabr.ru/">author</a> , but not in everything and there is something to add. <br>  That's what always struck me: we, Russians (and after reading <strong>Igor</strong> Chubais‚Äôs book Solved Russia, I am now convinced that Russian is not nationality, but belonging to Russia, since Russian is an <em>adjective</em> , not a noun ( such as German, American, etc.)) we are too worried about our image in front of the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù. <br>  Those.  many of the problems in our national identity - <a name="habracut"></a>  completely contrived.  And if you want, it is quite a subject for pride.  Now, let's say, what opinion do we have about other nationalities (may the public forgive me mention the word ‚Äúnationality‚Äù)?  Well ... Each nationality is peculiar to something special.  Germans are punctual and meticulous.  The French are gourmets and seemingly special lovers.  The British - hmm ... aristocrats and strategists, probably.  Italians are seemingly emotional and connoisseurs of the beautiful (Ferrari, opera, cabinetmakers, etc.).  So.  A little further.  Hindus?  - hmm ... There is no, perhaps, such a vividly expressed opinion.  Probably, Indians are programmers :-).  They are different.  Some mythical (Kama Sutra, Buddha, the burning of widows on fires).  Chinese?  A lot of them.  But what are they?  Canadians - hmm.  Nothing concrete.  Pupas of the earth (sorry, Americans) - probably arrogant.  Jews?  Oh, this is a song ... From "cunning" to "warlike." <br>  I can see here that, in one way or another, stereotypes about some nationalities are either strongly pronounced or rather vague.  But.  If you try to ‚Äúmeasure‚Äù nationality by the yardstick ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù and ‚Äúrationality‚Äù (not pedantry!), Then there is no definite meaning here.  Moreover, for some reason, it is the Russians who are very worried about what <em>opinion</em> other countries have about them.  Those.  we want to seem good to everyone.  We want to shine with intelligence, politeness and rationality.  We want to amaze with education, good manners and sincerity.  Moreover, if we hear about the indecent behavior of compatriots abroad, then we are <em>ashamed</em> of it. <br>  There were many articles about how <em>we</em> are treated abroad.  And these articles are replete with extremes - then " <em>we</em> walk <em>there</em> in tuxedos and shake everyone with good manners" (less often), then " <em>we get</em> drunk <em>there</em> and behave just like a pig."  It is curious that more or less balanced, without extremes, I did not come across an article.  In the best case, the ‚Äújustifying‚Äù subject matter is when the established opinions are debunked. <br>  Listen, it's much easier.  If you want, there are enough items for pride: the very fact that a part of us is ready to experience strong shame for another, less reasonable part - already says a lot.  I have never heard that, say, the Germans were too worried about the "drunken fights of burghers in the resorts of Turkey."  The ability to feel shame for compatriots is, in my opinion, a measure of humanity.  And modesty is peculiar, as far as I can tell, it is Russian. <br><br><h2>  Sincerity features </h2><br>  By the way, who knows what ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù of Russia?  Alcohol omit it later.  So, the ‚Äúvisiting card‚Äù of Russia is the theater.  Stanislavsky system.  Tolstoy and Dostoevsky.  People who are interested in Russian art are primarily attracted by the depth of spiritual experiences - in literature, in the theater, in music. <br>  So here.  We are <em>different</em> .  And we are <em>different</em> .  And it is also useful to remember that Russia is very large.  This is not some Italian boot.  This devil knows what a hefty piece of land, on which, in principle, there can be a lot of variations of self-awareness and traditions.  Yes, yes, we have traditions.  And if they differ from the traditions of the rest of the world, this is not a problem, but self-identification.  If in Europe it is customary to smile at everyone and indiscriminately, familiar or unfamiliar, and we, they say, dark bears, rarely smile at people - it is not at all because we are uneducated, wild, downtrodden and uncivilized.  And because <em>we have</em> <em>not taken to</em> smile at everyone.  In our self-consciousness, a smile is the first step towards rapprochement with a person, an attempt to move to a more trusting relationship.  It is important.  In Europe, the smile - something on duty, moreover, even mandatory.  See how Europeans pay attention to the fact that we do not smile?  Just for them a smile - almost a duty.  And we, forgive, are not accustomed to considering a sign of sympathy and an attempt to draw closer to distribute left and right to familiar and unfamiliar, pleasant and unpleasant people.  And we are more sincere in this regard.  We smile not according to a generally accepted obligation, but at the call of our soul.  Cut me into pieces, but more ‚Äúmean‚Äù, but sincere Russian smile to me is a thousand times nicer than a protocol European mask.  Sincerity is part of our culture, our traditions and customs.  Why should we be ashamed about this?  It‚Äôs customary to smile where you‚Äôre not, it‚Äôs your own business.  Your traditions.  We do not consider them either good or bad.  Be kind, and you, in turn, respect our traditions.  We smile not only because of gloom, but because we are smiling, we probably allow a person closer to the soul, and therefore do not spread out smiles. <br><br><h2>  About alcohol </h2><br>  It is considered that Russians are pigs, and they only do what they drink.  This is not quite true.  First, not only Russians drink a lot (this is mentioned in the previously mentioned topic).  Secondly, Russia is large, and the people in it are very different.  Personally, I know a lot of people who do not get drunk before the pig squeal, and generally against indecent drunkenness.  Yes, there are reverse examples.  But it is wrong to equate all with one comb. <br>  As for Russian alcoholism in general, there is such an interesting thing.  Sometimes I ask a person: tell me, what are your associations with the words ‚ÄúRussian peasant‚Äù?  The answer very often includes the picture "an unshaven man in a sweatshirt with a glass of vodka."  Then I ask: what about the words ‚ÄúRussian peasant‚Äù?  The answers are more varied, but ... Does the Russian peasant drink?  Most are lost a little and no one responds right away.  And what is interesting is that at least 50% answers ‚Äúno, do not drink‚Äù.  A very interesting thing comes out: in our subconsciousness the Russian peasant was not an alcoholic, and the Russian peasant always drank.  This is how it turns out interesting?  When did the non-drinking Russian peasant drink up before the <em>always-</em> drinking Russian peasant?  Is there a logical defect here?  In general, I conclude only one - the stereotype is very incomprehensible, it is not clear where it came from, and, most likely, either imposed, or made up of false impressions. <br><h2>  Russian image </h2><br>  You know, if you really think that something is bad, then it would be useful to have a picture of ‚Äúas it should.‚Äù  What <em>should be</em> with our, Russian t.zr.  Russian image?  I have plenty of reasons to believe that it should be like this: <br><ul><li> Russian is certainly a very intelligent person who can think outside the box, and often uses this ability.  This does not mean that he will repair the spacecraft with a sledgehammer.  This means that he will invent the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%252C_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Yablochkov</a> arc <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%252C_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">candle</a> where the whole world puzzles over a huge complex machine.  And he will do it calmly, without any particular stress, just stopping and thinking a few minutes.  Then calmly tell others that the decision is simple and obvious.  Surrounding people will begin to gasp, and the Russian, having already forgotten about the invention, will go on to go about their business. </li><li>  Russian is a tricky man.  Where Russians are waiting through an open place, they will pass through the Alps.  Cunning without cheating.  Those.  Russian is cunning, but by no means mean.  And Russian diplomats have always been famous for being able to find a language with anyone.  Because it is very smart and quite cunning.  But not deceivers.  No one in the world could call Russians scoundrels or treacherous men.  Because Russians have honor, and it means a lot to them.  Therefore, they can be cunning, but not deceivers and not scoundrels. </li><li>  Russian is patient.  Russian life is diverse, he was brought up on the works of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, and Russian knows perfectly well that in this life much is possible.  Therefore, he is able to forgive and tolerate some things.  For example, to endure the burger burp, knowing that it is in their traditions, and the most <em>reasonable</em> thing is not to make this scandal. </li><li>  But Russian can be very militant.  When encroach on the fact that it is dear to him.  When insulted him, his country or his loved ones.  All this is too dear to him, too close to his soul, and he will not tolerate abuse of all this. </li><li>  Russian respects other people's traditions, and demands that its own traditions be respected.  You have decided to smile to anyone, not hitting - we have decided not to diminish anyone.  Do not poke me that I supposedly uneducated.  I have other traditions and a different attitude to this world.  And in general, I do not poke.  There are special pronouns ‚Äúyou‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äù in our language, and this division is not in every language.  By the way, ‚Äúyou‚Äù can be said with varying degrees of respect: ‚ÄúHey you, goat‚Äù or ‚Äúyou, father, do not be angry with me.‚Äù  However, the same tricks are possible with ‚Äúyou‚Äù: ‚ÄúYou do not tell me?‚Äù - ‚Äúhow dare you!‚Äù. <br>  The Russian will not ignore other people's customs - ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt go to another monastery with their charter‚Äù, but will also demand respect for their customs. </li><li>  Russian will not break into a cake in order to please others (read foreigners).  He is what he is.  He will abide by the rules of decency adopted in your country, but he does not care if you try to label him ‚Äúson of a bear and balalaika‚Äù.  Although no, do not give a damn.  If you start to insult - he will defend himself.  It will not get into a fight, but will say so thoughtfully and sarcastically that if your brains do not stick together after his answer, then the agility will diminish.  Do not stop to climb - you can get in the face. </li><li>  The concept of emancipation is alien to the Russians.  In Russia, it is customary for a lady to open the door, pay for a lady in a restaurant, and generally treat women differently than men: protecting and nurturing.  Our women consider this the norm.  It is pleasant for our women to be aware of themselves as women, and not ‚Äúvagin-catching Russians‚Äù.  Leave yourself this incomprehensible desire to equalize completely different.  There are men and there are women.  And we are ready to spit in the eye of everyone who thinks otherwise. </li></ul><br>  Wow  Sorry that is long.  It has long been painful just.  The list of distinctive features of Russian men can continue.  I tried to describe this image a little.  In my opinion, there is nothing in it that can be ashamed of.  Moreover, one can be proud in this way.  And the most interesting - there are such people in Russia, there are, and there are many of them.  They just do not bulge.  But most of us will remember two or three acquaintances that look like this portrait.

      And about the fleshy aunts, who in hotels shout to the whole dining room, that she has already taken a turn - this will pass.  We are changing.  Difficulties harden us.  And these excesses will begin to be corrected with time and will not go to my eyes like that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29232/</a></p>
