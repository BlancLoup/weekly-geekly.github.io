  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 modules for Node.js, which is useful to know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Philip Ackerman, the author of the article, the translation of which we are publishing today, says that in recent years, the Node.js platform has become more and more popular.  It is often used to create server-side web applications, as well as to solve other problems arising during software development.  Currently, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> registry, the package manager for Node.js, has more than half a million modules. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/890/801/81a/89080181a4d88d50df7cb9b7bbc6b3c9.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  We present to your attention a review of the modules that the author of the material, a programmer, engaged in, among other things, also web development, finds useful.  Among them are libraries for working with images, tools for checking what users enter into forms, modules for optimizing and minifying data of various types, tools for creating PDF files, for logging and developing command line applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Graphics</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç1.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Work with images</font> </h3><br>  GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick are two popular tools for working with images.  They can be used from JavaScript code thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/aheckmann/gm">gm</a> npm module.  In general, all this allows you to create, edit, combine images.  For example, resizing, cropping, and converting formats. <br><br>  This is how the work with this module looks like.

    <pre><code class="hljs lua">const gm = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'gm'</span></span>); gm(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'/path/to/image.jpg'</span></span>)  .resize(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">500</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">250</span></span>)  .autoOrient()  .<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">write</span></span>(response, <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">error</span></span> =&gt; {});</code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Image processing</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/lovell/sharp">sharp</a> module is based on the incredibly fast libvips image processing library.  In the tasks of compressing images and resizing them, he, as stated on his page, is 4-5 times faster than ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick.  The module supports JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, GIF and SVG formats, it can display images in JPEG, PNG, WebP formats, or as uncompressed source pixel data streams. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç3.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Creating sprite lists</font> </h3><br>  Sprite lists are graphic files that contain many small images (for example, icons).  In our case we are talking about so-called CSS sprites.  They are often used to facilitate the task of loading images, which has a beneficial effect on the speed of page output.  Creating sprite sheets by hand is an ungrateful task.  You can automate this process with the <a href="https://github.com/Ensighten/spritesmith">spritesmith</a> module.  At the input of this module, information about the folder with graphic files is transferred, and it converts all these files into a single sprite list.  In addition, it generates a JSON file with information about the coordinates of each image in the finished sprite list, which can be used in CSS. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Dates, lines, colors</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç4.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Date formatting</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/2c5/6fc/b762c56fca2ca8b610ca57ac4d1b12e5.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Moment.js is a great alternative to the standard Date object.</font></i> <br><br>  The standard JavaScript API has a Date object, designed to work with values ‚Äã‚Äãthat represent the date and time.  However, this object is not particularly convenient in the business of outputting and formatting dates.  In order to simplify the work with the date and time, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/moment/moment">Moment.js</a> library.  It has a clear, well-thought-out interface, and the code that is obtained by using it turns out to be understandable and readable. <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs cs">moment() .<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">add</span></span>(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">7</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'days'</span></span>) .subtract(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'months'</span></span>) .year(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2009</span></span>) .hours(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>) .minutes(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>) .seconds(<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>);</code> </pre> <br>  In addition, there is a plugin for this library, which is used to parse and format dates for different time zones. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç5.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Check string data</font> </h3><br>  If you invite users of your site to fill out a form, do not forget to check the data entered by them.  This is done not only on the client side, but also on the server - in order to filter out the dangerous data sent by the attacker.  The module designed for solving string validation problems, <a href="">validate.js</a> , provides the developer with many useful methods, the purpose of which is clear from their names.  For example, these are <code>isEmail()</code> , <code>isURL()</code> , <code>isMobilePhone()</code> , <code>isCreditCard()</code> .  You can use it both on the server and on the client. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç6.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Work with color values</font> </h3><br>  Converting values ‚Äã‚Äãthat represent colors from one format to another is one of the tasks that the front-end developer occasionally faces.  The <a href="https://www.github.com/bgrins/TinyColor">TinyColor2</a> module simplifies the solution of this problem, it can be used both in the browser and in the Node.js environment.  It gives the programmer a set of methods for converting color values, like <code>toHexString()</code> , <code>toRGBString()</code> , and methods for performing various operations on colors.  Among them are <code>lighten()</code> , <code>saturate()</code> , <code>complement()</code> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Work with data of various formats</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç7.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Create PDFs</font> </h3><br>  If you need to dynamically generate PDF-files - pay attention to the <a href="https://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit">PDFKit</a> module.  It supports embedding in documents of fonts, images and descriptions of vector drawings, either generated programmatically (using an API similar to Canvas), or created in SVG format.  Moreover, it can be used to create hyperlinks, include notes in the files, highlight text and do much more useful things.  Perhaps, if you need something similar, you should start working with PDFKit by studying its <a href="http://pdfkit.org/demo/browser.html">interactive demonstration</a> , which works in a browser. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç8.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">HTML processing</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08e/30e/aaf/08e30eaafaf28c0e033c991c0747f0af.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Cheerio makes it easy to parse HTML files on the server.</font></i> <br><br>  If you were in a situation where you had to parse the HTML file on the server, and you didn‚Äôt have enough jQuery capabilities, then you may well have to look at <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">Cheerio</a> .  Although this module is only an implementation of a subset of jQuery features, it greatly facilitates parsing HTML files on the server.  It is built on the basis of the <a href="https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2">htmlparser2</a> module (this is a parser for HTML, XML and RSS).  In addition, taking into account the results of benchmarks, it is eight times faster than <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom">jsdom</a> , another module that allows you to work with DOM on the server. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç9.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Processing CSV files</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87f/552/250/87f5522501ab10dbaeacd62499f73409.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The node-csv module makes it easy to work with CSV data</font></i> <br><br>  The CSV format (comma-separated value, comma-separated values) is often used to organize the exchange of data presented in tabular form.  For example, Microsoft Excel allows you to export or import data using this format.  The <a href="https://github.com/wdavidw/node-csv">node-csv</a> module simplifies the process of working with CSV-data in JavaScript and provides tools for creating, processing, transforming CSV-files, allows you to convert them into strings.  Its API supports callback functions, threads, and there is its synchronous version, which gives the developer the opportunity to choose exactly what he needs. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç10.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Handling markdown files</font> </h3><br>  Markdown is a popular format for creating materials intended for the web.  If you need to programmatically handle markdown data (that is, for example, you want to create your own markdown editor), take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a> module.  At the entrance, it accepts code in the markdown format, and already renders the HTML code.  At the same time, the tools of this module allow further processing of the resulting HTML code using rendering tools customized by the developer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Optimization and minification of data</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç11.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Optimization and minification of images</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b29/3ca/93b/b293ca93beb3a59b40f36208b1b7ce07.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Imagemin - module for image minimization and optimization</font></i> <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/imagemin/imagemin">Imagemin</a> is an excellent module for minifying and optimizing images.  It can be used from the command line, in the form of a plug-in for gulp or Grunt, you can work with it using the imagemin-app - a GUI application available for all the most common operating systems.  The imagemin architecture is based on plugins.  This indicates the flexibility of this module, and that its ability to support various graphic formats can be expanded. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç12.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">HTML minification</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/791/dea/c97/791deac97a112afc068acc58e71a8f54.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The html-minifier tool can be considered the best existing HTML minifiers</font></i> <br><br>  After optimizing images, you should consider minifying the HTML code of the web application.  This task can be solved by the <a href="https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier">html-minifier</a> module, which can work from the command line, and is also available for gulp and Grunt.  In addition, there are solutions to integrate it into web frameworks such as Koa and Express, as a result, HTML can be minimized right in the process of the server, before sending HTML pages to clients.  According to the benchmark results that are available on the module‚Äôs home page, this is the best existing tool for minifying HTML code. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç13.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">CSS minification</font> </h3><br>  Having minified and optimized HTML code and images sent from the server to clients, it is worth considering the issue of CSS minification.  This task can be solved with a very fast <a href="https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css">clean-css</a> module, which can be used both from the command line and from the JS code.  It supports code maps (source maps), as well as various compatibility modes that allow you to work with the resulting minified CSS in older versions of IE. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç14.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">JavaScript minification</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/537/b4a/934/537b4a9344eb3c1417297ead74c1b485.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The UglifyJS2 module can not only minify JavaScript code, but it does this very well.</font></i> <br><br>  The popular <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2">UglifyJS2</a> module <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2">is</a> often used to minify JS code, but thanks to its code parsing capabilities, it can, in principle, be used to solve a wide range of tasks related to word processing of JavaScript programs.  This module converts JavaScript code into an abstract syntax tree (this is an object model representing the code) and provides a means to bypass this tree.  This module is suitable for those who are thinking about writing their own JavaScript-optimizer. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç15.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">SVG minification</font> </h3><br>  The subject of the minification of SVG data is given at the end of this section, but it is just as important as all that we talked about here.  In the past few years, one can observe the resurgence of this format.  The thing is that browsers support it perfectly, and that there are convenient tools for working with it.  Unfortunately, SVG data generated by editors often contain redundant or useless information such as comments and metadata. <br><br>  In order to remove all unnecessary from SVG-data, you can use the module <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a> .  This module supports the plugin system, here almost every optimization is presented as a separate plugin.  As in the case of other modules designed for minifikatsii, SVGO can be used from the command line, as well as from the JS-code. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Utilities</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç16.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Logging</font> </h3><br>  When you work with complex web applications, then, both during development and in production, a good logging library can be very useful in finding errors that occur during the operation of these applications.  The <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">winston</a> module is very popular in this area.  It supports various ways of working with data, for example, it can output information to the console, write to a file, save to a database (for example, CouchDB, MongoDB or Redis), or even give access to them via HTTP for further processing. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç17.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Creating dummy data</font> </h3><br>  During the development or testing of user interfaces, it is often necessary to have some conditional data, such as email addresses, user names, home addresses, and phone numbers.  Help in solving such problems can library <a href="">faker.js</a> .  It can be used both on the server (as a module for Node.js) and on the client.  This tool provides a set of methods for creating dummy data.  Do you need a username?  Call the <code>faker.internet.userName()</code> method and a randomly generated name at your disposal.  Need a company name?  Refer to the <code>faker.company.companyName()</code> method.  In fact, faker.js is capable of helping to create almost any kind of data. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç18.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Sending emails</font> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9b/9c6/f5e/b9b9c6f5e180d19a408cfd5640ce946a.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Nodemailer supports SSL / STARTTLS and can send messages containing plain text, HTML and images</font></i> <br><br>  In the course of website development, it is often necessary to programmatically send emails.  This is necessary, for example, to send registration confirmations to users, to send notifications about important events, news.  In fact, there are many situations in which we need opportunities to work with e-mails. <br>  The standard Node.js API does not have the means to send emails.  This task can be solved using the <a href="https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer">Nodemailer</a> module.  It supports sending emails that contain plain text, HTML, images, and, most importantly, supports the secure SSL / STARTTLS communication protocol. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç19.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Creating a REST API</font> </h3><br>  REST is the de facto standard used to create web applications that use web services.  Frameworks like Express help in creating such services, but often, ‚Äúon the load‚Äù, the developer gets the means to work with templates and the rendering system, which, depending on the specific situation, may be unclaimed.  In this situation, it is worth looking at the <a href="https://github.com/restify/node-restify">restify</a> module, which focuses exclusively on the development and testing of the REST-API.  Its API is very similar to the Connect middleware (which Express framework is based on), but gives the developer a higher level of control over HTTP interactions and supports DTrace to search for problems with real-time applications. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç20.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Creating command line applications</font> </h3><br>  There are a huge number of command-line applications created by Node.js tools designed to solve a variety of tasks (for example, this refers to the above tools for minifying and optimizing data).  If you are considering creating your own command-line application, look at the <a href="https://github.com/tj/commander.js/">Commander.js</a> package.  Its handy tools allow you to describe various aspects of such applications, among which are commands, options, aliases, reference materials.  It greatly simplifies the process of creating command line applications. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br>  In fact, in this material we covered only a small part of those useful tools that were created for Node.js.  Now JavaScript is incredibly popular, and new npm modules appear literally every week.  If you want to find something interesting on your own, look at the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> homepage, look at the projects that have received the highest ratings from the community, and take a look at <a href="https://github.com/trending/javascript">GitHub</a> in the section on popular repositories. <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b>  If you are busy developing for the Node.js platform, you probably have a list of favorite modules.  Please talk about them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352636/</a></p>
