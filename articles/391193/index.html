    <h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Materials, aerodynamics and new battery</font> </h2><br>  Goodies in the form of a visual positioning system will be left for later, but for now let us consider changes in physical dimensions and flight characteristics. <br><br>  In the 4th version, according to the company's assurances, the aerodynamics of the hull and the overall maneuverability of the device are radically reworked.  The basis of the quadcopter is now made of magnesium alloy, which, together with the new battery and body, made it possible to shift the center of gravity closer to the level of the propellers, and this, in turn, should save the final image from the ‚Äúsudden‚Äù propellers in the frame when the quadrocopter has strong inclinations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e2/a38/4f4/6e2a384f4ceece6bfbf05cdd714c060d.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/1/11134130/dji-phantom-4-drone-autonomous-avoidance-tracking-price-video">The Verge</a></i> <br><br>  The weight of the device compared to the Phantom 3 Pro increased by 100 grams due to the use of a more capacious battery.  Apparently the company found the perfect balance between its capacity, the total weight of the quadcopter and the power of the motors.  The latter, by the way, were also recycled.  The maximum flight speed is now 20 meters per second or 72 km / h.  Motors made as open as possible for better airflow and cooling, which is important given the increased power. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Sensors, Cameras, TapFly, ActiveTrack and that's it</font> </h2><br>  An innovation in the third version of the Phantom series was an optical position control sensor, which debuted at DJI Inspire 1. In essence, it is an ultrasonic sensor and a camera.  Such a bundle made it possible to better maintain the position and fly at low altitudes (up to 3 meters) in places with poor GPS reception. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ea/dad/da6/8eadadda698cb3f90b9c01e1a7c04866.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  In the 4th version of the quadcopter, this system was improved by introducing another camera on the bottom of the quadcopter.  In addition, two cameras were installed in the front of the quadcopter - they are mounted in the chassis.  Thus, a bundle of four camera sensors, a main camera for video recording and an ultrasound sensor form the so-called <b>computer vision</b> .  All the most interesting innovations are tied to this system: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>ActiveTrack</b> <br>  How did the ‚ÄúFollow me‚Äù system work in previous drones?  The quadcopter simply attached to the coordinates of the smartphone and stupidly flew behind it.  Now, thanks to the system mentioned above, the device has learned to "see."  It is enough to indicate on the screen of a person, a car, a boat, anything, a quadrocopter will follow the indicated purpose.  Without any additional transceivers.  Those.  in fact, the drone was taught to recognize and memorize images. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Obstacle Sensing Systems</b> <br>  The obstacle rounding system is based on the same technology, it only follows the obstacles (logical, yeah).  If it is possible to fly around it, the quadcopter will continue to move, otherwise it will slow down and freeze at a safe distance from the obstacle, waiting for further commands from the pilot. <br><br></li><li>  <b>TAPFLY</b> <br>  In fact, it is an improved flight mode by points.  The manufacturer says that ‚Äúmanaging the sticks and maintaining the height, course and speed can be difficult, so TapFly assumes all these responsibilities leaving you to concentrate on the object to be photographed.‚Äù  You simply indicate the direction or object on the screen and the quadrocopter flies following your instructions.  In other words - the replacement of the co-pilot. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Video and photo opportunities</font> </h2><br>  In terms of video filming, the GoPro with its action cameras may soon be catching up.  The main camera in DJI Phantom 4 has been improved again.  In addition to ephemeral improvements in the stability of a three-axis suspension or improved lenses, the camera learned how to shoot SlowMo video (120fps) in FullHD resolution.  Still available is recording in 4K and 30fps with ‚Äúcine‚Äù profiles Cine-D and D-Log.  Videos shot using these profiles are ideal for post-processing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1f/ff1/398/e1fff1398da8ed8d2965a323f23d5cb2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The possibilities of the camera remain the same: it can take pictures in the resolution of 4000x3000, both in JPEG and in RAW (DNG) format.  Exposure range 8 to 1/8000 c.  By the way, the range of ISO (photosensitivity) varies in photo mode from 100 to 1600, and in video the range extends to 3200 units. <br><br>  In addition to all of the above, the propeller attachment mechanism was changed in the new ‚Äúphantom‚Äù, a new flight mode for beginners and a sport mode was added, and a system of automatic flight logging was organized.  Phantom 4 is also endowed with two <abbr title="Inertial measurement unit">IMU</abbr> and compass modules for even more accurate and confident positioning.  But perhaps all this information goes beyond the usual news.  So let's talk about these innovations in a full review. <br><br>  Finally, a sample video from the DJI Phantom 4 camera: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/659O0-UqTtI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzxJVtp4HpfG752kCD00nCNiSxtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The new drone really turned out to be interesting, but its price and availability at the moment leave much to be desired.  So for now, welcome to our store, where even now you can buy a previous version of <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/kvadrokopter-dji-phantom-3-professional-10008167">DJI Phantom 3</a> in various modifications.
