  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do a web studio SaaS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now everyone is talking about SaaS, as a very promising direction which is at the forefront of progress. <br>  Should web-studios take on SaaS and when to start? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b>SaaS solves some of the problems of the</b> current business software distribution model. <br>  Yes, this trend is really new, it is at the forefront of progress, and it appeared in response to problems in the current software distribution model, soft-wrap.  Big problems are solved: <br><ul><li>  Software Deployment Problem.  The user no longer needs to read the system requirements, think about the compatibility of both hardware and software, and consult.  Buy new versions after OS upgrade. </li><li>  The problem of updates and the inconvenience associated with it for the user is being resolved: let us recall the policy of Abobe when a reminder of the desire or unwillingness to update almost every week pops up. </li><li>  The problem of data integrity is solved - everything on the supplier‚Äôs server, in the clouds, is guaranteed to be preserved. </li><li>  Solves the problem of accessibility - geographical. </li><li>  The problem of accessibility is solved - all that is needed is a thin client. </li></ul><br>  But all this does not automatically make SaaS highly profitable.  Here are the same commercial risks, except that the technology is different.  Many for some reason do not separate the technological part from the commercial part. <br></li><li>  <b>Demand</b> <br>  There is a problem with the demand for SaaS in the CIS - there is no need. <br>  Now business creates a larger business environment than competition.  Registration of the documentary part of the business, reporting to government agencies, checks eat up most of the time than the business spends directly on the business.  Therefore, there is no competition what it could be.  SaaS is process oriented ‚Äî optimize, improve, gain competitive advantages by reducing costs, see above.  If your SaaS solves the current business problems, the operational support of the business will be successful.  When the state reduces its control over the business, the business will need SaaS more than ever. <br></li><li>  <b>Features of the SaaS business model</b> <br>  There are features in the development of SaaS projects.  If you have previously worked at an outsourcing or custom development, then this is a complete reversal of the business scheme.  Most of the resources goes into marketing activity.  Huge value gets support.  Reliability and trust are of great importance - this is partially solved by cloud technologies.  The development and implementation of wishes against the background of everything goes by the wayside.  A lot of start-up capital or investment is required, as the return on investment in SaaS is slow, not so much in development.  This is true if the project is done with a goal, a budget allocated by the team.  If the project is a background project, then it will rather die by itself. </li><li>  <b>Mentality</b> <br>  business of the CIS is not yet ready to give "somewhere, someone" commercial data </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Findings. </h5><br>  Now the market in the CIS is not ready for SaaS, only projects that will provide current business problems with their operating activities will be successful.  The SaaS project will not be able to quickly rise and fly, if it is focused on the CIS, this is a long-term perspective.  Making SaaS oriented to a Western customer is possible only if you live there and understand the current problems of their business. </div>
