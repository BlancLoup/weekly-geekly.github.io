Summing up my life activity as an employee, I want to share the experience of communicating with various types of managers for almost 15 years of my career.  I hope that my observations will be useful when choosing tactics of communication with their leaders and at the time of choosing a chief when switching to a particular job. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, I worked as an ordinary employee or middle manager for almost 15 years.  During this time I had 5 chiefs, under the leadership of each of whom I worked for more than six months.  All of them, of course, are worthy of respect and met the primary selection criteria - they were decent, honest, educated, and knew well enough the work they did.  Everyone certainly had something to learn.  Below, I will try to draw collective types of managers with whom I had to work, and I will express my thoughts on how exactly you need to achieve maximum results with one or another type of manager and how to decide which type of manager suits you.

    <h4>  1. "Hillock" </h4><br><br>  A ‚Äúhill‚Äù, or ‚Äúbrigadier‚Äù, is the chief who directs his subordinates according to the principle ‚Äúdo as I am‚Äù, i.e.  on his personal example.  As a rule, a ‚Äúhill‚Äù is the best employee of the team, who was put forward for leadership work for his merits, so he does the work as a fighting unit, he is really the best of all and can always give professional advice on how and what should be done better.  True, his own management skills may be less developed - it is much less interesting for him to control the execution of tasks than to perform himself. <br><br>  A ‚Äúhill‚Äù as a manager is best suited for students starting their careers from scratch, i.e.  those who still do not have their own skills.  If a student works in constant contact with the ‚Äúhill‚Äù, he can, in a short period of time, adopt his skills and approach to business, i.e.  become a professional.  Such a person can then do a common thing for a long time together with the ‚Äúknoll‚Äù mentor.  If a person with well-established methods of work comes to the ‚Äúknoll‚Äù, they may not find a common language because of the difference in these very methods of work. <br><br>  The motivation to work at the ‚Äúhill‚Äù is the following: to get satisfaction from the results of work and / or working process and to be a leader.  Therefore, in order to earn the respect of the ‚Äúhillock‚Äù it is necessary: <br><br>  but.  work with enthusiasm and achieve positive results in work <br>  b.  to work together, to understand something incomprehensible <br>  at.  ask as many questions about the case as possible so that you can learn yourself and give the knoll a sense of its professionalism and coolness <br><br><h4>  "Formalist" </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúFormalist‚Äù is a manager who decides all questions in accordance with the written and unwritten rules and procedures existing in the company.  The "formalist" will never do any work that, in his opinion, goes beyond the limits of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of his unit.  However, for him, any approved work plan is ‚Äúcast in granite,‚Äù and he will demand that you strictly comply with it and strictly ask you, even if you had good reasons for not having time to do something.  For a formalist, the letter of the law often prevails over spirit, or in other words, the rules over common sense, and in time a written report is more important than an invention.  However, in any large company, such formalists should work in certain positions, since  they organize the life of the company and do not allow it to fall apart. <br><br>  The main motivation of the ‚Äúformalist‚Äù is to make everything work according to the instructions and procedures.  The ‚Äúformalist‚Äù is satisfied with his work, when in the report on the work of his department each item ends with the phrase ‚Äúcompleted on time‚Äù <br><br>  It is best for a ‚Äúformalist‚Äù to work for those for whom stability in work is important.  If you fulfill everything that is written in your service instructions and work plans - you can feel behind the ‚Äúformalist‚Äù like a stone wall, and he will promote you as a valuable employee. <br><br><h4>  "Careerist" </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúCareerist‚Äù is a manager whose main motivation in work is promotion through the ranks.  The most important thing for him in his work is to promote the results of the work of his department and himself personally.  Actually the results for it fade into the background.  "Careerist" has a good outlook and has enough intelligence to understand exactly how you can present the results of their activities in the most favorable light.  He is also a very pleasant person and does not hesitate to express his ideas to the top management, due to which he always has positive karma. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCareerist‚Äù as a manager is convenient if you do not have a heightened sense of responsibility and professional pride.  If, in your work, you regularly generate motives for PR, and if you are completely loyal to the ‚Äúcareerist‚Äù and he feels his own person in you, your value in his eyes will increase many times, and you will follow the career ladder ". <br><br><h4>  "Authority" </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúAuthority‚Äù is a leader who cares most about his authority among others.  Usually it is a person in years who once achieved a lot.  He likes to give advice very much and considers himself a great expert on a wide range of issues (and many agree with this, because ‚Äúauthority‚Äù has a certain charisma).  He treats his subordinates paternal or even lordly ‚Äî that is,  likes to encourage them, but at the same time tightly controls them (not only by results, but also by actions) and does not like very much when they get out of his influence. <br><br>  The main motivation in the work of the ‚Äúauthority‚Äù is to feel that it has honor, glory and universal recognition.  If you show signs of recognition to him and do not show your independence, you will have him in favor. <br><br>  Working for ‚Äúauthority‚Äù is good for those who are influenced by his charisma.  Freeloaders who have gained credibility of authority in one way or another (often by flattering), which allows them to live comfortably, also feel well.  on his loaves. <br><br><h4>  "Perfectionist" </h4><br><br>  ‚ÄúPerfectionist‚Äù is a good leader.  This is the opinion you will have in the first months of work with him, when you will be surprised how much he pays attention to you, how often and productively he discusses your current activities, how thoughtfully he reads the documents you have written and what valuable advice he gives by reading them.  However, over time, you will start to bother a little with such attention and want more independence.  In addition, you will notice that such close attention of a manager to the activities of his employees leads to the fact that most of the time you and your colleagues do not work, but discuss how to work.  And even as a result of the product of your unit and it turns out first-class, but it is made so slowly that others have time to go around you on the curve goat. <br><br>  The main motivation in the work of "perfectionist" is to do everything better than anyone.  If you want to win the trust of a ‚Äúperfectionist‚Äù - adopt his style of work, i.e.  do all the work so that he likes it. <br><br>  Working for a ‚Äúperfectionist‚Äù is good for students and, in general, for all those who want to study at work most of the time, not work, as well as people without special ambitions. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I would like to complete this opus with my favorite phrase of Zhvanetsky about the ideal leader: ‚Äúwhen we achieve that the leader, specialist and intellectual will be the same person, we will try to tell us:‚Äú Thank you guys! ‚Äù.‚Äù <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92599/</a></p>
