    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order not to climb every nook and cranny of the global network, I went to google overseas Internet on our subject today.  From what I found, I made a list of, in my opinion, the most interesting and fresh GUI on flash.  Fresh Flash GUI, yes. <br><br>  <strong>What kind of love I valued all this diversity?</strong> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nontriviality of the loadbara (loader). <br>  ‚Ä¢ The unusual method of navigation on the main page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interestingly graphic effects. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Nontriviality of the first screen (input \ language selection, etc.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Freedom of choice - html or flash. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The degree of convenience of the above items.  Of course in my opinion. <br><br>  <strong>1. <a href="http://www.stephaneguillot.com/index_uk.htm">Freelancer Stephane Guillot</a></strong> <br>  First on the list I present a truly impressive site.  It is shown in the form of Stephen's house, according to which we, in the role of him, walk, look in the mailboxes, read the biography in clothes, look at the portfolio in the form of all kinds of motifs on the desktop (on the usual, wooden).  In general, we go through his house, putting his nose where it is not needed.  I was particularly impressed with the musical effects, and the tricks of the character during the return to the main page - believe me, there is something to giggle over. <br><br>  PS: look also at the ‚Äúprofile‚Äù - this is a table with pieces of paper - laugh. <br><br> <a href="http://www.stephaneguillot.com/index_uk.htm"><img title="Freelancer Stephane Guillot" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/1.png" width="500" height="358"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar: a</strong> cute hurricane. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> very unusual, and beautiful. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> impressive. <br>  <strong>First screen:</strong> none. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> also not. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> at the height.  I never found it difficult. <br><br>  <strong>2. <a href="http://www.wysebodywear.com.au/">Wyse</a></strong> <br>  This site is not impressive effects, not its singularity, but very stylish - the site is made with good taste, and it shows in everything.  Unfortunately, he did not impress me as much as Stefan‚Äôs website, but he was also well made.  Unusual navigation on the main page with the mouse (twist-twist), click on the model, look at the information, and beautiful girls in beautiful clothes. <br><br> <a href="http://www.wysebodywear.com.au/"><img title="wyse" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/2.jpg" width="500" height="372"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> very simple and tasty. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> unusual, but inconvenient. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> practically absent, or almost imperceptible. <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> it is not. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no either.  Solid dictatorship. <br>  <strong>Convenience: the</strong> site causes some difficulties, because  quite complicated navigation, in my opinion. <br><br>  <strong>3. <a href="http://www.nagaoka-id.ac.jp/gallery/gallery.html">Nagaoka Institute of Design</a></strong> <br>  Website Design Institute should be impressive.  And this site is proud to cope with the task entrusted to it - non-trivial navigation, an unusual way of providing information, and delicious graphics of students - what else is needed for complete happiness? <br><br> <a href="http://www.nagaoka-id.ac.jp/gallery/gallery.html"><img title="Nagaoka Institute of Design" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/3.jpg" width="500" height="389"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> unusual in that it explains the method of navigating the site, but not enough information about the boot process, which is depressing. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> unusual.  Made in the form of two roulettes, and the associative row between them is student work.  Conveniently. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> they are few, and most importantly, they are in place, which pleases. <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> it is not. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no either. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> undoubtedly convenient, but unusual.  Learning is not necessary. <br><br>  <strong>4. <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/us/">UNIQLO</a></strong> <br>  A somewhat unusual site, according to a model agency, with quite ordinary clothes.  Not even very expensive.  Site navigation is very unpleasant, due to the special horizontal scroll, and the lack of any information about the product - just a picture.  But on the pictures, beautiful girls are a plus :) <br><br> <a href="http://www.uniqlo.com/us/"><img title="UNIQLO" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/4.jpg" width="500" height="399"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> in fact it is not.  Only the inscription "is loading". <br>  <strong>Navigation: in</strong> places usually, and in places not very.  Makes confusion in the mind.  Inconvenient. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> no effects at all. <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> there is, but with a minimum of information. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no. <br><br>  <strong>5. <a href="http://www.instinct.ru/">Instinct</a></strong> <br>  Our guys are not asleep, and may well give odds to many flashers abroad.  In general, only one obsessive thought comes to mind - that the guys from Park Studio smoke, and where can I buy such rubbish? <br><br> <a href="http://www.instinct.ru/"><img title="Instinct" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/5.jpg" width="500" height="399"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> made in the form of beautiful speedometers with an eye. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> very unusual - we have to drop objects into the ‚Äúthresher‚Äù, and information about the work is shown to us.  Interesting, but somewhat unusual. <br>  <strong>Effects: a</strong> bunch of effects, especially animated.  In place. <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> there is. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> somewhat inconvenient, but grabbing the idea is not difficult. <br><br>  <strong>6. <a href="http://www.juliebayard.fr/jb.html">Julie Bayard</a></strong> <br>  This girl is an extremely talented fashion designer, photographer, and graphic artist.  Elegant ideas and thoughts on this site to meet not the problem, but the rule. <br><br> <a href="http://www.juliebayard.fr/jb.html"><img title="Julie bayard" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/6.jpg" width="500" height="389"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> made in the form of gradually loading the work with the movement to the left.  Very unusual. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> intuitive, and quite adequate in this site. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> they are few, and all "in the subject." <br>  <strong>First screen:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no either. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> quite comfortable. <br><br>  <strong>7. <a href="http://www.johnnyslack.com/">Johnny Slack</a></strong> <br><br>  Very stylish, and fashion designer, whose work is exciting, and the implementation of the portfolio is simply impressive.  Everything is so cute, and in its place, that all references can be clicked, and all the work to see. <br><br> <a href="http://www.johnnyslack.com/"><img title="Johnny slack" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/7.jpg" width="500" height="361"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> designed as a loading circle.  It is quite adequate. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> everything is in place, everything is in place. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> quite a bit. <br>  <strong>First screen:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no either. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> very, and very convenient. <br><br>  <strong>8. <a href="http://www.created201.com/">Created 201 Studios</a></strong> <br>  The site is made in the form of a "glamorous" cube, the sides of which are sections.  The whole site is covered with patterns, nice ornaments in the form of a studio logo.  Their work is impressive, and customers even more so. <br><br> <a href="http://www.created201.com/"><img title="Created 201 Studios" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/8.jpg" width="500" height="451"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> Present, and in a rather curious interpretation. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> quite intuitive. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> graphic effects a bit, I would not say that they are "to the point" <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> there is. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> somewhat inconvenient, due to the fact that navigation does not stand out from the overall composition. <br><br>  <strong>9. <a href="http://www.neostream.com/">Neostream</a></strong> <br>  An unusual site for people with the tendencies of sadists who like to beat an incomprehensible creature (in my opinion, a cat with three ears) with a mouse cursor (always dreamed of), and burn the poor man by clicking on the links. <br><br> <a href="http://www.neostream.com/"><img title="Neostream" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/9.jpg" width="500" height="283"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> available, quite intuitive. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> good, no frills, though there are a few drawbacks.  Among them, an incomprehensible menu. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> graphic effects are used in the form of an animation of the creature, and our bullying. <br>  <strong>The first screen:</strong> there is. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> without 100 grams you will not understand. <br><br>  <strong>10. <a href="http://www.whitevoid.com/application.html">WhiteVoid</a></strong> <br>  The site is made in the form of an incomprehensible box (book?) With blue leaves, on which there is information.  Flash uses a variety of 3d effects that are controlled using our precious mouse already. <br><br> <a href="http://www.whitevoid.com/application.html"><img title="WhiteVoid" src="http://www.birzool.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/10.jpg" width="500" height="403"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Loadbar:</strong> available, but not intuitive at all. <br>  <strong>Navigation:</strong> strange, I would say uncomfortable.  For the benefit of 3D did not go. <br>  <strong>Effects:</strong> 3d. <br>  <strong>First screen:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Choice:</strong> no. <br>  <strong>Convenience:</strong> none either. <br><br>  That's all, dear habrachiteli. <br><br>  <strong>PS: each other's groaning is good.</strong>  <strong>We will be good!</strong>  <strong>:)</strong> (I am caring all commentators :)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24077/</a></p>
