  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moving to the cloud: how modern companies use the benefits of IP telephony</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <i>Transition to virtual PBX: statistics, analytics and economic aspects.</i> </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a63/9ed/1df/a639ed1df28a44b4bdb2918c261adc3b.png"></div><br><p>  On the Internet, discussions about the prospects of virtual PBX in Russia do not subside.  Some advocate for their development, others boldly declare the death of analog communication, and business is confusedly looking for the best option.  Why do Russian companies continue to choose virtual PBX, what they are guided by?  We studied everything in detail and are ready to tell you.  Only numbers, only graphics, only hardcore. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  <b>Waiver of analog PBX: numbers and analysis</b> </p><br><p>  Familiar to us traditional systems go.  Analog communications or PRI (standard office ISDN network interface) is being replaced by VoIP. </p><br><p>  <i>For reference: PRI - Primary Rate Interface, First Level Interface.</i>  <i>Determines the order of connecting stations to the channels connecting local and central PBX.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>VoIP - Voice over Internet protocol, Voice over Internet Protocol.</i>  <i>Voice technology in packet switched networks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ISDN - Integrated Services Digital Network, Integrated Services Digital Network.</i>  <i>Allows you to make phone calls and send digital data.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Thanks to this trend, local and virtual PBXs, also called cloud-based ones, are becoming increasingly common.  Virtual PBX is a system in which all the necessary applications are on the servers of the service provider.  In the case of local PBXs, the situation is inverse - all services are located on the servers of the company using the service. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c8/bda/831/2c8bda8315524f20b9322a4c7ed0d2aa.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78e/15a/609/78e15a6092ea4301b95daa59817245d2.png"></div><br><p>  Today, 29% of companies have virtual and local telephone exchanges.  This is 2 times more than the corresponding indicator of aging analog systems.  Statistics say that small and medium-sized companies switch to cloud communications faster due to their greater mobility. </p><br><p>  Among the main advantages that ensured the rise of IP-telephony, it is worth mentioning the possibility to make calls from any place where there is Internet access.  At the same time, any smartphone, tablet or laptop can act as a telephone.  Reducing equipment costs is another significant benefit of cloud communications. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02b/031/18c/02b03118c24e41a2b25762c552bace31.png"></div><br><p>  IP-telephony often helps small companies that do not have a large budget for IT.  In this case, all maintenance and software update costs are borne by the provider.  Another noticeable plus is lower start-up costs for office telephones (compared to local or analog systems). </p><br><p>  <b>Key features of cloud PBX: routing and voice menu</b> </p><br><p>  In the diagram we see the most important and popular functions of the virtual PBX, which determined its success.  Leads the voice menu IVR - a handy tool to reduce the burden on employees.  Next is the automatic distribution of calls - a procedure in which new calls are placed in a queue and sent to the first released employee.  Studies show that more than 60% of consumers will not cooperate with a company that does not have automatic transfer of calls, allowing you not to lose a single call. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e9/160/b7e/9e9160b7ee9344208187c72c0dd1c2e0.png"></div><br><p>  <b>Other important advantages of cloud systems: call forwarding and voice mail</b> </p><br><p>  It can be seen from the graph that call forwarding and voice mail are among the most requested features of voice systems.  In the age of gadgets, the demand for the availability of a mobile application that allows you to use a standard PBX has increased. <br>  The survey also shows the importance of monitoring calls.  This function is most often needed for structures with call-centers - detailed call statistics allows you to adjust the company's marketing policy. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/0a0/24f/00b0a024f1e34a45b9634520046fe25d.png"></div><br><p>  <b>Why does everyone switch to cloud PBX?</b>  <b>Three answers: flexibility, simplicity, functionality</b> </p><br><p>  Against all expectations, among the main reasons for switching to VoIP there was no quality of communication or its cost.  The most important factor was the lack of flexibility, which does not allow you to instantly connect new numbers in the event of enterprise expansion.  Thus, traditional PBXs are not suitable for a company focused on dynamic development.  The second factor that contributed to the transition to cloud PBXs, was the rapid technical wear of analog communication. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/b1c/bdd/089b1cbddfcc4d7398f3bf89c9ac1a07.png"></div><br><p>  <b>Business characteristics of survey participants</b> <br>  All research participants from our sample work in companies with fewer than 50 employees. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/810/79a/07f81079a7a34ff5878dfc42f27eb4c0.png"></div><br><p>  The sample is representative: the statistics correspond to the data on small and medium businesses. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af9/947/d12/af9947d121d5423da931812b37a3cc1b.png"></div><br><p>  As a rule, one telephone line accounts for 1-3 employees. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3c/284/09c/b3c28409c96a4c51b6462eb591d0e1c4.png"></div><br><p>  The survey involved employees of firms from the entire range of B2C services, with a focus on small and medium-sized companies. </p><br><p>  <strong>Conclusion: brief conclusions</strong> </p><br><p>  <u>Cloud PBX in the near future will supplant traditional</u> <br>  More and more companies are opting for cloud PBXs such as <a href="https://youmagic.pro/">YouMagic.Pro</a> to save on system maintenance and support. </p><br><p>  <u>Critical factors - call transfer and availability of mobile applications.</u> <br>  Given the popularity and prevalence of gadgets, the modern system requires functionality, thanks to which employees can use their devices as part of an office PBX.  A considerable number of enterprises switching to YouMagic.Pro virtual PBXs, abandon conventional telephones in favor of tablets, laptops and smartphones. </p><br><p>  <u>Detailed call reports are a noticeable plus of virtual PBXs.</u> <br>  Many companies that use call centers in their work control their employees and investigate purchasing behavior using detailed call reports.  Such firms make a choice in favor of YouMagic.Pro virtual PBXs due to the ease of monitoring and collecting call statistics. </p><br><p>  <u>Scalability is crucial for small and medium enterprises.</u> <br>  One of the main advantages of <a href="https://youmagic.pro/">YouMagic.Pro</a> cloud PBX is the ability to quickly connect new numbers in case of expansion of the company.  Traditional systems, by contrast, do not allow for rapid changes to the system, and are not suitable for companies planning to grow and develop. </p><br><p>  As you can see, the traditional communication time is running out, and more and more companies are switching to IP telephony.  Only virtual PBXs provide easily managed routing and voice menus, call forwarding and voice mail, detailed call reports and recording of each conversation.  Other fundamental benefits that ensured the take-off of IP telephony are the low starting cost of office telephonization and the ability to scale the system in the event of enterprise expansion. </p></div>
