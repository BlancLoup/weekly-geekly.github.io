I always considered myself a sports man, but at some point the doctors diagnosed a double vertebral hernia in the lower back.  I will not say that I was surprised - I felt the discomfort in everyday life for a long time. I decided to stop with the sport that I was engaged in, so as not to aggravate.  For a while I completely refrained from any kind of stress, I went to the doctors, which gave my result - there was an excuse from the army, and 100% honest.  Years later, I think that I'd rather give them a lot of money, rather than receive such a ‚Äúgift‚Äù for life.  The preamble is over, get down to business. <br><br>  I have long wanted to realize my dream and go do iron.  The motive was simple - to strengthen <br>  near-vertebral muscles so that although there are 10 minutes in place without experiencing pain and fatigue.  No sooner said than done.  I found a gym not far from my home (sic! Look for a room with iron, as close as you can to yourself, otherwise you just get stuck ... um, get tired of wasting time and energy on the trip), met the trainer, rushed.  Since I came with a specific goal, the trainer was aware of what direction to give the load.  A lot of time was spent on the back, from the coccyx to the ears ((: <br>  For six months, I wondered why, in addition to exercises on my back, I was forced to do bench press, squats, and so on.  After two years of training (the place of deployment has been changed - both for residence and training, one and a half years without a coach), I can say the following: 
      <br>

      chest press <b>117.5 kg</b> at times (this is equivalent to 80-100 push-ups from the floor without pauses), squatting with a barbell on the shoulders - <b>155 kg</b> at times (right here my back brings, on big scales, the feeling that the spine is now cowards crumble), deadlift from the floor (drumming ...) - <b>185 kg</b> .  Subsequently, undergoing various medical examinations ‚Äî I realized that doctors should not be brought to a heart attack, because some stupidly do not believe that my diagnosis and my result in a burden are compatible and possible.  And for reasons of principle, in those two years, not a gram of protein was drunk, not a single table of creatine was eaten, not to mention other more powerful anabolic steroids / chemosis. <br><br>  Result: my back is stronger than many healthy guys.  I completed my task.  But at the same time I got involved, developed the other muscle groups, got +5 strength of will and character, I never take my eyes off the oncoming gopniks first, I got interesting friends, the girls are delighted (though I don‚Äôt have a goal to pick-up them with bundles, - in view of my sports activities - does not look at other men in the summer / on the beach, etc.) and many more positive things. <br><br>  And now a couple of tips: <br>  1. Training place as close to home as possible. <br>  2. The first six months we pay attention only to the basic exercises: bench press, squats, stand.  Squatting with a barbell will even launch a powerful testosterone production machine, even in the dying place, speed up the metabolism and in general - the growth of both strength and mass starts from the legs, from the bottom, from the squats.  If you do not squat - you are engaged in the hall masturbation.  And it is not even negotiable! <br>  3. When the result in the press is (at the bar), your own weight is 10 times, in squats and in front of the body 1.5 X <br>  your_with X 10 times - you can start paying attention to your biceps and triceps (but what will your <br>  surprise when you find that even without targeted training, this group of muscles is not inferior to what you will see every time at the ‚Äúathletes‚Äù, from the first day of ‚Äúdigging cans‚Äù on the Scott bench) <br>  4. Relief press - a gift of genetics, you will NEVER have the same as on the cover of a glossy magazine. But you can bring your result closer to this.  Moreover, the pledge of a beautiful, relief press consists of 70% of the diet: we completely exclude sugar / salt from the diet, it is forbidden to eat after 7-8 pm, smoked / fried to a minimum, exclude flour, and so on - are you ready for such sacrifices? <br>  5. Muscles with the right load you will always hurt.  And who said it would be easy?  You should not be afraid of this, after some athlete gets used and even begins to enjoy (: <br>  6. From the very beginning, choose what direction you are interested in ‚Äúdragging pieces of iron‚Äù - external volume and hypertrophicity (and you should not be surprised when you are pointed and giggling at you) or inhuman internal strength and psychological hardness (but you can also lift and the girl in her arms to bring home the house). <br><br>  PS If a man wants to be beautiful - it is a bit strange, if a man wants to be strong - this is normal. <br>  PS2 height 186, weight 79-80 kg, one year old photo <br><img src="http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4039/96851796.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  7. Strictly follow the technique of doing the exercises.  How - an experienced comrade in the hall will show the best, in words it is difficult for me to explain what it means to ‚Äúsquat to the parallel‚Äù, ‚Äúkeep your back‚Äù, ‚Äúnot to cure‚Äù (the term meaning putting the legs inside when ‚Äúgetting up‚Äù).  Technique is a PLEDGE of health, immune to injury and harmoniously developed muscles! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67528/</a></p>
