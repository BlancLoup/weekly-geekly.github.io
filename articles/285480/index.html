I have never been inside the agency process, but I‚Äôve been on both sides of the job and sometimes I drink with a familiar agent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What does this look like if you are looking for a job? </h4><br>  Two types of employment are common - permanent (permanent) and contract freelancer (contract).  In any case, will have to deal with agencies.  Agents you could hire to look for a job for you.  No one wants to take on this work, besides the cost of the services of such an agent can not afford an ordinary specialist.

      Experts are looking for jobs themselves.  Jobs look very sample and contain a minimum of information.  It is often difficult to even understand exactly what you have to do. <br><br><h4>  Sample ad </h4><br><blockquote>  <i>C # developer, London, ¬£ 400 per day</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I am looking for a C # developer on a contract basis for my web development client.</i>  <i>You will work on a number of future products to improve their existing systems and sites, as well as for new solutions as they become available.</i>  <i>Requirements:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Great development experience in C #</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- A good understanding of OO design and development</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- ASP.net MVC (2 or 3 are desirable)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- DevExpress desirable</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- nHibernate</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Subversion</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Javascript or jQuery</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This is a 6 month contract in central London.</i>  <i>¬£ 350-400 per day.</i>  <i>If you are looking for a job and are ready to start soon, please send your contacts _agent_name_ to _agents_name_.</i> </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.theitjobboard.co.uk/IT-Job/C-development-C-Programmer-C-ASPNet-MVC-London-400/8487239/en/%3Fsource%3DSearch%26SearchTerms%3DC%2523%26LocationSearchTerms%3DLONDON%26Page%3D1">Original</a> <br><br>  Such announcements dominate the majority.  It is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other.  If you call the agent, he will most likely give you a 10-minute dialogue about the company, from which it will be impossible to learn anything useful. <br><br>  I specifically left a mistake that is present in the original.  "Javascript <b>or</b> JQuery" - this clearly demonstrates that the agent does not understand a damn thing in the area in which it works.  And there is.  Agents are not specialists, very often they do not even speak much English.  Therefore, it is important that during contact you exactly match the list of requirements.  The same in the resume.  Exact match required.  Something is wrong or just a typo and the chopper will have a banquet. <br><br><h4>  What you should pay attention to </h4><br><ul><li>  Wages - the main criterion.  On these wonderful islands, she speaks better than anything about what level a specialist is looking for.  The ad may say in an abstract that a talented C ++ architect is being sought, but ¬£ 20k ‚Äã‚Äãa year will say that a graduate is looking for something that can do C ++. </li><li>  List of requirements - it would be good to understand everything.  If you lack 1-2 practical knowledge, but there is an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it is, you can lie and learn before starting work. </li><li>  Place of work - London is very big, and England is even more.  Trains run frequently and on schedule, you can comfortably ride a bike all year round, but it is still worth sensing the time to travel. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  First contact </h4><br>  Usually sending a resume or call.  Resume is better to write without beautiful, as many use automatic scanning systems.  If the resume came up, the agent will call within 48 hours.  They never called foreign numbers in my practice, but <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/uraven/" class="user_link">uraven</a> was lucky to talk with them being in Ukraine <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140037/">*</a> .  It is also good to have an insurance number and a bank account.  Their presence is evidence of legal stay in the country. <br><br>  After the first contact, the agent will disappear for a couple of days or forever.  If the applicant was deemed worthy, the agent will go all the way these days to arrange an interview.  Further, depending on the company, a specialist may be asked to perform a task or test.  More often on the site, less often invited to the office.  There is no point in deceiving, as the results and decisions will be analyzed in detail at the next interview. <br><br><h4>  Interview </h4><br>  The first interview is the most important.  During it, the specialist meets or speaks by telephone with future colleagues or his potential direct boss.  Usually technical issues are raised and this is the first time when you can find out what the company is, what is it called (until now it‚Äôs hidden!) And what is to be worked on. <br><br>  An interesting fact is that the employer up to this point about the specialist knows only that he is suitable according to the agent and sees the results of the test / task.  You cannot share personal contacts during an interview. <br><br>  All conspiracy due to agent commission.  A year ago, my girlfriend went to the same company twice in three days.  To the same position! <br><br><h4>  Required call </h4><br>  It is very important to call the agent after the visit.  This demonstrates the interest and opportunity to express your opinion about the interview.  If something went wrong and the specialist confused or did not know something, during the call you can assure the agent that these gaps will be filled. <br><br>  Also this call you need to refuse the post.  Unfortunately, agents often praise companies and lie about them in order to attract more specialists. <br><br>  Some companies invite 2-3 times for interviews, which differ little from each other.  For example, during the first interview, someone from the development team was sick or worked from home, but for hiring everyone needs approval.  This is a bad tone and a flaw in planning, but some people neglect them and torture applicants. <br><br><h4>  Sentence </h4><br>  If the specialist likes the position and the employer is interested in it, then an offer is made to the agent.  The agent sends it to the applicant.  It usually sounds short and informative: "¬£ 80k per year, 28 days of paid vacation, bonuses, medical insurance, retirement and travel tickets for the train are possible."  Verbal consent is legally binding, so if there is a suspicion that the proposal will arrive soon better, you should ask a couple of days for reflection.  Bargaining is appropriate, but rarely brings results.  You can refuse medical insurance in favor of some increase in cash income. <br><br><h4>  Why is everything so </h4><br>  I often get asked this question.  I do not know the answer, but I think that this is due to the shortage of developers and the fact that the agent‚Äôs time is cheaper than the technical staff‚Äôs time. <br><br>  Two reservations. <br><ul><li>  On the labor market, there is Google and others like it (in size) with their own agents who do not hide information and are well aware of their field of activity. </li><li>  An agent who has successfully found a specialist for a permanent job gets about 10% - 20% of the annual salary of a specialist in the form of a commission. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285480/</a></p>
