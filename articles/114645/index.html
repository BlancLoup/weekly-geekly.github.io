    <h4>  Arguments Against Routing </h4><br><h5>  You cancel the warranty on the device </h5><br>  If your device is under warranty service and it starts to overheat, or reboot frequently, or any other malfunction is detected, you can return your device for warranty repair or replace it. <br><br>  However, if you rooted your phone (or, for example, if you installed a different version of the Android operating system on your device, as most of those who ruin your device do), you will void your warranty and the device manufacturer will give you a repair failure. if your device needs it. <br><br>  Yes, of course, you will be able to remove all traces of the rutting so that no one can find out whether you performed this operation or not. <br><br><h5>  You can turn your device into a brick </h5><br><br>  If you do not exactly follow the instructions of the rutting, then you can turn your device into a brick - make it completely unusable, so that the device can become nothing more than an expensive, shiny "brick" for you. <br><br>  Routing is not a complicated procedure and can be done in a couple of minutes in a couple of clicks.  As long as you are careful with this procedure, you do not have to worry for anything.  But the potential risk, if you do something wrong, is huge. <br><br><h5>  You will lose OTA updates for your device. </h5><br>  From time to time, your device receives updates for its version of Android: there may be minor bug fixes, or large updates, such as upgrading the version of the operating system from Eclair (Android 2.1) to Froyo (Android 2.2). <br><br>  If you root your device and then try to install any OTA updates, you will lose root access to your device and you will not be able to repeat the root operation again until someone finds a way to get root access for the new updated version of the device. <br><br><h4>  Arguments for rooting </h4><br><h5>  You will have the possibility of a more complete and advanced device configuration. </h5><br>  Routing allows you to install a third-party ROM - a different version of the Android operating system on your device.  For example, it is possible to install the HTC Sense user interface on a Nexus One phone. <br><br>  Some developers offer their own ROM versions, such as <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a> .  Other developers offer their own themes for ROM, which can completely change the look of your Android operating system, how the system works and change other functions.  The basic functions allow you to sufficiently change the operating system for your needs, however, the routing of your device will raise your configuration options to a higher level. <br><br><h5>  You can increase the performance or life of the battery of your device. </h5><br>  Various modifications of the Android operating system have their advantages.  For example, <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod is</a> focused on improving performance, which optimizes your device for as fast and smooth operation as possible.  <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D829734">Oxygen</a> , on the other hand, helps you save the life of your battery. <br><br>  Having received root access to your device, you can independently configure, for example, the frequency of the processor operation of your device with the help of applications such as, for example, <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.mhuang.overclocking%26feature%3Dsearch_result">SetCPU</a> .  It will adjust the frequency of the processor under certain operating conditions, for example, when the discharge of the battery becomes low, or reduce the energy consumption of your device at night, when it is not in use. <br><br><h5>  You will have more opportunities. </h5><br>  You can transfer absolutely any applications to the SD card including their cache, while leaving more space on the phone‚Äôs internal memory.  Also, you can install and work with applications that can take screenshots directly from the current screen of your phone (usually this requires connecting the phone to a computer and using debugging programs) <br><br><h5>  You can put a firewall on your Android device. </h5><br>  When you go online, your phone starts checking for updates, downloading information for applications, updating the weather and using a large amount of Internet traffic.  To prevent this, you can put the Firewall on your phone, for example, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/droidwall/">Droidwall</a> , which will restrict programs from accessing the Internet, which is very useful if you have, for example, high prices for Internet traffic over 3G. <br><br><h4>  The choice is yours </h4><br>  Now you know why you need routing devices running the Android operating system.  Perform this procedure or not is up to you.  And remember - you can lose the warranty on your device after the routing procedure. <br><br><h4>  Small glossary of terms </h4><br>  ROM is an abbreviation of the English words Read Only Memory.  In Russian there is a similar abbreviation - ROM, Permanent Storage. <br><br>  Root (from English root - root; reads "root") is the main account on UNIX systems (it has UID 0 - user ID).  The root user (superuser) has all possible rights in the system, which allows him to execute any commands, change system parameters, etc. <br><br>  OTA - (abbr. From the English. Over-the-air) - Updates directly from your phone </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114645/</a></p>
