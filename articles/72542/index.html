  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 ways to improve communication with customers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is very easy to become <i>impersonal on the</i> Internet.  We hide behind nicknames, <nobr>pseudo-organizations</nobr> , messenger numbers and email addresses.  But at the same time, we still remain alive, sensitive and attached to real communication by people.  And the more impersonal the relationship between us becomes, the less <i>trust</i> and <i>affection</i> remains.  In this case, I'm not just talking about love or friendship.  It also has a strong effect on <nobr>business connections</nobr> , and incorrect positioning will easily turn your ‚Äúwarm and cozy‚Äù brand into a ‚Äúcold and machine-like‚Äù one. <br><br>  I want to advise <b>3 simple ways</b> to make communication with customers on the Internet much more personal.  These proven methods will not only improve your <acronym>PR</acronym> with current customers, but also help you not to scare off new potential buyers. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> thanks, moved to Freelance.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. Studio of one person </h4><br>  Perhaps the most common mistake.  A freelancer is so afraid of appearing frivolous, incompetent, or simply unprepared for a large order that he calls himself a ‚Äústudio‚Äù.  However, he often does not try to hide the fact that he works alone, but the feeling of Importance grows before our eyes.  What, know yourself?  Let's get better! <br><br>  The problem is that a serious client easily recognizes such a scam, and will not order anything.  The problem is that the designer can suddenly receive an order for which he is really not ready, and start nervously looking for outsourcers to help.  The problem is that the client is trying to hang noodles on their ears.  The problem is that the client suddenly begins to communicate with <nobr>some</nobr> organization about which he knows nothing, although he could communicate with a living person who transparently presents his business.  And <i>transparency</i> is one of the keys to success in today's <nobr>business environment</nobr> . <br><br>  The solution to the problem is quite simple - <b>do not show off</b> .  If you are a master of your craft, then no one will look at the fact that you work alone.  No one will care if you have a company or if you have an office in every big city in the world.  All that the customer cares about at the first stage is your abilities and characteristics.  No legal status.  Call your name, make a site named after yourself, write who you are and what you do.  <a href="http://wilsonminer.com/">Wilson Miner</a> , for example, does not hide behind <nobr>pseudo-organizations</nobr> , which did not prevent him from working as a designer for <a href="http://apple.com/">Apple.com</a> . <br><br>  In addition, the client will be interested in your <i>resources</i> as a freelancer.  Show that although by default you are a <nobr>lone wolf</nobr> , your partners are always ready to help and together you will pull out even the largest order.  No partners?  Find them!  But find as a person, not as a ‚Äústudio‚Äù.  Because really close relationships are built between people, not companies. <br><br><h4>  2. Personal contact information </h4><br>  A person writes a letter to your company, enters the address mail@company.ru, but immediately faces several difficult issues: <br>  - Who am I writing to?  How to apply?  "Hello, who can this concern?" <br>  - Will my letter be received?  Or will it be lost in a hundred others? <br>  - Will they answer me?  And if they don't answer, then who is to blame? <br>  - Are there any people or a UFO? <br>  We used to talk to people.  Sending a letter to an impersonal address, we feel like a man with closed eyes, talking in an unknown room.  He does not know if there is <nobr>anyone</nobr> else in this room, whether they hear him, whether they will answer.  The same with email.  by mail.  You are required to show at least that you are still in this room - a listening, answering person. <br><br>  Specify in the address to whom the letter will go.  Write the name of the person who will receive it next to the address.  Write, for what reason is to write at this address.  And people will reach out to you :-).  But you should not forget about one impersonal email.  It is like a lifeline for those who do not know which department to turn to.  It is <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/studio/location/">used</a> quite well in the studio of Artemy Lebedev. <br><br><h4>  3. Do not let nicks replace their name </h4><br>  Many people use nicknames on the Internet.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  But we must always distinguish between the nickname and real name.  Most often in communication with customers it is better to use your first and last name.  Of course, <a href="http://twitter.com/APlusK">APlusK</a> sounds cool, but Ashton Kutcher will still be written in the credits.  Let me remind you that we are used to communicate not with robots, but with people.  We are so comfortable and convenient.  About nicknames like "Tooth-eyed Thistle" in general, forget.  Behave like professionals, and you will be thought of as professionals.  And if you behave like children, then the income will be measured with candy. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  So, quite simply and without further ado, you can make communication with customers much more personal, which creates both trust, affection and relationships in general.  Remember, companies can be partners, but no more.  And only people can be friends.  Make the customer a <i>friend</i> , and he will not order from anyone else. <br><br>  <a href="http://abasov.net/publ/branding/3_sposoba_uluchshit_obshhenie_s_klientami/9-1-0-10">Cross post</a> from my blog.
