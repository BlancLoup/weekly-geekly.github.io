  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IFA 2013: action cameras</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year, by chance, I was able to visit the exhibition IFA 2013 - the second largest thematic IT exhibition in Germany and one of the four largest (CES, CeBIT, Computex, IFA) in the world.  There are a lot of impressions, even more photos and thoughts.  And I decided to start the review of the new IFA 2013 with action cameras, to which my colleagues pay a lot of attention in their posts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/485/970/678/48597067869b6ef4ba5075afecbd3631.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  They started talking about action cameras relatively recently, but these devices are rapidly gaining popularity.  High demand creates a corresponding offer: almost every company, one way or another connected with the release of IT-products, seeks to replenish the range of "sports" camera.  And if a year or two ago, only the devices of American Woodman Labs, the very same GoPro, were heard, now there are many analogues on the market.  IFA 2013 only witnessed the fact that action cameras are interesting not only for local B-brands (ie German), but also well-known global companies.  With them, and start a review of new products. <br><br><h5>  Jvc </h5><br>  Visiting the JVC KENWOOD booth, I never thought that I would stumble upon an action camera.  But it happened.  As it turned out later, the company already has two ‚Äúextreme cameras‚Äù (as the manufacturer calls them), selected in the ADIXXION series: GC-XA1 saw the light earlier, but the company demonstrated a novelty at IFA - GC-XA2.  The world premiere of this action camera took place a little more than two months ago - July 9th.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/577/8bc/c6c/5778bcc6c6dceb83066f9ee23c4c16ac.jpg"><br><br>  ADIXXION is a branch of the JVC camcorder line, and this is easily guessed in appearance by the GC-XA1 and GC-XA2.  Looking ahead, I‚Äôm going to say that Sony went the same way: its action camera also looks like a small video camera.  It seems to me, by doing so, i.  not ‚Äúbothering‚Äù with the appearance of both JVC and Sony are losing: I saw several people approach the stand saying something like ‚ÄúThese are their regular video cameras‚Äù and left.  Even the mannequin standing by the yard was not embarrassed.  At the same time, the gaze clings to the original devices like the GoPro, be healthy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cc7/3f0/bb5/cc73f0bb51025abeef9a0a70f39c670b.jpg"><br><br>  I must say that there is nothing particularly outstanding in the characteristics of the GC-XA2.  The protected case allows you to dive with a camera into water to a depth of 5 m, to work with it at temperatures up to -10 degrees Celsius.  Also, protection against dust and drops from a height of 2 m is declared. Is this anyone you surprise now?  But the presence of a built-in color display with a diagonal of 1.5 inches is a definite plus. <br>  Of course, GC-XA2 is equipped with a built-in battery, allows you to record Full HD video, compatible with SDXC cards.  There is support for Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6ce/0b0/318/6ce0b0318af89942d08b1fa402640f3c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6e6/30d/bc7/6e630dbc76e4cb6d475bf38db9e014a8.jpg"><br><br>  It differs from its predecessor GC-XA2 with a better matrix (8 Mp BSI CMOS versus the usual 5 Mp CMOS), a different equivalent focal length (20.5 mm against 25.4 mm) and a different aperture (F / 2.4 against F / 2.8) of the lens.  Interestingly, the viewing angle has also changed: if in the case of the GC-XA1 it is 170 degrees, in the case of the GC-XA2 it is already 160 degrees. <br>  I note that the quality of the JVC GC-XA2 is simply excellent.  The camera may not be too well cut, but it is stitched tightly together.  The abundance of metal in the design inspires confidence that the JVC GC-XA2 is really thoroughly prepared for situations for which action cameras are mainly purchased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/add/ff1/f12/addff1f12c9cbdab344a4a5bf2dbe2fc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6bf/571/627/6bf5716270c27975a4d127a6b62d4818.jpg"><br><br>  European prices JVC GC-XA2 - about 300 euros. <br><br><h5>  Sony </h5><br>  At the IFA 2013, the world premiere of the HDR-AS30V / B action camera took place, which was noticeably better than the previous model - the HDR-AS15 / B.  If the most remarkable feature of the old model was Wi-Fi support, the new one ‚Äúadds‚Äù to this also NFC and GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/575/010/09d/57501009d56f448ad15b5155e94c8be1.jpg"><br><br>  Interestingly, the HDR-AS30V / B is equipped with the same lens and the same matrix used in the HDR-AS15 / B model.  Those.  if the same JVC has improved the characteristics of the new model, then Sony considered that "the former will fit."  In principle, Sony can be understood, because the HDR-AS30V / B uses a BSI CMOS format of 1 / 2.3 inch impressive resolution of 11.9 megapixels and a Carl Zeiss Tessar lens with a maximum aperture of F / 2.8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6cd/9b6/f39/6cd9b6f39a88236dc4f6d791bf93187b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bf9/f05/3b0/bf9f053b0bf4cd59caad0484dae62007.jpg"><br><br>  HDR-AS30V / B, unlike its predecessor, is compatible with SDXC memory cards - that‚Äôs good, but that‚Äôs bad, that for the sake of better sound (there are now two microphones) and ease of control, the included diving box is not designed for diving 5 meters.  For comparison, the HDR-AS15 / B with its box could withstand 60-meter dives. ... In general, there is nothing critical in this, hardly any of the ordinary users will dive so deeply, but I think that The protective capabilities of action cameras from model to model should only be improved, even if not by much. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the hands of‚Äù Sony HDR-AS30V / B, I didn‚Äôt like it: the finishing materials seemed to be of high quality, but it doesn‚Äôt give that sense of security that JVC GC-XA2 has. <br><br>  As far as I know, Sony HDR-AS30V / B in Russia will start in October, and its value will be either the same 12,990 rubles, which is now being asked for for HDR-AS15 / B, or will be higher. <br><br><h5>  Rollei </h5><br>  Rollei, a company well-known in Germany, performed very powerfully in the segment of action cameras.  Actually, almost all of its exposition was devoted to these devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/57a/460/60b/57a46060b5d3032f7a4f6e4b6993aba1.jpg"><br><br>  Rollei now has about ten different action cameras, different in shape, size and even color!  A catalog of accessories for models 3S, 4S, 5S, 5S WiFi, S-50 WiFi has 26 items: from banal stickers 3M on the helmet and additional batteries to special mounting on the surfboard and magnetic pad!  Neither Sony nor JVC can boast such a variety of fixtures.  In general, I had the feeling that the products of second-tier companies have more functions and greater opportunities at naturally lower prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/339/95e/7d0/33995e7d0a16bd2f2adc7777924f0b23.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/757/680/9af/7576809af77e8d2300aed994d47b6e4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f20/8c9/3b5/f208c93b5edcf186e268a1035fb214a9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/12f/517/044/12f517044cf0dc398b0f3bd9ffd51dbc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/330/111/98b/33011198b202dd4591c506beea100c56.jpg"><br><br>  I will not list all the camera models shown by Rollei, I‚Äôll briefly discuss only a couple. <br><br>  Very interesting specimens - Sunglasses Cam 100 and Cam 200. In fact, these are sunglasses with an integrated camera, aimed primarily at motorcyclists.  "Points" are equipped with a 5-megapixel matrix, allow you to record Full-HD video and stereo sound.  The handles have a microSD card slot and a battery that provides the device with up to an hour of autonomous work.  They only upset unimportant viewing angles: only 63 degrees in the Cam 100 model and 135 degrees in the Cam 200 model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/46d/c3c/b71/46dc3cb713a7feb261431af77c0e8441.jpg"><br><br>  Rollei Youngster is focused mainly on young people, who - and this is totally in Europe - prefer to move around the city on a bicycle.  Characteristics average (720p video recording, viewing angle of 135 degrees, 2-inch screen, protective box included), but the price is low and there are several body colors. <br><br>  In general, I must say that bright colors or interchangeable panels are a new trend in action cameras.  The second-tier manufacturers are well aware of how great the demand is, and they are trying to offer the user maximum opportunities, including customization of appearance.  For example, the new fall, Rollei S-50 WiFi, comes with three sockets: black, blue and yellow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2c1/bdb/182/2c1bdb182291446f083d705c03dd961e.jpg"><br><br>  The S-50 WiFi model is the flagship Rollei action camera, which can be judged by the characteristics: a 14 megapixel matrix, a box that provides immersion to a depth of 60 m, a glass lens, and an extended operating temperature - from +60 to -20 degrees Celsius, viewing angle of 175 degrees, 2-inch screen, the ability to control from a smartphone via Wi-Fi.  The set of this camera, in addition to replaceable, panels includes two batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/443/8ad/d11/4438add114674388c8803a4824ad3614.jpg"><br><br>  It seems to me that the Rollei example is the most significant example of how popular action cameras are and ... how far you can go in wanting to satisfy the explosive demand for these devices among consumers.  It‚Äôs one thing when a company produces about a dozen models of smartphones ‚Äî that‚Äôs understandable; it‚Äôs quite another to try to sell ten different action cameras.  In my opinion, this is a bust. <br><br>  By the way, if desired, and the presence of 8 170 euros at the stand of Rollei you could buy a cross-country bike Suzuki RM-Z450.  With me, no visitor even approached him, but there were plenty of curious about action cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2a5/103/75d/2a510375dbdfa4edfd8247e0c1bd54a3.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Nilox </h5><br>  I have never heard of the action cameras of this company, meanwhile, the Italians are quite famous both in their homeland and in Europe.  Nilox officially collaborates with several well-known Italian athletes, as well as the FIM SBK Superbike motorcycle racing series and the Ducati motorcycle company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ae9/e96/494/ae9e96494663faadab9b049a7f2c56af.jpg"><br><br>  There are six action cameras in the Nilox range: Foolish (is it a funny name?), Foolish Special, Foolish Ducati, F-60, Mini and Tube.  The chip of almost all Nilox action cameras is a detachable display.  I have already seen this solution in a number of developments of other companies.  Some more models are equipped with a laser pointer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0d5/d20/bc2/0d5d20bc248286bebf674b609c887daf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/325/581/af7/325581af74a3bd268e525f13fe0aa697.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5a8/f48/2d8/5a8f482d8cbf3ca66cefa41cf1101268.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e6f/7a3/250/e6f7a3250b48ef06423b648a982ea1a7.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer positions the cameras as very easy to use: clicked on one button - received a photo, clicked on another - video recording began.  From the point of view of the characteristics of the device Nilox is not particularly stand out: Full-HD video and the angle of 175 degrees is easy to find in many other products. <br><br>  Nilox promotes not only action cameras, but also a number of other devices for specialized use.  For example, in the photo below, the young lady shows off the charms ... SwimSonic - waterproof MP3 player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/edc/b68/d58/edcb68d58e1d998e9929624041a44dce.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Instead of output </h5><br>  I could not get around the entire exhibition even for a few days, so it is very likely that many of the original designs did not get into my focus.  Nevertheless, the examples above illustrate perfectly the trend indicated in the introduction: action cameras are interesting to the consumer, and companies of various ranks can try to satisfy demand.  And I prefer the development of small companies, they tend to be much more interesting and diverse.  I'm not talking about features and price. <br><br>  I note that next week my colleague <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alex_smartgadget/" class="user_link">Alex_SmartGadget</a> is going to publish a comparative review, in which he intends to carry out a comparative analysis of GoPro 3 White Edition with iON Air Pro Wi-Fi from the perspective of an ordinary consumer.  Both models are about the same (about 10 thousand rubles), while the latter is positioned as a direct competitor and more affordable alternative to the younger GoPro camera, at least due to a wider configuration.  What will come of this - will soon find out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4c2/66d/554/4c266d554537222f9b964d5fde8b783a.jpg"><br><br>  This is the end of the material on action cameras, but this week I will try to post the first part of a large review of the mobile novelties of the IFA 2013. With detailed photos and tests of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone and Toshiba Excite Pro tablet on the NVIDIA Tegra 4 platform, as well as detailed preview hours Samsung Galaxy Gear.  As they say, do not switch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194118/</a></p>
