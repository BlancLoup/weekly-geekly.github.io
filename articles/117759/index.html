      Analyzing the features of usability of computer games, it is necessary to take into account the specifics of the gaming experience.  The following are the most important features of the gaming software for the user: <br><br>  <b>Ease of use</b> <br><br>  This criterion is one of the decisive in evaluating users of any computer program.  In the case of games, simplicity is very closely related to ease of mastery.  We should not forget about the understandability of the interface, as well as the ease of use of peripheral devices. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Beginning of the game </td><td>  The menu, which is used to launch the game, should be given special attention.  The developer must be confident that: <br>  -User received comprehensive information about the possibilities of the game; <br>  - after acquaintance with the menu, the user can control the game process without problems </td></tr><tr><td>  Learning levels </td><td>  If the game includes educational levels, then they must be an organic part of it.  They must meet the following requirements: <br>  - not to be both too difficult and too easy; <br>  - after passing the training levels, the user should be willing to continue playing </td></tr><tr><td>  Game interface </td><td>  Its task is to provide feedback to the user, as well as the implementation of certain actions.  For game interfaces, the same requirements apply as for any software interface. </td></tr><tr><td>  Game control using peripherals </td><td>  Control of any peripherals should be carried out "on the machine".  The choice of buttons and their functions should be made solely by the convenience of the user. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Elements that are not related to the game itself should not distract the user from the gameplay.  Menu, saving levels, etc. - all this should be extremely simple and not take most of the user's attention.  However, in some cases it is necessary to be guided not so much by the criteria of convenience as aesthetics.  Visually attractive interface, animation, performing exclusively decorative functions, unusual design of the menu - all this can contribute to immersion, dragging the user into the game and thereby increase the degree of satisfaction. <br><br>  <b>Rhythm game</b> <br><br>  Here we are talking about everything that contributes to the "tightening" of the user in the gameplay, and in the first place - about interactivity and about the plot of the game. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Interactivity </td><td>  The meaning of interactivity is to create user confidence that he controls the whole game process. </td></tr><tr><td>  Plot </td><td>  A well thought out plot allows you to increase the degree of user integration in the gameplay.  The relationship between the characters of the game and the user, as well as their semantic context, are in this case the main factors. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <b>Degree of difficulty of the game</b> <br><br>  The degree of difficulty of the game is one of the important factors determining its success.  The game process should be organized in such a way that the tasks arising before the user are complex enough and that their decision process itself is pleasant and interesting for the user.  The difficulty level of the game must match the level of user competence. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Complexity </td><td>  The level of difficulty of the game must be determined primarily by the level of competence of the user.  As the user masters the specifics of the game, the tasks should become more complex and solvable. </td></tr><tr><td>  Task type </td><td>  The type of tasks to be solved is also very important: for example, in car racing the user should not guess which way the car will turn after pressing a button, but learn how to drive.  The specificity of the game tasks should correspond to the general context of the game and meet the user's expectations. </td></tr><tr><td>  Compensation option </td><td>  The user of the game application, unlike the office software user, is a motivated researcher.  Often, a lot of time and effort is spent on solving a task.  The organization of the game process should include the possibility of compensating efforts aimed at overcoming difficulties. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The criteria listed above are based on the recommendations of the Microsoft gaming testing team.  Accounting for these criteria can significantly improve the game and bring it as close as possible to the user's expectations. <br><br>  <b>Development of ergonomic criteria for gaming software</b> <br><br>  It is clear that other criteria should be applied to games, rather than to other applications.  They must be adapted to the specific product.  For example, the criterion for the possibility of explicit control, the meaning of which is that the user must have the ability to fully control the system (all changes to the system must be determined solely by the user's requests) can hardly be applied to games.  In most games, artificial intelligence is a full-fledged participant in the gameplay, and it would be absurd to provide the user with the ability to control it at will. <br>  Specificity of ergonomic criteria for gaming software can be considered on the example of real-time game-strategies: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Criterion </th><th>  Description </th><th>  Is this criterion taken into account? </th></tr><tr><td>  "Transparency" of action </td><td>  The computer acts as an opponent, performs numerous actions on which the user can not have any influence </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  User control </td><td>  The user must control all actions that he initiates (for example, the construction of a building) </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Information density </td><td>  During the game, the amount of memorized and digestible information is important.  The ability to assimilate and systematize this information is a criterion for distinguishing between beginners and advanced players. </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Minimum operations / flexibility </td><td>  The number of actions required for the implementation of the basic game operation should be minimized.  The user should be able to customize the interface for themselves to build their own strategy. </td><td>  Yes </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Ergonomic criteria should be rethought with reference to computer games.  When developing ergonomic requirements, you must also take into account the game genre.  Of course, the expectations of game users are in many ways different from the expectations of office software users, but in both cases, taking into account these expectations is necessary to achieve the same goal - ensuring maximum satisfaction from working with the program. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117759/</a></p>
