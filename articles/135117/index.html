  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spam in November 2011: New Year crept in unnoticed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Christmas fever is in full swing.  All signs of the approaching main holiday of the year are evident: endless traffic jams, cone-shaped Christmas trees, festive illumination, queues, discounts, lengthening delivery times in online stores, New Year's spam ... <br><br>  Eating sweet tangerines and watching the long-awaited drifts grow outside the window, we decided not to reinvent the wheel, but to please the residents of Habr with a new year's selection of spam messages. <br>  Let's begin, perhaps, with the most touching New Year's divorce for the money of 2011.  A certain guy with the nickname Rusel complained to the entire Runet in the beginning of November that he had quarreled with the lady of his heart.  The young man sees the only way to truce in the purchase of a costly gift for a girl on NG, the money for which he claims from users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/325/1a7/528/3251a75280948f9ddb7310397d1bb780.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Interestingly, his WebMoney ID received a complaint from another user of the service.  The complaint was capacious, consisted of the quotation of the opus presented above and biting ‚ÄúGo work!‚Äù.  Rusel immediately replied that he was already working, and that it was "just a cry for the world."  Apparently, it does not work well, since you have to throw such ‚Äúscreams‚Äù. <br><br>  Next we talk about New Year's gifts.  There certainly will not do without the main "donator" - Santa Claus - what could be the New Year's collection without a cheerful old man in red?  True, this copy looks more like a bourgeois Santa Claus, who also came to the child, who behaved badly in the outgoing year, but his call for urgently buying souvenirs does not become less convincing: <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4425/126183829.1/0_702b1_aa7da3b7_XL.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such a severe grandfather, of course, is very difficult to refuse.  Even if he offers to buy some meaningless and merciless trash.  For example, the fish on the radio.  Perhaps someone reading now choked on tea or coffee, deciding that we were completely crazy here =) And someone may have even seen this fish.  This is such a big balloon in the shape of a fish.  This ball is equipped (and I want to write a ‚Äúpropeller‚Äù =)) with a kind of motor.  This "motor" is just a radio-controlled part of the design.  Spammers sell this miracle of technology for almost two thousand rubles.  Not sour for a balloon =) <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/2/126183829.1/0_702b2_287b99a3_XL.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, our New Year's collection will not do without spam, offering services for organizing a New Year's celebration.  We receive such messages annually.  Most of them are of the same type and do not shine with originality.  This year, however, one newsletter managed to hit our imagination.  Spend an evening in a pleasant company offers tavern "Butyrka."  It is not surprising that an institution with such a name chose such a controversial way of advertising.  They even "billboard" attached to the letter, issued accordingly.  Especially delivers the barbed wire, which stretches along the bottom side of the image.  Spammers seem to anticipate what awaits them if they continue in the same vein. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4526/126183829.1/0_702b3_820f7e9a_L.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, as a lyrical omission, I note that in mid-December, another holiday passed completely unnoticed behind all this New Year's bustle: the 75th anniversary of the industrial cultivation of medical leeches!  This wonderful holiday came on December 16th, and everyone would have forgotten about it if it were not for the valiant spammers who bother to remind him of Runet! <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4/126183829.1/0_702b4_27161ce_XL.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In November, spam, one way or another exploiting the theme of the New Year or Christmas, amounted to about 3.5% of all junk emails.  It is too early to sum up the results of December, but, based on past experience, it is safe to say that the proportion of New Year's spam this month will be no less than 10%. <br>  November spam - we, of course, have already summarized the results.  You can get acquainted with them <a href="http://www.securelist.com/ru/analysis/208050730/Spam_v_noyabre_2011_goda">by the link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135117/</a></p>
