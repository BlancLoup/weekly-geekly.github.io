  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Information chaos</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The purpose of this post is to make us think about the existing ‚Äúvarieties‚Äù of information surrounding us, about its perception and about the abundance of errors, many of which are firmly entrenched in society.  As will be explained below, much of what has been said is my subjective opinion, developed on the facts I have seen, inconsistencies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Links to many of the sources and resources mentioned can be found at the end of the article; I did not specifically publish them in the course of the presentation, so that the read more or less had time to lie down and only then could it be interrupted to view additional materials. <br><br><h4>  Antinauka </h4><br>  And how many of you wondered, is the official scientific theory so unshakable? <br><br>  For example, there is a forum at one Russian resource, at this forum people gather and actively discuss various inventions.  The main themes: free energy, anti-gravity and so on.  So, at this forum among the discussion of the real and unreal inventions of Nikola Tesla, anti-gravity platforms of unknown origin, there is an active discussion of the design of the perpetual motion machine of a certain Georgian.  The discussion has already stretched to a good hundred pages (according to the last check at 2010.04.30, there are already 192 pages) and more than 10 interlocutors participate in it.  On a single video from YouTube, for some fragmentary phrases and distorted facts from the life of Nikola Tesla, using completely fantastic scientific terms, laws and types of fields, they try to conclude how this thing works.  Some intricate assumptions are built, some shemkies are drawn (structural and principal), diagrams, and sometimes even the question: ‚ÄúWell, did you try?‚Äù.  In general, every day, the participants sit and exaggerate this topic.

      I looked through the diagonally for an hour, hoping to see at least one sensible person who would remind the audience about the 2 basic laws of thermodynamics.  Tolley there is a hard moderation against "dissidents" (ie, adherents of more or less classical science), all the classics who enter are in shock from what they see to such an extent that they quietly molt from there, or they simply don‚Äôt see any reason to go into this world miracles, located, apparently, in a parallel universe. <br><br>  Probably correctly, someone of my friends spoke on this phenomenon: "People love to dream very much."  This explains all the discussions on the forum.  It is also worth noting that none of the participants (in any case, the majority of its inhabitants) are engaged in construction, does not set up experiments, but everyone sees their own uniqueness, their own Tesla genius, their experimental talents, but for some reason not done. <br><br>  I would like to quote one amazing entrepreneur (yes, an entrepreneur, even more likely a fraudster, although he himself has been a scholar for many years) Petrik: ‚ÄúDo not try to understand anything!  Understand - not real!  And as soon as you will attract knowledge, there will be a flash in the hole &lt;...&gt; there will be nothing! ‚Äù.  Personality, by the way, deserves special attention, especially because it has connections with high-ranking officials, and the RAS has almost equated all its activities with pseudoscience (which is not surprising, because in the presented quotation he clearly described the principle of operation of all tricks: Miracle, we begin to understand and immediately find a catch).  In his speeches, he states that his inventions are already being introduced everywhere or have already been introduced in Europe and even the States, although if you look at it, he does not even have publications in foreign scientific journals. <br><br>  There is a beautiful book by Russian professor S.G.  Ruby, who teaches at MEPI, is called "How our Universe works."  At the end of it there is a humorous tutorial on compiling your own pseudoscientific theory.  The work of Petrik fits very well with the items presented in the self-guide, only Petrik went even further: he enlisted the support of the authorities.  You can only guess what will come of this, but the sawn brews are simply fantastic.  Below is a scan of this manual: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/0a9/277be89aa/01-small.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/de/10/de10bd77c6c38ff771c4df6d3f3b53c6.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7a/6c/7a6c9f5ab6522340317166cc961eb841.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Many probably remember how news on the First Channel rolled a report about the miracle installation, which, consuming 40W of energy, was able to influence the weather and disperse the clouds.  Any sane meteorologist and physicist will immediately call the main reason why it is very difficult to control the weather: the enormous amounts of energy that are involved in shaping the weather conditions, this "pukalka" can only be a little ionized air near the installation. <br><br>  And well, if it were on all known channels with leading psychics, but outputting SUCH on the central channel is a bust.  Although it is constantly possible to observe all the spells, damage and cuffs, from which I personally have very much turned back.  There is a tendency to revive the Orthodox Church and return to it the positions that existed in the days of Tsarist Russia, but religion is a very controversial issue and I will not touch it.  But in general, it is good to have an uneducated crowd, it is better to train, obediently eats the provided ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and does not ask the questions ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Chaos in science </h4><br>  Now about the steadfastness of classical science.  Do you think Einstein's genius is unmoved? <br><br>  Once I wondered if there was a ‚Äúother side‚Äù, if there were any stories and statements that say that Einstein is not a genius, but a scammer, a charlatan and _______ (you need to enter).  It seems that in our world any statement of any facts can be found already ready, since I easily found a different view on the personality of Einstein.  Literally after a minute of ‚Äúgoogling,‚Äù I went to a ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù resource, a personal page of a Russian-speaking person.  Let us throw aside that he believes in the existence of the Aryan race (and of course, considers himself to it) and is a supporter of conspiracy theories on a global scale, but he was attracted by the article: "Einstein and his theory of relativity: 100 years of manipulating the minds of scientists" .  Reading it, or rather the part related to Einstein‚Äôs alternative biography, to put it mildly, I was shocked.  Moreover, he is not alone in his village, similar expositions were found on other resources. <br><br>  There are even whole stories of other people's discoveries by Einstein in the course of correspondence with colleagues, as well as hints that Einstein's wives were the geniuses and he used them.  In general, after reading, I extracted one truth for myself: if you want to believe in Einstein's genius - please believe, if you want to poach it, to level it (getting, apparently, low-grade satisfaction for your Ego) - carry the read alternative versions to the world. <br><br>  He was in Biblio-Globus in the section of physics, came across Atsyukovsky‚Äôs books with his Aethodynamics and a thin brochure about the state of science.  In the latter, he especially amused the list of sources used: Lenin, Lenin, Lenin, Atsyukovsky, Lenin.  In a good environment, he puts himself.  But the funny thing is how he agrees with agility about the error of the whole of modern science, about the complete failure of the Theory of Relativity and so on.  If I am not mistaken, the Russian Academy of Sciences also entered it in the list of false scientists (to go against the Theory of Relativity, this is too much, and the air is still an anachronism).  It is necessary to be more reserved, gentlemen, more reserved.  In general, when reading, the usual human feeling, called envy, is felt. <br><br>  Most struck and many books with names similar to "New Physics", in which each section was called "New Mechanics", "New Thermodynamics", "New Electrodynamics", and sometimes at the end of each name is added the name of the scientist (usually the same author).  Where did they all come from? <br><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  Probably one of the most visible and observable examples of informational chaos can be the phenomenon of rewriting history.  History is first of all changed by the state, and it‚Äôs good when there are still people who remember what really happened, but when there are no such people left (or very few remain), the path is free, you can begin to destroy old values, create new ones.  Again, if you look at the shelves of bookstores, they are decently bent not from ordinary books called ‚ÄúHistory of Russia‚Äù, ‚ÄúHistory of the World‚Äù and other things, but from books called ‚ÄúAlternative History‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew History‚Äù, as well as more intriguing, for example, "Secret History".  Yes, and in ordinary books with ordinary titles, sometimes there is a significant change in priorities, and this is even more dangerous. <br><br>  My father is now interested in reading books that set forth an alternative history, or rather just incredible by modern concepts: German bases in Antarctica, alien Egyptian pyramid construction by aliens, education of Neanderthals by aliens, gene experiments, which resulted in a kind of human being, generally fascinating reading, if completely tired other fiction.  It is more harmless in social terms, while very exciting.  Moreover, by reading it and not being an expert in the field, individual facts and carefully selected coincidences (and there is a lot of them if you wish) excite the imagination and you can even believe in certain advanced theories. <br><br>  However, it was not the docking that is found that I personally would immediately have recaptured the desire to read.  For example, it says: ‚Äúthis information was received from a scientist of such and such (the name was changed for conspiracy purposes)‚Äù, hereinafter referred to as ‚Äúit works ...‚Äù and the full name of the institution goes along with the position held.  Pretty detektivchik obtained. <br><br><h4>  Medicine and Biology </h4><br>  Medicine in its time (or rather, with the discovery of antibiotics) made a huge leap in development and won many victories over the diseases that have tormented humanity for hundreds or even thousands of years.  This allowed pharmaceuticals to take a firm position in the economic system.  However, diseases we fear everything, this fear gives rise to speculation. <br><br>  In many areas of medicine, there are wars between classical approaches and ‚Äúalternates‚Äù.  In some matters, they seem more reasonable than in physics, in medicine there are much more ways to conduct a biased experiment, and the human body itself is too complex, and sometimes it is much simpler.  There is an opinion that for some diseases there is a struggle not with the source of the disease, but with its symptoms, which causes a feeling of incurability and vagueness of manifestation (as an example, you can read about AIDS-e and HIV-e). <br><br>  But now about speculation.  Avian flu (last year replaced by swine flu), how many people caused by the complications caused by it per year?  Tens.  And from the usual flu?  Tens of thousands around the world!  So why was there so much speculation around him?  For one reason, it was necessary to wind up the excitement around him in order to receive funding for the development of drugs.  The old flu has been around for a long time and everyone has more or less accepted it, it was necessary to provide something new, more frightening.  The epogee of this situation happened with swine flu, here and at all the money was pumped up, they developed a ‚Äúsomething‚Äù with incomprehensible properties, they removed the responsibility from themselves, and they were almost obligated to do vaccinations. <br><br>  Now genetically modified products.  Genetics, answer me, how do genes in cells of genetically modified products affect our genome?  No, right?  They are digested like other squirrels.  The product itself, after modifications, will also clearly not become poisonous, and some balance violations will be completely insignificant for the consumer.  However, there is again a reason for speculation.  The motivation seems to be more truthful: gene modifications are made with the help of viruses, but the word ‚Äúvirus‚Äù together with genetic engineering inspires fear.  Here is the argument: this virus can be dangerous for humans.  I just don‚Äôt understand how ... In the form that it is being introduced, it is not capable of reproduction (and even more so in the human body), and the probability of an accidental mutation giving it this opportunity is extremely small, the more likely it is that the ordinary flu really mutates into something dangerous. <br><br>  In medicine, there is the so-called Placebo effect, which is based on the psychology of man and his perception.  The effect is based on the remarkable features of human psychology: a person believes in what he wants to believe (or potentially would like).  Moreover, a completely subjective setting (assessment) of the competence of the source of this information plays a huge role. <br><br>  On the basis of only this effect, you can conduct an "honest" experiment.  We pour water into bottles (it is possible from under the tap, but better from the filter, and even better from the ‚ÄúPetrik filter‚Äù).  Some bottles sign that they have ‚Äúordinary water‚Äù, the other half of the bottles are signed: ‚Äútherapeutic water‚Äù.  Then we forget about the origin of the bottles and start ‚Äúpushing‚Äù in their test group.  We say about medicinal that the water is conspiratorial, with positive ions, alien extracts (may the UFO forgive me) and so on.  About ordinary water, we simply say: ‚ÄúThis is ordinary water, have a drink and tell me if it cured you?‚Äù I think it‚Äôs not necessary to announce the result of the experiment, do you guess yourself? <br><br>  If you develop an idea, then on the basis of this effect, you can prove the effectiveness of any drug, and indeed any other action, for example, a tambourine dance. <br><br><h4>  How we perceive information </h4><br>  When providing information to a person, it is possible to exaggerate the importance of one factor, reduce or completely forget about some other factor.  Also, the human brain itself may unconsciously block unwanted information.  Freud also mentioned in his works the type of reservations, which he called ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù: a person forgets unwanted, unpleasant information for him. <br><br>  Another disturbing feature of thinking that is sensible to logic is associativity and the general tendency to quickly forget the good (and sometimes not notice at all) than the bad one.  In my opinion, it is at the basis of this that the formation of all prejudices lies and will accept other irrational restrictions. <br><br>  But most importantly, it happens unconsciously, not only that, even being fully aware you can not control the situation.  A good example: on the channel with a kind of magic number, I watched an interesting program (I can tell a lie with a name, if that is correct), it was called: ‚ÄúCode of a man‚Äù.  It advanced the theory (moreover, allegedly confirmed by research), which rises against all existing genetics.  To be honest, I tried not to succumb to the gushing nonsense about (literal interpretation): the irradiation of one gene set of another, but in spite of everything, after watching there was some kind of unpleasant sediment. <br><br>  You can cause a known misconception.  Tell me, how does the music of Mozart and other classics affect mental abilities?  Probably, many of you will immediately say: positively, improves mental abilities, maybe even remember the alleged details that they recommend to listen to expectant mothers at any time during pregnancy and so on.  In reality, this myth originates from a single article from some English yellow rag.  It describes some of the research conducted on students of a local university, and their poor fellows were forced to listen to the classics and study, distracting, apparently, from watching pornography and reverendos, so it is not at all surprising that academic progress has increased.  Journalists also played in a damaged phone, and they gave birth to a myth, and quite successfully. <br><br>  Later similar studies were repeated (possibly more than once), but no patterns were found.  I think this was also written about, however, who is interested in such a result, to be precise: such a lack of result?  Simply put, no one heard them, the myth continued to exist, even after being refuted.  The result, more precisely, the absence of a result during the repetition of studies did not interest anyone.  Society is boring, they need to serve hot cakes. <br><br>  But an example of another error, which is retold in many sources: ‚ÄúEinstein‚Äôs reference book was the Secret Doctrine of E. Blavadsky,‚Äù which in reality originated from some Nazi propagandist of literature, with esoteric trends and propaganda of Aryanism in Nazi Germany, it was beneficial to publish such information in order to approve: the genius Einstein himself listens to the teachings of this Dontsova of his time (sorry for such rudeness, but somehow he turned himself out). <br><br><h4>  Chaos in information </h4><br>  Most likely, the majority have heard of such a person as Ernst Muldashev, an ophthalmologist, who for some reason got into esotericism (did mystics want to?).  At one time I had a sin to read some of his works.  Frankly, they are interesting, even, everything looks logical and allows you to dream, does not burden the brain as much as the Secret Doctrine of E. Blavadsky.  But if you start to understand what was written, as some Pyotr Obraztsov did (by the way, he smashed in his books to pieces yet), then you understand, there is no truth, there is a subjective opinion (or rather dreams) of the author, embellished with a bunch of fictions, and in some places completely without concern about the docking of even the simplest facts. <br><br>  What am I talking about?  Maybe he was really distracted, but look at the headlines in the same Yandex-news.  One loud enticement, 95% of duplicates and repetitions, and in fact the usefulness of each individual news tends to zero.  Dozens (or hundreds?) Of information portals thoughtlessly reprint the same thing, partially adding some changes, and it‚Äôs good if they consist in the usual rephrasing, sometimes the facts change and distort. <br><br>  I remember a joke: <br>  <i>Scientist: "We were able to kill 15% of cancer cells in the tail of a laboratory rat!"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Reporter: "Scientists cured cancer!"</i> <br><br>  Such a loud headline firmly settles in the head of the reader, and when you consider how the Internet teaches us to perceive information and can be taken as a fact.  Looking at information on the Internet, and seeing its abundance, it is sometimes impossible to capture the essence of a particular problem, you have to ride on tops, and this further simplifies the creation of myths, the introduction of certain rumors and errors into society. <br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  I apologize, maybe in some places it turned out very rude, muddled, and so on.  Certain moments could not reveal or reveal not fully.  In many ways, the material is presented from my personal position.  Completely neutral approach, alas, is simply impossible.  On many points he could not fully speak, you can find and express a different point of view.  I do not have the opportunity to cover everything, I do not have the right to say that my opinion is true, since my professional field of activity lies in completely different areas.  Described exactly from the position that I saw, looking at the materials on the subject. <br><br>  Of course, I do not think that there is a complete conspiracy around, I don‚Äôt go to extremes, that many / most generally accepted scientific theories are pseudoscientific, but I also understand some of the problems of modern science.  However, I approach any question / fact from the position that it is potentially true or, on the contrary, false.  I would like to believe that the physical / cosmological / chemical scientific theory is still developing on the right path (well, or at least the errors in it are minimal and if they are present only because of their insignificance at this stage of development). <br><br>  Human society has extremely complex interactions and an intricate structure.  The motivation of each individual can be incomprehensible without careful analysis.  As I was convinced, it is possible to select and interpret the same factors in completely different ways, making as a result completely different conclusions and forming a different opinion in a person. <br><br>  At the same time, human society is well subordinate to the 2nd Zakom of Thermodynamics: entropy (that is, a measure of uncertainty, simply speaking chaos) in it is constantly increasing. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> ‚ÄúWe should not be afraid of censorship, but of the fact that useful information is lost against the background of endless informational noise,‚Äù the truth that Aldous Huxley saw 80 years ago. <br><br><h4>  Materials on the topic </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.ras.ru/digest/fdigestlist/bulletin.aspx">Bulletin "In Defense of Science."</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://zhuck1.narod.ru/Einst-2a.htm">Zhuk N.
