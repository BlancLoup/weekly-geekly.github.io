    <h4>  Gateway idea </h4><br>  I came up with after familiarizing myself with [ <a href="http://avz.org.ua/wp/2011/06/17/printing-to-cups-from-windows/">1</a> ] and searching for alternatives to installing GNU / Linux on client machines;  probably, subconsciously, the emergence of such an architecture was influenced by familiarity with the three-tier architecture of access to the database [ <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D1%2591%25D1%2585%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">2</a> ] and the search for ways to use it as such, and its analogies. <br>  The very concept of a gateway does not quite fit into this context, but only by analogy: according to [3, p.313] <blockquote>  "The gateway is a relay system providing the interaction of two information networks." </blockquote>  It would be more accurate to call it a virtual print gateway or something else;  further, for brevity, this link of the route will be called simply the gateway. <br><br>  The most interesting is already stated, it's time to move on to the routine.  The following is ... <br><br><h4>  Concept instructions for the deployment of the gateway </h4><br><ol><li> <u>On the client machine</u> with the address <code>192.168.ab</code> there is a user <code>prn_user</code> with the password <code>secret</code> - for printing through the Microsoft network, the print subsystem is configured and works as it is in the Windows 2000 / XP / 2003 environment.  We look at the name of the printer on the network: the context menu of the printer, the item ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù, the tab ‚ÄúAccess‚Äù, the field ‚ÄúShare:‚Äù <code>xerox</code> .  % computername% of this client: <code>UHost01</code> - we will need it, for example, to generate a meaningful name in the CUPS system;  although if it matches the DNS name inside the local zone, and your household has a good name resolution in IP addresses, and the search is inside the domain suffix of this zone, then it may be used as a substitute for the address <code>192.168.ab</code> hereinafter. </li><li>  <u>Customize the print gateway</u> <ol><li>  System-wide work with the CUPS server <ol><li>  The basic part of the gateway.  Looks like that <ol><li>  Iron gateway: an old server system unit DELL PowerEdge 1400 2xCPU iP-III-800/1536 MB RAM / 18 GB HDD </li><li>  OS: Debian GNU / Linux 6.0 i386 </li><li>  Gateway Address: <code>192.168.ac</code> </li></ol></li><li>  Package installation <br>  If CUPS is not installed yet, give the command to install it. <br><blockquote>  # aptitude install cups <br>  ... <br>  0 packages updated, 52 new ones installed, 0 packages marked for deletion, and 0 packages not updated. <br>  You need to get 26.7 MB archives.  After unpacking 83.2 MB will be taken. <br>  Want to continue?  [Y / n /?] Y <br>  ... </blockquote><br>  We look, whether CUPS is started <br><blockquote>  # /etc/init.d/cups status <br>  Status of Common Unix Printing System: cupsd is running. </blockquote><br>  As required, we go further. <br>  Also, the system requires the presence of the smbclient package, since  The output to the network printer will be on the SMB protocol, and in this package there is a backend for CUPS. </li><li>  You must make sure that CUPS is configured to accept tasks from outside <br>  We go to the admin panel, for example, like this: <code><a href="http://192.168.a.c/"></a> 192.168.ac:631/</code>  <code><a href="http://192.168.a.c/"></a> 192.168.ac:631/</code> , click on the tab "Administration", then, in the section "Server" - "Server Settings:" it is necessary to check the "Allow sharing of printers connected to this system" and "Allow printing from the Internet ";  if not, then click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, after pressing which we will be asked for the username and password, by default this is the username / password from our Linux system root user account, i.e.  as root </li></ol></li><li>  We connect the printer to CUPS <ol><li>  Tab "Administration" in the section "Printers", click the button "Add a printer" </li><li>  In the section "Other network printers:", select the value of the "Windows Printer via SAMBA" radio button and click "Continue" </li><li>  Section "Add a printer", In the "Connection:" field, enter the value " <code>smb://prn_user:secret@192.168.ab/xerox</code> " (hereinafter: enter the value without quotes) and click "Continue" </li><li>  Fill in the next field in this way <br>  Name: drive in " <code>Uhost01_xerox</code> " - this will be the name of the printer in the CUPS system <br>  The following two fields are not so critical, their meanings should be invented by you for your own convenience: <br>  Description: " <code>Xerox DocuPrint P8ex</code> " <br>  Location: " <code>1 ,  13, ,   ..</code> " <br>  Connection: " <code>smb://prn_user:secret@192.168.ab/xerox</code> " (already inserted, displayed for reference) <br>  ‚ÄúSharing:‚Äù - ‚ÄúAllow sharing of this printer‚Äù - tick here <br>  We press the button "Continue" </li><li>  Choose a printer driver with the same name as ours; if not, then the closest one by name;  This approach works in most cases. <br>  Create: "Xerox" - click "Continue" <br>  Model: choose "Xerox DocuPrint P8e Foomatic / hpijs-pcl5e (recommended) (black and white, duplex printing)", and at the bottom press the button "Add Printer" </li><li>  We get to the page ‚ÄúSet default parameters for <code>Uhost01_xerox</code> ‚Äù - here there are various parameters of trays and paper size;  I left everything as it was and clicked on ‚ÄúSave default settings‚Äù </li><li>  For a few seconds, a window will appear saying that our printer uses the default settings. </li><li>  We get to the page of the newly added printer and give the command ‚ÄúMaintenance - printing a test page‚Äù </li></ol></li><li>  If the test page is OK, then the printer is ready to work in CUPS, you can go further </li></ol></li><li>  <u>We configure the MS WS 2008 R2 server or the client of Windows 7</u> <ol><li>  Presetting <ol><li>  Turn on the Internet Printing Client <ol><li>  For the case of <b>Windows 7</b> <br>  Checking: the components should include the Internet Printing client: Start - Control Panel - Programs and Components - in the window that appears, click on the caption on the left ‚ÄúEnable or Disable Windows Components‚Äù further on the tree: ‚ÄúPrinting and Document Services‚Äù - ‚ÄúInternet Client print "- the last jackdaw should stand;  if not, then set.  Click "OK" to confirm the changes or "Cancel" if the changes are not made. </li><li>  For the case of <b>MS Windows Server 2008 R2</b> <br>  This component is disabled by default [ <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverprint/thread/8e6130df-acba-4a8c-b984-a455667e9e49/">4</a> , Tuesday, March 15, 2011 1:49 AM], and I had to tinker to understand why the addition of the printer described in Section 3.2 does not work. <br>  Start - Control Panel - Programs - Enable or Disable Windows Components <br>  In the window that appears, select the item ‚ÄúComponents‚Äù on the left to find the button with the green plus sign ‚ÄúAdd components‚Äù and in the list put a tick in front of ‚ÄúClient of Internet printing‚Äù, click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù. </li></ol></li><li>  If the component ‚ÄúInternet printing client‚Äù was turned off, and we turned it on, i.e.  performed clause 3.1.1., then restart the print server after that, for which the command line: <br><blockquote>  &gt; net stop spooler <br>  &gt; net start spooler </blockquote><br></li><li>  Change the tincture on the proxy server <br>  All users of this printer should disable proxies in their browser properties, or set an exception, i.e.  <code>192.168.ac</code> or for its subnet as a whole, i.e.  for <code>192.168.a.*</code> . </li></ol></li><li>  Printer setup <br>  This item is also done with administrator rights;  Initially, the printer will be available to all users. <ol><li>  Start - devices and printers </li><li>  Printer installation (wizard window will appear) </li><li>  For <b>MS Windows Server 2008 R2 there</b> will be an additional step in which we click on ‚ÄúAdd a local or network printer as administrator.‚Äù </li><li>  Add a network, wireless or bluetooth printer </li><li>  Click "the desired printer is not in the list" </li><li>  The radio button should be in the "Select a shared printer by name" position, next to it is the field where we drive in " <code><a href="http://192.168.a.c/"></a> 192.168.ac:631/printers/Uhost01_xerox</code>  <code><a href="http://192.168.a.c/"></a> 192.168.ac:631/printers/Uhost01_xerox</code> ", click" Next " </li><li>  If you successfully contact the printer, the ‚ÄúAdd Printer Wizard‚Äù will appear, if unsuccessful, an error message will appear.
