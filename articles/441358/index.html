  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first commercial lunar landing apparatus Beresheet was launched.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last landing on the moon was carried out in December 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission, not counting the recent achievements of China.  At that time, Elon Mask was just one year old, he lived in South Africa.  Israel experienced the consequences of the Munich massacre that occurred three months earlier, during which 11 members of its Olympic team were taken hostage and killed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/fg/4b/qffg4b-0masdso7xlrm2pjd1yjw.jpeg"><br><br>  Today, the Israeli Beresheet lander was launched, just the size of a washing machine that would circle in large loops around the Earth until it was captured by lunar gravity and went into orbit around the moon.  The landing will take place on April 11 at the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSerenity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Beresheet mission for $ 100 million could not afford its own rocket - even a small one - therefore the organizers chose the launch option by passing load.  It makes traveling much longer;  The moon is now at a distance of almost 230,000 miles (370,000 kilometers).

      "This is an exploration of outer space in the style of Uber, so we are somehow renting space on a rocket," explained Vinetraub at a press conference on the eve of the launch. <br><br>  The communications satellite for Indonesia was the main cargo aboard the Falcon 9 rocket, which illuminated the sky during a night flight.  But the Israeli moon ship - the first not only for Israel, but also for commercial space - caused an unprecedented hype. <br><br>  Israel seeks to become only the fourth country to successfully land on the moon, after Russia, the United States and China.  Spacecraft, which is called "Bereshit", "Genesis Ivr.", "◊ë÷∞÷º◊®÷µ◊ê◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊™" <br>  or ‚ÄúAt the beginning,‚Äù it will take almost two months to reach the moon. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe thought it was time for a change, and we want little Israel on its way to the moon,‚Äù said Jonathan Vinetraub, co-founder of Israeli SpaceIL, a non-profit organization behind these efforts. <br><br>  The almost full and brightly glowing moon beckoned to itself when it rose in the eastern sky.  According to SpaceIL, an hour after the start, Beresheet was already sending data and successfully deployed its landing supports. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will continue to analyze the data, but the bottom line is that we are in the exclusive group of countries that launched the spacecraft to the moon,‚Äù said Igal Harel, head of the SpaceIL space program. <br><br>  The Soviet Union first landed a spacecraft on Earth‚Äôs satellite, Moon 2, in 1959.  NASA followed him, with his Ranger 4 in 1962.  Last month, China became the first country to land on the opposite side of the moon. <br><br>  Apollo 11 crew astronaut Buzz Aldrin congratulated the upcoming event on Thursday.  NASA administrator Jim Briddenstein did the same thing, calling it "a historic step for all nations and commercial space, as we strive to expand our cooperation beyond low Earth orbit to the moon."  NASA has a laser reflector onboard Beresheet and offers its Deep Space network for communication. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the best to @TeamSpaceIL, she is sending tonight to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/spacex/" class="user_link">SpaceX</a> # Falcon9 from Florida to the land I once trampled ... to the moon,‚Äù Aldrin tweeted. <br><br>  Initially, the Beresheet mission was part of the Google Lunar XPrize competition and even prepared the final design before the end of the competition.  The competition itself ended last year without a winner.  The Israeli team decided to continue to work independently, with funds partially donated by the Israeli billionaire. <br><br>  Operations on the lunar surface should last only two days.  Beresheet will measure the magnetic field at the landing pad and send back data and photos.  The time capsule is on board the spacecraft, which depicts the Israeli cosmonaut Ilan Ramon, who was killed aboard the Columbia spacecraft in 2003, as well as the lunar library containing 30 million pages on the disk from the American Arch Mission Foundation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS0E35aYJcU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video broadcast launch.</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/israel-flying-moon-first-lunar-landing-after-spacex-launch-ncna974456">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441358/</a></p>
