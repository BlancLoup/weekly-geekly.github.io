If the decision was made by one person, then looking at the statistics of the results of his decisions, one can understand how well he makes decisions in this area. <br>  The decision often also needs to be not only accepted, but also translated, and when there is one specific person in charge who also knows that others periodically look to see if his decisions are completed successfully, they move much better and often complete successfully. <br><br>  - time consumption <br>  In order to vote, everyone needs at least a superficial acquaintance with the essence of the question, to spend time on it.  This time will be spent by each voter, in total they spend in an empty huge pile of time.

      If you have a small company, and you are trying to work there according to the principles of democracy, jointly discussing all directions and voting, then the company will most likely sink to the bottom, steeped in endless discussions. <br>  It is much more optimal to divide the areas of responsibility, each does its part and makes decisions within the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility delegated to it (by a team or leader).  Discussions take place at the junction of the zone of responsibility, and not among all, but among those whose zones have crossed. <br><br>  Many start-up teams of friends who start a business are attacking the democracy‚Äôs rake, but they either move away from it naturally or bend in time. <br><br>  In terms of quality management, the business is significantly ahead of our outdated territorial states.  An employee may be a co-owner of a business, have a share of the profits, or shares of a company.  At the same time, he understands in money the value of this share, of these shares.  If he does not like the company's policy, and the weight of his share is too small so that he can demand a change of leader, then he can simply be led away and his share sold. <br>  However, in no country in the world can you sell your share of the state whose co-owner you are supposed to be, the maximum you can just stop being a citizen, without paying compensation. <br>  The people do not own, and the people do not take part in the democratic governance either, the election is an illusion of power that does not exist. <br><br>  In the future, the role of corporations in public life will only grow, and the role of the state will decrease.  The turning point will come when corporations start building private cities. <br>  A private city is a huge investment.  If you build a city, and earn on the delivery of residential and business premises for rent, communal and transport will fight back for a long time, 20+ years, the business does not like such a long investment.  But then, it will be a net income, and of course the power is the real power that will generally move the state aside. <br>  The more perfect our construction technologies become, the longer the time to zero is reduced.  Also, the further, the more capital is concentrated in the hands of private corporations.  And our cities are outdated, they need total refactoring, so total that it is easier to build from scratch from scratch than to update the existing one. <br><br>  For the average person, the difference between a traditional state and a corporation that has become a metropolis-state will not be very noticeable. <br>  Laws, the police, the court, the ministries, the government, even prisons ‚Äî will be the counterparts of these institutions in the corporation city.  But there will be no illusion of democracy, no elections, citizens are customers.  Some citizens may be co-owners, shareholders and may even vote with these shares on a single issue - changing the CEO of the corporation, if of course the shares are given the right to vote. <br><br>  In the internal mechanisms that affect the competitive ability of the differences will be enormous.  More able will climb the career ladder, mediocrity will stay at the bottom or even quit.  It will be so because there will be many such corporations.  They will compete with each other for customers, those who do not follow these principles will be less competitive, will incur losses and customer outflows and they will either take on effective experience or go out of business and be absorbed by their competitors. <br><br>  And there will be no taxes.  Because this is a competitive advantage in a comfortable place for living, where there are no taxes, business will flow from the old states.  The greater the turnover of business within the city, the more expensive you can take the property, the higher the shares of the entire enterprise.  Taxes are just a robbery that traditional states use as they are so inefficient that they cannot even do business as a plus. <br><br>  First, such a corporation will be one.  Someone will build a modest town of skyscrapers and an ultramodern transport system centrally controlled by computer and eliminating traffic jams, most likely without the traditional cars we are used to.  Advanced such skyscrapers, where the premises will be insulation, climate control and always clean air.  A small town, 100 million. <br>  Then go clones, franchises. <br>  In these cities there will be different rules, they will go into niches trying to attract residents of customers.  It will take a couple of decades and most of the population of the planet will live in new cities, spill over just as from villages people flowed into our ordinary cities, only the process will go much faster, maybe, people have already become much more mobile. <br><br>  Corporations city owners will compete with each other, mergers and acquisitions will take place.  The role of traditional states will come to naught, perhaps a number of armed conflicts of the forces of states and corporations will occur, and maybe everything will do without shooting. <br><br>  As a result, we will get one mega corporation all over the Earth, probably by now with branches on the Moon and Mars. <br>  The rules of the game change with monopoly, the lack of competition will reduce the importance of the quality of business processes, regress, worsening of the rights of the population, tightening the screws, shifting towards the totalitarian system is possible. <br>  Up to this point, probably a few hundred years later, what will happen next, I will not undertake to predict that too far, too many technological discoveries will occur during this time. <br><br>  One thing is for sure - the development of society will go continuously. <br>  Never will humanity reach some sort of stable social form, an ideal state system.  There is no limit to perfection, we strive to improve the world around us, and we will always strive to do this, this is the basic law of life. <br>  It is impossible to build utopia, but it is possible to continuously improve what already exists. <br>  Of course, a temporary regression is possible, some experiments, the motive of which of course was to improve the world, led to unfortunate consequences, such as the USSR or fascism.  But evolution is not only at the genetic level.  Social institutions are also evolving, and the factor of natural selection is how much people like one social structure compared to another. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298228/</a></p>
