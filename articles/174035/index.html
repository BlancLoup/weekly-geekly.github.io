They can now be seen if you have a Hubble and a couple of shuttles in your attic. <br><br>  But the trouble is - these ‚ÄúPillars‚Äù do not exist.  More precisely, they ceased to exist 6,000 years ago.  It was then that they accidentally <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/11037">boldly by a supernova explosion</a> .  Why do we see them and we will see another 1,000 years?  It's simple - they are 7,000 light years away.  Their ‚Äúcurrent image‚Äù has not reached us yet.  And right now we are seeing the past.  Want a detailed time travel recipe? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once again, so that you are filled with the idea for sure - we see them, but they do not exist.  This is not a hallucination, not a delusion of inflamed imagination and not Photoshop.  In the "reality" we see something that is long gone.  We see it rewound 7,000 years ago.  In fact - <b>we see the past.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42a/b20/ab5/42ab20ab50d18d22577a0bc91fc7aa1f.jpg" alt="Fairy region" align="right">  Penetrated?  And now pause.  Because further is even more interesting.  In the next 1,000 years, we will see one of the supernova explodes and the ‚ÄúPillars‚Äù disappear in some 300-500 years.  Absolutely and forever.  Although no - they have long disappeared.  But we will see it only in a thousand years.  Still not confused?  Great, go ahead.

      So how do we know they will disappear?  The infrared images are already showing how the explosion begins.  And, it is quite possible that in the infrared range we see the "Pillars" a little later - for example, for a couple of hundred years.  Although it used to be assumed that the speed of a wave cannot exceed the speed of light, in fact <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">this is a bit wrong</a> .  Take at least the guys from the University of Tennessee, who <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/11054">dispersed the sound</a> faster than the speed of light.  Or uncle Boyd, who <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/particle/5092">slowed down the light</a> to 57 meters per second (the Russian post has nothing to do with it).  And a space of two hundred years, by cosmic standards, lasts no longer than summer in St. Petersburg - a microscopic difference in speed is enough to outrun someone by 2 centuries.  There are also space-time warps and other bugs from the famous beta tester Einstein. <br><br>  But let's not climb into the general theory of relativity now and return to our "reality".  You and I, creatures accustomed to thinking of the notions ‚Äúpast‚Äù, ‚Äúpresent‚Äù and ‚Äúfuture‚Äù (in the Finnish language, by the way, there is no future time - the guys knew everything in advance and prepared), right now we see pillars as of 7,000 years ago - that is, in their past.  And we know what will happen to them in 1,000 years (or happened 6,000 years ago? I'm already confused about this time travel).  We cannot change this future, because it is already past.  It is the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù only here, on planet Earth.  There is a long-forgotten fact biography. <br><br>  At the same time, right now (if the word ‚Äúnow‚Äù has not yet lost the last remnants of meaning for you), the indigenous population of the Eagle nebula observes how a rational person is just beginning to master agriculture and enter the new age of stone.  <s>All because ping is big.</s>  And when we finally invent the warp engine and fly towards the Eagle Nebula at a speed of 3,500 light years per hour - it will be even more interesting.  Guess?  Yes, yes, we will see a 2-hour film about what has happened to the nebula in the last 7,000 years.  And after arriving, <b><i>we can from there see the Earth as it was 7,000 years ago</i></b> . <br><br>  It's time to stock up on popcorn.  The way home will be a popular destination among tourists - where else can you see how mankind evolved from cave times to our days in a couple of hours.  Catch the meaning?  Not in artificial 3D-models and not in science fiction films, but to see the past in the present with my own eyes.  And then what will be real for you - what you see right now - the planet Earth 7,000 years ago, or what you know and have seen before - the Earth paid in the 21st century?  Or maybe the past with the present swap places? <br><br>  Immediately I will disappoint those who want to return to the Soviet Union in this way or in the times before the revolution - the modern Earth will not disappear anywhere, because time travel is possible only as an observer.  We just see the old picture, which flies in space.  Although‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174035/</a></p>
