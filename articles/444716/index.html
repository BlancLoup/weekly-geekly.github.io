Its price is $ 1980, which is explained by the presence of a bendable display, which allows you to turn the phone into a mini-tablet and vice versa.  When the device was tested by journalists from different publications, they left mostly positive reviews. <br><br>  But now the phone was subjected to a longer test (during the official presentation of the device, no one managed to hold the phone in their hands, journalists were forbidden to touch it), thanks to which they managed to identify not very pleasant moments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main drawback is that, over time <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-fold-video-on-youtube-shows-a-pronounced-screen-crease/">, a kind of defect forms</a> at the bend <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-fold-video-on-youtube-shows-a-pronounced-screen-crease/">, a</a> hall that can be viewed without any problems.  Most likely, this problem can be eliminated only by the service centers or the company itself.

      A problem was discovered by one of the YouTube users, in whose hands Galaxy Fold fell.  However, it is not entirely clear what device is being tested - a prototype or a version that will soon appear on store shelves. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/otwW5e61nHQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  But be that as it may, the company claimed 200,000 guaranteed trouble-free flexion-extension cycles.  No creases / folds should form, but they are formed, and after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-06/samsung-is-said-to-be-preparing-more-foldable-smartphone-models">about 10,000 flexings</a> (presumably). <br><br>  The fact that the device was in the hands of a blogger is in itself strange, since it is not sold anywhere, and as far as is known, dev-kits are also not available for private developers.  The phone will be released only at the end of April of this year.  In addition, it is unclear how many times the blogger folded and folded the phone, before a fold appeared on the display. <br><br>  She herself is not too critical, for example, on a light background there are no problems.  But the dark background makes the fold noticeable, so it immediately becomes clear that something is wrong.  But the problem, in fact, is not the visibility of the defect, but the fact that it exists at all - if the device costs about $ 2000, then any malfunctions or shortcomings become an extremely unpleasant surprise. <br><br>  In addition, in the folded state, the two halves of the device do not fully touch, there is a gap between them, and not a small one.  In principle, some other folding phones manufactured by Samsung‚Äôs competitors have a similar structure, but this is not the case with other similar devices.  For example, the device from Huawei, which was named Mate X, is formed without any gaps between the two halves.  However, in the device from Huawei the principle of folding is somewhat different - the screen bends not inward, but outwardly, that is, one large display is divided into two functional parts. <br><br>  The third drawback is that the ‚Äúhalf‚Äù screen, which is activated after the phone is folded, has a diagonal of 4.6 inches and a non-standard aspect ratio. <br><br>  As for the characteristics, the internal memory in the phone is 512 GB.  Memory Type - Universal Flash Storage 3.0 (eUFS).  Eight-core Qualcomm processor, made on 7 nm process technology.  RAM - 12 GB.  Two batteries at once - one for each half of the folding phone.  The total battery capacity is 4380 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/994/cc6/d13/994cc6d13e66f29606ad69a9cc991993.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to Fold, the South Korean company may soon release at least <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-06/samsung-is-said-to-be-preparing-more-foldable-smartphone-models">two more smart phone models</a> with bendable screens.  As for the current model, the corporation plans to sell at least 1 million bend smartphones this year.  Perhaps it is this company that will be able to introduce a new type of gadgets into circulation and make such a form factor familiar.  But, as mentioned above, not only Samsung is working on a folding device, and soon manufacturers of such devices may become even more - if other manufacturers are convinced of their profitability. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444716/</a></p>
