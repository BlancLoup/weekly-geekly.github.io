  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Local keyword search based on Prodvigator service algorithms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to highlight the internal development of <a href="https://ringostat.com/">Ringostat</a> - a module created by the company's programmer <b>Vladislav Kudrik</b> for corporate research.  His goal is to determine which companies provide contextual advertising in a particular city. <br><br>  Although it was created to solve specific problems, it turned out that it is able to allocate narrow market segments by more precise segmentation by long search queries, which opens up a large space for analytics. <br><br>  The parser relies on the <a href="https://prodvigator.ru/">Prodvigator</a> service <a href="https://prodvigator.ru/">database</a> and the functionality of Yandex and Google search engines for geo-marketing.  With the help of the module, we were able to find companies that run contextual advertising in a particular city and country, filtered by key request, but the functionality of the parser is much broader.  All found data was unique and did not repeat.  Its functions will be useful to those who are looking for partners or customers of their market in a particular city. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Prodvigator is a service for analyzing competitors and selecting key phrases.  A free account represents 30 requests (calls) to the service with demonstration of only the first 10 lines in the received reports.  The totals contain: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  detailed information on the competitor's domain; </li><li>  reports on search queries and search tips; </li><li>  the dynamics of positions in the issuance of Google and Yandex; </li><li>  reports on advertisements and keywords; </li><li>  characteristic site competitors pages. </li></ul><br><h1>  How it works? </h1><br>  You set the necessary search parameters in the parser (city, keywords).  Then choose one of the databases of companies where there is a geo-referencing.  This can be Google Places, Yandex.Reference, Foursquare, 2Gis or any other similar system. <br><br>  You can add only one database, or you can link them with a few specific algorithms.  Not finding the required number of organizations in one database, the program will start searching the other. <br><br>  Moreover, you can set a condition that organizations in a particular region or city will search for Google, in another - Yandex, in the third 2Gis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4b6/57a/6cf/4b657a6cffadd5157d3bc74256b8ee72.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only limitations for such a search are the presets Google and Yandex.  So the American search engine does not allow to receive more than 60 search queries on geo-marketing, filtering organizations by maximum match for a keyword.  The relevance algorithm is Google‚Äôs corporate information.  However, the top 60 companies are enough for a small survey.  You can get full lists of organizations in Yandex, but the number of requests per day is limited to 500. To expand the number of requests, you need to use a paid Yandex account. <br><br>  One of the unique features of the service is binding to the Prodvigator database, which allows you to actually determine whether the company is carrying out contextual advertising.  For the parser, a Professional account was used in Prodvigator, which allows you to get maximum information on the unlimited number of search queries. <br><br>  This is the most advanced fare, which costs $ 299 per month.  In the Prodvigator product line, there are also Lite and Standart products that allow you to enter 1000 and 5000 requests per day, respectively. <br><br><h1>  What does the parser interface look like? </h1><br>  The ‚ÄúWorkers‚Äù page shows all search campaigns that are still working or have already finished parsing.  Information about their status can be seen in the ‚ÄúIs waiting‚Äù column: the value ‚Äú0‚Äù means that the work is not being conducted, ‚Äú1‚Äù - that the search process is not over yet. <br><br>  Here we can see the unique ID of the campaign, the city in which the search takes place, the key search parameter, the bases that are connected to the campaign.  As we can see in the screenshot, 13 businesses were found in the 2Gis database of companies offering training in Odessa, using Google Ukraine to advertise.  And in Dnepropetrovsk found 10 advertised car dealers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/482/f05/86a/482f0586a24166ade85209fe36f4e8c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next screen shows that the parser provided information from the Yandex catalog on 49 interior designers in Kiev and 52 companies selling doors advertised in Google Ukraine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/227/013/f8f/227013f8f1d24cbdca85b35af45476dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next is the page of the found company, which includes: <br><ul><li>  business name; </li><li>  its legal address indicated on the site; </li><li>  URL of the organization's site; </li><li>  email; </li><li>  telephone (if any); </li><li>  parameters that were specified during the search. </li></ul><br>  In addition, we can view all the keywords that are used by the organization for contextual advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/29d/2f5/1b0/29d2f51b085dc36d697169befc56e871.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúResults‚Äù page is a summary of the search campaign results (which can also be uploaded to a csv file).  Here we see all the sites found, with their data, as well as search queries and an example of a keyword used for promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a84/ceb/b4b/a84cebb4b135ea3766f67bec808b93dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  How profitable to use the search with the help of the developed module </h1><br>  The functionality of the parser allows us to effectively prepare for work with clients in a particular city.  We can quickly form a pool of companies that are engaged in contextual advertising from a specific business area and establish contacts with them. <br><br>  In addition, it can be used to conduct large-scale market research in different countries, assessing the scale of the industry and the main players in specific market niches.  The ability to distinguish narrow market segments by more precise segmentation by long search queries, opens up a large space for analytics. <br><br>  At the moment, the Ringostat service uses the module as a corporate tool for working with partners and customers, but it is possible that after some time the functionality of a specialized search engine will become available to a wider audience. <br><br>  Learn more about call tracking on the <a href="http://blog.ringostat.com/">Ringostat blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299226/</a></p>
