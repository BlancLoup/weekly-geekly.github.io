  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The official order of the action in M.Video allows you to buy TWO IPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In continuation of yesterday's story <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/66283/">about the action with the sale of the IPhone in M.Video</a> ... <br><br>  Today I went to the Spektr shopping center again, but not for the tube, but just to watch the action.  Came around at 9:40, and the store (located on the 0 floor of the shopping center) opened at 10:00.  The ground floor of the shopping center was cordoned off by security.  People in black uniforms stood every 5-10 meters.  The entrance to the shopping center is strictly by passes.  The escalator has accumulated about 35 people.  Many of them arrived there at 6 am and waited for the opening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Familiar faces ... Those who did not have time yesterday and broke off with the purchase again stood.  It is not clear how, but somewhere around 9:50 below, M.Video has a small number of people.  They were 8 people.  The security guard checked their documents, they all turned out to be employees of the Shopping Center, who can move around the shopping center without any obstacles. <br><br>  At 10 o'clock the crowd was allowed in and the accumulated people began to hurry down the stopped escalator down to the store.  Inside was already a turn!  The seller said that today there are only 10. After the discharge of two checks, the phones ran out.  Bummer!  Those who waited from 6 in the morning were clearly dissatisfied.  Who bought?  Where are the tubes?  Administrator!

      Employees of the store justified on already memorized phrases: "Employees bought phones, they are the same buyers."  This clearly did not suit.  ‚ÄúWe have no more iPhones!  We can do nothing to help, come back tomorrow. ‚Äù <br><br>  But another man in a red T-shirt came up to the counter.  "We sell 10 more iPhones, this is the maximum."  You see, yes?  They have pipes, they just don‚Äôt want to sell them.  The senior manager (Andrei Andreev, hello!) Referred to the regulations on which they could not sell a lot of handsets (‚ÄúEuroset will make complaints‚Äù).  As always, there were people who knew ‚Äúfrom reliable sources in the central office‚Äù that 62 iPhones were delivered to this store.  The unexpected appearance of 10 tubes indirectly confirms this fact. <br><br>  Next was the internal abuse between the participants in the queue.  They found out who was the first to give up.  The security guard of the shopping center (who was on duty on the escalator) intervened in the process - he was pointing fingers at everyone he "saw at 8 am when he arrived."  They got the cherished papers to receive the iPhone.  Compared with yesterday's progress on the face.  There were about 20 tubes, more than 10 of them went to a free market (I didn‚Äôt remember exactly, but somewhere around 5-8 it was not clear where). <br><br>  By the way, the top management from ‚ÄúM.video‚Äù was present there.  Maybe that's why they decided to throw out another tube. <br><br>  As a buyer, I‚Äôm wondering why they sell so little and whether it‚Äôs allowed to participate in the promotion by the store‚Äôs employees themselves.  Typically, such actions in the regulations stipulates that employees and their relatives can not participate.  I asked for the rules of conduct to which managers so often referred.  Naturally, nobody wanted to give it to me.  But we know that they should have such a document.  Either please invite the store manager, or a few entries to the book of complaints from those who remained without purchases, but they showed me some paper in about 20 minutes.  It could not be copied, it was impossible to carry.  Just read. <br><br>  This document was an <b>internal order for holding the action number 193</b> (if it was not wrong with the number I) dated August 4, 2009.  It says that this campaign is taking place should contribute to the promotion of sales of iPhones, drawing attention to the network and sales of MegaFon SIM cards.  <b>No more than 2 TELEPHONES can be sold to each shareholder.</b>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>not one, but two.</b>  Feel free to demand a second handset tomorrow morning.  You are obliged to sell it, according to the order of M.Video management.  The document does not regulate a certain number of phones, which must be sold per day.  Those.  <b>Excuses like "We can sell no more than 10 handsets a day" - fantasy store managers</b> . <br><br>  It was possible to talk with the director of the store, which "does not produce iPhones."  He said that <b>employees could not buy phones before opening a store</b> .  And that the situation in which 8 out of 10 pipes disappeared somewhere (there were ten, only 2 were sold, then there was zero) - impossible (= this should not be). <br><br>  In short, ‚Äúcome back tomorrow.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66380/</a></p>
