In the author of the game Z-Game, carrying circulation nastol, flies a truck on the Ring Road.  Half the car and the car in the trash, Marvin - shook, but he is cheerful and happy, continues to deliver boxes in a day.  On the night before the children's matinee, where the teacher-teacher for the master class was to come, it turns out that she was sick - and we are looking for an urgent replacement at 6 am.  When assembling an exhibition, we forget to put the rules into demo samples (400 pieces) - we urgently send a person by plane from Russia to Germany, and then we turn a good hotel into an assembly workshop of production.  After the exhibition, we, in theory, will have a few pallets of goods that you don‚Äôt want to carry back - they shouted who could sell them - and almost by chance signed a distribution contract throughout Europe.  On the site, a person leaves a comment about the product ‚Äúant farm‚Äù, telling that this is, in fact, a concentration camp for ants.  The essence of the appeal - rename the product. <br><br>  And it's only three days. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Stories every day </h3><br>  Something is constantly happening somewhere.  Some of this can be used for training: for example, when a bread kiosk was demolished near us, the saleswomen stood in his place and began to greet all the customers who were remembered by sight.  And they also showed where the store is now in the courtyard nearby.  For two years, we have remembered almost everyone - and I learned what a real loyalty program is, which solves the very task that it must solve: in a crisis, it retains customers.

      The other part is fixing your processes.  As usual - various shoals and cases that could have been avoided if it had turned out to be thought in advance.  Since the network is large, it is necessary to disassemble and, if necessary, add something new to the rules.  Required rarely, I must say.  Usually it is about the fact that someone did not understand something.  And our people are hot, so things often end up far from how we would like. <br><br>  The third is just funny stories that carry a certain shade of irrationality.  Sometimes they bring real chaos to the processes, sometimes they are just fun, and sometimes they are perfectly combined in combination.  Which then give, for example, a new direction, as was the case with the goods in Germany. <br><br>  <b>In general, to hell with morality, let's just tell what happens to us.</b> <br><br>  Here, for example, a foreigner comes into the shop on Tverskaya and gestures in half with fragments of our speech that he is very fond of a Russian girl who teaches his great powerful Russian language.  Apparently, love was more than learning, because the seller did not understand what he wanted further.  But!  They found a way out.  The seller launched the Google voice search service, the foreigner spoke the phrase into it, Google recognized it, then the seller shoved it with a translator.  So they figured out what he wanted to give her a good gift, they chose the game.  I remember Asprin, describing Bazar-na-Virgo, they say, no devil has ever allowed the deal to be broken due to ignorance of the language. <br><br>  Tuesday morning point on Okhotny Ryad.  There are almost no people, because the morning is the same.  A very intelligent maitre enters in the prime of his life.  He has two children, eight and twelve years old, says sir.  For 20 minutes, slowly chose the game, the sellers are preparing to punch.  And on the point flies a lady on the heels and says: <br>  - Venya, what are you, what games, they are stupid! <br>  And takes our romantic hero. <br><br>  At the beginning of autumn a man came to the ‚ÄúOverboard!‚Äù Tournament in China Town.  I played, then I thought and bought ice cream for everyone.  Just.  In general, the whole store in China-town is very strange because of the constantly operating gaming zone (by the way, free, yes).  In the same place, all of a sudden, right on the spot (in this very game hall) Misha Kuzin, our regular participant in tournaments, celebrated his 12th birthday.  He is now cool tears all in Neyroshimu-6. <br><br>  At the points on the streets, such as on Paveletskaya, they often bring empty bottles and ask if there is room for throwing them away. <br><br>  They came to Taganskaya to return the game with a check not from our store.  In the holy certainty that this was exactly us.  The elder did not lose his head and did everything right: he accepted the refund, returned the money, and then made out explanatory notes for a long time, because according to the regulations it‚Äôs not possible. <br><br>  Two guys fly at the point once, shouting: <br>  - Twister, urgently, the question of life and death! <br>  We have one left, open, with a torn box.  But they were burning, and the sellers carried him out of the warehouse, made a discount.  The guys bought another ‚ÄúLove‚Äù ball and a bunch of romantic postcards, left with Twister under the arm.  What it was - no one knows. <br><br>  Gypsy ran to the point, grabbed the box with the game (which was just laid out on the table), ran away.  Half an hour later, she returned to swear that she had been sold empty. <br><br>  Constantly come devils from all sorts of new generations of Herbalife.  Most often offer fur coats and cosmetics, and at each point.  And there is also a well-known man who illegally trades with brass knuckles and clubs.  Each his arrival is a whole show, as a farts from the 90s, he opens up a coat with goods, and starts describing the assortment with jokes and jokes.  Just as if the hero ‚ÄúCards, money, two trunks‚Äù came to you.  Or even Smugate.  On Paveletskaya, they wanted to sell him a Ruff, but he said that he was a non-drinker. <br><br>  Dad is looking for a gift for a child, he wants a designer.  That one is not that, this is something flimsy, this is not suitable ... We roll out heavy artillery - a children's construction set, one <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%26mode%3Dblock%26sort%3Dprice-desc">of these</a> .  Who does not know - it is heavy as a horse, because there really are bricks, only small ones, and there‚Äôs really a composition for laying them.  The man turned out to be a builder, with the head of the company.  Long admired, and bought several sets at once.  With a particularly good intonation, he said ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù - apparently, the seller did not correctly call it ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù or ‚Äúcement‚Äù. <br><br>  In the new store the corner rack is brought late.  They called, they say, a little later.  Then they called every half hour, saying that right now, now.  The senior point waited, at about 10:30 pm already thinking about the effect of the trolleybus - the longer you wait, the more sorry it is to get up and leave.  On the threshold of our pseudo-furniture makers were at half past midnight. <br><br>  A guy with angel wings and a halo walked along Tverskaya.  I went to the shops, greeted and left. <br><br>  Someone said hookah, that we must put in them board games.  The walkers began: strange people came, gathered games for 10 thousand evenly, left.  Three days this invasion lasted. <br><br>  Went dad 5-year-old child.  I chose the game ‚ÄúBuratino‚Äù, this is a simple hodilka, mechanics ‚ÄúSnakes and ladders‚Äù.  Suddenly I found a microscope ( <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/mosigrushka/microscop_15/">like this</a> ), there are more drugs in the kit.  Opened, looked, fascinated, reviewed all the drugs from the main set, asked for more.  Bought, said son bugs catches, will now look again.  But we doubt something that his son will quickly get it. <br><br>  Constantly on the point come famous people.  Then a pop star will be asked to use the toilet (which will finally convince the seller that she is an earthly person), then the Moscow Art Theater actors will enter (they are very pleased that the young people recognize them), then the characters from Doma 2 appear, and one of the vendors is tough scorched.  Vendors greet popular video bloggers with their own catch phrases, only this is what distinguishes them - in reality in natural light it is difficult to know.  Decl came with detslyatami, at the senior point as much as the era flashed before my eyes - I realized how old he had become. <br><br>  Shopping centers are terrified by alarms on the ‚Äúfattest‚Äù days - competitive showdowns, it seems.  December 30 fire alarm is a frequent occurrence.  But there are real cases, for example, we participated in the evacuation.  Good chefs set fire to something on the island with a meal - as a result, the entire floor of the shopping center was foggy, just Silent Hill.  By the way, the shopping center has excellent steganography.  We already know the codes "someone left the gun in the grocery cell" and check for the ignition sensor trigger.  By the way, the last one in one of the shopping centers - the "rainbow", can come in handy.  I would immediately get up from the floor. <br><br>  Regularly leave children in stores.  If the seller is playing with the family in the game to show, then the parent can suddenly get together somewhere and say - play it with him for now, please.  And come back in an hour.  We fight in every way, but parents are damn sudden. <br><br>  The intern took the goods to the client and never returned. <br><br>  The boy (judging by his height ‚Äî about 8‚Äì9 years) amassed a few months on Jackal.  Came, looked, played with sellers, saved up.  At the White Dacha in Mega, the girl, too, somehow came up with a broken piggy bank - scored almost fifteen hundred dozens.  Once again a very little boy and dad came in, brought a packet of packets.  There were inside the "sausages" trivia, such as a package of "10 rubles", 10 and 50 kopecks.  Did not count.  Maybe, of course, it would not have come together for a couple of rubles, but when a person saved up so much and so responsibly, it is not blasphemous to distrust him. <br><br>  Or here is Scrabble.  Prices for it are like in Europe (it rolls over through customs and becomes much more expensive).  In Russia, its counterpart - our good old "Erudite", he - "Balda".  But it was Scruble who, on March 8, was bought by a homeless man who constantly lives 100 meters from the store in the courtyard. <br><br>  The reason for the return of erotic fantasies: ‚ÄúI want to complain, please note - this is not a guide to action and not a list of poses!  We changed the linen, went to the shower, and there - they brought you a pizza, and you have to pay in kind.  The whole evening is spoiled! ‚Äù <br><br>  A woman comes with a son.  He wanted "Jackal" and "Zombie Monkey".  In the "monkey" box - exactly the coffin for the cat in shape and color.  Mom is scared, they refuse to play.  Jackal is looking - and there is 18+ on the box (because rum is mentioned in the game - but a thousand devils! - rum was used so that the water would not spoil in a long transition, so this is a historical truth!).  Panic.  Alcohol in the game.  The boy, sobbing, left us with the "Wizard of the Emerald City."  Everything is beautiful and positive there. <br><br>  In the summer, an uncle from the Invasion, who bought Zombies in the House, Jackal, Heureka and Ruff, came to Kurskaya right outside the station.  He says he missed the train, let me return a couple of games, otherwise there is not enough for a ticket.  Very well, you were here, maybe it will?  Returned, of course.  Left normal. <br><br>  A girl, a pretty girl, looks like 18 years old, if not younger, she stands at the shelf with erotic phantoms and considers the most hardcore.  The seller does not climb, because he knows - in this category will only frighten.  It happens that girls right up to the roots of their hair turn red, if they say an extra word in such a situation.  The virgin looks up at him with large, clean eyes and says: <br>  - And is there more interesting?  It's all very simple, I have already tried everything. <br><br>  Half an hour before closing on the last New Year, a guy came in with a guitar, wanted a monopoly as a gift to someone.  But he had no money.  At all.  And cards.  I got up with a guitar in the transition, shot some trivia.  Then I realized that I still needed gift wrapping, offered to play right in the store, performed a couple of songs, broke the applause - they gave a rustling paper, helped to pack.  He then came back, we are always happy for him. <br><br>  A magician glanced at Prospect Mira.  I bought special cards that are expensive and pretentious (but, sort of like, they have the right material and size).  Tricks showed.  After his departure, just in case, they counted the money on hand. <br><br>  In general, life is irrational and this fun. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315462/</a></p>
