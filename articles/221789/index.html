The Brandon Mendelsohn Book</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c6/d36/833/0c6d3683344176d1720727de20449a27.jpg">  I for a long time did not publish anything on Habr√©.  Somehow there was nothing to share.  And for the first time I am writing about a book that is worth reading.  The author debunks myths about the effectiveness of social networks for brand building and customer loyalty. <br><br>  Remember the time when many companies rushed to blog and promote them?  Only in the end it turned out that there are very few people who can write interestingly.  And those who are willing to read and comment, even less.  So still hang many "foul" blogs with congratulations on the New Year and March 8 ... <br><br>  With the advent of fashion on the "social" all just as sharply wanted to be there.  What for?  Well, there is "everything" ...

      Let's go back to the book. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSo you should not register on Facebook.  Nobody needs you there. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Its main charm is that it is a research work that is based on the mass of publications, interviews and interviews conducted and found by the author, as well as facts, for example, data on sales of companies.  Almost on every page of the book - several footnotes with reference to external sources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Brandon consistently (and that is especially attractive - with humor) shows how the ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù of such companies as Old Spice, Zappos, Kia and others actually arose on Facebook, Twitter.  And as proof, he gives figures and statements of the participants of the events themselves.  Remarkably, for most companies, these social media advertising campaigns are unprofitable. <br><br>  The author does not claim that everything is so bad.  He emphasizes once again that any advertising channel is just a tool.  And there are no guarantees that it will work as well as for large brands (which have not only fame, but also resources - monetary and human). <br><br>  As a result, we are presented with a completely different, truthful view of the ‚Äúsecond coming of the Messiah‚Äù in the face of social networks.  And the main thing remains the same as it was before - your goals and your audience. <br><br>  Finally, on the format of the book: the paper edition is very pleasant to read and hold in your hands.  Format, binding, font and all the rest are made by 5. Enjoy your reading! <br><br>  <i>For reference: Brandon Mendelssohn - the destroyer of the myths about marketing in social media, a journalist and public critic.</i>  <i>He has collaborated with many publications, in particular the Huffington Post, CNN, Mashable, Forbes, ComicsAlliance, NBC News, the Wall Street Journal, led a blog on the Albany Times Union site and a ‚Äúcollege survival column‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Mendelssohn's texts were quoted and published in Newsweek, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Psychology Today, Smart Money Magazine.</i>  <i>The author himself has repeatedly appeared on CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, Yahoo!</i>  <i>News, CBC and other TV channels.</i>  <i>He lectured on social media marketing myths and debated marketers at events such as Social Media Explore, The DO Lectures in the UK, Word of Mouth Marketing Summit and South By Southwest Interactive.</i>  <i>In addition, Brandon Mendelsohn debated on the impact of social media on society and political processes with Pakistan‚Äôs Permanent Representative to the UN, Abdullah Hussein Harun.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Currently, Mendelssohn leads a weekly column in the magazine Social Times.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221789/</a></p>
