Finished and preparing for protection.  And at the same time I am preparing for the teacher to clap his eyes, like an innocent child, and ask - WHAT IS THIS?  But there will be nothing to complain about, and he will still count me a curse, because ... where will go :) <br><br>  Actually, I am a part-time student who has worked in the specialty much longer than I study it (yes, a female programmer is not fiction, we exist).  The teacher is a graduate of a local teacher training center, in combination with a classic one, I would even say, a clinical student who, somehow, is crawling in Delphi, but he himself seems to have not written a single working application.  Kursach - the usual, I would even say, the most important task of writing software, which conducts testing.  I just don‚Äôt want to go along the usual ‚Äúhose‚Äù way and write it all somehow on a coached dolphin (or, even ‚Äúbetter‚Äù, to roll off Tyrnet‚Äôs ready-made options, of which there are many people) I want to learn something new.  And along the way, to slightly show off and wipe the nose of the pretentious teachers - I can‚Äôt take it away from me, I love it (what woman doesn‚Äôt like to show off, eh?), And even since I wrote a similar softphone not in a turbopascale in school grade 11 All normal students, and on Pearl.  :)) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, my course project was developed with the help of the Qt library in C ++ (in fact, this is the first working application, which I wrote on some pluses).  Also under Linux in KDevelop, yes (however, especially for the teacher I also did the Windows build).  Instead of reinventing their vague data formats, like most students, I use normal XML, and I don‚Äôt disdain to use UML schemas to explain the program logic (although in reality they are unnecessary for a literate person, because the program is, again, simple and trivial ).  Yes, even the text of the course stuffed in OpenOffice, and as a reference sources on technology used wiki resources!  Continuous open source, wherever you look :)

      Well, the work itself - in fact, also open source, you can safely copy-paste and use for your student projects.  I'm not greedy, I do not mind.  The text is <a href="http://ad-astra.name/assets/files/trpp.pdf">here</a> (in our techie they look at the design through their fingers, so if the text is not so formatted where it is, format it), then the source code <a href="">here</a>  The course, in addition to the above, contains: a stone in the melkosoft garden, the glorification of the open source, and other topics that are sweet for the red-eyed brother :) I will brag so much that I will quote a little: <br><br>  <i>Five or ten years ago, with the almost total domination of Microsoft's operating systems and not so many integrated development environments for them, the very words ‚Äúcross-platform programming‚Äù and ‚Äúfree technologies‚Äù most often gave rise to the question: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.</i>  <i>It was a vicious circle - there was a lot of application software for PC / Windows, so the market share of other architectures and operating systems was small (and the prospects for commercial coverage of this were doubtful), and, accordingly, application software for Windows continued to be released more than anything else. .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But since IT is one of the fastest growing areas of high-tech manufacturing, the situation is changing rapidly.</i>  <i>The further - the greater the share of Linux distributions used on home, non-server computers.</i>  <i>Moreover, Apple's Macintosh computers are again gaining popularity, the latest versions of the operating system for which are also POSIX-compatible (in other words, they are variations on the Unix theme).</i>  <i>More and more developers of both commercial and open source software come to the conclusion that in order to popularize their offspring they will somehow have to make it work on different platforms.</i>  <i>And I am no exception.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The main objective and objective of this project is to write a program that allows students to test for pre-set lists of questions.</i>  <i>But, unlike most similar projects that are written in Delphi exclusively for Windows and using data formats that are incompatible, I also set a purely conceptual task - to use the most modern cross-platform design and development technologies, as well as, as close as possible. written code for industrial designs actually used in production.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  And this is how the main form of the application looks like: <br><img src="http://ad-astra.name/assets/files/mainform.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, it‚Äôs cool that I knocked out the right to choose the development tools myself, because there are autocratic teachers who insist on one particular solution (usually from small-scale ones, aha).  I am happy as an elephant and happily anticipating protection :) And you, dear readers, have you ever wiped the nose of our IT education system in general and individual teachers in particular? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59274/</a></p>
