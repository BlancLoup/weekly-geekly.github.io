As it is easy to understand from the title, the conference is practical, not theoretical.  More than 200 people from more than 50 companies have already registered for the main part of the conference. <br><br>  The organizers made every effort to bring famous speakers and trainers to the conference who were at the origin of modern engineering approaches.  This will give participants the opportunity to get first-hand information.  The main engineering practices will be covered: Unit Testing, TDD, Continuous Integration, BDD, Code Review, Refactoring, Acceptance Testing and others.  It will also discuss architecture issues in Agile projects, dealing with technical indebtedness, developers and testers relations, as well as many other problems of modern development. <br><br>  Let's see what the conference organizers have prepared for us! <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  25 speakers from different countries; </li><li>  19 reports and 8 mini-reports on the main day of the conference; </li><li>  A series of two-day TDD trainings in various programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Java, .NET, PHP) from experienced practitioners. </li><li>  Introductory training "Engineering practices in Agile" </li><li>  Training "Continuous Integration in practice" on the use of one of the mandatory practices in the modern world of development. </li><li>  A meeting of the ‚ÄúClub of anonymous developers‚Äù on the topic ‚ÄúDependency Injection‚Äù with guest speaker Mark Seemann </li><li>  Johannes Brodwall's TDD Coding Dojo master class, in which the popular testing development approach will be demonstrated in the popular coding dojo style. </li></ul><br><h4>  Key speakers </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>Mark Seemann</b> , an experienced developer and author of the book ‚ÄúDependency Injection in .NET‚Äù, will share with participants the experience of developing agreements and standards that make the code look more coherent, easy to maintain and maintain. </li><li>  <b>Pawe≈Ç Lipi≈Ñski</b> will talk about the principles and approaches to design in Agile.  Do I need to make long-term decisions?  Do UML diagrams and TDDs help in the design?  These and many other questions will be discussed in detail. </li><li>  <b>Johannes Brodwall</b> will hold a hands-on workshop on TDD and pair programming.  By programming together with another developer, Johannes will demonstrate various TDD practices and subtleties. </li><li>  <b>Dmitry Kovalenko</b> will tell about his experience in building a process of continuous automated testing using various popular tools: RSpec, Cucumber, Selenium.  Dmitry has extensive experience in testing, including companies such as ThoughtWorks and Groupon. </li><li>  <b>Nikolai Alimenkov</b> is a Java technical leader and Scrum Master from Zoral Labs.  Having more than 7 years of development experience, Nikolai has been working with Agile methodologies for more than 5 years.  Expert in development in Java, Agile engineering practices and team management.  An active participant and speaker at many international conferences, a member of the Agile Ukraine community.  Founder and trainer of the XP Injection training center, author of numerous Java development, application testing, scheduling, organization of Agile and QA processes, engineering practices. </li><li>  <b>Alex Solntsev</b> is a practicing Flex and Java developer, Certified Scrum Master and Certified Scrum Practitioner.  Active volunteer for the development and development of the Agile community, the initiator and curator of the translation into Russian of well-known publications.  Alexey is a trainer at the XP Injection Training Center and head of the Agile Competence Center at Infopulse.  He is not only a speaker, but also a reviewer of such conferences as Agile Gathering, Agileee, IT Jam, Agile Base Camp. </li><li>  <b>Andrei Bibichev</b> participated in software development at the junction of the following activities: programming (still loves to play!), Design and design, project management, training and assistance to other teams, development of the company (both in terms of technology, and in terms of organization and management ).  Now he is developing and developing a system for markerless capture of human movements (MoCap) using conventional web-cameras.  Prior to that, developed applications for large businesses.  At the moment, occupies the position of technical director of the company iPi Soft. </li></ul><br>  From the reports I would also like to mention a few: <br><ul><li>  " <b>Tester, programmer and automation</b> " (Andrey Rebrov) is probably one of the most complex and important elements in the organization of software development. </li><li>  ‚Äú <b>Architecture and design in Agile</b> ‚Äù (Dmitry Mindra) is another very hot and poorly described topic, without an understanding of which it is impossible to make a quality project. <br>  This is only a small part of the interesting speakers and topics covered at the conference.  Also, issues of architecture and design in Agile, automation of all levels of testing, application of Code Review practices, TDD, refactoring, Continuous Integration, work with old projects and legacy code, building a process of continuous product delivery, code quality management will be considered. </li></ul></div>
