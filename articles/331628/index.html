  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everything you wanted to know about HPE Synergy Composable Infrastructure, questions and answers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In January 2017, Hewlett Packard Enterprise began to deliver the first platform for HPE Synergy composable infrastructure around the world, and today there are already a number of orders in Russia - both among large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises.  From April to June, we conducted a cycle of webinars, at which we spoke in detail about the architecture of HPE Synergy, and now we have put together a FAQ for you - of course, with answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8c7/50d/e44/8c750de44b054d8b8fc007a416375d39.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the concept of a composable infrastructure is generally new for you, we recommend that you read it in more detail (for example, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/ru/ru/integrated-systems/synergy.html">on our website</a> or by downloading the e-book <a href="https://www.hpe.com/ru/ru/resources/integrated-systems/synergy-for-dummies.html">‚ÄúHPE Synergy for Beginners‚Äù</a> ).  In addition, we invite you to view the <a href="http://p.brighttalk.com/hpe/ru/%3Fcommid%3D246079%26utm_source%3Dpost%26utm_medium%3Dsmm%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">records of all webinars</a> on HPE Synergy.  And now, in fact, questions and answers from webinars: <br><br>  <b>1. If there is no need for 5 racks (20 baskets), and 1 rack is enough (1-2 blades of baskets), is there any point in using HPE Synergy, especially if there is a static infrastructure in the organization, there is no such thing that every day everything changes?</b>

      Answer: Synergy is great for both static and dynamic infrastructures.  Any system is to some extent dynamic - new servers are added, old ones are decommissioned.  Two baskets are a great example for Synergy.  There will be 2 master modules and 2 satellite modules.  Even one Synergy basket with 6-8 servers is a normal starting solution that is economically sound.  For rack servers, we also offer a OneView based management system.  A limitation compared to Synergy / Blade would be the inability to configure network connections (SAN and LAN). <br><br>  <b>2. To create an HCI based on VMware vSAN, for each server slot you need 2 dedicated 10GbE ports for vSAN and vMotion traffic.</b>  <b>Is this possible in Synergy?</b>  <b>How many network ports on the calculator in the cart are possible in HPE Synergy, what are the ports?</b> <br><br>  Answer: If you use one pair of switches or Virtual Connect modules per basket, then each server will have 2 ports of 20 Gb / s.  Each physical port can be divided into 4 virtual (4 physical functions) and for each set its minimum guaranteed and maximum available bandwidth, 200 MB / s step.  It is impossible to leave in the amount of 20 Gb / s at the minimum guaranteed capacity (MGP).  That is, if you want to issue both vSAN and vMotion at 10 Gb / s MGPS, then this is possible, but there will be no more free band to other ports.  If this is a prerequisite, then you need to put additional switches in the basket.  If, for example, 4-5-6 Gb / s is sufficient for each of these types of traffic, you can allocate the remaining bandwidth to the control network and to productive traffic. <br><br>  <b>3. If you do not intend to use external storage, do you need to use SDS (HPE StoreVirtual or VMware vSAN) to create virtual environments?</b> <br><br>  Answer: If you need shared disk storage, then yes.  Disks from the disk module in Synergy connect directly to selected servers for exclusive use. <br><br>  <b>4. Is it possible to install diskless blades in Synergy?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Yes, you can not put the disks in the server.  And you can choose a server model without a disk backplane at all. <br><br>  <b>5. According to what protocol are the disks from the disk module D3940 connected to the computers (SAS, FC ...)?</b> <br><br>  Answer: SAS protocol using SAS switches. <br><br>  <b>6. Tell me how many Virtual Connect masters can be combined into an IRF stack?</b> <br><br>  Answer: IRF is a proprietary technology for Comware OS-based HPE Networking switches.  VC uses the MLAG protocol.  Upstream switches should use IRF, vPC, or equivalent protocols. <br><br>  <b>7. What happens if the Virtual Connect master module fails?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Each calculator (server) has 2 ports that are connected to different master modules (MM).  If one MM fails, then switching and communication with the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù will be carried out through the second MM. <br><br>  <b>8. Is it possible to connect the internal storage at the same time to several calculators?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Answer: Disks in disk modules can be distributed among all computers in the chassis, in which the disk module itself is located.  The RAID group is created by the Smart Array controller located in each computer.  One set of disks in the disk module can be provided only to one calculator. <br><br>  <b>9. Why is 3PAR and StoreVirtual used in a fully composable environment, but the latter will still be located on 3PAR?</b> <br><br>  Answer: StoreVirtual VSA can be located on the disks in the disk modules of the chassis itself.  Impose restrictions, prohibiting the connection of external arrays, it makes no sense.  Most companies use external disk arrays in their IT infrastructure.  The user has the right to choose which path to go - SDS inside Synergy or classic external arrays. <br><br>  <b>10. Why did SAS storage?</b>  <b>Why not FC?</b> <br><br>  Answer: A philosophical question.  SAS is cheaper and more versatile inside the basket.  FC or iSCSI can be recreated using some servers as controllers.  The existing example is StoreVirtual VSA.  In addition, FC requires the use of third-party switches (Brocade, Cisco), which reduces the flexibility of the overall solution. <br><br>  <b>11. Is it possible to use NVME and SAS disks together?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Yes, in the variant: NVMe - internal server disks, SAS - disks from the disk module. <br><br>  <b>12. Is it possible to extend the iSCSI factory outside the rack (logical chassis)</b> <br><br>  Answer: There are no restrictions.  If logical chassis are connected to the same network, for example, to the core switches, iSCSI traffic can be routed through an external network from the point of view of the logical chassis. <br><br>  <b>13. If you do not plan disk modules in the chassis, is the SAS switch still mandatory or can you take a slot with something else?</b> <br><br>  Answer: If disk modules are not planned, SAS switches are not needed at all.  Synergy - buildable architecture.  You can take only what you need, and in the quantity in which you need. <br><br>  <b>14. Do I understand correctly that 1 kW of electricity is output to 1 server at full load?</b> <br><br>  Answer: No.  Power consumption can be checked through Sizer for Synergy.  The Synergy calculator is a regular server in a kind of form factor.  Its power consumption does not exceed the consumption of a conventional server.  Most likely, it will be lower due to the use of common power supplies for the whole basket, which increases the energy efficiency of the solution as a whole. <br><br>  15. Is it possible to change the period of 4 minutes during which the disk module can <b>be in the open state?</b>  <b>That is, if you ‚Äúovertighten‚Äù (accidentally or intentionally), then the chassis will turn off abnormally?</b> <br><br>  Answer: 4 minutes is the guaranteed time during which the disk module can be opened.  The system does not turn off after 4 minutes, but when the critical temperature inside the chassis is reached.  Therefore, the behavior of the chassis will depend not only on the expiration of 4 minutes, but also on the temperature in the server room, modules installed in the chassis, etc. <br><br>  <b>16. Are disks from a disk module assigned arbitrarily to a server profile (different places in a disk module ‚Äî modules) or is there some kind of logic?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Answer: If possible, consistently.  If after a certain period of use, non-adjacent discs become free, they will be used.  The process can be compared to file system fragmentation.  First, successive blocks are taken, over time, the data is written into free blocks located in different places of the disk. <br><br>  <b>17. When using a disk module with VSA, which switching modules should I use?</b>  <b>Usually, only Ethernet switches are used to connect servers.</b> <br><br>  Answer: HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 Module or HPE Synergy 40Gb F8 Switch Module as master modules.  HPE Synergy 20G Interconnect Link Module or HPE Synergy 10Gb Interconnect Link Module, as satellite modules.  To connect disks from disk modules - HPE Synergy 12Gb SAS Connection Module. <br><br>  <b>18. What is the number of internal and external USB in the SY480 computer?</b> <br><br>  Answer: One external and one internal USB 3.0 <br>  Quote from QuickSpec: <br>  Micro SDHC Slot - One (1) Micro SDHC card slot <br>  USB 3.0 Port - One (1) internal USB 3.0 connector for USB flash media drive keys <br>  NOTE: The above options are intended for integrated hypervisor virtualization environments. <br>  USB 3.0 Port - One (1) external USB 3.0 connector for USB flash media drive keys <br><br>  <b>19. In which areas is it better to use Synergy?</b>  <b>For example, does it make sense to use one Synergy chassis in an organization with a standard set of services: AD, DNS, 1C, EDMS, and so on?</b>  <b>Or is it possible to do with standard rack servers?</b> <br><br>  Answer: The Synergy architecture itself is designed to fit a wide range of tasks, excluding highly specialized ones.  For example, for high performance computing, Synergy would not be a good choice.  The platform is maximally expanded, if necessary, to dynamically redistribute resources for heterogeneous tasks.  However, Synergy is also great for static landscapes.  When using the system in conjunction with the 3PAR disk array, the customer receives additional benefits due to the unified IT infrastructure management system and full automation of the deployment process of computing and storage resources.  With the tasks listed in the question, Synergy will do an excellent job. <br><br>  But you should always remember about economic feasibility.  Synergy is financially optimal compared to rack servers if the landing gear is full or almost complete.  Also, when comparing with rack servers, it is necessary to take into account architectural features, for example, using 10/40 Gb / s Ethernet and 8/16 Gb / s Fiber Channel.  The services listed in the question will most likely not require 12 servers.  If the total number of servers is from 8 pieces, and in the future we plan to increase their number, then you should consider Synergy as the basis of your server infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>20. Is it possible in Flex-20 to get a Storage Network up to 16Gb?</b>  <b>And is it planned to output Native FC 16Gb on a port from a convergent switch for Synergy?</b> <br><br>  Answer: No.  The HPE Virtual Connect SE 40Gb F8 module only supports FC 8 Gb.  FC 16 Gb support is planned for the next generation of converged modules.  Now, to connect to FC 16 Gb networks, you should use either the HPE Virtual Connect SE 16Gb FC module or the Brocade SAN switch. <br><br>  <b>21. Are maps planned with Remote DMA (RoCE, iWARP)?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Yes, they are.  In the second half of 2017 <br><br>  <b>22. Is it true that in order for everything to be ideologically correct, you need to install at least 2 chassis?</b>  <b>This is a question of using a backup tape drive and linker.</b> <br><br>  Answer: To use the Image Streamer you need at least 3 chassis for industrial use. <br><br>  <b>23. Where exactly is the created OS image stored?</b> <br><br>  Answer: The golden OS images and delta disks are stored on the internal disks of the Image Distributor (Image Streamer).  In Synergy, Image Distributors are installed in pairs.  The image library is synchronized between Distributors to prevent data loss when one of them fails.  To synchronize data between Distributors and create volume snapshots (delta disks), the StoreVirtual functionality built into Distributor is used. <br><br>  <b>24. Is there a record of seminars introducing HPE Synergy in more detail?</b> <br><br>  Answer: Yes, of course.  Records of webinars for technical specialists are available for viewing on-demand after a short registration: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/gateway/elitehpeemeademandgen/1474757/1514577%3Fpartnerref%3Dhabrahabr">Part 1.
