Weigh the pros and cons of the example of Xiaomi and LG</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last year, interest in various wearable gadgets has grown significantly.  Someone chose a smart watch for themselves, someone with pleasure wears a smart bracelet.  I was lucky to try both, so today I will share my observations about the LG Watch R smart watches and Xiaomi Mi Band 1s smart bracelet. <br><br>  Immediately it should be noted that the LG Watch R, and any other smart watches, have a large number of functions.  But Xiaomi Mi Band 1s has a price that is much better than any more or less well-known smart watches.  The question is whether all these functions are needed or does the price decide? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a96/7ef/e91/a967efe91effdc0a7bec30ba09a61d56.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      The most valuable thing in smart devices is functions.  So I defined 5 main functions, by the example of which I will compare the devices. <br><br><h2>  1. Call Notification </h2><br>  I think this is the most important and most necessary property of a smart wearable gadget.  This allows you not to miss calls, as well as keep the phone in silent mode, even without vibration.  Personally, I feel more comfortable with calls.  He vibrated something on his arm - he found the phone, answered.  And do not worry about turning off the sound in a movie or theater. <br><br>  Both devices notify about a call by means of vibration.  The difference here is that the smart watch will immediately show who is calling and you can even immediately accept or reject the call.  True, if you take it, then you scream in Kurt: ‚ÄúJust a minute, I‚Äôll only get you out of my pocket.‚Äù  :) But the bracelet has a significant advantage - it is weight.  The bracelet is much lighter than your opponent, so you practically forget about it on your hand, but the watch is impressive.  I even take them off periodically to give my hand a break (and at this time, of course, I miss calls). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07a/965/a13/07a965a13b5b6e507781e76a319b3f1a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  * It is noteworthy that they both work normally at the same time notifying about the call to 1 phone <br><br><h2>  2. Message Notification </h2><br>  In this paragraph, I mean not only SMS, but also various notifications from different applications, like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db9/4d7/456/db94d7456b6582dc0283b24b9522d165.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d2/c19/883/3d2c19883ca46523083c70232b19a124.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This function is on the second place in my chart of the most important things and again both devices cope with this task.  True, the difference is that the Xiaomi Mi Band 1s just vibrates 2 times (they say: ‚ÄúBoss, look at the phone‚Äù), and the watch still immediately displays some announcement on the screen.  That is, the clock in this case is still more convenient, since you understand from where and from whom the message.  And you can immediately poke at the screen by reading the message.  True, LG has a cant - when more than 2 messages come from one source - it no longer allows them to read, I hope someday they will correct it. <br><br>  In defense of the bracelet, I‚Äôll say that the fact that messages are reported is important.  Knowing that a message exists is much more important than knowing its contents at the same second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9da/bef/aab/9dabefaab013217534f91875afb5ac87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  3. Pulse measurement </h2><br>  Pulse measurement here is implemented using an optical sensor.  The thing is quite universal, but only to get good results, we need ideal conditions.  However, it is more likely to think here - who needs to measure the pulse at all? <br><br>  Personally, it seems to me that this is necessary for people who sometimes like to do some kind of fitness or arrange a workout for themselves.  And, with the help of a smart gadget, you can control the load.  If so, then the watch here wins that you can quickly call the function and measure the pulse on the watch itself, while to check the pulse through the bracelet, you need to find the phone and run the application there.  But the bracelet is much easier and it means that it is much more convenient to train with it. <br><br>  So we choose what is more important for you: ‚Äúquick access‚Äù or ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù, and the measurement result is still very similar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba1/5fe/24b/ba15fe24b347efb3ab1fbffd2e078cbd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  4. Smart / silent alarm </h2><br>  Another important, in my opinion, the function of smart gadgets has become an alarm clock.  Yes, the alarm clocks were always and very different, but with the advent of bracelets, the alarm clocks became smarter.  Now they are able to count the phases of sleep and gently wake up at the right time. <br><br>  The key moment for a gadget where such a function is implemented is convenience.  I‚Äôm ready to go to bed with a watch on my hands unless I am in a state of complete nonstopion, but I‚Äôm not going to take off my pants, but something light and inconspicuous is needed for every night.  So the Mi Band is the undisputed leader here and it wakes up very gently, starting to vibrate a little closer in the morning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09c/8c1/bd3/09c8c1bd38479f05c4df4f3195764a9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  5. Show time </h2><br>  Speaking of watches, you cannot miss the function of demonstrating time, and here, of course, Mibends are not at all competitors, because they do not have a screen.  However, some models are more expensive, they can still show time.  But I personally like the watch's function of changing dials, so I can always change my watch as you like.  True, I also had a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù who wrote me how much time with text.  I think this is a good option for fans to read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0db/c05/286/0dbc0528681dd913ac95c71c32f56224.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Interesting fact:</b> LG Watch R was the first watch with a really round display and looks like an ordinary watch, so some people are still very surprised when something appears on the screen and I start to carry on it with my finger. <br><br><h2>  Price </h2><br>  If you think about it, it turns out that Xiaomi Mi Band 1s worth 1200 rubles.  the highlights are not much lower than the LG Watch R, which cost somewhere around 15,000 rubles.  And in some moments bracelets are better than smart watches. <br><br>  It turns out that if you just want to try smart wearable devices, then it makes no sense to immediately buy a full-fledged good watch, and enough to buy a smart bracelet Xiaomi Mi Band 1s on AliExpress for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ta">$ 17.99</a> * (1200 rub). <br><br>  Well, if you are sure that it is convenient for you to walk with a clock on your hand, then you can safely choose a smart watch.  Among the inexpensive, but interesting from China, GT08 can be noted for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/tb">$ 22.99</a> * (1600 rubles), which more than 5000 people have already bought from this seller. <br><br>  And sometimes the watch unexpectedly motivates: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/308/11d/68c/30811d68c9a6f5eca31411a85ae2d44c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  * This is generally about pedometers, but I did not find utility in this function, except for entertainment <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
