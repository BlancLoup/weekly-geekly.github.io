      Switch's patented innovative solutions in the design, power supply, cooling systems have increased the overall energy efficiency of PUE.  Powering and Cooling Switch technologies achieve annual PUE 1.28 ratings in Las Vegas, Nev. And 1.20 in Reno, Nevada.  In addition to the standards of the Tier IV Gold Uptime Institute, Switch is the first company that received the Tier 5 Platinum reliability level or, as it is called, the Tier "Elite". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ec/f8/59ecf8f80b261490304369.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2016, Switch began construction of two solar power plants in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a total capacity of 179 MW.  These facilities will power all Switch Data Centers with 100% renewable energy, this will help avoid carbon emissions of 265,000 tons to the environment.  Switch stands guard over chemicals from the most valuable resource in the world - water.  At the initiative of the company, innovative technologies for cooling systems are being created and developed, which not only increase efficiency by more than 400%, but also save more than 600 million liters of water in just 3 years. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/aa/59edaa3f42b23255699711.png"></div><br>  Taking into account shortcomings in assessing the reliability of data centers, Switch introduces a new standard for Tier 5, which, in addition to taking into account factors such as fault tolerance, system redundancy, will take into account 30 additional ones: the lifetime of power supply systems, the location of cooling systems, the security system, the use of 100 % renewable energy.  The developers of the Uptime Institute standards agree that the time has come for a new level of reliability standard.  ‚ÄúThe various indicators in the assessment have become obsolete,‚Äù said Vince Reno, co-author of standards and former technical director of the Uptime Institute from 2009 to 2013.  ‚ÄúThe Tier 5 standard from Switch takes into account new parameters to assess the level of availability and reliability of data centers in the colocation industry.‚Äù  In 2014, Switch became the first Tier IV Gold certified company from the Uptime Institute.  Then, in 2016, it was the only colocation provider that had twice passed Tier IV Gold certification.  Switch considers the Tier 5 standard to be the first step to create a new and open Data Foundation Data Foundation (DCSF).  The DCSF will be an independent, non-profit standards body headed by leading technology companies and industry experts. <br><br>  The new Tier 5 standard provides: <br>  - data center can work without water (for cooling) <br>  - identification of substances that pollute the outside air and quick response <br>  - continuous cooling <br>  - fault tolerance of critical equipment <br>  - backup power system in N + 1 <br>  - backup power system is constantly on monitoring <br>  - 100 hours of redundancy backup power <br>  - 10 operators available online for all customers <br>  - protection against D / DoS <br>  - each rack in the server under protection <br>  - access to systems and networks is guarded <br>  - monitoring, motion sensors, video surveillance systems for office space and entrance, 15 images per second are saved, records are stored for 90 days <br>  - external walls of the object without windows, made of concrete <br>  - reinforced steel entrance doors <br>  - no flammable materials in the machine rooms and corridors <br>  - there are no high-risk objects in the neighborhood (for example, flammable, explosive or nuclear objects) <br>  - powered by 100% renewable sources <br>  - for 12 months, the average value of PUE is less than 1.3 <br><br><h3>  Switch PRIME - SuperNAP rebranding </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ec/9e/59ec9e5103341697920834.png"><br><br>  ATLANTA.  Switch in May 2017 announced its intention to build a campus PRIME Data Center area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 93 thousand square meters.  meters in Atlanta to meet the needs of its customers in the Southeastern United States.  Called ‚ÄúKeep,‚Äù the Atlanta campus will be the fourth campus of the Switch PRIMES project, with campuses located throughout the United States.  This is Las Vegas, Tahoe Reno (Nevada) and Grand Rapids (Michigan). <br><br>  PRIME serves the relevant region: LAS VEGAS (Core Campus) serves as the PRIME center for Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the rest of the Southwest United States.
