  <section class="page js-page"><h1>KidsReview.ru - entry with children is allowed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many activities for children in big cities.  But there are problems with the notification: for some exhibitions I, for example, find out only from the advertisement in the subway, and usually already overdue.  A daughter of four years old requires spectacle.  How not to miss anything?  Question. <br><br>  You can answer it in different ways.  There are many websites where they publish information about upcoming performances, master classes, exhibitions, holidays, but, as a rule, it is framed unsuccessfully: there is not enough information, feedback, maps, finally.  The creators of the site KidsReview.ru went ahead and wrote an application for iOS, where convenience is really great. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>The very beginning</b> </h4>  The app is easy to find in the appstore at the request of kidsreview.  It is completely free, but for work requires access to the Internet.  This is understandable: it makes no sense to clutter up the memory of the iPhone or iPad with tons of information about events in many cities, and updates in the calendar are happening with an alarming frequency. <br>  ‚ÄúIn many cities, is this, as usual, Moscow and Peter?‚Äù, Not one malicious reader will ask.  Of course, I will answer, and also Novosibirsk, Perm, Vladivostok, Kaliningrad, other cities of Russia and even the capital of Ukraine.  And this list is constantly updated.  Now, even on a trip, you don‚Äôt have to think about how to occupy the children.  There will be another problem - how to manage to see all the interesting things! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c23/a50/b38/c23a50b38ed4399652ec86b751fcb6cb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>The most important thing</b> </h4>  So, thanks to which this application - ‚ÄúMasthev‚Äù for any parent, lies in the first of five items in the main menu: ‚ÄúNext‚Äù.  This, of course, is not a team of disobedient fumes, but an overview of interesting places and events near you.  Remember, when installing agreed to determine your location?  That's the same thing. <br>  Places on the map are marked with standard ‚Äúticks‚Äù, name them as you wish.  Clicking opens detailed information about what will happen there.  You can view the events and the list - for those who do not need a card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c1/aa8/986/7c1aa898693daadd77184849bdb9f9c4.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/780/173/0dd/7801730ddd224351213a352af013249c.jpg">

      For those who are free to move, section "Bill" is intended.  All interesting places and events with a detailed description and distance from your location, as well as offers from service partners (for example, discounts on air tickets) come here.  So that the parents of the infants do not read the messages about the party for older students, they can be sorted by age: 0-6, 7-15, 16+ years, and for families with several children, you can view all the information at once.  I would note that it would be more convenient for many to use smaller age groups (for example, 0-3, 4-7, 8-12, 13-15, 15+), and to send activities for children of different ages into several categories at the same time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f6a/4b1/8d9/f6a4b18d9b215f5d59ca71b96a20faa8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d4/7bd/e38/9d47bde38c72dcc9602aae8a7571ba00.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23c/d0b/fea/23cd0bfeab04e008cf60728ad803ca8a.jpg"><br><br>  The point coverage of events "is engaged" in the section "Journal".  Here are collected independent reviews and photo reviews of places.  An example is a review of all the covered skating rinks in Moscow, where there are children's skates for hire, or of all the stables in St. Petersburg, where children can learn to ride a horse.  As well as book reviews, photo reviews of theaters, museums, parks, shops and other interesting places.  Useful information can be immediately shared with friends on Facebook or Vkontakte.  Integration with social networks is excellent, not a single announcement has gone ‚Äúinto the milk‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af1/25c/963/af125c96312079ae561f80321cf765d0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/826/aed/ef0/826aedef0da0d5e2dfa1f13b1248425c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Most useful</b> </h4>  Events are good, but where, for example, can you sit and have dinner with a family with small children?  I open the ‚ÄúDirectory‚Äù section, there are ‚ÄúRestaurants‚Äù in it - and voila: I find out that there is a children's room on the corner in the cafe, and there are free animators in the restaurant overlooking the park on weekends.  (This, by the way, is not those who draws cartoons, but mass media entertainers who paint children‚Äôs faces with an akvagrim, plane long-haired dogs and do other useful things while parents rest.) <br>  The handbook also contains information on medical centers, shops, education, sports, services and leisure.  You can add your own options, leave reviews and read other people.  Again, it is convenient that opinions about the clinic and the cafe can be read in the same application, and not on two separate sites. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/376/aa5/bf9/376aa5bf9de303c8bf35fddbe1d407b4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Total</b> </h4> The application turned out to be extremely successful.  By the nature of my ‚Äúmother's‚Äù activity, I had seen similar services before, but they were not informative and certainly did not count the distance from the threshold to the threshold.  A small revision (separation by age, the ability to comment on events in the "Journal", leave notes, where he has already been) - and you can take money for the service.  But it is better, probably, to get off with unobtrusive advertising :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182766/</a></p>
