  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Registration of sites: now for 1000 rubles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several months already, the state power in Russia has been selflessly devising how to embrace the favorite cluster, IT, more reliably.  There are payment restrictions, locks without a trial, and well-known excavations of servers for a long time.  New trend - <b>registration</b> .  There are already 2 such bills, one has already been passed in the first reading by the State Duma, the second is hanging between the Government and the Federation Council. <br><br>  And here - meet - the third! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is called ‚ÄúOn the creation of sites and placing information on them,‚Äù introduced by a member of the Federation Council from the Kirov region, a certain Oleg Kazakovtsev.  I probably missed something, and this is a prominent figure in the IT community, a beacon of science and business, an expert on the problems and aspirations of a simple Russian IT specialist.  Shame on me, illiterate. <br><br>  The most remarkable part of this law, which certainly distinguishes it from all others, was the offer to site owners to independently pay all state expenses for the creation and maintenance of the register.  While we are talking about a one-time state duty in the amount of 1000 rubles during registration, but I have no doubt that those who wish to make this payment annually will appear soon enough.  Yes, the sanction for not registering for 6 months is simple: blocking through the RKN.

      How simple it is, damn it!  In RuNet only about 6 million sites.  1000r each - it will be 6 000 000 000 rubles.  Under 200 million dollars.  Like a bush. <br>  Who there doubted that we have ‚Äústrong business executives‚Äù up there?  Strong unequivocally, and economic ones! <br><br>  At first, the state elephant in the china shop slightly trampled on individual entrepreneurs, having accidentally thinned them out almost in half, now is the turn of the webmaster?  And this ... "specialist", before crawling into this topic, did not think how much the number of sites in runet would decrease? <br><br>  I personally have several dozen sites registered with me.  Almost all of them are non-commercial, they are not monetized.  They lie quietly on one of the servers, they don‚Äôt ask, people go there, read something, write something.  Apparently, they are considered useful for themselves.  I just looked at one - 1200 unique per day, 5.5 pages viewed per average visitor.  There is no advertising there at all, the site does not sell anything, the topic is completely non-commercial.  For the prolongation of domains I pay 95 rubles a year - and damn it, I don‚Äôt feel sorry.  But to register, and even for 1000r - damn bald!  I‚Äôll rather strangle them all, except for the last couple, which are of particular interest to me and which will have to be re-registered with .com. <br><br>  It's amazing how far in advance the author of the <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/advice/9-point-5-rules-fot-it-business-in-russia/">9.5 rules of</a> conducting IT business in Russia turned out to be.  Yes, it was already then great to be true, but still not so much!  It seems that the authorities took these rules for themselves as a roadmap. <br><br>  Link to <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/568058">news</a> about the bill. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216991/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216991/</a></p>
