Investors want to see and feel something already working, and even better already making money. <br><br>  But working and moreover earning projects all the same begin with a good team and a good idea.  Who and how can help those good people who have a good idea for a startup? <br><br>  We decided to help ideas by doing.  <a href="http://glavstart.ru/">Glavstart is</a> ready to invest in projects at the idea stage, which takes up to 12 months and up to 100 thousand dollars to bring to the finished product stage.

      And now tell you more about this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What ideas are considered? <br><ul><li>  IT and Internet projects, which take up to 12 months and up to 100 thousand dollars to bring them to the state of the finished product.  The optimal planned dates are 9 months and 50-70 thousand, which in reality will most likely turn into those same 12 months and 75-100 thousand: (By ‚Äúproduct readiness‚Äù I mean, as a rule, TTM (Time To Market) - time to large-scale market entry, that is, technological readiness, infrastructure readiness and successful completion of a real-life test on the first users / clients. </li><li>  Projects that have good growth prospects are primarily in terms of the size of the audience.  Monetization plans are useful, but it is worth understanding that at this stage they have an approximation of plus or minus 100 kilometers. </li><li>  A serious plus: having your own ideas on the project. </li></ul><br>  What are the authors of ideas considered? <br><ul><li>  Authors (or authors) of ideas must personally possess one or more competencies necessary for the implementation of key components of the project: technological, marketing or business. </li><li>  Among the authors of the project should be a person who is able to understand the principles of work of all components of the project and is ready to organize the work of the project as a whole. </li><li>  A serious plus: having a team, not just one person. </li></ul><br>  What needs to be done to get your idea reviewed? <br><ul><li>  Send an application with the presentation of the idea and the team at idea (at) glavstart.ru. <br>  The application can be sent in free form.  The main thing is that it a) tells the essence of the idea why it is cool and has good prospects, b) tells about the authors, why you think that you can implement this project, and whether the authors have any ideas on the subject of the project. </li><li>  Take part in one of the <a href="http://startupweekend.ru/">Startup Weekend</a> in your area. <br>  Only on the Weekend you have the opportunity to show yourself, your abilities and capabilities in real work - in the 54-hour marathon.  We appreciate your ability to talk about your idea and the ability to listen to others, the ability to defend their opinions and perceive others, the ability to make adjustments to their plans and highlight priorities, and just human qualities. <br>  In addition, on the Weekend you will have a unique opportunity to talk with experts and refine your idea with their help.  Willingness of the mentor to participate in the project will be its serious advantage. <br>  You can learn about upcoming events in your area and register an idea for participation in it on <a href="http://startupweekend.ru/">the Weekend website</a> . </li></ul><br>  You have a chance to get an offer to participate in our investment program after the final presentations of projects at the Weekend itself.  Financing itself will begin after receiving from the project plans: goals and deadlines for the first stage, including a plan for exactly what you are going to spend the first money on. <br><br>  The first stage of financing is supposed to be about 10 thousand dollars, which should be used to obtain the first prototypes, demonstrating the work of the key components of the project.  The objectives of the first stage: to show the performance of the proposed technological solutions and the competence of the team, as well as to prove the ability to get concrete results. <br><br>  After successful completion of the first stage, plans and terms for further development are specified, as well as the volumes of the next stages of financing <br><br>  We immediately agree with the project on a full sowing investment round for a period of up to 12 months.  Stage financing is necessary in order to fix the control points of product development, without getting stuck in long-term construction. <br><br>  The next stages after our sowing investments will most likely be the stage of venture investments aimed at financing a full-fledged and large-scale market entry of the project.  We will help you prepare for this stage and assist in the successful selection of a venture investor. <br><br>  Answers to immediate questions <br><ul><li>  Q: Why do we need investment in ideas?  If there is a good idea, then it is better to develop it yourself, come to an investor with a ready project and get a lot of money. <br>  A: What to do if you yourself do not know how to do everything (at least equally well), but do you need people to implement the project?  Search for them among friends, but where is the guarantee that people who are ready to devote their free time to your project are sufficiently qualified?  And if they also want their share in the project - is it better to give them a share than an investor?  Why better? <br>  If you try to do everything yourself, you can lose a very important thing - time.  Ideas, as is well known, are in the air, therefore, those who came up with the first chances of success are not the people who invented them first.  And the first to sometimes do something is money that helps to attract qualified specialists to work on a project or to allocate more of its time to work on it. </li><li>  Q: Do you want to get a controlling stake in this project? <br>  A: No, we do not want. </li><li>  Q: We are ready to give you 10% in our wonderful idea for 100 thousand dollars.  Will you take it? <br>  A: No, thanks.  We believe that 10% for investments in a project at the stage of a bare idea is too little, no matter how bright the prospects would be in theory. </li><li>  Q: And we need a million dollar investment.  Investing? <br>  A: No, thanks.  We invest in projects that are at the stage of an idea or an early prototype, which requires up to 12 months for development and up to 100 thousand dollars of financing.  And better is less :) </li><li>  Q: We are interested.  What to do? <br>  A: Send an application for idea (at) glavstart.ru and take part in the <a href="http://startupweekend.ru/">nearest weekend</a> in your region. </li></ul><br>  See you, <br>  Arkady Moreynis </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112024/</a></p>
