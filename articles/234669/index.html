Members of the delegation of the first in Russia private robot-technology park Navigator Campus and their friends went on an excursion to this center.  So, share what you see. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d41/29c/171/d4129c1711254791aa46066fd3efae14.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb6/38e/ba3/fb638eba38314244b5e2066a341ba50c.JPG">

      This is what the entrance group looks like, in which Zinin Oleg Vladimirovich, Deputy Director of ‚ÄúKAI-Laser‚Äù met our delegation.  He spoke about existing customers and orders (mainly large industrial and oil enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan), as well as the possibilities of technology and the future of lasers in Russia.  ‚ÄúWhat will the development of this sphere give us?‚Äù We asked.  We were assured that the development of the complex would allow small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the production cycle of large enterprises by outsourcing the production of components and, as a result, the efficiency of the economy as a whole would increase.  Is this how we decided to make sure ourselves? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/939/0be/f20/9390bef20a23415ca2bb7136137aff0c.png"><br><br>  So let's start with the improvement of this temple of Athena - the goddess of knowledge, arts and crafts.  The center houses 11 complexes based on fiber lasers of various power, using all types of laser processing of materials - tick and hybrid welding, cutting, surfacing, marking, cleaning, milling of the material.  The power of lasers is from 20 W to 30 kW. <br><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/doc1164704_323161772%3Fhash%3D3e2304f4d0eced0b35%26dl%3Dc6c6dcfd809609959c">List and characteristics of the main equipment in the center</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b9/75f/a50/8b975fa500eb4c84971bd52d3bca8d3a.png"><br><br>  full equipment specifications are available here: <br><br>  439.5 million rubles were spent on equipping the center - 60% from the federal budget, 40% from the budget of the Republic of Tatarstan. <br>  KAI-Laser engineers have set ambitious plans related to the technological development of the engineering industry in Tatarstan and Russia. <br>  Armed with common sense, versatility and uniqueness of fiber laser technology, the best minds of Kazan have found use in heavy industry.  The use of laser technology will increase efficiency and reduce production costs.  Scientific research on the basis of the new center will concern the application of laser technologies for processing composite materials and the development of laser additive technologies. <br>  For example, the rector of ‚ÄúKNITU-KAI‚Äù in one of the interviews hinted that the center plans to develop processing technologies for composite materials and additive technologies - creating parts by building metal from powders (a unique piece for our country!).  Laser cutting is characterized by the absence of mechanical impact on the material being processed.  A powerful laser beam focused at a focal point with a size of 0.1 mm and a few kW allows you to cut almost any material, regardless of their thermophysical properties. <br><br>  Laser radiation, due to its versatility, has received great demand in such types of technological processes as: cutting, welding, heat treatment, alloying, piercing holes, turning, milling.  This range of work laser equipment is not limited and every day is used in new areas, replacing outdated equipment.  Not far off, laser bread slicers, comrades! <br>  The laser today is a proven working tool.  The demand for laser technology is constantly growing mainly because they produce results that are significantly higher compared with traditional methods of processing materials. <br>  So, with what equipment we managed to get acquainted with the tour: <br>  Laser cutting of blanks: a laser laser tube cutting module <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3f/5dc/58e/d3f5dc58eec94cb8bd2b4e0ef429c765.png"><br><br>  The module for automatic laser cutting is designed for cutting pipes.  The system allows to make figured cutting of pipes with a diameter of up to 190 mm and a length of up to 3000 mm. <br>  This machine is equipped with a 6 kW fiber laser with a 100 ¬µm transport fiber.  The essence of the technology: the laser beam is formed in the laser radiation source (resonator) and directed through a mirror or transport fiber into the cutting head of the machine, where it is focused to a point with a very small diameter and high power using a lens.  The focused laser beam hits the sheet metal and melts it. <br>  Due to these parameters, this module has several advantages over other types of metal cutting: <br>  - clean cut, <br>  - the possibility of cutting thin-walled pipes, <br>  - high accuracy, <br>  - lack of thermal deformations, <br>  - lack of additional mechanical processing of edges. <br>  Thanks to these advantages, cut parts can easily be assembled without additional interventions. <br><br>  Next - automatic laser cutting machine profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/774/0da/aad/7740daaade17457c8816505f94092822.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/998/a91/33a/998a9133a7e5455fb195647d82031f42.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62e/eaa/09e/62eeaa09e9814344ba2bb27e2042a151.JPG"><br><br>  They allow you to make figured cutting of any profile with a thickness of up to 200 mm and a length of up to 6000 m. In the process of cutting, under the influence of a laser beam, the material melts, ignites, evaporates and is blown out by a stream of gas.  Cutting width less than 1 mm, allows with a minimum thermal effect on the main material with high precision to produce cutting blanks. <br><br>  Then we got acquainted with the equipment for laser welding, it is performed by a laser processing module for dimensional products based on a fiber laser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/876/631/71a/87663171a6794895a75ddf475a6f79bc.JPG"><br><br>  This is manual hydraulic welding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/822/9b9/27f/8229b927ff6d42ad994384400d44f274.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/846/b5f/6bb/846b5f6bba5046e4adff483ee8b460cf.JPG"><br><br>  And this is a robotic mite welding complex. <br>  Installation LaserWeld 6R60-L6000 is designed for automatic laser welding of dimensional products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7be/a74/7b8/7bea747b85f846aaa0e210e140d32c7b.JPG"><br><br>  The facility is equipped with a 6 kW fiber laser manufactured by IRE-Polyus, to support the technological process of laser welding.  The control of the machine is carried out with the help of a specialized control panel that provides the entire cycle of control of the machine. <br>  Compared to arc welding, laser welding has several advantages: <br>  - deep penetration with the effect of ‚Äúdagger penetration‚Äù, <br>  - allows you to process products with a thickness of up to 10 mm without cutting edges for welding; <br>  - welding is performed in one pass; <br>  - welding is performed with minimal geometric deformations and stresses due to the minimum thermal effects; <br>  - increased welding speed (from 1 to 10 m / min). <br>  Laser welding provides high performance, efficiency of the process and the competitiveness of technology compared with other methods of welding.  Laser welding technology is universal and suitable for welding a wide range of materials and thicknesses. <br>  The setup uses a highly efficient ytterbium fiber laser with a power of up to 6 kW, a laser efficiency of more than 40%.  Laser radiation is transmitted to the welding head through a separate flexible transport fiber cable with a length of up to 15 m. <br>  And the last, most "spectacular" exhibit - laser cutting of mounting holes in the finished product - a laser processing module for parts of complex shapes (5D) based on a fiber laser <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48d/a63/d5c/48da63d5caac46278d7fa913db5d9677.JPG"><br><br>  Someone called it "Autobot", this module impressed us most!  The younger brother of ‚ÄúBumblebee‚Äù can not only turn everything around into a flame, and then into dust, but also cuts three-dimensional parts of complex geometric shapes with a vertical axis of rotation (axis of geometric symmetry or part mounting axis).  The maximum overall dimensions of the part are 2000 mm in diameter and 550 mm in height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/2c0/a19/2c72c0a1903d427e87db87e93de54e23.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66b/165/c98/66b165c98b27478cacc152b9ff95d5ef.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59e/dca/d63/59edcad63df84719a5eca804b3dcf5a9.JPG"><br><br>  This module is equipped with a 5 kW fiber laser, which allows laser cutting with high quality edges of a wide range of materials and thicknesses. <br>  The automatic cutting module comes with a protective cabin.  To monitor the laser cutting process, protective transparent windows from laser radiation are installed. <br><br>  And all these treasures lie "under the side" for Tatarstan engineers and businessmen!  It is already used by the largest enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan, and Navigator Campus plans to cooperate with KAI-Laser in the implementation of its upcoming major projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234669/</a></p>
