It is designed to reduce the fee for the transfer of funds. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/425133/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d9/s5/ve/d9s5vepjik4ctmpzjl4hzxzhbei.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1371471">Pxhere</a> / <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1371471">pd</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  How cross-border payments work </h2><br>  Cross Border Payment is a financial transaction that is <a href="https://home.bluesnap.com/snap-center/blog/how-cross-border-payments-work-in-ecommerce/">conducted</a> between organizations located in different countries.  Usually, banks are responsible for this, organizing the procedure for transferring information about users using systems like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT">SWIFT</a> .  SWIFT does not transfer money, it sends messages with information about transactions between banks.  This approach, although it works for almost half a century (SWIFT was established in 1973), still has several disadvantages:

    <ul><li>  <b>High commissions.</b>  The user, whether a company or an individual, is charged a fee for the transfer of funds.  Given that this is a multi-step process and the user's money <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-cross-border-transaction-fees-so-high">passes through several banks</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2591%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">payment systems</a> , each of which can take its own ‚Äúshare‚Äù, the final amount of the commission can be quite impressive. <br><br>  At the same time, banks and payment systems work with personal data of users, because recently they have to spend extra efforts on <a href="https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/cross-border-payment-compliance-know-gdpr-kicks-off/">meeting the requirements of GDPR</a> .  In theory, this could result in increased commissions to cover the costs of introducing new systems and tools. </li><li>  <b>Translation takes a long time.</b>  Transactions are slow because the approval at the banks of the sender and the recipient takes several hours, or even days.  This is partly due to the "fatigue" of the technologies used.  The same SWIFT was originally based on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584">Telex</a> technology.  Other translation service providers also <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/publ/moneyandcredit/uberoy_01_13.pdf">base</a> their work model on telex or even telegraph. </li><li>  <b>There is a threat to data security.</b>  According to the ThreatMetrix <a href="https://www.scmagazineuk.com/cross-border-transactions-low-hanging-fruit-attackers/article/1472747">study</a> , in the first quarter of 2018, attackers launched a billion organized bot-attacks on payment systems.  At the same time, cybercriminals attacked cross-border payment systems 30% more often than ‚Äúlocal‚Äù banking. </li></ul><br><h2>  How can a telecom operator solve these problems? </h2><br>  The telecommunications operator LG UPlus has begun work on a cross-border payment blockchain platform CCPS, which solves at least some of these difficulties.  CCPS operates in networks of mobile operators and performs cash transactions in real time. <br><br>  Thus, it is assumed that the platform <a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2018/09/133_255620.html">will speed up</a> transactions between customers of different mobile operators and eliminate the commission.  LG UPlus has already entered into a partnership agreement with the Far EasTone Telecommunications telecom company from Taiwan and the Japanese SoftBank operator. <br><br>  The blockchain platform itself is being developed by TBCASoft, an American startup from Silicon Valley.  The payment system will operate using the Rich Communication Services ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services">RCS</a> ) protocol, an advanced analogue of SMS that can transmit multimedia data and perform <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">service discovery</a> .  The protocol was already tested by SoftBank <a href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/group/sbm/news/press/2018/20180912_01/">in mid-September</a> for P2P payments between mobile operators. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.ccn.com/lgs-mobile-carrier-to-offer-blockchain-payments-for-international-travelers/">to</a> representatives of SoftBank, at the expense of RCS, customers of the companies mentioned will be able to buy goods and services using the application on a mobile gadget while traveling in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.  In this case, they will not have to change the currency in the bank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/et/je/voetjeaayx3kzhfaapxfwz-pf9o.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Wikimedia / <a href="">Santeri Viinam√§ki</a> / <a href="">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  The launch of the system is scheduled for 2019.  But in fairness, we note that before its global implementation is still far away.  For this, the blockchain technology is not yet widely spread, and only individual companies are working on its development in the telecom industry.  For example, the corresponding consortium - Carrier Blockchain Study Group (CBSG) - <a href="https://disruptive.asia/carrier-blockchain-study-group-adds-six/">appeared</a> only last year. <br><br><h2>  Similar solutions </h2><br>  The development of a system for cross-border transfers based on blockchains is also being <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3233187/mobile-wireless/fintech-builds-on-blockchain-for-international-mobile-payments.html">carried out</a> at IBM.  The IT giant has deployed the system in its own IBM Blockchain cloud to create blockchain networks.  The company plans to provide a platform for transferring money between countries in the Asia-Pacific region and the UK. <br><br>  Together with IBM, KlickEx, a New Zealand-based company that provides financial services to the countries of Oceania, and Stellar, an organization that developed an open source blockchain platform for financial services, are working on the project. <br><br>  Stellar is also <a href="https://www.transfer-to.com/moneytransfer/news/1137/TransferTo-partners-with-Stellarorg-to-bolster-international-money-transfers">developing a</a> joint project with TransferTo.  They plan to provide a system for the transfer of money abroad using mobile networks for residents of 70 countries. <br><br>  The participants of the CBSG consortium (LG UPlus is among them) note that such payment systems are just the starting point for the distribution of blockchain solutions in the telecommunications industry.  Next, the company will develop systems for the identification and authentication of users. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS A few additional materials from the blog VAS Experts:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/budushhee-uslug-operatorov-svyazi/">The future of carrier services: what does the client need?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/skat-dpi/roskomnadzor-gotovit-mexanizm-blokirovki-ipv6/">Roskomnadzor is preparing an IPv6 blocking mechanism</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/ekonomiya-na-spichkax-i-neskolko-sposobov-vystrelit-sebe-v-nogu-kriticheskie-oshibki-v-stroitelstve-setej-operatorov-svyazi/">Shot in the leg: critical errors in the construction of networks of telecom operators</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425133/</a></p>
