    <hr><br><h2>  Audio Podcasts </h2><hr><br><h3>  Sound on Sound </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundonsound">SoundCloud</a> ] </h4><br>  This is a podcast of the eponymous British audio magazine, which has been published monthly since 1985.  Although the podcast serves as a supplement to the main product, it remains a completely independent show.  To get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa podcast, you can visit <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/">the magazine‚Äôs website</a> or its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/soundonsoundvideo">YouTube channel</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundonsound/podcast-oct-2017">Conversational</a> shows on the SoundCloud site are irregular.  According to the editors, it depends on the availability of free time for the authors.  When they do find an opportunity to meet at the microphone, the discussions relate to various devices and activities. <br><br>  The magazine is a regular participant in conferences in the field of music technology, such as AES, NAMM, NAB, IBC and Musikmesse. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Sound </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/sou-zvuk-vigorous-space/id731089874">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/">Web version</a> ] </h4><br>  This is a podcast about the world of Hi-Fi in Russian, which has been coming out for 4 years with the support of Audiomania.  Initially, the main theme of the issues was the debunking of the myths that had accumulated over the years of "ethereal silence" on the subject of audio technology. <br><br>  The podcast went beyond the scope of this issue in the first year of work and now it focuses on original topics - how an audio equipment store <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00030">selects an</a> assortment, how cinemas <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00039">are built</a> , how soundtracks are <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00032">created for</a> films. <br><br>  For more immersion in the ‚ÄúSound‚Äù we offer to get acquainted with the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/295003/">digest</a> of the 42 issues that we made last year.  You can see how the podcast recording process looks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDgQwh5KmQcE">here</a> . <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Beginner Audiophile </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/beginner-audiophile-hifi-gear-reviews-stereo-hi-end-audio/id1209604270">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/beginner-audiophile-hifi-gear-reviews-stereo-hi-end-audio">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  This is the case when the title perfectly describes the content.  For their audiophile listeners, the presenters tell how to choose the right technique, saving money, and find out from the experts how the expensive audio equipment <a href="http://beginneraudiophile.blubrry.com/2017/11/28/18-beginner-audiophile-returns-new-york-audio-show-breakdown-listener-qa/">differs</a> from cheap analogs. <br><br>  In a series of recent shows, the presenters <a href="http://beginneraudiophile.blubrry.com/2018/02/16/21-gear-gear-and-more-gear-ces-wrapup-part-ii-with-harris-fogel/">shared</a> their impressions of what they saw at CES.  The podcast is only a year old, but the positive feedback from listeners on iTunes <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/beginner-audiophile-hifi-stereo-hi-end-audio/id1209604270">suggests</a> that the presenters are trying in vain. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Home theater geeks </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/home-theater-geeks-mp3/id348527831">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/home-theater-geeks-mp3-46729">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  Archived entries by Scott Wilkinson (Scott Wilkinson), editor of the industry-famous portal on home theater systems and the film industry <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/">AVSForum</a> .  The podcast has been released since 2009.  Scott <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/home-theater-geeks/episodes/1">'s</a> very first guest <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/home-theater-geeks/episodes/1">was</a> Tomlinson Holman, who, together with George Lucas <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX">THX</a> , developed a set of requirements for high-quality home theater systems.  Much attention in the issues is traditionally paid to audio equipment. <br><br>  In October last year, Scott <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/forum/138-avs-foruma-podcasts/2923514-home-theater-geeks-canceled.html">addressed</a> the readers of the publication with a message about the suspension of the show.  According to him, this decision is dictated solely by economic reasons.  Now all 373 releases can be slowly heard on one of the podcasting platforms.  However, Scott gave hope for a possible revival of Home Theater Geeks in a different format in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5x/qh/yk/5xqhykv7pedrppt_ggv3xrnnjyk.png"><br>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150684305%40N05/38972737634/">Photo</a> m1try / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></font></i> <br><br><hr><br><h3>  BeardyCast </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/beardycast-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0/id868222886">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://podtail.com/podcast/-beardycast-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582/">Podtail</a> ] </h4><br>  Russian-language podcast, which can not be said that it is completely devoted to the sound.  More precisely, audio equipment is a rare guest in this program, but given the small number of shows for connoisseurs of Hi-Fi in Russian, Borodokast deserves a mention in this compilation. <br><br>  He belongs to the category of entertainment shows.  The presenters mainly discuss technology news, movies, and simply the hottest information channels.  Sometimes airtime goes to audio equipment.  In a recent issue <a href="http://beardycast.com/2018/02/13/podcast/beardycast-144/">, the</a> issue of the audio market was <a href="http://beardycast.com/2018/02/13/podcast/beardycast-144/">raised</a> . <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Soundtrack Podcasts </h2><br><hr><br><h3>  How Do Games </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%258E%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258B/id560881209">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/series-19282">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  Another podcast in Russian in this collection.  Sergey Galenkin and Mikhail Kuzmin, well known in game devs, discuss various aspects of game development, from game design to legal issues.  Among other things, the collection has a <a href="https://kdicast.com/e/199-cnova-o-muzyike-i-zvuke-v-igrah/">series of entertaining podcasts</a> about music in games. <br><br>  The authors attracted composers and sound producers to the discussion.  From these releases, for example, you can learn about the work of the <a href="https://griaudio.ru/">professional association of</a> Russian-language sound producers, sound designers and composers who work in the interests of the gaming industry. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  SoundWorks Collection </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/soundworks-collection/id685229051">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://soundcloud.com/soundworkscollection">SoundCloud</a> ] </h4><br>  This podcast owes its appearance to director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2353869/">Michael Coleman</a> .  A few years ago, he did a series of video interviews about movie sounds with Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, and other famous directors. <br><br>  The podcast-shaped SoundWorks Collection continues the theme of the role of the soundtrack and sounds in various productions.  In this case, Michael works with the same team that helped him with the preparation of the first interview.  A typical release is a story about the work process of the film crew responsible for the sounds on the set. <br><br>  <a href="http://soundworkscollection.com/news/the-sound-of-the-shape-of-water-oscar-podcast">One of the recent podcasts is</a> dedicated to Guillermo del Toro's The Form of Water and the role of the sound of the monster‚Äôs breathing as one of the tools for creating the desired film atmosphere.  Another - <a href="http://soundworkscollection.com/news/the-sound-of-star-wars-the-last-jedi-oscar-podcast">talks</a> about the soundtrack of the recently released "Star Wars".  This release will be especially interesting to skeptics who at least once resented because of the sounds of explosions in space. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Super Marcato Bros.  Video Game Music Podcast </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  A podcast that discusses and analyzes the best soundtracks for video games of different generations.  The show has already accumulated an impressive archive - more than 300 issues have been released.  The podcast is especially valuable because in almost every release you can hear melodies that evoke fond memories of console games from childhood. <br><br>  However, most of the soundtracks and games mentioned are known either to big Game Boy fans from the 90s, or to the experts of the composers who created the soundtracks at the same times, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Kanno">Yoko Kanno</a> .  Presenters <a href="http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2017/12/10/episode-297-yoko-kanno">dedicate</a> entire issues to such authors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/xj/ze/fgxjze1jcihcmks_vhkwhrqwq9q.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/vinyl-record-19951/">Tookapic</a> <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo-license/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Vinyl Podcasts </h2><br><hr><br><h3>  The Vinyl Me Please </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/the-vinyl-me-please-podcast/id1027093999">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/the-vinyl-me-please-podcast-1392921">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  Podcast of the same name <a href="http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/">magazine</a> and <a href="https://app.vinylmeplease.com/">store</a> .  It is rather a musical show, rather than informative.  However, there are also philosophical editions, for example, <a href="http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/sounds-good-why-we-love-sad-music-during-fall/">arguments</a> about why in the fall you want to listen to sad music. <br><br>  Typically, Tyler Bastow, the podcast presenter and co-founder of the project, discusses new albums with artists and composers and recommends new recordings to the audience.  The podcast helps vinyl sound lovers track decent records and replenish their collection. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  The vinyl guide </h3><br><h4>  [ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-vinyl-guide/id1048766030">iTunes</a> ] [ <a href="https://player.fm/series/the-vinyl-guide-1554544">Player.fm</a> ] </h4><br>  Another conversational podcast about vinyl.  His host Nate Goyer is a record collector.  Together with musicians and technicians, he tells the story of music and recalls rare records that any collector probably dreams of. <br><br>  Nate's guests deserve special attention - for example, in December he <a href="http://www.thevinylguide.com/episodes/ep105-don-was-president-of-blue-note-records">talked</a> about career and music with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Was">Don Waz</a> , head of the iconic jazz label <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Note_Records">Blue Note Records</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Our other selections on GT:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/298677/">Reading on the weekend: memoirs, essays and music studies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/298465/">10 popular science podcasts about sound and work in the field of sound recording</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  <i>A couple of articles on sound and music from the "Hi-Fi World":</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5556.html">You never dreamed of, or 5 unusual versions of well-known songs</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5551.html">Music in movies and TV shows that we hear too often</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5517.html">Synesthesia: Do you hear the sound while watching the animation?</a> </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410801/</a></p>
