      So the understanding came to me that it was time to change something in my life.  No sooner said than done.  Left work.  Became a freelancer.  His own master.  Furnished his office, everything is convenient, no one bothers.  The cat is kicked out of the door, supplied with food and valuable instructions for its use - now you can focus on work.  But, all the same four walls.  Still tied to the place. <br><br>  Again, work ... Life passes by.  I decided to change the situation.  I went to the resort.  Road luggage.  I managed to work on the road for half an hour.  Well, how to work - read the mail, answered a couple of letters - that's all.  While settling in, looking for a hotel - so lost two more working days.  Okay, damn it.  I will work a couple of days late - I'll make it up. <br><br>  A week has passed.  Liked.  Why stop there?  Road to the next travel point.  The train, the laptop in the evening of the first day of the villages ... Goodbye a couple of days of productive work.  Eh ... Okay.  It's worth it.  We live once. <br><br>  That's how I started spending most of the time on the road.  Suitcases, trains, buses, search for a place to sleep and rest.  There are cockroaches, there are noisy neighbors in the room.  Got sick.  Working in such an environment is almost impossible.  Constantly distracting something, knocking out of the schedule and the flow of thoughts. <br><br>  Could not resist, returned home.  ‚ÄúOn the suitcases‚Äù is impossible to work productively.  Again ‚Äúoffice‚Äù.  Four walls. <br><br>  It was something like a lyrical digression, or an introduction.  Call it what you want.  All names and matches are fictional, in the end, no one was hurt. <br><br>  Actually to the point.  Let you present your idea. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/164/5de/6db/1645de6db9916c88897acc8e090e741b.jpg"><br><br>  Someone has already solved the problem of "four walls" for himself by moving to Thailand and other equally attractive, but distant places. <br><br>  Actually, what's the idea: Why not put your little office ‚Äúon wheels‚Äù and travel comfortably without sacrificing productivity? <br><br>  We all watched American films, and more than once saw them as ‚Äúhouses on wheels‚Äù.  They have developed it there, although with a little bit of other subtext - pure rest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/863/3f7/433/8633f74333c46d570e5bf0455ea5a142.jpg"><br><br>  So, why people who do not depend on geographic location do not learn from this experience? <br><br>  Anyone who tried to combine travel with work probably faced the problem that most of the time it‚Äôs impossible to work effectively - the main difficulties are transport, overnight accommodation.  Search ‚Äúsockets‚Äù.  I do not say that all this is not solved.  Proper route planning eliminates much of the inconvenience.  But not all. <br><br>  The main idea is to reach the next level of freedom - to take an ordinary passenger intercity bus and convert it into an office, with full-fledged workplaces, a kitchen, a seating area, a shower and sleeping places and go traveling in a small company / team to beautiful places, as they say, without interrupting production. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a5c/bec/e23/a5cbece2333849d5a9aa6778244cbb5b.jpg"><br><br>  But not everything is so simple ... <br><br>  There are many problems - from financial - alteration, purchase, household, organization of space, to legal ones, like registration of a modified vehicle. <br><br>  But I am sure, together we will find ways to implement!  Humans and Humanity have repeatedly argued that nothing is impossible.  There would be a desire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3bc/3c3/151/3bc3c3151ea798feb008c9d0e96f4001.jpg"><br><br>  Thank you for your attention, have a nice day and mood, Habr! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Since there are people to whom this is all interesting, here‚Äôs a page dedicated to the project: <a href="http://officeb.us/">officeb.us</a> , forum. <br>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficeBus">twitter.com/OfficeBus</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197340/</a></p>
