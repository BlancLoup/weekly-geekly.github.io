It differs from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142366/">the scheme we considered earlier in the</a> absence of some terrible problem that must be solved immediately. <br><br>  The scheme is good because it allows you to roll out the name, logo and essence of the service almost from the first seconds.  This means that even if the viewer turns off the video, without having watched it to the end, useful information about the project will have time to register on the sub-strip.

      However, one should still have time to build up from competitors, and the viewer, who received the main information, already had the feeling that ‚Äúhe had already seen it somewhere‚Äù, and the temptation to stop watching.  Therefore, there are increased requirements for design and script. <br><br>  Camera!  Motor! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  FourSquare </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFXzyJ8mUh4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAYNW4y81SvLSVH5rMixVE44pwHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Let's start with the classics.  We analyze the first video in detail, since it is exemplary in many ways. <br><br>  The main value of the service is explained from the first seconds of the video - albeit in the form of a question, but the question is clearly rhetorical.  It immediately interested. <br><br>  0:15 The frame ‚ÄúWhat is needed for this‚Äù complements the short introduction.  The frame seems primitive at first glance, but it translates several important thoughts at once.  First, it is all very simple, judging by the size and content of the list.  Secondly, this is a mobile application.  Thirdly, those who use, well done - they have passion and all that. <br><br>  0:20 This entry ends.  Next comes the story: a step-by-step instruction that, for all its straightness, solves a large range of tasks facing the video.  First of all, it is, of course, a user guide that helps him quickly get comfortable in the application (Foursquare uses this video on the main page instead of the text ‚ÄúAbout the project‚Äù).  But the main goal, after all, is to explain the numerous advantages and benefits of a kayfushechka. <br><br>  How to make the service immediately friendly?  Find your friends there.  If you have friends, everything is not so scary.  This calls for the first step. <br><br>  0:35 A very interesting trick - notes.  On the one hand, we tear the storyline and lose a little in dynamics, on the other hand, we increase the information density per unit of time.  The information in this case is really useful. <br><br>  0:40 Step Two.  We demonstrate the main functionality. <br><br>  1:01 Step Three.  Finally got to the good.  An interesting message.  First give (mark), then get (see where others are marked).  Is it possible to keep the user without buns for a whole minute?  Only if in the second half of the video density of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat promise the user will be off-scale.  This is what happens. <br><br>  1.10 Get recommendations about places near you (and finally you remembered about geolocation). <br>  1.16 Get medals and badges. <br>  1.30 Get the mayor. <br>  1.35 Get discounts and gifts. <br>  1.40 Get special offers. <br><br>  1.45 After this stargazing we end on a cautionary note: user, use the service everywhere! <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  From the point of view of the plot, this video can be taken as a sample of the ‚ÄúFrom the bat‚Äù scenario.  A vigorous start without a buildup or some problematic story, a flat narration without repetitions, a competent balance of user duties and values.  Finally, high-quality graphics, which is not unimportant. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings, I would point out the primitive monotonous music and some lethargy of what is happening on the screen. <br><br><h3>  MobilePay </h3><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://player.vimeo.com/15211039&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwNxPIInNxr07i5myNCMpm-OAZfg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As befits the video from ‚ÄúPlace in the pit‚Äù, it begins with the logo and description of the product.  At 10 seconds we begin to tell how it works.  Then we begin to pour buns like a horn of plenty.  We show how easy it is to pay: you can connect plastic cards, you can connect discount cards, you can give friends a loan.  Of course, everything is super secret!  Safer than the credit cards themselves!  Nothing is needed at all: neither software, nor hardware, nor bar codes.  Your phone is your wallet! <br><br>  Solid advantages and the revolution of which the Bolsheviks had been talking for so long. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Here it can be clearly seen that this is exactly the plot of the video that suits this service.  When there are a lot of advantages, you can just talk about them in order, rather than sucking one problem out of your finger and fighting it for 1.5 minutes. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings we see here a weak design and sluggish installation.  Frankly, with all the usefulness of the product, the movie is boring to watch. <br><br><h3>  Headliner.fm </h3><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/9006077&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiy_XJCdl4_g76JFnsS0zf3XoMuA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="headliner.fm Sizzle Reel" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Representative of the genre, frankly, not the best.  The example of this video shows how important it is to do not just beautiful graphics, but also informative.  In this video, the graphics and not beautiful and not informative.  If the first immediately catches the eye, then you notice the second only after viewing. <br><br>  Do an experiment.  Turn off the music and try to understand what the movie is looking at infographics.  Understanding the movie, not listening to the voiceover, is extremely difficult.  It turns out that the visual range is idle. <br><br><h3>  Freemonee </h3><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://player.vimeo.com/23489033&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmwRkXDMl4WtF7igGjPdk4jsvflw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  FreeMonee is a service with an original business model, a funny name and a good chorus performance.  From the first seconds the movie takes an enviable pace. <br><br>  0:03 Essence and benefits in one sentence.  We actively use powerful hats: the first in the world, gifts, shopping, free! <br><br>  0:12 Essentially, thousands of stores are connected, well-known financial institutions.  Presents! <br><br>  0:25 Essence more.  Invite there, a gift here, a notification on the phone, the user comes and buys. <br><br>  0:48 More details.  How the system works inside.  Users, plastic cards.  We know what users are buying, and therefore we know what to offer.  Information is provided ... by the bank!  Of course, everything is super secret and encrypted! <br><br>  1:22 After all this, the shops applaud, and the users tensed.  They need to relax.  We appeal now to users.  We explain for them.  Just enjoy!  Presents!  "Free money"!  What need to do?  Trivia - a piece of paper to sign.  Presents!  Presents!  Presents!  Useful gifts! <br><br>  The audience applauded, applauded, finished applauding. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  It is seen that the movie is built on the principle of the pyramid: from simple to complex.  Mrs. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/53265/">Barbara Minto</a> told us that this is an exceptionally correct approach to presenting information.  Information grows like a snowball, drawing the audience into this whirlpool of consumer hooks and hitchhikers. <br><br>  The video is a bit tight, a lot of repetition and the exploitation of the words "gifts", "money", "free."  But the topic is serious, - data privacy, plastic cards - so you can chew a little.  In addition, there are two audiences here, and each one needs to talk about his own. <br><br>  Not enough music for such a vigorous video. <br><br><h3>  Clear </h3><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/35693267&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiIKN3d7MNgxYJTCXMzqoy27PKUIQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Clear for iPhone - Available Now!" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The original movie.  There is no voiceover.  Text junk is not.  At the very beginning flashed the logo of the program, but without explaining what it is.  It turns out that nothing needs to be explained.  After watching the video, we understand that this is another todo-manager. <br><br>  The authors had a really impossible task.  How to convince the viewer that the trivial program, which has tens and hundreds of analogues, is better than others?  Start telling us about how difficult it was to live without this program, and we will immediately close the video without seeing it through to the end. <br><br>  It seems that what the authors of the video did is the only correct decision.  They showed how pleasant and convenient to work with this program.  Juicy, cheerful, capacious.  The duration of the video for such a reception is chosen ideal. <br><br>  Pay attention to the place where the hero sips coffee.  This is the highlight.  The authors, confident that the viewer is closely watching their manipulations, make a dramatic pause: ‚ÄúWhat, like?  Just a second ... Now we'll show something else. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Google Maps 8-bit </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rznYifPHxDg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjVN7nMPX6Y_MQRfNPp5vP2WmyqlQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What a review without our beloved Big Brother.  A great example of a funny, actually viral video.  No problem for you to solve.  We talk about the product, the value of which is himself.  Accordingly, the task is to show it in all its glory and with a humor. <br><br>  The video does not require any special comments.  In order to make a similar video, you need to make a similar product. <br><br><h3>  DollarShaveClub.com </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUG9qYTJMsI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhA89QsK6qt2uSt6C4LZGxxkunGyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is the case when the product leaves us the right to choose.  It would be possible to make a video of the type ‚ÄúProblem-solution‚Äù.  There are hints of this in the video itself.  In fact, the hero of the video voices us one problem (we always forget to buy new blades), then another (a bunch of unnecessary bells and whistles, for which we overpay).  It would be possible to collect all these ‚Äúseven misfortunes‚Äù at the beginning of the video, tighten a dull song for 30 seconds about the hard life of a peasant, and then give out ‚Äúone answer‚Äù.  Many, probably, would close the video on the first part ... <br><br>  Because it would no longer be a male movie.  By the way, an interesting thought!  There are some ‚Äúproblem-solving‚Äù videos ... whiny, not brutal, or something.  Whether the case - "right off the bat."  Head-on.  Like a man! <br><br>  See how authentic they did with this strategy.  Right at the beginning of the video, they introduced themselves and rolled out their main value: ‚ÄúOur product is damn good‚Äù (literary translation :).  And let's prick problems one after another like nuts, while rolling out one after another the advantages of the product. <br><br>  A rare unshaven audience will not watch this video to the end.  Well, not with all the heart with it.  Good product + quality banter = virus. <br><br><h3>  General conclusions </h3><br><ol><li>  When there is no specific problem, or it is banal, or it needs to be chewed for a long time, the ‚ÄúFrom the quarry‚Äù scheme is used.  Information too much to waste precious time on the buildup. </li><li>  The timing of the ‚ÄúFrom the Quarry‚Äù commercials is determined by the complexity of the service, the delicacy of the questions (for example, privacy) and the number of target groups that need to be addressed.  Typically, timekeeping does not exceed 2 minutes: FourSquare, MobilePay, FreeMonee, Clear, DollarShaveClub.com. </li><li>  The duration of a number of clips has a magic number 9 at the end: FourSquare, FreeMonee.  Apparently, there is also a marketing trick here :) </li><li>  If in the ‚ÄúProblem-solution‚Äù scheme, creativity and humor were a pleasant, but not obligatory addition, then here it is already difficult without them.  Many of the "From the bat" clips have the potential of viral: Google Maps 8-bit, DollarShaveClub.com. </li><li>  When a product has 100 competitors, there is only one way out - to rest on convenience and pleasure of use: Clear </li><li>  When a product has 0 competitors, you can show the product itself and even make fun of it a little: Google Maps 8-bit </li></ol><br><br><h5>  useful links </h5><br>  <a href="http://startup-videos.com/">startup-videos.com</a> Website with a talking title <br>  <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-examples-of-startup-product-demo-videos">www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-examples-of-startup-product-demo-videos</a> Quora was asked to throw examples of good start-up videos <br>  <a href="http://ruvfx.ru/">ruvfx.ru</a> Visual effects in film and advertising <br><br><h5>  Acknowledgments </h5><br>  Thanks to egge <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/egge/" class="user_link">comrade</a> for useful links that helped improve the article and suggested an idea for the next one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142588/</a></p>
