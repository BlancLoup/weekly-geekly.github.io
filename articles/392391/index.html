  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Troll paper newspaper</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ac/1e5/7e3/7ac1e57e32b746bab76d3c232554ee0b.jpeg"><br><br>  I, damn it, have long wanted to submit the usual announcement "Falcon, we were revealed."  Directly imagined how the newspaper was leaving by subscription to all pensioners, and they read this ad and discuss it on the benches.  Better yet, not even one thing, but to take and submit 10 pieces of announcements so that the reader‚Äôs brain would nafig break, trying to overpower them. <br><br>  The case presented itself.  We filed an advertising module in one of the newspaper ads, and the owner says - and let's barter, you give me a hefty hockey game, and I give you two times more ads.  In the end, after several iterations, they offered to play around and got a strip after clarifying the idea, good people are adequate.  <b>Therefore, an old dream come true to mess things up in a serious newspaper garbage.</b>  Here is the strip under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The layout is local, straight to the point of mimicry for ordinary ads, we would not be able to: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/86b/080/c2686b080b6c457db89c3d8e16ee9af0.jpeg"><br><br>  Our strip is on the left, on the right is a regular newspaper strip.  The newspaper itself looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/eb4/e70/73aeb4e709b54417abe3b1c6f915e5a8.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything is as it should be, announcements, strange layout, even a crossword with brands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/254/b19/495254b19f034298b5f1e0c7d6e15b14.jpeg"><br><br>  Since our lane is too similar to a regular one, it was necessary to bring up something completely provocative: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/1f2/518/c5e1f2518215416a873241a7371f509e.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, it was highly likely that pensioners would accept everything at face value, so I added bayans from their childhood (about kittens and a bucket and about ‚Äúwallet found‚Äù) so that they would not be particularly scared and clearly understand that it was April 1st. and not the world gone mad. <br><br>  The important point is that you cannot give contacts, otherwise everything turns out to be almost an offer, and you can get it by the law on advertising.  Therefore, no phones, although the temptation was great.  The lawyer helped to do everything as it should, plus, in consultation with the editor, we particularly stressed on April 1. <br><br>  This means that you can go to any newspaper and submit a bunch of such ads yourself.  In theory.  And not necessarily on the first of April.  In practice, the editors can usually refuse to publish without explanation and return the money.  For example, in our case, the ad ‚ÄúThe dog was gone.  White  Bitch.  Bitch!".  The editor decided that the biological name of the female dog would still not please the parents.  In general, he is right. <br><br>  If you want proof, that this newspaper is real (or issue for memory) - in our shop on Kurskaya (right in the metro building) you can take a couple of pieces for free.  We were given 7 kilograms (300 pieces), and they will lie for a week or until they run out.  It also spreads around Troitsk and nearby, moreover, according to the statement of the editorial board, everything there now will be inundated with it, the circulation of 25 thousand pieces. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More prototypes under the spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Option one, I decide what to do with the strip: maybe just in German, taking 2% in the center and leaving everything else empty? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/2f8/f87/7492f8f87be14d7ea3404a6ba4af8213.png"><br><br>  We try hellish ads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03e/152/849/03e1528492324ad2a4e6ee80805450cc.png"><br><br>  In general, it was assumed that there would also come across ordinary advertisers' ads, but in the end they decided not to offend people (or even cut off sales if, because of the neighborhood, their material is also taken as part of a joke).  Here is the implementation of the layout (a couple of our ads fell out, then a couple more were added to the real one, corrected a couple of bugs, including changed the 24/7 = 3.43 decimal separator and returned the discount minus 20%): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/af5/d67/6b9af5d6766b4ffab9a5c3f6864ef356.png"><br><br>  And the <a href="http://nk-gazeta.ru/Archiv/NK/2016/NK_24_2016/page_01.htm">final</a> on the newspaper's website. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>PS</b> Sorry for some offtopic.  A long time ago you asked in one of the topics how lawyers with a sense of humor differ from ordinary ones.  I still can‚Äôt cite a single high-profile story, but it was here that a plan was needed to implement the plan, which would explain how to do it right, and not why not.  In general, take care of lawyers with debugging thinking. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392391/</a></p>
