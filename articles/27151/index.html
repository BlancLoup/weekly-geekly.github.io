  <section class="page js-page"><h1>File hosting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.fileqube.com/resources/teasers/habr.jpg"><br>  This is my first post here and I want to warn you right away - this is a boost :) Now I will brazenly praise my own resource - <a href="http://www.fileqube.com/">File Qube</a> .  As is clear from the title, it will be about file hosting. <a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  <em>Such resources were divorced darkness, a lot of people wanted easy money and began to rivet services.</em>  <em>The approach was simple - a lot of advertising hides the site itself, the work with which required not weak mental activity and iron nerves.</em>  <em>And the soul demanded something very beautiful and not less convenient.</em>  <em>Yes, and so that the site does not eat up the brain with advertising and extortion of money.</em>  <em>So the idea was to make File Qube.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>By the way, it was more than 2 years ago.</em>  <em>Damn long, yes.</em>  <em>But only two people worked on the site.</em>  <em>And our task was not only to make a good site, but also not to starve in the process.</em>  <em>While my friend is a mega-developer of the brain of the service, I was engaged in designing the interface, creating graphics and design, layout and developing client scripts.</em>  <em>For two years, the Internet accelerated great, had to learn on the go.</em>  <em>It was fun :)</em> <br></blockquote><br>  After two long years of development, we successfully launched.  File Qube on the network for 3 months and some days there.  Our hosting is an expensive and powerful server, 6TB of disk space, 100Mbps dedicated channel.  I'm sure everything turned out well.  Very nice and comfortable.  Because we prepared FQ with love :) <br><h2>  Easy peasy </h2><br> <a href=""><img src="http://www.fileqube.com/resources/shots/thumbs/progress_bar.jpg" align="right"></a> <br>  The simplest thing a service can do is download and store files for distribution.  We did not hide the download form and placed it on the main page.  If there is a need to upload several files at once, you can upload up to <a href="http://fileqube.com/upload">5 files at the same time</a> .  For non-registered users, the file size is limited to 150MB.  The download process is monitored using JSHttpReques, the server returns the percentage of upload, the size of the files and calculates the approximate end time. <br>  It is also possible to create an account without departing from the cash register.  Select the files, specify the address and click [upload].  As soon as files are uploaded, the service will send an email with registration data and show links to files.  The service will generate the password on its own, then it can be changed in the settings. <br><h2>  Account Benefits </h2><br>  It is cool to be registered :) Tasty interface, improved file loading, all kinds of baubles for the site \ blog much more.  <font><strong>Apload</strong></font> <br>  The size of the file that can be uploaded is 500MB, and the maximum number of queues is 10 files.  The usual form replaces <a href="http://swfupload.org/">SFWUpload</a> , which makes the work more enjoyable.  If you have problems with flash, you can easily switch to the usual upload by clicking the 'Switch to regular upload' link at the bottom of the form. <br>  <font><strong>File manager</strong></font> <br> <a href=""><img src="http://www.fileqube.com/resources/shots/thumbs/filemanager_thumbs.jpg" align="right"></a>  This is the coolest part of the site.  The file manager uses AJAX and all the best that modern js has to offer.  The file listing is loaded as a json string, it is processed and the client side listing is generated.  This made the interface more dynamic.  For example, switching between views (their 2 is the classic table and the thumbnail mode) occurs in real time, the same with sorting, the transition between the pages in the listing and so on. (rubberband select), support CTRL + Click.  It works in the same way as Windows Explorer - a single click to select an object and a double click for the default action. There were no drawbacks either.  For example, you cannot rename a file, you cannot move a folder, there is no copy function.  All these troubles will be fixed in the new version.  It is written about it in our blog :) <br>  <font><strong>Sharing widget</strong></font> <br>  A very simple thing that allows you to publish files wherever embed code is supported.  Create a folder, upload files, a couple of clicks and it turns out <a href="http://www.fileqube.com/html/widget.html">this</a> thing. <br><h2>  And lastly :) </h2><br>  For those who are interested in what and how, but do not want to register, there is a guest account. <br><blockquote>  <em>username: guest</em> <em><br></em>  <em>password: guest</em> <br></blockquote>  We are not responsible for the files for this post :) <br><br>  Ps.  This is a trial entry.  If the community is interested, I will post a couple more articles.  The plans include several notes on the service architecture, a story about the client part in details and details about the future version. <br></div>
