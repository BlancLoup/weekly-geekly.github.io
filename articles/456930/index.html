But this is only the beginning - there are a lot of tasks that can be solved with the help of IoT. <br><br>  In order to demonstrate the technology capabilities to developers, GeekBrains together with Rostelecom decided to conduct an IoT hackathon.  The task was one for all participants - to come up with a solution in the field of the Internet of things and implement a web and / or mobile application for a specific user of smart devices.  In technical terms, it was necessary to write a <i>front</i> - <i>end</i> for the end user, plus a <i>back</i> - <i>end</i> , which controls the business logic of working with data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who are the heroes of our Hakaton <s>novel</s> ? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1_/u8/oi/1_u8oiaibrtsweio97o9y5so4bw.jpeg">

      434 people responded to the call to take part in the hackathon, where you need to come up with and implement an IoT solution for business - this is how many applications the organizers received.  184 people took part in the hackathon - 35 teams.  By the way, one of the conditions was to invite only novice developers who wish to try their hand at a new area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9g/am/9c/9gam9ckutqaozyfcre5jmys9k4a.jpeg"><br><br>  Almost all got to the finish - 33 teams out of 35, these are 174 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/gk/qa/ecgkqahanslhh7drinh3vtqebcm.jpeg"><br><br>  It was judged by all the jury, consisting entirely of harsh professionals: <br><br><ul><li>  Dmitry Slinkov - Director of Industrial Internet, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Alexey Poluektov - Director of Platform Architecture, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Nikita Bratko - Chief Solution Architect, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Oleg Gerasimov - Wink and In-memory DB Reindexer Development Manager, Rostelecom Information Technologies; <br></li><li>  Nikolai Olkhovsky - director of the center of competence for the development of video surveillance products, Rostelecom Information Technologies; <br></li><li>  Sergey Shirkin - Dean of the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence at GeekUniversity, Data Scientist at Dentsu Aegis Network Russia; <br></li><li>  Oleg Shikov - Dean of the Faculty of Web Development GeekUniversity; <br></li><li>  Alexander Sinichkin is a GeekBrains, Python Team Lead teacher at Usetech. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  First there was the word - the word of the expert </h2><br>  In order for the hackathon participants to better understand what to do, Rostelecom experts conducted three thematic workshops at once.  The first is ‚ÄúThe Internet of Things Platform‚Äù, the second is ‚ÄúIntroduction to React Native‚Äù and the third is ‚ÄúMobile application from scratch‚Äù. <br><br>  Well, in order for each participant to be aware of the task and to provide an approximate solution, plus he knew where to go for the reward in case of victory the mentors helped the participants: <br><br><ul><li>  Alexey Poluektov - Director of Platform Architecture, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Nikita Bratko - Chief Solution Architect, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Sergey Bastionov - head of project management group, Rostelecom; <br></li><li>  Oleg Shikov - Dean of the Faculty of Web Development GeekUniversity; <br></li><li>  Sergey Kruchinin - Head of educational projects GeekUniversity; <br></li><li>  Alexander Sinichkin - GeekBrains, Python Team Lead teacher at Usetech; <br></li><li>  Ivan Makeev - teacher GeekBrains, the founder of the project "Scorochets." <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lp/1k/wj/lp1kwj6s0syucsknmbwgbyocd1k.jpeg"><br><br>  Mentors performed the role of a kind of "first aid".  They approached teams, asked different questions, commented on emerging ideas and suggested potentially promising areas.  If someone needed a consultation, the participant received it immediately after applying for help. <br><br><h2>  How did everything go? </h2><br>  On the first day, the hackathon members passed two ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù: <br><br><ol><li>  Until 14:00, team members had to decide and declare on which idea they would work on the hackathon.  Ideas organizers fixed; <br></li><li>  In the evening, the teams told what they did and what happened in the end. <br></li></ol><br>  The organizers advised participants to receive feedback from two mentors every day - this is necessary in order to be guided by expert opinions.  Some of the fastest participants had time to talk with all the mentors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_b/cf/d_/_bcfd_stbpydtg1sbvlk_8cfii8.jpeg"><br><br>  In order to complete the work faster, 23 teams did not go to sleep, but stayed in the office for the night.  Coffee helped, ideas and enthusiasm helped, plus some snacks. <br><br>  Then, on the second day of the hackathon, the teams demonstrated what was the result.  After that, the judges consulted for a while and scored.  Each project was evaluated according to the following criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  Does it solve a specific user problem and how relevant it is. <br></li><li>  The novelty of the idea. <br></li><li>  Technical complexity: the scale of the solution, the devices involved, the amount of data collected. <br></li><li>  Implementation of the backend. <br></li><li>  Implementation frontend. <br></li><li>  Interface work - a prototype in action. <br></li><li>  Commercial prospects of the project. <br></li></ul><br>  Each item received a score on a five-point scale.  Then all points of each team were summed up.  The total sum was determined by the three best teams.  In addition to the main three winners, there were additional prizes in nine other nominations. <br><br><h2>  Sector "Prize" - the final results </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/rk/kc/sxrkkcmdcga9r4pcjyidtzt4jz0.jpeg"><br><br>  The first place was taken by the SunDali team (in which, by the way, a laptop burned in the process).  She received a prize of 100 thousand rubles for the development of a control system for unmanned cleaning equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/aj/hi/beajhig_yc026wmb9btsmcqt1bs.jpeg"><br><br>  The second place with a prize of 70,000 rubles was received by the RHDV team, which implemented a project for monitoring and remote control of the smart greenhouse system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ym/6p/lf/ym6plfdt0o07zige_j8tj6erc-y.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, the third place was given to the team of GeekBrains courses, which presented the IoT insurance project for the agricultural complex. <br><br>  As for nominations, the winners of each of them are: <br><br>  ‚òÜ Prize for the project‚Äôs commercial prospects - ReAction <br><br>  ‚òÜ Prize "Take it and do it!" - "2121" <br><br>  ‚òÜ Innovative solution - WAAS !!! <br><br>  ‚òÜ Prize ‚ÄúZhelezyaka‚Äù - ‚ÄúBNB‚Äù <br><br>  ‚òÜ Best integration solution - Snakes <br><br>  ‚òÜ The best mobile app - ‚ÄúBoats‚Äù <br><br>  ‚òÜ Prize ‚ÄúOh, we still have a demo!‚Äù - ‚ÄúNursultan‚Äù <br><br>  ‚òÜ The prize of sympathy of Rostelecom - "5642" <br><br>  ‚òÜ Jury Prize - OCEAN <br><br><h2>  What do the participants say? </h2><br>  The experts were pleased with how everything went.  Here is what Nikolai Olkhovsky, director of the center of competence for the development of video surveillance products, told Rostelecom Information Technologies: <i>‚ÄúThe solutions created on the hackathon are a matter of respect.</i>  <i>There were teams that themselves found ready datasets instead of those offered by us and screwed interfaces to them.</i>  <i>As a result, their demos looked very realistic.</i>  <i>Many have tried to implement large-scale things in just a day.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The dedication and creativity of the guys struck.</i>  <i>Despite lack of sleep and tight deadlines, everyone did their best: 33 out of 35 teams reached the finish line.</i>  <i>This is a very good result!</i>  <i>All participants are great.</i>  <i>And we, the jury and the mentors, enjoyed it</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7w/ae/qx/7waeqx6yor2-pbk-cuo76wwkmbi.jpeg"><br><br>  Alexander Sinichkin, GeekBrains teacher, Python Team Lead at Usetech: <i>‚ÄúI first participated in the hackathon and was delighted with how many guys can come up with something interesting and worthwhile.</i>  <i>Every third or even second project made exclaim: ‚ÄúWow, was it possible?‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I was very pleased with the persistence of the participants trying to understand the things they did not understand.</i>  <i>How can you connect neural networks and a web project in two days and without experience?</i>  <i>But they did it.</i>  <i>Very cool".</i> <br><br>  It is worth noting that each of the participants in the hackathon received an employment opportunity.  HR from Rostelecom communicated with the participants, collecting useful contacts.  Company representative Olga Romanova, head of IT specialists selection at Rostelecom Information Technologies, commented on the results as follows: <i>‚ÄúRostelecom is ready to work with novice specialists and, of course, we actively communicated with the guys on the hackathon in order to attract the best to our team.</i>  <i>Depending on the level of the person, we can offer a professional position or internship.</i>  <i>We have many interesting and promising projects: interactive television, video surveillance platform, smart home platform.</i>  <i>After the hackathon, we already had several interviews. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Well, the impressions of the winners - we took a short interview with team timbers. <br><br>  <b>Alexandra Vasilega, team leader of the SunDali team (1st place)</b> <br><br>  <i>Why did you decide to take part in the hackathon?</i> <br><br>  For many in the team, this was the first hackathon, the decision to take part came spontaneously. <br><br>  <i>How did you come up with the idea that allowed you to take the prize?</i> <br><br>  There was a long discussion with a lot of ideas, but the final was that one of the team members looked at the robot cleaner, he had the idea to use such a device to work on a project.  So there was our option. <br><br>  <i>What will you spend (or have already spent) the prize pool?</i> <br><br>  Everyone decided personally - for me this is a technique. <br><br>  <b>Arkady Dymkov, team leader RHDV (2nd place)</b> <br><br>  <i>Why did you decide to take part in the hackathon?</i> <br><br>  Our team has long been involved in the hackathons of various topics, so we understood perfectly well what a hackathon is and what needs to be done there.  Signed up for participation, one might say, by chance: one of our team members came across the announcement of a joint hackathon from Rostelecom and Geekbrains.  We looked at the cases and immediately realized that it was ours. <br><br>  <i>How did you come up with the idea that allowed you to take the prize?</i> <br><br>  Recently we took part in the agrohakatone, which we won with the greenhouse project.  We already had the code for the controllers and we understood the principle of the whole system, so the idea was not to dig far, but to do something on the same topic, and it almost perfectly fit into the theme of the new hackathon.  We made software for remote control and monitoring of smart greenhouses systems.  As it seemed to us, this idea, at a minimum, is practical and can ‚Äúshoot‚Äù.  So it happened. <br><br>  <i>What will you spend (or have already spent) the prize pool?</i> <br><br>  We divided the money equally and each stayed with his own part). <br><br>  <b>Maxim Lukyanov, team leader of the team ‚ÄúRandom Forest‚Äù (3rd place)</b> <br><br>  <i>Why did you decide to take part in the hackathon?</i> <br><br>  I learned about the hackathon, because  I study in Geekbrains at the Faculty of AI.  At the time of the hackathon, I just mastered the python library for machine learning, and since the hackathon itself was positioned as an event for novice developers in the field of machine learning, I decided that it would be great to try my hand at practice.  In addition, I have never participated in such competitions before and it was interesting to try. <br><br>  <i>How did you come up with the idea that allowed you to take the prize?</i> <br><br>  All team members sketched out a few ideas, formed a list, it included 7 options.  In fact, the hackathon started by discussing all the ideas, discarding those that are difficult to implement within the time limit, and chose the most thoughtful and, in our opinion, interesting project to implement IoT sensors in the fields to monitor their condition and inform about emerging risks. (insurance claims).  The idea was originally thought up, in my opinion, by Oleg Kharatov. <br><br>  <i>What will you spend (or have already spent) the prize pool?</i> <br><br>  We took the third place, our prize is free courses GeekBrains. <br><br><hr><br>  In general, the hackathon can be considered successful, everyone enjoyed - the participants, the jury, the audience and, of course, the organizers.  Follow the agenda, this hackathon is not the last. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456930/</a></p>
