In particular, they talked about research in the field of antennas ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/237403/">part 1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/239037/">part 2</a> ) and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/252331/">about the integration of carrier frequencies</a> .  Until recently, there was no prevailing opinion among vendors regarding the technologies that will form the basis of the future 5G.  But its appearance is predicted by many in five years.  However, at the recently concluded 5G World Summit conference, a number of manufacturers expressed the opinion that a serious qualitative leap in creating a new mobile communication technology is possible only when using frequencies in the 6-100 GHz range.  On this occasion <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2940869/wireless-broadband/5g-networks-look-to-new-frequencies-to-deliver-gigabit-speeds.html">, an article has</a> even been <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2940869/wireless-broadband/5g-networks-look-to-new-frequencies-to-deliver-gigabit-speeds.html">published</a> , the translation of which we are happy to publish below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Until recently, frequencies below 6 GHz were allocated for the needs of mobile communications, for the most part because of good coverage in large areas.  But the need for increased bandwidth makes it cross this line.  In addition, the use of higher frequencies will reduce the level of delays in data transmission in mobile networks. <br><br>  Despite the fact that in the next five years one can hardly expect the development of new frequencies, vendors are trying to demonstrate their willingness to solve future technological difficulties.  In particular, Samsung and Huawei have reported successful research in high-frequency technology.  And the development of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Gigabit_Alliance">WiGig</a> technology proved the possibility of successful use of frequencies in the region of 60 GHz.

      To master the range above 6 GHz, it will be necessary to develop a new generation of antennas capable of communicating simultaneously with several users through narrow-band signal transmission.  You may also have to create new modulation schemes for more efficient packaging of the data being sent. <br><br>  Of course, vendors still have a number of opportunities to increase network bandwidth within the already used ranges.  For example, using carrier combining or sharing of Wi-Fi networks.  But not a single method will provide anything that can be obtained by expanding the range beyond the 6 GHz boundary.  To do this, it is necessary not only to develop the appropriate technology, but also to negotiate with numerous regulators.  Some of them are ready to meet the industry.  As Andrew Hudson, Director of Spectrum Policy at the British regulator Ofcom, said: " <i>... we intend to provide access to significant bands of new frequencies, and this position is shared by more and more regulators in other countries</i> ." <br><br>  Today in Ofcom they say not so much about the fact of the expansion of the available ranges, but about how to choose the most appropriate frequencies.  In particular, they must possess the necessary physical characteristics and have prospects for successful international harmonization.  But if new frequencies are chosen and allocated, it is unlikely that this will happen before 2019. <br><br>  However, the difficulties are not limited to the development of technology and the persuasion of regulators.  Frequencies above 6 GHz have an important disadvantage: poor coverage.  Frequent building, difficult terrain, dense vegetation - all this has a very negative impact on the signal level.  Therefore, operators when deploying new networks will have to install many small base stations.  Although now it is not easy to find free space for installing new cells. <br><br>  For objectivity's sake, it should be noted that the ordinary 5G user is not really needed today.  The speed of mobile Internet at the level of 1-10 Gbit / s is very few people need, and expanding the network bandwidth is much more important for operators: after all, it‚Äôs not possible to delay this until subscribers experience a deterioration in communication quality due to network overload.  Therefore, all the work and research ongoing today is aimed at solving problems that may arise in the future, in the horizon of five to ten years. <br><br>  In any case, if the vendors really want to not just upgrade LTE, but to make a real breakthrough technology, then they will have to overcome many technical and political obstacles.  In this regard, we can recall how long and difficult operators tried to achieve the introduction of <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/562337">technological neutrality</a> .  It seems that getting approval for the expansion of the frequency spectrum will not be easier.  Perhaps by 2020 there will be some new networks with a 5G nameplate, but they will most likely use frequencies below 6 GHz.  After all, you can not discount the developed infrastructure around the world.  So a breakthrough in mobile communications will have to wait longer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262893/</a></p>
