We can recall June 2010, when Apple showed the reporters a room not far from here, filled with black and white iPhons 4. <br><br>  Needless to say, Apple still does not sell its latest iPhone model in a color other than black.  However, previous 3G and 3GS models have been offered with both white and black back covers.

      Apple CEO Steve Jobs hinted at a problem with the iPhone during the presentation, focusing on the phrase: ‚ÄúWe will start delivering white iPads from the first day of sales,‚Äù which caused general laughter in the hall. <br><br>  At least two key factors prevented Apple from shipping the white version of the new iPhon not only to the launch, but even to the 251st day from the date of sale, Apple developers said. <br><br>  White iPhone, assembled from parts of a Chinese supplier, which is used by one of the founders of Apple, Steve Wozniak, as he explained, was rejected by Apple.  The camera of the phone takes pictures of poor quality when the flash is turned on, and the white material <i>(</i> distortion of the proximity sensor data of the <i>4th iPhon is glass)</i> distorts the proximity sensor data, Wozniak said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe first samples of the parts were poor quality, so we decided not to put them at all,‚Äù said Wozniak in an interview with Engadget.  ‚ÄúI took two photos: with a flash and without it, that photo that was with her looked like this ... As if I had made it through cellophane.‚Äù <br><br>  These design barriers have affected the latest version of iPhon.  In the iPad, the camera is in the back, and the back of it is made of aluminum, not of the same material as the front one <i>(the iPad‚Äôs front-facing camera also has a note of the translator)</i> .  And there is no flash in it at all. <br><br>  The new tablet also lacks proximity sensor.  This mechanism is used in iPnone, for example, when it is pressed against an object, usually to your head during a call, to turn off the backlight (in previous versions of the phone this problem was not observed because both versions had a black front part). <br><br>  Instead of a proximity sensor, iPad uses built-in magnets to determine when the screen is covered with a case and the backlight must be turned off or on if the screen is open.  And light sensors, the same as in the iPhone, allow you to adjust the brightness of the backlight. <br><br>  For the first time, Apple announced a delay in the supply of white iPhons two weeks before the start of sales in June, stating that they will be available in the second half of July.  Then, in July, Apple promised that the elusive white will appear later this year.  Then, in October, Apple again postponed release until the spring of 2011. <br><br>  Despite its mythical character, the white model became not only the Grail <i>(such a thing in religion, about which a lot of rumors circulate: the king‚Äôs blood, denoting the descendants of Jesus, this or this holy cup, where the blood of the above-mentioned crucified character flowed ‚Äî comment. Translator)</i> ready to lose the warranty and screw the non-original parts to your device, but it also became some symbol of the city of Cupertino in California, Apple headquarters. <br><br>  Jony Ive, the company's chief designer, was spotted using his white iPhone 4 in the product showroom after the iPad 2 presentation on Wednesday. <br><br><h6>  <i>The fact that this is my first topic and therefore I will not write tram-param, but I will be glad to accept comments and suggestions on the translation.</i> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115550/</a></p>
