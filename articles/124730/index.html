Not that this would be a new idea, no.  Such services are presented on the Internet, not to say that it is quite wide, but they have firmly occupied their small niche.  Looking at the analogs, I wanted to do something better, and warm up on the development of the site from scratch on a new platform. <br><br>  Then I became very interested in the Django framework, and Python really liked me with my own, how to say it, intuitive clarity or something, and some sort of lightness that no programming language I had learned before.  Having plunged a little deeper into my free time from work in Python, with time came the overwhelming desire to take a stronger hold on Django and start working on the realization of the idea. <br><br>  Remembering the bitter experience of good undertakings not brought to a logical end, this idea wanted to be completed at all costs.  Therefore, it was decided to start development with the design of the service.  So to say, to transfer ideas from the head to paper, which was to save the next project from oblivion in the irregular flow of thoughts of the average person of the information age.  No sooner said than done.  Having looked for articles on Habr√© on design found a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/115224/">couple of</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/115738/">articles</a> which became a starting point.

      At first, I wanted to adhere to literally academic accuracy in the preparation of project documentation, almost directly directing GOST, but soon refused to do this, and decided not to rush from extremes into extremes, but to do everything according to the mind, but without excesses.  All the same for myself doing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Vision of the project </h4><br>  The first step to the goal was the document ‚ÄúVision of the project‚Äù, in which I outlined in general terms the goals of the project, the requirements and wishes for the site, the concept and the general plan for the development of the project.  That's what came out of it. <br><br><h5>  1. Introduction </h5><br>  This document contains the concept of the site naming service and is intended to be the starting point in the creation of the project.  Here will be presented and described the most common goals, wishes and requirements for the project. <br><br><h5>  2 Goals </h5><br>  The objectives of the project: <br><ol><li>  Create a naming service platform - a service providing services associated with the selection of a name in the broadest sense of the phrase ‚Äúname selection‚Äù (domain name, company name, slogan, pet name, future child's name) </li><li>  To organize interaction on the basis of the service between two interested parties: the customer and the performer </li><li>  Monetize service </li></ol><br><h5>  3 Requirements and wishes to the site </h5><br>  The site should be made in a minimalist style, providing only the most necessary for users simply, conveniently and affordably. <br><br>  The site should contain a list of all current tasks from customers, for any of the tasks you can click and see detailed information about this name selection task: description, requirements, restrictions.  Here you can also offer your own names for this task. <br><br>  Registered users who wish to set a task for a name selection should be able to fill in the appropriate form for this, in which they can indicate the goal of the task, a description, restrictions and other additional information that will help the performers issue more appropriate names. <br><br>  Registered users who wish to give name variants should be able to fill in the appropriate form for this, which should be automatically checked for the correctness of the name sentence input in accordance with the description, requirements, and restrictions.  Name sentences coming from the performers must undergo pre-moderation before the customer sees them (in order to avoid trolling, which can damage the reputation of the service). <br><br>  After the customer liked any proposal for the name, he marks it, thereby closing the task and determining the winner. <br><br>  The service must be monetized, so that the task gets to work only after it has been paid by the customer.  These funds are divided between the performer and the service, after the customer determines the winner. <br><br>  There are no technical or other restrictions.  The site will be based on the Django framework.  Hosting will be organized on the basis of Amazon cloud services. <br><br><h5>  4 Site Concept </h5><br>  Naming service should provide users to pick a name for anything.  There should be no restrictions, the coverage should be the widest.  But there are main vectors, this is the selection of a domain name, the selection of the name of a company, organization, company, and the selection of an advertising slogan (the majority of users will use the service for these purposes). <br><br>  But also other most courageous ideas should be realized.  Whether it is the selection of the name of the unborn child, the nickname of a pet, in the end, the original poem or sms birthday girlfriend, which can not be found in Google!  This is the key idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service - here you can pick up a name (and not only) for everything!  The service will bring together on its site a lot of people, each of whom is ready to offer his original name.  And if exactly his proposal will appeal to the customer to receive a reward. <br><br><h5>  5 What needs to be done within the project </h5><br>  Stages of project life: <br><ol><li>  Design (the result is a ‚ÄúProject Task‚Äù document describing the tasks, requirements and project model. A site will be created based on this document) </li><li>  Website development (layout design, programming. Result - site transferred to hosting) </li><li>  Promotion, development and maintenance (the result - a developing service, located in the first lines of popular search engines) </li></ol><br><h4>  Retrospective </h4><br>  Looking from the heights of today on that first document there are differences in what was intended and what happened.  But still this document played an important role at the very beginning of the journey, which cannot be overestimated.  I agree that in order to finish the job you need to put it on paper. <br><br><h4>  What's next </h4><br>  Three more documents followed, after which I proceeded directly to the coding of the idea.  They already contained more specific, object information on the project.  But more about that in the following articles. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Link to the service <a href="http://namingservice.org/">http://namingservice.org/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124730/</a></p>
