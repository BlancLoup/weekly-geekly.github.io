  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Basil and night</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  July was in full swing, and nothing foreshadowed trouble, except for the dull and very smoky moon.  At first, Vasily did not even pay attention to her, until a mosquito bit him on his left ear.  Cursing foully, he continued his difficult journey.  The path should be noted through the thorns of bushes, wrapped in a cemetery, crossed a ravine, about which there were many legends among local children and old women of old age.  Basil overcame Ternias with Susanin's quickness, alcohol in the blood made itself felt.  Falling on the stones, he only remembered a pair of empirical deities and went on.  Along the way, a couple of times, banging his forehead against the ground, he again recalled the magical creatures, but that was all a saying.  From afar, having spotted the lights of the round-the-clock GLAVSELSPIRTTORGA, Vasily added to the pace. <a name="habracut"></a>  The saleswoman Maroussia, handing a bag of check and a loaf of bread, recalled God in the head, and since she had to sit there all night, and incredible sadness, she tried to beat our gallant friend with a fable about a werewolf without shoulder straps, but with teeth and hair.  Basil just mumbled something unintelligible in response and left, moving on to running on all fours.  On the way back, the moon is still as before, looking from heaven, and wrung her face to the freshly risen from the salad, who wanted to relieve herself under the cover of darkness of a late guest.  Descending into the ravine, Vasily sat down on a stump, to the sound of a stream flowing over the pebbles.  Having poured all the vodka in one gulp and having eaten half a loaf, Vasily glanced at his watch.  Dial refused to work.  Instead of time, he showed a black spot in the middle of his hand.  Having maimed the moon for a poor reflection of light, Vasily glanced at her again.  The moon has become somehow bigger.  If it was alcohol that acted, it was the world that collapsed ‚Äî it was impossible to understand, and laziness in such an alcoholic hour took over, and Basil, curled up, hugged the stump and fell asleep. <br><br>  Night 14 number, Saturday, about three o'clock local time.  Vasya woke up from beats, some hooting, and some informal group of guys dancing not far away.  The usual rite for this village, through which every teenager passed, was in full swing.  A pentagram was inscribed on a large stone, the blood of a wolf, up and down, a freshly caught squirming virgin lay in the middle, which according to tradition, if the canons had not changed in the 15 years that had already passed Vasina‚Äôs initialization, was snatched from the bed in the next corner, Ugly.  But something repelled Vasily from this fun and cheerful ceremony, in which each traveler was poured a hundred grams.  There was something ominous here.  Tolya, a virgin wriggled unusually, toli guys did something wrong, but some evil permeated this ritual.  Looking at the dance, and finally waking up, Vasya realized that one hundred grams was not superfluous, and headed towards the crowd.  And only then did he realize that this was not the case - the blood was not a wolf, but that girl who was lying naked on a stone.  She just did not have enough hands, which the dog nibbled nearby, and it was with this torn hand that the children drew the pentagram ... Of course, times change, maybe the rules of the ritual changed, but there was something wild and rejecting here.  Vodka was still wanted, but it became brutally curious about what would happen next, and Vasya hid in the bushes and began to watch. <br><br>  Three guys in cassocks, with long dreads under the hoods, surrounded the captive, who was no longer writhing so much (apparently already used to the pain because of a lost hand).  The one that was in the center gently held a scalpel on the left breast and blood flowed from it.  This procedure is not ill, but very revealing, and having one of the key meanings in the ritual.  Next, the scalpel was dipped into a glass with alcohol and passed around in a circle.  When the scalpel fell into someone's hands, he made a small incision of the vein, and laid his hand on the cast-iron tub.  Previously, the virgin was turned over on her belly and the vat was put under it.  Today, the technology has become more progressive, and taking a long tube, the central one sucked some blood from the incision and dipped the tube into the vat ... the communicating vessels invented very progressively, Vasily thought.  This procedure marks the eternal fraternity of the members of the ritual, and the addition of innocent blood only tightens these bonds.  Seeing that, in principle, everything happens more or less ordinary Vasily began to approach.

      But then an unimaginable and new phenomenon happened - the central one put his hand on the girl‚Äôs chest, and began to push the flesh and penetrate it.  In seconds, she screamed, but after a moment her eyes went out ... he tore out his heart.  It was a pity the girl, and Vasily understood that the guys arbitrarily changed the ritual. <br><br>  The heart was drowned in a vat of blood.  For a degree, a Russian standard vodka bottle was poured there, and for taste they threw dill and some pepper.  Also there was added a little fried pork meat and carrots with cucumbers, after which they began to stir the stew over a slow fire, given by three candles under the pot. <br><br>  Basil approached just at that moment when warm soup was poured into plates. <br>  Guys, on a road for a walk - Basil growled.  He snarled not because he was angry or offended in the whole wide world, but because the voice was planted yesterday by the shouting of songs with Dmitry and Anton, under Anyut's heartfelt howl.  Glorious company eyes were burning, and the hair began to rise.  At the main point, that in the center, they climbed to such an extent that they slipped from under the hood, and shmyaknuvshis to the ground, crawled in an unknown direction.  It should be noted that the initialized young, not yet passed, or just passing insanely respected, and it always has been and will be.  Vodka, of course, was poured, and according to tradition they offered to add their own blood to the solution, and then try the soup together.  Vasya wanted to eat, not to eat, but to eat, and he naturally agreed to the proposal. <br><br>  The pottage was not usual, the heart still sometimes contracted, giving its vitality to the children.  In the eyes dimmed, and the darkness dizzy.  Outwardly, out of the light flowed.  At these moments, the soul, and the entire ethereal essence, experiences an unprecedented surge of power, passing from the innocent soul, and uniting the brotherhood into one.  Only in this case the innocent soul did not share power, but was completely absorbed and chewed by our four.  Soul devouring causes strong disturbances in the bioenergy and magnetic field for many hundreds of kilometers.  And the action is distributed not only in space but also in time.  Coming out of oblivion, the four saw a moon glowing hot for them, but it was too late ... <br><br><br>  <b>History reference:</b> <br><blockquote>  In the ancient chronicles, written probably still at the creation of the world, it is said that once the moon collapsed and covered the wood in the cradle of the world with itself.  This is of course a transfer of meaning; in the original, the words ‚Äúizhi‚Äù, ‚Äúcabs‚Äù, ‚Äúzhep da khan‚Äù, ‚Äúthicken sa zvirem‚Äù are used there.  And so it was.  Yes, there's nothing left.  The moon fell strictly on the forest, betraying a lot of animals and woodpeckers.  The impact was a point, and caused the separation of approximately the same piece of matter on the other side of the planet.  This piece later became a companion.  The rise of civilization, which understood the principle of the transmigration of souls, integral calculus and bioenergy with bioengineering was destroyed.  Together with all civilization.  The earth shook.  Centuries of nuclear snow flakes fell out.  No one survived.  Only worms are in the earth‚Äôs mass, and the biobots that have evolved and multiplied over millennia.  Biobots having lost their owners, began to select the remaining type of life.  So it turned out the empire of large worms that grew limbs, developed the senses. </blockquote><br><br>  I publish my first story, if I don‚Äôt like something much - write in the comments.  Although he is still nonsense :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12004/</a></p>
