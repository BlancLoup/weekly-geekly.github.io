She can be solved by walking to her once in several days, but there is not always time and opportunity for this.  Requires a solution - to automate this process. <br><br>  I have already begun to build in my mind a combination of arduino and water pumps through executive relays or systems of solenoid valves 3/8 inch and electric programmable timers ... However, it turned out that there is a ready-made solution on the Net - Avtoleika.  Its beauty is that it (unlike any arduins and other fascinating geek-kolkhoz) has a complete, aesthetically acceptable appearance and simple control, which means it can be presented to mother for the upcoming birthday. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, AutoLayka needed to check the functionality - can I not give my mom a gadget that doesn‚Äôt understand how it works?  I want to share the results of this test with the information field of the Universe. <br>  The set of "Autoleaders" looks like this:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d76/1d0/84f/d761d084f3194a7eaa01366f0b768a75.jpg"><br><br>  The main execution unit is a one-piece assembly of complex configuration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d9/085/6d9/0d90856d94be4f76830fd282d76790eb.jpg"><br><br>  ... comprising a submersible pump, a hydraulic distribution unit and a control unit.  Installed on any bucket, hooked over the edge: <br><br>  The system is powered by four AA elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/532/348/9495323489ac4b4dacad62a8901f7d80.jpg"><br><br>  Here I saw two at once, though not very significant, but a lack. <br><br>  Firstly, I do not really understand this basic installation on autonomous power.  This is not a mobile gadget, ideally it was attached to a bucket - and forgot, just pour water.  Why it is impossible to provide a connector for an external standard power supply unit at 5V?  The water pump is not a quartz watch for you, consumption is noticeable.  The situation when you went on vacation for a month, relying on automatic watering, and upon arrival found dried flowers and a gadget flooded with electrolyte from leaking batteries, does not look incredible.  Yes, the manufacturer promises to work up to six months from one set, but you and I are well aware that this is a spherical term in a vacuum - the batteries are different, the irrigation mode too. <br><br>  The second drawback will seem to someone to be insignificant at all, or not at all a disadvantage, but for me it is important - it is the fastening of the battery cover on the self-tapping screws.  They are so tight and tight that I could not even twist them to the end of the duty multitool: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/be1/134/4ffbe113401b4cf2bede59e5e27c1266.jpg"><br><br>  I had to climb into the cherished chest with a professional tool for a good screwdriver with a hard-tipped tip of the correct profile.  What does this mean in my case?  That my mother herself cannot change the batteries, it will have to be done to me every time.  Can I not give mom a screwdriver to give in the kit?  In general, again, I do not understand what kind of technological need has forbidden the battery cover to be made on the latch. <br><br>  I thought about immediately after the end of the warranty, insert some power connector into the case, and let it work from the outlet.  If you get a little stronger, you can implement a tiny rechargeable autonomy inside, so that in the event of a power outage, the program is not reset - but I would just power it on the UPS for the duration of the holiday. <br><br>  Okay, back from tuning to stock.  The control unit is a box with a display and buttons, on which a plate with Russian inscriptions is slightly casually stuck. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/be1/134/4ffbe113401b4cf2bede59e5e27c1266.jpg"><br><br>  I immediately itched my hands to tear it off and see what was there, under it - but, fortunately, it is not necessary - on the packaging the block is depicted in the original: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a54/2f8/193/a542f8193b204bcda58409ee7122be0e.jpg"><br><br>  Nothing interesting, the same, but in the language of a potential opponent.  Since the display is still all in English, the need for this sticker is controversial. <br><br>  Inside the block we see one single-sided board: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b0/8dc/5ff/2b08dc5ffbf24fe5beaa5183b3d90bc5.jpg"><br><br>  On which a droplet of the compound is flooded with a timer chip, there are rubberized programming buttons and a signal buzzer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fc/11a/644/2fc11a6447ee472d9020941954184c8f.jpg"><br><br>  Separately, a simple display is connected through the contact pad.  A constructive-elemental solution hails from the 90s, but, by the way, there is no need for high technologies.  A squeaker on the board reports a low battery or no water in the tank ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt open the pump, but the fact that four wires come from it (plus / minus power and two more) hints at the presence of an appropriate sensor.  Directly the pump is controlled by the timer command transistor B772. <br><br>  The design does not like disassembly, the wire harness to the pump, embedded in the usual heat-shrinkable cambric, immediately showed insides: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ac/ec6/b91/7acec6b917da42268e1f4b039d517b27.jpg"><br><br>  Which, however, does not affect the performance of the device and is a consequence of my manipulations, and not a design defect. <br>  The watering timer is programmed easily and simply, it is enough to set two digits: ‚ÄúN times a day‚Äù (can be fractional) and the duration of the pump in seconds.  So, say, if you set the number in the Day field to 0.1, then watering will be 10 times a day, and if you put 30 in the Sec field, then each watering will last half a minute.  The top line at first was puzzled by me, but then I realized that it shows the time in hours and minutes until the next watering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ff/be1/134/4ffbe113401b4cf2bede59e5e27c1266.jpg"><br><br>  The hydraulic distributor is arranged quite simply - it is a tube with 10 holes, like a flute.  Each hole can be attached to a thin hose for watering a single plant, or this hole should be plugged with a complete plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aae/8b5/b55/aae8b5b55e034328b3efc8676f73b989.jpg"><br><br>  All connections are strictly friction, but with such a weak pressure in the system this is enough.  There are 10 meters of hose in the set, ten irrigation channels too - so if there are many plants, they will have to be placed in a circle at a distance of no more than a meter from the autoleading. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0b/e18/97d/b0be1897dd824c149918188d4cc4eb16.jpg"><br><br>  Funny metal twists on the photo - this is the regular mounting of the hose in the pot.  They run a hose: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/c95/10a/2bbc9510ab0b43bba2089c0f291ccd3f.jpg"><br><br>  And they stick in the soil: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ed/c04/0fa/5edc040fa977484691a343e8e0c4090d.jpg"><br><br>  Again - simple, but effective. <br>  What is the system performance?  Checking: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/0c5/160/45a0c5160741418aae565d0f9ea6e28d.jpg"><br><br>  In thirty seconds, 80 milliliters of water was poured from one tube.  Of the two - 160 and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/f14/67f/6cef1467f4c34bc18513174099faa171.jpg"><br><br>  Limits not pump performance, and tube section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d9/958/41b/4d995841b58e462595bf29692f242900.jpg"><br><br>  Accordingly, it is possible to calculate how much watering time is required for each of the plants, and how much water in the bucket should be left for a month of leave.  (To prevent evaporation, the bucket can be closed with plastic wrap by passing pump hoses through it). <br>  You can change the capacity of the tips of drip irrigation.  Here are these: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/8f5/a7f/64e8f5a7f6a94188b586ca2ec46264d9.jpg"><br><br>  Their ability to pass water is limited by wrapping the spray head with a primitive needle regulator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/d6b/6f9/c84d6b6f949846a19dd10df4d7410c27.jpg"><br><br>  They are put on the hose: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e6/f28/358/2e6f28358f764412b992fc4e465e8c9b.jpg"><br><br>  ... and set in the pot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/dc6/845/5e9dc6845f51424d93f060b3e7105780.jpg"><br><br>  But there is a problem - it is necessary either to use them on all branches of the irrigation system, or not to use it at all - otherwise the water will flow only along the open branch, and from the spray head that restricts it, it drops only a couple of times.  Hydraulics! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/126/04c/36212604c8c14f309da20144f2702034.jpg"><br><br>  A fun detail - when the pump runs from the supply hose back into the bucket a thin stream beats: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/db7/412/fb4db7412aa1487e991715704419c632.jpg"><br><br>  I thought it was damage to the hose, but no - the hole is clearly staffed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/363/802/5f3/3638025f316f412f81766af5d30f4029.jpg"><br><br>  Apparently, this is such a "balancing jet", relieves the pump pressure. <br>  So, here is a watering system for two plants: <br><br>  You can add eight more - but no more.  It's a pity.  As for me, it would not hurt to add several small threes to the kit in order to divide, if necessary, the flow from one branch to several plants that are less demanding to watering.  It is necessary to try on the diameter of a triple with a car washer.  They seem to be thicker at a glance, but maybe it will stretch?  Then the hoses can be lengthened due to car wash tubes ... Yes, and low-voltage car valves ... An interesting idea ... * left to think about further tuning of the system * <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  This is a practical solution that works out of the box right away.  Readers of the site have the opportunity to purchase the AutoLayka Automatic Watering Plant with a 10% discount using <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/avtoleika/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Davtoleika%26utm_content%3Davtoleika%26utm_campaign%3Davtoleika_200">the GEEKT-LEIKA code</a> , which is valid 14 days from the date of publication of this article.  As for me, inexpensive - especially in the format of a gift.  I can immediately offer several cheaper and versatile self-made solutions "made of clay and sticks", but as a gift, this will not work. <br><br>  Advantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ready-made solution, all included. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Just set up even for a retired humanities <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not spoil the interior, if you find a nice bucket. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Inexpensive. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lack of power supply from the network <br>  ‚Ä¢ Failure to secure the battery cover <br>  ‚Ä¢ Limited system scalability (Low hose! We need a threesome!) <br><br>  I, on the whole, am satisfied with the acquisition.  Now let's see how mom will like it. <br><br>  <i>Author: Pavel Ievlev, Voronezh</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393879/</a></p>
