We figured out and identified two types of procrastination: fatal, which leads to intractable life problems and painful psychological effects, and avoidable, in which a person even after a critical point in time still performs the necessary work on time. <br><br>  Under the cut, we cite cases of movement of PRO-type procrastinators, both in the past and in the future, we count the speed of such movements, as well as the effect of procrastination on life before and after the deadlines. <br><br>  We accompanied the article with rigorous mathematical calculations, as well as data from an experiment that was conducted on six volunteers.  With this work, we spoke at the largest <a href="https://vk.com/dfmipt_antinauka">anti-science conference</a> , which this year will be held on May 4th.  So you can trust us (well, or not, because today is April 1).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/im/fb/vwimfbaj89rh-34qpqx2zkj5ccm.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A typical student situation is when a classmate comes to your room and asks how many tickets you have prepared for the exam, and you catch yourself thinking that you should finish the first task.  ‚ÄúMove in time!‚Äù, You say.  "Procrastination!" - We will answer. <br><br>  What is procrastination?  By definition, an authoritative source is a tendency to constantly postponing unpleasant things for later, that is, postponing the overwhelming majority of cases in our life for later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kv/ps/3k/kvps3k9yjrjondvi3xck0oqtvvw.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1. The definition of procrastination from those most reputable sources</i> <br><br><h2>  Very complex scientific calculations </h2><br>  Below we give a very complex reasoning to confirm the possible connection between movements in time and procrastination. <br><br>  Let's start with the fact that we consider the schedule of work performance by a normal person and a procrastinator. <br><a name="1"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/w8/up/rpw8up594dy9ww6umk02qwiuqd8.png"><br>  Figure 2. Work done from time to time - ordinary person, fatal procrastination and PRO <br><br>  Suppose we have work <i>A0</i> , which needs to be completed in <i>T Finite</i> time.  An ordinary person performs work evenly.  And what happens to procrastinators?  Like limits, procrastination is disposable and non-removable.  People suffering from fatal procrastination, always do the work very slowly, as shown in the figure by a dotted line.  Creatures with fatal procrastination, eliminates evolution. <br><br>  Much more interesting is disposable procrastination, that is, those people who, after a certain level of Tkrit, manage to do all the work on time.  Such procrastinators, in our opinion, deserve the respectful definition of ‚ÄúPRO‚Äù.  By experience, the most fearless PROs manage to complete the work on time, even when <i>Tkrit</i> strives for the <i>Finite</i> . <br><a name="2"></a><br><blockquote>  We take for granted the assumption that PRO always does work on time, regardless of the schedule path. </blockquote><br><br>  Since time is a sequence of events, we logically accepted part of the work performed as the reference events.  For a normal person, as seen in Figure 1, time flows evenly.  PRO does the same parts of the work for a significantly different time. <br><br>  In his reporting system <i>, time heterogeneity arises, and this hints at the possibility of movement in time</i> . <br><br><h2>  Thermodynamics of procrastination </h2><br>  Now we prove strictly.  For this we consider the isothermally existing ordinary person and PRO.  By virtue of the constancy of the internal energy of an ordinary person, the work done by him is equal to the energy brought to him. <br><br> <code>A = Œ¥Q</code> <br> <br>  Now consider PRO, it eats more and sleeps: <br><br> <code>Œ¥Qpro &gt; Œ¥Q,</code> <br> <br>  but it works less: <br><br> <code>Apro &lt; A</code> <br> <br>  So for him, Apro&gt; Œ¥Qpro, that is, the energy conservation law is not satisfied.  In turn, according to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259D%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">theorem of Neter,</a> each conservation law is a consequence of the symmetry of space-time, that is, in our case, the absence of the energy conservation law is equivalent to the assertion that time is not uniform.  And the heterogeneity of time is an excellent loophole to travel in it. <br><br><h2>  With procrastination - in a bright future </h2><br>  Procrastinators no longer surprise anyone with the ease with which they move into the future.  We present the dependence of the speed of movement into the future and the speed of work performance on some factors. <br><br>  Thus, the power drops sharply with the increase in the number of PROs collected together, and the speed with which they rush into the future increases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r8/vd/dh/r8vddhtjmgf5ebt6utxasadrzy8.png"><br>  <i>Figure 3. Power and speed of time against the number of PROs collected together.</i> <br><br>  Now look at the same parameters from the hours of sleep per day.  At 0 and at 24 hours of sleep per day, the power is zero, while the optimum is reached somewhere at 8 hours.  The speed of time, however, gradually increases and at 24 hours of sleep in days tends to infinity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/4q/ef/oy4qeftub3chmx_inf5y4acklmq.png"><br>  <i>Figure 4. The power and rate of time from the hours of sleep per day</i> <br><br><h2>  Cheating time </h2><br>  Of course, the most interesting thing is traveling to the past and they can be done with the help of procrastination. <br><br>  Recall <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mipt/blog/446242/">Figure 2</a> and move the point <i>Tkrit</i> farther and farther away so that it is beyond the <i>finite</i> .  This can be done by instructing another PRO to keep track of time.  We think it is obvious to all that these guys will remember the work after the deadline for its implementation.  However, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mipt/blog/446242/">axiom number one</a> remains in force, so the work schedule takes the form as shown in Figure 5. At that point, the <i>future</i> , when our <i>PROs</i> realize that it is time to get down to business, time will turn its direction and work will be done on time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/is/jc/tbisjclckuhihgatxyyhdshbwri.png"><br>  <i>Figure 5. Work done from time to time - PRO travels into the past</i> <br><br>  Such situations can often be found within the walls of higher education institutions.  The student does not go on pairs up to the most effective week ( <i>segment 0 - Tcritical</i> ), does not receive credits ( <i>Tcritical</i> ), does not prepare for the session and does not give it ( <i>T</i> ), but in the future does not <i>turn</i> out to be deducted.  Given the undeniable axiom of the impartiality of the education system, it is obvious that the student has moved into the past and passed the session there. <br><br><h2>  Experiments </h2><br>  A simple experiment helped us to better understand the essence of procrastination.  We asked six volunteers to do a simple task - to draw a horse.  Here are the pictures of horses that turned out: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u1/vb/pi/u1vbpitndjg2osuf0iq1hhvhtyo.png"><br><br>  Obviously, ‚Ññ2 and ‚Ññ6 are ordinary people, they honestly completed the task. <br>  ‚Ññ5 - fatal procrastination, his horse we did not wait. <br>  But number 1, number 3 and number 4 - this is the real PRO.  No. 1 was distinguished by special creativity, No. 4 - by special disorder, No. 3 - just downloaded a picture from the Internet. <br><br>  We hope that <a href="https://mipt.ru/docs/official/procrast.pdf">our work</a> will help you to distinguish the time traveler from mere mortals. <br><br><h2>  What did you just read? </h2><br>  Someday we plan to continue our research, but for now we invite you on May 4 to the FestTech open youth festival, where the <a href="https://vk.com/dfmipt_antinauka">Anti-Scientific Conference</a> will take <a href="https://vk.com/dfmipt_antinauka">place</a> . <br><br>  What is an anti-science conference?  These are reports on the pressing, but not yet studied, problems of humanity: tusdynamics, the physical theory of student sleep, or the study of supercold relations. <br><br>  Every year the conference gathers hundreds of listeners.  And if earlier the anti-scientific humor was limited to the lecture audience of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, this time the speakers can share their theory from the stage of the Landau Hall at the Physical Park. <br><br>  To present your anti-report to the world, it is not necessary to study for 42 years, you just need to <a href="http://festtech.tilda.ws/antinauka">submit an application</a> before April 7 and be thoroughly prepared. <br><br>  If you want to attend the conference as a spectator, register for the festival <a href="http://festtech.tilda.ws/">FestTech</a> - this is the first open event on technology and science, which grew out of the traditional Physics Days of MIPT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/cs/e4/c6cse4pzcydmlpwfqjoeg_qsesg.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446242/</a></p>
