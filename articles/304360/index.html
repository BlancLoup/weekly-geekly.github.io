      I give an example.  When I was small, I was ill for CSKA hockey and every second day I washed dishes for the whole family.  I liked the first, the second - not very much.  And I came up with an interesting game: big spoons played hockey with small ones, and knives played with forks.  Whom I get out of the sink and wash it, he won.  And such a game really brightened me the process and motivated me to do the routine work. <br><br>  People first started playing games, and then they came up with using them in business.  Gamification was used initially to attract customers, then to motivate staff, and in the community there is no unequivocal opinion about the benefits of gamification within organizations. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the one hand, there are examples of gamification, which bring in additional billions of dollars (for more details, see Gabe Zickerman‚Äôs <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/26014129/"><u>book, Gamification in Business</u></a> ).  There is a corporate social-motivational network of <a href="http://www.pryaniky.com/ru/Product/Gamification"><u>Gingerbread</u></a> , which basically uses gamification.  You can go to their website and see their success stories. <br><br>  On the other hand, I remember how at the beginning of the two thousandth our work was paralyzed for several days because of the flash game <a href="http://www.1001guru.ru/games/Hit%2BThe%2BPenguin"><u>Hit the Penguin</u></a> .  It is alleged that the loss of working time due to this game exceeded the losses from all computer viruses combined.  That is, inadequate play can lead to negative results.  Or, Yuri Fedoseyev, the founder of the corporate social network <a href="http://daoffice.ru/"><u>DaOffice</u></a> , believes that it <a href="https://vc.ru/p/gamification"><u>is better not to use gamification in working with people</u></a> , but rather to motivate through leadership. <br><br>  But every day our environment is changing.  The millenniums and the Z generation are coming onto the scene. It seems to me that I had found the key to their understanding in Zikermann: ‚ÄúThe main difference between the millennium generation and the rest of the world is excessive dependence on the game.‚Äù <br><br>  What follows from this?  Over the past few years, we have been taught that a crisis is not a crisis, but such a new reality.  Then it turns out that the game is not a game, but a new language of communication of the new generation.  We speak different languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith them.  So that we can work together with them, we need to learn to speak the language of gamification, and young people to learn to speak the language of our corporate culture. <br><br><h2>  Learning to speak </h2><br>  Here are the top three requests from young people who come to work: feedback, friends and fun.  Return - it is important to regularly note the progress of employees.  Friends - communication between employees, not only in the usual sense of the word, but also friends in social networks.  Fun - is different, but usually it is pleasure and a sense of satisfaction. <br><br>  The most advanced employers will create conditions where there will be an opportunity to progress rapidly, there will be more connections between employees, they will create an atmosphere of fun.  And attract the best young people.  What to do the rest? <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQXYYtLXCy0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIOPczl1v-jeJvfRL3CGUKuBv3VQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Learn to speak </h2><br>  ‚ÄúThey come to work without the slightest experience, but with great expectations‚Äù, ‚Äúthey are not at all concerned with responsibility and advancement along the career ladder‚Äù, ‚Äúany negative reaction to their work makes them depressed‚Äù, ‚Äúonly under constant supervision they will do everything right ‚Äù,‚Äú they got used to it from childhood that everyone around them only does what they praise. ‚Äù <br><br>  Familiar quotes, yes?  It's funny that they said the same about generation Y. <br><br>  But, let's say, we decided that even if the Millennians themselves adapt to our style, whether they like it or not.  Type of life will teach.  And in fact, not life, and we ourselves will be taught.  Only here is the catch.  If we ourselves have brought up such a generation of our children, why should we suddenly take it and re-educate them?  Only shock therapy remains.  Will it work this time? <br><br>  In general, we'll see. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <a href="http://www.supereon.ru/about/">|</a>  <a href="http://www.supereon.ru/about/"><u>Supereon</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304360/</a></p>
