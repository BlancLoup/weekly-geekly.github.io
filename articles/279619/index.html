  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Non-technical program PHDays, or From hackers to artists one step</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/279619/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7b/f4a/eff/a7bf4aeff88440458b701ccfe99fcc21.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Hackers and artists - it would seem, what could be common between them, because these are completely different worlds?  However, they both know firsthand what inspiration and creative process are.  We decided to repeat <a href="http://2015.phdays.ru/press/news/40965/">last year‚Äôs experience</a> and gather hackers, artists and all creative people at the site of the Positive Hack Days International Practical Security Forum.  We tell what will be behind the scenes of the technical program. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  An exhibition of illustrations by Alexey Andreev, an artist from St. Petersburg, will be held for visitors and participants of PHDays.  His work, made in the technique of digital painting, is very fond of visitors last year's forum.  The artist again invites everyone to go on a journey to the fantasy world: objects and phenomena familiar to the eye appear in a new light, and it seems that everything that happens is true that this is the real life.  Fantasy plots, charming heroes and incredible credibility - here, perhaps, are three main components of the paintings of Andreev.

      This time the artist prepared a surprise - a series of paintings with augmented reality.  Visitors to the exhibition will be able to "revive" the picture using a smartphone.  To do this, you need to download a special application and scan the QR code of the picture you like.  Just a few seconds, and you are already in the world of flying electric trains and post-apocalyptic monsters.  Everyone will have the opportunity to talk with the artist and purchase his <a href="http://www.alexandreev.com/">paintings</a> . <br><br>  As before, the game zone will work.  Soviet slot machines, classic old school - ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù, ‚ÄúSea battle‚Äù, ‚ÄúAutoRally-M‚Äù.  As well as Sega, Dendy and PlayStation, loved by everyone in the 90s.  Energize before many hours of virtual battles or before a new portion of the reports can be in the machine with space food.  Yes, yes, the one in the tube that astronauts feed in orbit. <br><br>  Forum organizers have prepared a few surprises.  For example, it will be possible to communicate behind the scenes not only with colleagues, but also with a real robot.  He will answer any question - unless, of course, he likes the other person. <br><br>  Lovers of high art will meet with amazing art objects.  PHDays Chronicle on a panel of floppy disks, a hacker manifesto on a big screen, optical installations that can only be viewed from a strictly defined distance ... You can deceive your eyesight and literally hear how the brain works - all this and much more will be available on PHDays VI. <br><br>  Will not stay aside and literature.  Readings will again be held this year as part of the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/press/news/45372/">Hacked Future</a> ‚Äù cyberpunk story contest.  The stories that reached the final will be read out by the permanent participants of the forum, the creators of the cult radio program <a href="https://mds.ru/">Model to Build</a> .  They will create the right atmosphere: reading will be accompanied by modern electronic music.  By the way, each of you still has the opportunity to become a participant in the competition: stories are accepted until April 15, 2016 at <a href="">cyberpunk@ptsecurity.com</a> . <br><br>  Recall that PHDays VI is just around the corner - it will take place on May 17 and 18, 2016 at the World Trade Center in Moscow.  The forum will bring together security experts and hackers, government officials, businessmen, young scientists and journalists from around the world.  Do not miss the chance to take part!  You can buy tickets on the page <a href="http://runet-id.com/event/phdays16">runet-id.com/event/phdays16</a> .  To participate in the forum <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/how_to_join/">for free</a> , you can perform research in the field of information security (the second wave of <a href="http://www.phdays.ru/call_for_papers">Call for Papers</a> will last until March 31), become a participant in one of the hacker contests (registration and qualifying competitions will open closer to May) or reach the final of the story contest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279619/</a></p>
