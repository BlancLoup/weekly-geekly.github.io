Under the cut, there are three dozen photos about the Odnoklassniki Riga office - it is within its walls that they create a project the way you see it now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/169ef859/06667b2b/7b2ab68f/23a78711.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, you can read a recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/130546/">interview</a> with <b>Elina Parkhomenko</b> , product development director. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first problem you encounter in another country is mobile communication, roaming.  In this regard, our colleagues are very happy - right at the airport, they gave us corporate iPhones with local sim cards.  On devices, their official application was installed, in which Deniskin and I were registered - we were added as friends to each other, as well as to several other company employees - so that we could communicate with each other, for example, if we were lost.  Not everyone knows, but Odnoklassniki launched <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/odnoklassniki/blog/128328/">video calls</a> through their service, the convenience of which even surprised me.  It is also worth paying tribute to local telecoms operators - 3G is everywhere, even on the seafront in Jurmala

      The company's office is located 8 kilometers from the center of Riga - in the business center <b><a href="http://www.pblcbiznesacentrs.lv/">PBLC Biznesa Centrs</a></b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f6885829/440ba21a/9806faf0/1f461fa7.jpg"><br><br>  We flew there and back by plane, which made it seem as if the company's office is located somewhere in the sub-Moscow region.  But by and large, the location of the office can be considered a suburb, so no one gets there on foot from home - either by public transport (including by taxi), or by their cars, or, if the season is, also by bicycle.  There is a rather large parking area around the office, which many business centers often cannot boast: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/aef49cd0/44a5a276/e18337ee/faeb1f6c.jpg"><br><br>  On the other side of the building is another parking.  Trollmode on: Tractors of those who left Russia on time are clearly visible from the upper floors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/72b6f468/85f896e6/e3c853cf/7cd30597.jpg"><br><br>  Classmates occupy two floors (4 and 5) of the six in this building - I don‚Äôt remember the exact distribution of employees across the floors, but it‚Äôs like the support staff working below, and the developers, designers and management are at the top. <br><br>  We go in the elevator and after a moment at the reception we are met by a smiling girl - she told us exactly where.  However, we probably wouldn‚Äôt get lost either - <b>Nadir</b> [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/saratsin/"><b>Saratsin</b></a> ] <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/saratsin/"><b>Khabdulin</b></a> , PR-manager of the company, was with us as a guide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19f/33c/947/19f33c947822c8eb4de58a17ecf45fba.jpg"><br><br>  The first thing that struck us was when we entered the ‚Äúworking‚Äù premises - the number of people working ... almost in perfect silence.  It usually happens like this: in an undivided space, there are a lot of people who freely communicate with each other;  everyone has their own music, someone is talking on the phone - the result is a completely inactive situation (as, for example, in the publishing house GameLand).  Some companies (the same Intel) solve this issue by dividing the space into personal cells - the so-called "cubicles", but in the case of "classmates" there was no need for them - there was almost perfect silence. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know, maybe this is European calm, but anyway, we decided not to disturb the peace and all the time spoke in half a voice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c7ecbd5/d18ded74/eb96e5a1/cf7d8022.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4ad03f8/858f9a5d/d5470186/7f26aac1.jpg"><br><br>  Workplaces are fairly common - long tables, separated by small partitions.  Each employee has an office chair and 1 or 2 monitors, depending on the tasks.  The number of "poppies" could be counted on the fingers of one hand - all either on the "pussy" or on laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2772c02d/e3ac19e0/89c9e356/2b5474ab.jpg"><br><br>  Everybody‚Äôs working day starts in different ways: if some collective work is done (for example, a manager, designer and 2 programmers do some kind of service), the group decides how much they need to be at work.  The rest - you can come and 8 and 10. No dress code - someone under the table, I saw a cozy home sneakers :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cf9f7ea1/7b3940fb/29838731/2945c67c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/da477b7f/88d61307/7397516d/cd62e681.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a5165a9d/a245845c/af71bcb1/38b6dae8.jpg"><br><br>  The photo shows a TV hanging on the wall - the project statistics is displayed in real time on it. <br><br>  The office employs about 100 people, 25 of whom are developers, the rest are designers, testers and others.  The youngest has just turned 20 years old, the youngest is exactly twice as old.  The number of girls was pleasantly surprised - there are about a quarter or even a third of the total number of employees.  That's right - programmers among them, too! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/84fdfb53/450e22cd/a6414555/9de21cce.jpg"><br><br>  More familiar to the girl is the profession of the designer - there are in the company and such.  In the photo below, I almost revealed a winter project: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8b53704d/6f460be8/fa42dbbe/826387e2.jpg"><br><br>  Frontal place designers.  Most recently, the slender ranks of the staff joined <b>Alisher</b> [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alisher/"><b>Alisher</b></a> ] <b>Yakupov</b> , a former designer of TM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6e157111/459f7093/92cca47d/d9aafe5a.jpg"><br><br>  Another 20 percent is the technical support service - on the lower floor of the office there are girls from the ‚Äúsecond line‚Äù - those who answer the most difficult (non-template) questions.  The first line, which takes the brunt, is in Ivanovo. <br><br>  More recently, the caliper was about 25 thousand hits per day (!), Of which 70-80% were associated with forgetting passwords.  Refactoring help helped reduce the number of requests by more than 5 times, and the operative readability of requests is 100%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8dc28b10/20e427d6/64ffed74/f0dbbe50.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7c3c4577/f4bfbd6b/e0ccfe4a/95ec13f0.jpg"><br><br>  All rooms are very bright - thanks to daylight and large windows around the perimeter of the building.  Here, for example, several meeting rooms: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b2e36a93/2e2707e7/5aa57de3/5e7d72fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8729b9f0/eb464ee7/3d5bc7b1/2b3fe5de.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/590995b2/fda61975/e87fbf30/5ad16a33.jpg"><br><br>  There are separate rooms for video conferencing.  Surprisingly, all this is not just in stock (for a tick ") - it really is used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3ed5041a/fe2deec9/9664bedf/2e7862c2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/027d2d33/e9732898/6261b9e7/cf7649b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8966eef6/b71319a3/9fbb90bc/c1f6f9e9.jpg"><br><br>  I did not see rooms for rest as such, although there are plenty of sofas and ottomans on which you can sit with a tea and discuss something.  In the room near the kitchen - a living area with fish: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a8658ca1/1c9f9484/4eb37610/4da4ec3c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6d427bad/aadbd326/2eddaa87/d70c3376.jpg"><br><br>  On the ground floor, there seems to be a separate gym, but we didn‚Äôt go there.  On the top floor, we stuck at the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D1%2581">Novus</a> table - the Latvian version of billiards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/67bd851c/303e64cf/2d0c6638/9db42734.jpg"><br><br>  No special boxes and playschenes for you - you need to work at work and this is correct <br><br>  But in the office there is a good tradition to all together celebrate any event in the life of the team.  Was a child married or born?  Passed on the right or bought a car?  Birthday?  In any of these cases - cakes and tea, alcohol is not welcome. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/81de4b98/90000ef8/6c2e712d/0e06d01b.jpg"><br><br>  Pleasant was the fact that almost everyone reads Habr - from system administrators and programmers, to the support service girls.  However, conspiracy and espionage skills helped us to remain in the rear of the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù unnoticed :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a5dc92cc/752e68a6/befc33ff/c682c86c.png"><br><br>  Actually, in the photos above you saw those jobs in which the project is being forged, and in the photo those people who do it. <br><br>  As you can see, there are quite a few differences between the offices of the two social networks (which we were able to visit).  If a somewhat outrageous office of Vkontakte (however, it was in this form it was rented) only reinforced the stereotype of the ‚Äúevil empire‚Äù, then in the case of classmates the opposite picture is light, quiet and peaceful.  If ‚ÄúVK‚Äù has a little irrational use of space (I think it is a matter of time), then the situation in ‚ÄúOK‚Äù is felt more relaxed and with everything necessary for fruitful work.  But in general, it is a rather strange idea to compare anything in this question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/db1051f3/08bc7632/7d6bcd1c/d7a21b38.jpg"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, everything.  I will tell you about Riga itself on Autokadabar the other day, by the way, we have just updated it.  If you want to ‚Äútravel‚Äù to other offices, then here are a couple of links to other articles in this series: <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">Office of the company Vkontakte</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/82533/">Office of Intel</a> (in Moscow) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/106911/">Office of Intel</a> (in Nizhny Novgorod) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/91646/">Boomburum office</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/p/83155/">Data center "Oversan-Mercury"</a> <br><br>  Thank you all for the warm welcome.  What company to visit next time? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130518/</a></p>
