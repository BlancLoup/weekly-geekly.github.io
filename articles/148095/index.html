What for?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, habroody! <br><br>  The value of the ability to speak in public is difficult to overestimate, but many bypass the side issues of oratory.  And then they wonder why they are not listened to, and if they listen, they are not interested in the topic.  If you want to learn how to communicate with the audience, if you want to learn a little more about the art of public speaking, then welcome under cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before you start to learn something you need to try to structure this "something". <br>  So, let's start with a simple question: what parts is the public speaking about? <br>  a) <b>Introduction</b> <br>  b) <b>Main part</b> <br>  c) <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  And all?  You have not forgotten anything? .. That's right!  One of the most important stages of public speaking is d) <b>Preparation</b> .  Let's walk in chronological order for each of the components of public speaking. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. <b><i>Preparation</i></b> . <br>  a) During the preparation for public speaking, great attention should be paid to appearance.  You should be neatly dressed, clean-shaven, etc.  Remember, the attention of the audience should be directed to you and the audience should be pleased to look at you. <br>  b) Analyze the audience!  Speech to academics and kindergarteners can not be the same.  Focus on the part of your report that is interesting to your audience. <br>  Example: presenting your project to investors should pay attention to the financial side.  Presenting it to scientists / experts should show the scientific, ideological component (the financial side is indifferent to them) Banal observation!  But it's amazing how many young startups do wrong. <br>  c) Prepare materials for your presentation.  This may be a presentation, funny pictures, handouts.  I don‚Äôt want to touch upon the topic of a presentation that deserves a separate article  I will only say one thing: your presentation slides must contain a minimum amount of text. <br>  d) Rehearse the performance.  Over time, you will need less and less time for rehearsal.  But first you need to carefully work out your performances in front of the mirror, friends, pets. <br>  d) Tune in to perform.  Many have retained a heavy attitude towards performances.  Remember how in your school years you didn‚Äôt want to be called to the blackboard?  Remember how you wanted to ‚Äúlive through‚Äù your performance at a scientific conference?  The most important aspect of a successful performance is self-tuning.  Enjoy the performance!  (whatever you do, if you don‚Äôt enjoy it, it‚Äôs impossible to achieve high results). <br><br>  2. <b><u>Introduction</u></b> <br>  It is very important to be remembered, to attract the attention of the audience.  Do something unusual at the beginning of the speech.  Try to surprise them. <br><br><img src="http://static.pokato.net/2011-01-31-19-35-311803967223.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A great example of attracting attention.  Advertising network eateries "SubWay". <br><br>  What should I say in the introduction? <br>  First, it is very important to introduce yourself.  Many immediately go to work - do not!  Say a few words about yourself.  Only shortly.  Explain to the audience why you are exactly: why you are the best in this field, why they should believe you. <br>  Then there are several options: <br>  a) <b>Announcement</b> .  Introduce the listeners.  Briefly.  Why is the problem relevant right now?  You can outline a short plan for further narration. <br>  b) <b>Gratitude</b> .  Thank the people who made you attend this lecture.  Thank the audience. <br>  c) <b>Compliment</b> .  Praise the listeners.  Tell me that you have never had such an interesting audience.  Say you have long wanted to give a lecture for such smart people.  Options for the sea! <br>  d) <b>History</b> .  Tell an enlightening story.  This story should demonstrate to the audience the importance of your speech.  (In general, the use of different stories / personal experience is one of the most important differences between a successful speaker and a novice) <br>  e) <b>Interaction with the audience</b> .  It could be a vote, a game or something else.  (Actually, I like it when a speaker actively interacts with his audience from the beginning to the end of his speech) <br>  ... Options can be very different, show imagination or combine the above. <br>  Remember: the introduction is the first impression of an orator, and making a good first impression is extremely important. <br><br>  3. <b><u>The main part</u></b> . <br>  Here you have to brightly reveal the topic.  General recommendations are difficult to give.  Try to organize interaction with the audience.  Remember: lecture is an outdated format.  Voting, polls, games with the audience will give your lecture charm. <br>  About specific techniques, I will write below.  It is very important to correctly divide your performance into parts.  Each part should be a logically complete fragment.  So he will be remembered by the audience. <br><br>  4. <b><u>Conclusion</u></b> . <br>  In conclusion, you need to repeat the main points told at the beginning.  Not bad to show the future direction of work (some links, books, unsolved problems). <br>  Say goodbye (davidosvidaniya, until, see you), if the lecture will have a continuation, say about it. <br>  Thank listeners, organizers, etc. <br>  ... come up with something original. <br>  No need to delay the conclusion.  As a rule, the audience understands that you are completing and their attention begins to dissipate. (Especially when after the performance there is a coffee break, lunch, sauna, ...) <br><br>  So, with the structure of public speaking figured out, and this is half the way to success.  Now we will analyze some typical techniques, we note what is important to pay during a public speech. <br><br>  1. <b><u>Gestures, facial expressions.</u></b> <br>  First of all, gestures and facial expressions should correspond to your words (it is called a very clever word congruence). <br>  In no case do not plan your gestures in advance (this will add flimsy, which should be avoided during a public speech). <br>  Gestures should be open, show that you are active, interested in what you are saying.  I think after watching the movie about Steve Jobs attached below you will not have questions on this part. <br><br>  2. <b><u>Intonation, voice.</u></b> <br>  Learn to play with voice.  If you want something to remember the listeners speak a little lower.  Want to make fun of something?  Speak up. <br>  <i>Exercise.</i> <br>  Read the poems.  That high voice, then low.  That quickly, then slowly.  And now the height of mastery: start slowly and lowly and gradually until the end of the poem, accelerate and make your voice higher.  This will help you learn to control intonation and voice. <br><br>  3. <b><u>Personal stories.</u></b> <br>  By supporting what has been said from personal experience, you greatly increase the weight of your words.  Therefore, prepare stories on your subject.  Short, interesting, memorable. <br><br>  4. <b><u>Experiments.</u></b> <br>  Remember, public speaking is a creative process.  So look for new formats, try something original.  Do not be afraid to look stupid.  (for the latter you need to try very hard, believe me) <br><br>  Now I want to talk about how to <b>learn to</b> speak in public. <br>  1. <b>Speak</b> <br>  What you need to do to run well?  Right, run!  And what should I do to perform well? .. Speak, speak, look more than once.  Before friends, at conferences, in universities, etc.  Got a chance to speak?  Do not miss it. <br><br>  2. <b>Learn from the masters.</b> <br>  Watch the recordings, go to master classes and speeches, analyze their speech and gestures.  Each of the great speakers can comprehend something and thus improve their skills. <br>  Need to learn from <br>  a) Radislav Gandapas - if someone does not know, the coolest Russian business coach.  Specializes in public speaking, leadership, etc.  He's great.  He also wrote good books on oratory, which you can purchase.  All details on the website <a href="http://www.radislavgandapas.com/">www.radislavgandapas.com</a> . <br><br>  b) Steve Jobs.  Does not need representation. <br><br>  c) Barack Obama.  (Of all the political figures, I especially want to highlight Barack Obama. He is a great speaker. I think his skills appeared in his university years, when he was actively engaged in debates). <br><br>  d) Famous politicians.  (without the ability to speak publicly, it is impossible to become successful in the political arena) <br><br>  3. Go to <u><b>meetings of</b></u> people who are engaged in public speaking. <br>  If you search, you will most likely find such in your city.  If not, organize yourself!  Perform there, watch other people's performances.  Approach them with criticism.  In this way, you will get an extremely useful experience. <br><br>  And for dessert, the promised video about Steve Jobs. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SA71yQ0JgXk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhdwn_PONWzDi_FtY74LJ5TbEKQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I would be very interested to read your feedback on the article in the comments or personal messages. <br><br>  <i>Perform, enjoy the performances and be <b>happy</b> !</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148095/</a></p>
