Where was I during their IPO ?! ‚ÄùThe question is really reasonable, although many of the exclaimed Russians at that time had little idea what an IPO was, and not everyone knew about Google.  In fact, when two students came up with something in their garage, many told them that searching the Internet was a hopeless task, but catalogs were yes, this was a necessary thing. <br><br>  The IPO of the <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> search engine took place much later than Google.  The leader of search in China and the 4th most visited site in the world started from only $ 27 per share last year, now the price has grown about 4 times.  Many serious investors will probably say that this is not serious.  But let's argue. <br><br>  Remember such an important thing as prospects.  Already, the company's revenues are growing exponentially.  Already, Baidu is really the leader of the search in Chinanet, and this is despite Google‚Äôs entry into the Chinese market (a funny phrase, by the way, is the Chinese market).  Place Google in this country can now be described something like this - "nervously smokes on the sidelines." 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Moreover, Baidu is the search leader not in an ordinary country, but in the country with the largest population.  It is this population that provides it with the fourth position in world attendance.  100 million Chinese (out of 1.3 billion) are now using the Internet - and most of them use Baidu, and obviously more often than we use Yandex. <br><br>  Baidu extracts maximum opportunities from the fact that its developers speak Chinese well: Baidu Space is an analogue of Blogger, Baidu Knows is a competitor of Yahoo Answers, several services are on the way.  It is the use of ‚Äúnational color‚Äù that makes this company the leader.  And its name appeals to the ancient Chinese poem for a reason: the creators of Baidu initially relied on Chinese as the basis of business. <br><br>  Moreover, last week CEO Robin Lee announced that Baidu had been developing the engine in Japanese for 6 months.  Thus, as early as next year, the Chinese company plans to begin seizing the Japanese market. <br><br>  All this is slightly reminiscent of the situation in the global economy.  There is a USA - a world power with huge capital and monster companies.  And there is China - there are many inhabitants there.  When Baidu starts to search in English, someone will have to drive sanctions. <br><br>  So maybe it's better to buy some Baidu?  Anyway, Google won't be able to keep up (although it is now cheaper than $ 500) ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4794/</a></p>
