The technologies of production of solar and rechargeable batteries, countless electronic devices, mining, etc. are harmful to the environment and humans. In these cases, heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium, etc. are often a byproduct of the production process. deposited when released into the soil as part of various compounds. <br><br>  In connection with the above-mentioned problem, the treatment of waste water from heavy metals is of particular importance today.  Unfortunately, the issue raised does not always take proper place in the infrastructure of the production processes of enterprises, which is connected, first of all, with the cost of the wastewater treatment plants themselves, and of the cleaning technology itself. <br><br>  A cleaning method that could become an affordable alternative to the construction of expensive and not always sufficiently effective treatment facilities was proposed by a joint team of scientists from the Institute of Intelligent Systems.  Max Planck (Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems) in Stuttgart (Germany) and the Institute of Bioengineering of Catalonia in Barcelona (Spain).  In the course of the experiments, microbets from graphene were used, which in one hour of work managed to remove more than 95% of lead from the water.

      <b>How it works</b> <br><br>  By itself, the microbot has a complex multi-layer structure.  The outer layer consists of graphene - a powerful adsorbent that captures the ions of the heavy metals of the environment with which it contacts.  The middle layer is made of nickel - ferromagnet, capable of exhibiting magnetic properties.  This makes the ‚Äúswarm‚Äù of microbots controlled by an external magnetic field.  The inside of the microbot is coated with platinum-coated.  When hydrogen peroxide is added to water, platinum acts as a catalyst for the chemical reaction of hydrogen peroxide decomposition into water and oxygen, the by-product of which are actively evolving bubbles escaping from the hollow back of the bot and creating a directional force vector.  The microbot, thus ‚Äúset up‚Äù in this way, under the control of the applied external magnetic field, having coped with the task, are collected in the right place and sent for chemical cleaning and then ready to work again. <br><br>  The proposed method of water purification using graphene robots, each of which is less than the thickness of a human hair, has serious advantages over existing purification technologies.  Such robots are not only capable of being sent to the task in groups, but also reused, thanks to a simple and inexpensive chemical cleaning process.  This advantage greatly reduces the cost of using the technology.  "Our robots are the first step towards creating a" smart "cleaning system that can remove pollution from the environment, without creating, by other systems, by-products of pollution," explains a representative of the research team Samuel Sanchez. <br><br>  At this stage, the capabilities of the demonstrated technology make it possible to remove lead from water, but using the same principle, scientists intend to expand the capabilities of microbots in order to bind ions of other heavy metals and toxic chemical compounds that are dangerous to the environment and human health.  In addition to the cleaning functions, according to the researchers - the authors of the development of micro- and non-bots of a similar design can also be used in medicine for drug delivery and sensing. <br><br>  Having received encouraging results in the laboratory, scientists have already begun to improve the technology that will allow the production of ‚Äúmicrobots-orderlies‚Äù on a production scale. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-04-microbots-polluted.html">Source + Video</a></sub></i> <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
