Technoparks are one of the important elements of a modern venture capital ecosystem.  The popularity of technology parks in recent years has declined with the advent of many fashionable Western formats supporting innovation.  Nevertheless, the leaders of technology parks and IT parks throughout Russia are striving to ensure the success of their residents and create the most comfortable and favorable conditions for them. <br><br>  We talked with representatives of a number of domestic technology parks and IT parks about how these organizations differ from each other, how they attract residents and which projects they select.

Only a small number of technology parks have all the necessary infrastructure and programs aimed at locating and creating high-tech companies.  This state of affairs is due to the fact that in Russia until recently there were no legal documents regulating the activities of technoparks, their functions and tasks.  Many ministries in one form or another tried to support the development of the conducting infrastructure, but these were not coordinated actions, but local ones, which did not allow building an effective mechanism for introducing scientific and technical research into the economy. <br><br>  <b>Could you highlight certain qualities of the leading technoparks of the country, which should be paid attention to similar organizations?</b> <br><br>  Positive dynamics is observed, it lies in the fact that some officials have finally figured out what a technopark is and that the main task of the technopark's management company is not renting premises or land for rent, but providing a full cycle of development services for new companies.  Technopark is not a business project in the traditional sense of the word, providing in a short time a cash inflow for the regional budget, but a mechanism that promotes the creation and development of new companies.  Its result is the number of high-tech companies created, the number of jobs, the increase in the taxable base. <br><br>  I hope that after the creation of the regulatory framework for the innovation infrastructure and the development of a common conceptual apparatus, the governors will have to decide to dismantle their ‚ÄúPotemkin villages‚Äù and begin to create truly effective technology parks. <br><br>  Today, there are leaders of the technopark movement: first of all, this is the Novosibirsk Academpark, the Technopark of Mordovia, the Khanty-Mansiysk Technopark.  These technology parks have all the necessary infrastructure and programs to reduce costs in the implementation of projects.  A distinctive feature of these technology parks is that they were able to create a complete system, combining elements of the innovation infrastructure, functionally supporting projects at each stage of the life cycle from idea to production. <br><br>  <b>What is the main challenge for institutes supporting technology business today?</b>  <b>Could you offer your own vision of possible solutions?</b> <br><br>  The main challenge for innovation support institutions is the need to overcome disunity, developing clear, understandable rules and regulations for each stage of support for innovative startups.  There should be no gaps in the chain of commercialization.  After all, if you carefully analyze the path from idea to product, it is clear that support institutions are most likely to work at the sales stage, and very few people are willing to work at the R &amp; D stage, experimental production.  At the same time, the main problem is not even the lack of money, but the multi-vector activity of ministries, departments, development institutions, which are obliged to contribute to the development of an innovative economy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/272/60a/fa927260aced440181ee15a1bb7f26ff.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Our questions to technoparks representatives </h4><br>  1. What is your technopark profile?  Are there any particularities in terms of the approach to the selection of projects that distinguish it (technopark) from other similar organizations? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sergey Teplov, General Director, KP Technopark "Strogino"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark "Strogino" has a universal specialization, but mainly on the territory are located companies implementing projects in the field of information technology, medicine, biotechnology, and instrument-making.  Since  The Technopark was established by the Government of Moscow, the project selection process has several stages: the primary selection of projects, the Expert Council, the Competition Commission. <br><br>  The Expert Council allows a more detailed assessment of the project from the point of view of practical implementation and feasibility regarding market conditions.  Expert and mentoring support is provided free of charge.  Experts are chosen in such a way that, in addition to theoretical knowledge, they also have professional practical knowledge on the project topic and can quickly evaluate the project and give comprehensive recommendations on the company's business profile. <br><br>  The competitive commission where representatives of the Government of Moscow enter, makes the decision by results of the expert conclusion.  The Technopark has developed its own mechanism and criteria for the selection of projects, which allows you to immediately assess the future development of the project, identify existing problems and identify ways to resolve them. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ksenia Temnikova, Development Director, Technopark Slava OJSC</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark Slava OJSC is an infrastructure object for the innovation activities of the city of Moscow.  Functionally, the property complex of the technology park is adapted to accommodate enterprises engaged in R &amp; D and R &amp; D that have created their own production (for this, the necessary energy resources, water, etc. are available).  Today, more than 60 high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in development and production in the following areas are located in the industrial park: <br><br><ul><li>  energy saving, energy efficiency and energy security; </li><li>  nanotechnology and nanomaterials; </li><li>  biomedical technologies, pharmacology, medical equipment and materials; </li><li>  mechatronics and robotics; </li><li>  information and communication technology; </li><li>  analytical equipment and control equipment. </li></ul><br>  Import substitution programs and projects are being implemented on the territory of the technology park.  A number of enterprises have a high export potential. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evdokia Rukavishnikov, Advisor to the General Director of Technopark "Sarov"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The main directions of technological specialization Technopark "Sarov" - is information technology;  laser;  energy efficient technologies;  sensors and automation;  materials and coatings. <br><br>  Technological specialization of Technopark "Sarov" was not chosen by chance.  It is focused on the scientific and human potential of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center-VNIIEF, which is located near the Technopark.  The resource of highly qualified VNIIEF specialists is actively involved in the creation of new innovative projects in the Technopark.  And the projects themselves often ‚Äúgrow‚Äù from individual technological solutions of the institute and the Sistema Group of Companies. <br><br>  However, companies of completely different directions appear among the residents of Technopark: for example, this summer the KinoAtis film company, widely known for the Belka and Strelka animated films, opened its KinoAtis-Sarov branch in Technopark Sarov.  The company's leaders chose Technopark ‚ÄúSarov‚Äù, because there is everything that is necessary to create modern cartoons using computer technology. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alexey Rodos, Head of Technopark JSC "Caliber"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In our technopark, conditions are created for the development of enterprises in the field of: multimedia technologies, information and telecommunication technologies, technologies in the field of instrumentation and measuring equipment. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Anton Ischenko, Head of the Krasnodar IT-Park</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Software, web services, mobile applications, robotics, the Internet of things, medbiotech, big data analysis, energy saving and electric transport are the main areas from which we are happy to see residents on our site and with which we provide support.  In most areas there are intersections with the direction of training specialists in universities. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Inna Lazareva, Marketing Specialist, Zhiguli Valley Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark in the field of high technologies "Zhigulevskaya Valley" has five areas of specialization, which were determined in accordance with the priority directions of development of the country's economy, as well as taking into account the historically established regional clusters.  These are: information and telecommunication technologies, transport and space development, energy efficiency and energy saving, chemistry and the development of materials with new properties, biotechnology and medicine.  Almost half of our residents implement IT projects - 59 projects out of 143. <br><br>  We have developed a multistage system for selecting projects for residents.  At the first stage, applicants' projects are selected by specialists of the management company according to two criteria: compliance with one of the technology park's activities and the novelty of the claimed development. <br><br>  At the preliminary examination stage, the scientific component of the applicant‚Äôs stated project, its innovativeness and the possibility of commercialization are assessed.  The experts at this stage are scientists - representatives of leading universities and research centers of the Samara region, Moscow and St. Petersburg, who specialize in the subject of the declared project.  Based on the results of their assessment, a preliminary opinion is drawn up for each application. <br><br>  At the final stage, the project of the applicant with a preliminary conclusion and assessment is submitted to the Expert Council of the Technopark, which is headed by the Vice-Governor, Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Investment of the Samara Region, Alexander Kobenko.  Council members decide on assigning resident status to an applicant. <br><br>  We believe that it is this resident selection scheme that allows concentrating the most breakthrough and economically successful innovative and high-tech projects at the site of the Zhiguli Valley. </div></div><br>  2. Is your technopark connected with any universities, can you get to your project directly from the training bench? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sergey Teplov, General Director, KP Technopark "Strogino"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark interacts with universities such as MGIMO, HSE, MIIT.  Technopark employees assist start-up companies and young entrepreneurs at any stage of project development from the idea to market entry. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ksenia Temnikova, Development Director, Technopark Slava OJSC</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark Slava actively cooperates with leading Moscow universities, such as the Moscow State University.  Mv  Lomonosov, National Research Technological University "MISiS", Moscow State Technical University named after N.E.  Bauman et al. For example, at present, nanoparticle sizes and nanolayers are being measured for the MSU chemical department.  Managers and employees of a number of innovative companies teach at leading technical universities.  As already noted, mainly innovative companies that have already established their production are located on the territory of the technology park. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evdokia Rukavishnikov, Advisor to the General Director of Technopark "Sarov"</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Technopark "Sarov" collaborates with NSTU.  Alekseeva, MEPI, SarFTI NRNU MEPI.  If we are talking about students, then most likely such a project can claim to be a resident of the Business Incubator of Sarov Technopark, in which start-ups on a competitive basis are entitled to preferential rental of premises and all necessary consulting assistance in organizing the business processes of the project. <br><br>  Today Technopark conducts active educational, informational and project activities.  The business incubator earned only last year, but 22 startups are already working in it.  A large block of events in the Technopark is associated with educational projects for schoolchildren and students.  In particular, we have specialized shifts in preparing students for All-Russian Olympiads in physics and mathematics, and programming. <br><br>  Last summer, the VII Summer School on Parallel Programming ‚ÄúGame Development‚Äù was held at the Technopark ‚ÄúSarov‚Äù for schoolchildren of 7-10 grades;  at the end of last year, we held the XVIII International Mathematical Tournament of high school students ‚ÄúThe Memory Cup of A.N. Kolmogorov‚Äù, which was attended by over 200 children from all over Russia from Kaliningrad to Yakutsk;  during the winter school holidays of 2015, the Sarov Technopark held a Physics and Mathematics celebration for schoolchildren of 7-11 grades, as part of which the children became participants in the qualifying round of the All-Russian Engineering Olympiad for Schoolchildren. <br><br>  Each such event is accompanied by lectures, excursions, free communication of students with residents of Technopark.  This instills a taste for innovation and provides an opportunity to understand what they are doing in technology parks. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alexey Rodos, Head of Technopark JSC "Caliber"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark ‚ÄúCaliber‚Äù cooperates with the Innovation Center of the Higher School of Economics in order to develop a marketing strategy for the development of Technopark and attract innovative companies. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Anton Ischenko, Head of the Krasnodar IT-Park</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The participation of students in the activities of the Krasnodar IT-park is quite intensive, and we are actively developing this area.  This includes the participation of students in the organization of events, and the attachment of students to the residents of a technopark for practical training.  The most active students are recruited. <br><br>  For groups of university students, we hold introductory introductory meetings with residents of the Krasnodar IT-park, and many specialized events are held at the site, in which students participate.  We work extremely positively on working on our own project, moreover, we believe that this is the only true way for a student to become a professional in his field and be in demand in the market. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Inna Lazareva, Marketing Specialist, Zhiguli Valley Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Of course, we work closely with universities.  Moreover, we believe that without this kind of interaction, a technopark simply cannot exist and develop, because in its essence a high-tech park is not just an infrastructure platform, but an environment for the implementation of innovative developments, experts in the assessment of which are primarily representatives of the scientific community.  Also, universities themselves are often the ‚Äúdonors‚Äù of projects for the technopark.  In this regard, the management company signed partnership agreements with leading regional universities at the construction stage of the technopark facilities, and this list is constantly growing. <br><br>  As for the possibility of entering the technopark "right from the school bench", there are no restrictions here.  Important stage of the project.  For children with interesting, but unformed ideas, which at this stage are not able to correctly position the future project to consumers and investors, a business incubation program operates in Zhiguli Valley.  Following the completion of the program, start-up teams should acquire all the necessary skills and competencies to commercialize their projects, learn how to develop a business plan, and prepare to further attract investment in their project.  The program of business incubation "Zhiguli Valley" is designed for a year, after which successful startups will be able to obtain the status of residents of the Technopark "Zhigulevskaya Valley". <br><br>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãpartnership with universities is cooperation within the Center for Training and Development of the Technopark human resource potential: basic departments of the International Market Institute, Volga State University of Service, Volga State University of Telecommunications and Informatics were established at the site of the Zhiguli Valley. </div></div><br>  3. What opportunities do you provide for residents?  Are there any particular elements of the technopark infrastructure or features in the services you provide that you would like to mention? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sergey Teplov, General Director, KP Technopark "Strogino"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the Technopark business incubator, premises are provided at a discounted rental rate, equipped with everything necessary to start a business.  Technopark "Strogino" provides a wide range of services on major business issues.  Also in 2014, new structural divisions were created: coworking and Hacklab in microelectronics, which expand the list of services offered by the technopark and offer different work formats. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ksenia Temnikova, Development Director, Technopark Slava OJSC</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The infrastructure of the Slava Technopark includes a Business Center, which provides services for holding public events, and a Technology Center for collective use.  Our residents and third-party customers are rented modern appliances and equipment.  Specialists of the TCSP conduct research and provide consulting services in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNanotechnology and Nanomaterials. <br><br>  From the experience of our technopark, it can be noted that often small technological Russian companies do not have enough money to buy expensive instruments and equipment that are important for the development of innovative products.  Companies can not afford to buy equipment for several million rubles.  Therefore, the Technology Center for Collective Use, equipped with all the necessary equipment for research, research and quality control, was established in the Technopark Slava.  Thus, having spent only a few thousand rubles on measurements at the Technological Park Glory TCI Center, the company can receive income from the creation of a new product for several million rubles. <br><br>  In addition, in the Glory Technopark you can get legal services, economic and marketing advice, assistance in drawing up business plans, personnel and information support. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evdokia Rukavishnikov, Advisor to the General Director of Technopark "Sarov"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark "Sarov" offers a range of services to residents: rental of premises from 11 m2, 24/7 round-the-clock operation, 24-hour security and access control, broadband communications, information support, printing, publishing and advertising services, hotel, cleaning services. <br><br>  Residents of the Sarov Technopark Business Incubator, along with the right of preferential rent, have the opportunity to examine the project, get advice on creating a business plan, attracting investors, helping to organize business meetings and finding business contacts, and attending training seminars and management training. business, consult on attracting venture financing, get assistance in choosing regional and federal small business support programs, information support. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alexey Rodos, Head of Technopark JSC "Caliber"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We represent the interests of residents at the municipal and federal levels: DNPPiP, CIR, Moscow State Budgetary Institution, development institutions, giving an opportunity to gain access to new markets.  Using our relationships with other companies, technoparks, resident companies can apply unique equipment to design and manufacture their products. <br><br>  At the initial stage of the creation of the technopark, where we are now, the high quality of the traditional services provided and the convenient location are our distinguishing features. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Inna Lazareva, Marketing Specialist, Zhiguli Valley Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In addition to providing preferential placement in office, laboratory and production buildings, the Zhigulevskaya Valley Technopark assists in promoting projects, raising funds, finding potential customers and customers, information support. <br><br>  Within the framework of the Center for Training and Development of the personnel potential of the technopark for residents, system-based workshops, seminars, courses and practices are held as part of training programs in various areas. <br>  As part of the activity of the Center for Collective Use, residents of the park have access to unique, expensive equipment of the nanotechnology laboratory.  The Center is also equipped with modern equipment for the Regional Engineering Center of the automotive cluster of the Samara region, which occupies a special place in the structure of the technopark and provides design and prototyping services for new and modernized products. <br><br>  Also in the Zhiguli Valley, the first in the region State Coworking Center ‚ÄúFUTUROOM Z-valley‚Äù was opened, which will become the main platform for the implementation of various educational activities and programs aimed at promoting entrepreneurship and innovation among young people, and where the youth business community will be formed Tolyatti city and the entire Samara region. </div></div><br>  4. Do you hold events at the request of residents?  If so, what kind of events are especially popular among them? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sergey Teplov, General Director, KP Technopark "Strogino"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Events are held regularly and on topics that are interesting to Technopark companies.  As a rule, these are topics that are related to the protection of intellectual property, access to international markets and the search for partners, opportunities to attract funding and existing measures of state and infrastructure support for start-up businesses. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evdokia Rukavishnikov, Advisor to the General Director of Technopark "Sarov"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technopark "Sarov" tries to take into account the interests and requests of its residents.  As a rule, such events are educational in nature. <br><br>  In particular, Technopark hosts programs for start-up entrepreneurs, professional growth programs, discussion platforms, round tables, and trainings, which are held in partnership with FPI RVC, Euro-Info-Consulting Center (Nizhny Novgorod), the Ministry of Support and Development small business of the Nizhny Novgorod region, Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Nizhny Novgorod region, ANO "Center for the Development of the Sarov Innovation Cluster". <br><br>  In addition, the Technopark became a supporting platform for the CSR "North-West" Foundation for conducting practical consulting sessions on the development of small high-tech companies and engineering centers. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ksenia Temnikova, Development Director, Technopark Slava OJSC</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On the subject of a variety of activities.  For innovative companies of interest are topics related to the registration of intellectual property rights in Russia and abroad, technology transfer and commercialization, investment attraction, guarantee support opportunities, preparation of business plans and financial models, features of high-tech projects presentation at presentation sessions, forums , exhibitions, etc. Along with this, of particular interest are topics related to entering foreign markets, the development of export potential  la. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Inna Lazareva, Marketing Specialist, Zhiguli Valley Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Despite the fact that the Zhiguli Valley Technopark was fully launched at the end of 2014 (the Technopark officially opened on December 28), a number of events were already held at its site at the request of existing residents.  It is difficult to single out any particular subject that is especially interesting for our residents. <br><br>  We also select events that may be useful to our residents, and most of them are enthusiastically taking part in them.  For example, last year, the management company held: a road show of development institutions ‚ÄúRussian Startup Tour‚Äù (together with Skolkovo), a two-day intensive work on developing the business model ‚ÄúSUMIT WarmUP‚Äù, designed for projects at the earliest stages, ‚ÄúDemo Day ‚Äùof the first acceleration program‚Äú StartupSamara Business Catalyst ‚Äù, the general partner of which was RVC, a video conference with the Skolkovo Technopark and many other events. </div></div><br>  5. What do you think is not enough for small Russian technology companies to become successful in their chosen field?  How can your technology park help your business in this matter? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sergey Teplov, General Director, KP Technopark "Strogino"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Russian technology companies lack government programs aimed at supporting and promoting domestic products to the market.  Expansion of import-substitution programs, purchases of domestic innovative products, programs for gaining access to financial resources will also be useful. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ksenia Temnikova, Development Director, Technopark Slava OJSC</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technology companies, as a rule, do not have enough resources.  Companies located on the territory of Technopark Slava have the opportunity to receive the status of a technology park resident and, at the same time, a range of additional opportunities for business development (for example, more opportunities to receive financing, access to markets, including the Moscow city market, training programs, work with mass media). <br><br>  It is important to note that companies are significantly expanding the possibilities for presenting their developments and technologies within the framework of presentation sessions of innovative projects, participation in forums and exhibitions both in Moscow and abroad, including international exhibitions (for example, HANNOVER MESSE). <br><br>  It is important to note that at the technopark site, technology companies are in close cooperation with each other, which allows them to reduce costs, optimize logistics, find new business partners, etc. Technology companies feel the synergistic effect of interaction. <br><br>  One of the main tasks of the technopark is to create a modern innovation ecosystem, to promote the commercialization of developments and technologies, the development of export potential, and international cooperation in the innovation sphere. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evdokia Rukavishnikov, Advisor to the General Director of Technopark "Sarov"</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  As a rule, small innovative companies lack experience in reformulating ideas into projects, in project positioning, as well as in understanding how to choose business partners and how to interact with investors.  Often, the problem of companies is the lack of investment (venture) managers in the team to implement all of the above. <br><br>  There are other problems.  For example, the restrictions that exist in the funds (development institutions): on the project stage, on the amount of the maximum investment, on the areas of investment;  difficulties in finding a co-investor in the project. <br><br>  The staff of the Sarov Technopark can help with the solution of all these problems in a quality and professional manner.

In our opinion, the problem of most developers in solving this problem is that they cannot present their project at the right angle - in such a way as to interest a potential investor. <br><br>  Technopark, through joint events, trainings and attracting mentors, is ready to contribute to finding points of contact between the developer of an innovative project and a potential investor. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283790/</a></p>
