  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hybrid forms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last days in my head (among other things) are spinning several image-pictures that I really want to stuff into some two-dimensional matrix and give an analysis of each cell.  The images are as follows: shots from ‚ÄúClone Wars‚Äù (not a full-length film that Lucas released in 2002, and the 3D cartoon that came out recently), shots from Tarkovsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúStalker‚Äù, group photos of teams of cybersportsmen who played in Starcraft, a trailer add-on to World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.  Computer cinema, traditional cinema, eSports and massive online games. <br><br>  Source materials for the entertainment of the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Computers have invaded the production process of traditional cinema a long time ago.  We can contemplate the results in cinemas at almost every show of the next blockbuster.  What promising options in this regard may arise, I have already written on the old base of the base and will write here (with the update).  For now, there are considerations about the intersection of genres at which new forms of mass entertainment and entertainment may arise.

      MMORPG and movies.  According to rumors (in the form of rare press releases) based on two popular MMOs - World of Warctarft and Everquest 2 - they are going to release movies.  The fact itself is interesting and deserves a separate posting.  I want to say a little about something else.  Is another process possible - films based on the graphics engine of these games?  After all, videos with records of raids have long been practiced in the same YouTube.  What else is possible? <br><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that, besides killing monsters and completing quests in multiplayer worlds, they play roles as well as in forests with wooden swords.  Separate servers in the same WoW are allocated to a pure roleplay, communication in the general chat about yesterday's booze in RL (‚Äúreal life‚Äù) is punishable by GMs.  Can what players play on role-playing worlds become a subject of interest for thousands of outside observers?  I think not yet.  I have not yet seen the quality of the picture Age of Conan, but it is unlikely that even she will be able to become an alternative to the picture on the engine on which Beowulf was made.  But - the technology does not stand still, I think that sooner or later such engines will arise.  And here I think there may be some good opportunities for the creators of various television series.  Actors, managing their avatars in virtuality, will be able to play roles without leaving the chairs in the studios.  No need to create scenery, no need to steam with the search for beautiful landscapes and go to New Zealand.  It is enough to start the game and make a movie in it. <br><br>  Speaking of the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù component of the MMORPG, here the prospects are much more short-term.  Live broadcasts raids top guilds become regular. <br><br>  Most importantly, the audience already has these shows - hundreds of thousands of casual players in the MMORPG.  They are similar to those fans in the stadium, who sometimes play football themselves, without pretending to world achievements, but with no less pleasure watching the progress of professional athletes.  There is a potential not only for one-off performances and shows, but also for championships, moreover, both for PvE-mode ("player against monsters") and for PvP ("player against player").  When the additions to the game worlds among the guilds begin, the competition for the championship begins - who will be the first to fill up one or another boss of the new instance.  And with respect to PvP, individual or team duels between gamers may also interest many.  This fall comes online Warhammer, in which developers have implemented the RvR mode (Realm vs Realm), implying large-scale fights between players.  Who knows, maybe the spectacle of the mass battle in the style of ‚Äúwall to wall‚Äù will have no less success than football or hockey matches. <br><br>  What else?  Of course - interactivity.  Indeed, one of the main advantages of new shows is the ability to influence the course of events in the fictional world.  There are two possible options for fantasizing how interactivity can influence modern cinema. <br><br>  The first is to ‚Äúget used to‚Äù the image of the main characters and play their own version of the film.  Or get together with friends and assign roles to each other.  In fact, it will be the same computer game, but with a time limit.  Imagine such an interactive film based on the Titanic disaster.  You become one of the passengers of this ship and, depending on who you have become, a passenger of the first or third class and how you behave, it will depend on whether you are saved or not.  Moreover, the action in such an interactive film will depend on time.  You can not save the game and the whole "disaster" last for several hours. <br><br>  The second option is less extreme.  In the 3D world, we can choose the point of view of the action.  There is no fixed point once and for all from which we watch the action in the cinema.  The opportunity to choose the perspectives for yourself or give this matter to someone who can give you a more interesting video series of the same event - the director of the show, let's call it that - is also a good direction in which cinema can develop.  Like a good book, a good movie means several readings in which the text reveals new layers.  Can truly three-dimensional movies provide an opportunity to watch them in new ways every time? <br><br>  I think that this list does not exhaust the possible hybrid forms of new mass media entertainment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48371/</a></p>
