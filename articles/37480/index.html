  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thinking about the back</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About the fact that the eyesight of programmics deteriorates - almost everyone knows and says, but few people think about an equally important part of the body - the back. <br><br>  I personally have already earned myself decent problems with the spine and I want to help others avoid it. <br><br>  In this post I touched upon key points and mistakes in questions <br><ol><li>  As we sit </li><li>  On what we sit </li><li>  Charging </li><li>  Sport </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. How we sit </h4><br>  Much has already been said in <a href="http://odionysus.habrahabr.ru/blog/37470/">How do we sit?</a>  from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/odionysus/" class="user_link">odionysus</a> So I will try not to duplicate, just give the key points and add something: <ul><li>  The back is pressed to the back of the chair.  From the buttocks to the neck.  Sure to!  And if you are slouched - do not hold the weight of your back, lean on your elbow. </li><li>  We set our legs in front of ourselves and upright to the floor.  Do not tuck under. </li><li>  Pose on foot - in any case. </li><li>  Hands are lying, not hanging in the air. </li></ul><br>  At first, it will not be so easy, and it will seem that sitting like that is more difficult.  But, believe me, over time, your body will like it.  Learn to listen to him, pay attention to what muscles you have tense, and try to relax them.

      Pretending to be a monument (a la Peter I in Petropavlovka) is also not necessary - periodically change the position.  The angle of inclination of the back of the chair is higher-lower, the feet a little closer-further, etc.  By the way, the ideal back incline is 135%, i.e.  almost reclining, it is certainly pleasant, but it is difficult to work. <br><br><h4>  2. What are we sitting on </h4><br>  Much has been said about the back, head restraints, adjustments, etc.  I will dwell on the most important and glaring. <br><br>  Most cheap "Chinese" chairs do not hold back.  The mechanism for fixing the backrest based on the clamping of a bolt on the side or compression of the spring from the bottom is sure to get loose in six months.  The result is that the back of the chair does not hold weight and you automatically move forward, hunch, hold your back with your muscles, etc. ... generally horror. <br><br>  Hence the main requirement for the chair - the possibility of a rigid fixation of the position of the backrest. <br><br>  In addition, it is desirable that the back of a chair bends forward at the level of the waist. <br><br>  I can put a plus sign in Ikea chairs, although they are more expensive than analogs, but they fulfill these requirements. <br><br><h4>  3. Charging </h4><br>  About the fact that occasionally you have to get up and warm up, everyone probably already knows.  Do it at least once an hour. <br><br>  There are special exercises for the prevention of osteochondrosis. I don‚Äôt want to copy-paste, read for example <a href="http://www.dikyl.ru/osteohondroz">here</a> . <br><br>  From myself I will add - many advise push-ups, and rightly so, but not always real in an office setting.  Push-ups can be replaced as follows: we approach the door, almost reaching, we rest with our hands the left and right joint and try to push them forward.  As the doctor-physiotherapist said, after advising this exercise, "the back will thank you." <br><br>  As an alternative to the horizontal bar - stand up against the wall, heels, legs, buttocks, back, head - are constantly pressed against the wall.  Raise your arms and stretch upwards, without lifting anything from the wall or feet from the floor, as if we want to get something. <br><br>  Note that in all descriptions of the exercises there is always the word "smoothly."  Sharp waving his head left and right, and other movements can end badly, seriously. <br><br><br><h4>  4. Sport </h4><br>  About the fact that sports need to do, now there is a blog.  I note that swimming is most beneficial for the back.  Pilates is also advised, but I have not tried it yet; I can‚Äôt say anything. <br><br>  In the rocking chair, too many simulators on the back.  For example - the rise of the body, being face down and fixing the legs and pelvis.  Any simulators where you pull something on yourself, from top to bottom, or better from top to bottom along a circular path. <br><br>  By the way, the tone of the press is very important, the inflated press is very conducive to correct posture. <br><br>  If back problems have already begun - it is better to avoid vertical loads on the spine, i.e.  weightlifting by the force of the legs with shoulders up or down. <br><br>  Well and besides everything, if you carry a briefcase or a handbag on your shoulder - change your shoulder, if you have a backpack - wear it on both shoulders or change if you have one. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> How correctly reminded in the comments - do not forget about the doctor.  If something is bothering you, hurts, etc.  - first go to the neurologist (well, or who else is doing it).  Tips for exercise, sport, etc.  He gave on personal experience, having an initial osteochondrosis of the cervical vertebrae. <br><br>  If you have something more serious, perhaps you can not for example perform stretching exercises.  To the doctor <b>must</b> ! <br><br>  PS In general, everything.  I'm afraid it turned out a little messy.  If there are comments and interest - I will try to develop any of the topics.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37480/</a></p>
