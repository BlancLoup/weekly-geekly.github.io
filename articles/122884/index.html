  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Getting rid of the FC-errors of the com.htc.bgp process on some android devices from HTC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I am the owner of an Android device from HTC based on Android 2.2.  By and large, everything in it quite suits me, but some minor flaws and not very pleasant surprises are still a bit annoying.  For me, one of the most unpleasant surprises in the operation of the device for me recently was the sudden occurrence of the FC-process error com.htc.bgp when I tried to update the weather with the help of the standard HTC application Weather.  One day, I turned on wi-fi and tried to update the weather, but almost instantly received the error <b>‚ÄúOh.</b>  <b>The com.htc.bgp process stopped unexpectedly.</b>  <b>Try again "</b> with the button <b>" Close forcibly "</b> .  Prior to this, there was no such error, I didn‚Äôt make any changes to the programs that day, and I didn‚Äôt install any new applications for quite a long time.  I admit at once that I did not reveal the causes of the error.  However, I managed to defeat it and, although the error occurs on the smartphone and now (once every two to three weeks), I know a clear method to quickly get rid of it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, briefly about the symptoms and attempts to get rid of the mistakes that I made. <br><br>  <b>Symptoms</b> <br>  On the main desktop of my smartphone, there is a clock widget, which is beloved by many owners of HTC devices, to which a tiny weather widget is attached as a bonus.  For those who do not know, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/20110628/BFj4ZVmb.jpg" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In addition, there is a separate Weather widget from the same manufacturer on another desktop: <br><br><img src="http://supermig.ru/sites/default/files/HTC_rosie13-weather-widget_0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, when you click on any of these widgets, the Weather application from HTC opens, in which you can manually update the weather at the current time. <br>  So, when I tried to update the weather it was here, in the Weather <b>application</b> , I received the notorious error.  By the way, attempts to update the weather directly from the <b>widget</b> (there is an opportunity to update the weather without going into the application) were successful - the weather was updated without any errors. <br><br>  <b>Attempts to correct the error</b> <br><br>  I will say right away that I didn‚Äôt do reset to the factory settings - a lot of necessary applications, a lot of time was spent on setting up and sorting applications in the device, etc.  And the problem is not critical (‚Äúwell, think, the weather is not updated, the rest, everything works!‚Äù), But rather annoying.  Therefore, I began to look for other ways to solve it.  Yes, by the way, restarting the device did not help either. <br>  The first thing, of course, I, remembering the precepts of my great-grandfather, asked Google about the problem.  He gave me a few links <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D659325">to</a> <a href="http://androidforums.com/eris-support-troubleshooting/81386-com-htc-bgp.html">foreign</a> <a href="http://forum.androidcentral.com/htc-droid-eris/12863-com-htc-bgp-com-htc-calendar-force-close.html">forums</a> , and two or three to <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D223000">Russian</a> <a href="http://www.4pda.ws/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D203919%26view%3Dfindpost%26p%3D7540240">resources</a> , on which I found only fragmentary recommendations on how to correct the error, which did not allow getting rid of it completely.  In no place did I see step-by-step detailed instructions for getting rid of the problem. <br><br>  Some of the tips and suggestions I have found to eliminate the problem were really worthwhile, although some of them didn‚Äôt give any results at all (say, a frequently encountered recommendation for clearing data from Calendar and Gmail applications that helped many people who encountered an error) however, in the end, the sum of most of these tips helped me, plus some of my own guesses.  In general, the sequence of my actions when an error occurs is currently this: <br><br>  1. First you need to remove the HTC Clock and Weather widgets from your desktops, which I mentioned at the beginning. <br>  2. Then go to Menu / Settings / Applications / Application Management / All Applications.  There you need to find the following applications: Weater Provider, Weather Widget, Network Location, Weather, Weather Synchronization Service.  In all these applications, you need to perform data cleansing and cache cleaning where it is possible (using dedicated buttons), after having forcedly stopped these applications. <br>  3. (Optional) For the reason that after clearing the data, the newly added widget will request the coordinates of the current location from the provider, and not all providers honestly report these coordinates, you need to enable GPS in the Menu / Settings / Coordinates and view the location in applications (after receiving the widget all this data can be safely turned off).  Incidentally, until I included these items, the error did not want to disappear. <br>  4. Reboot the device. <br>  5. Add the clock and weather widgets.  When adding the Clock widget, you‚Äôll be asked to select a location.  Select the item "Current Location". <br>  Voila  Errors are gone.  We can easily enter the application and manually update the weather. <br><br>  As you can see, the method I described is quite simple and eliminates the need to do hard-rezet.  Just a few movements from the error can get rid of for quite a long time.  By the way, after the last correction of the error, it has not been around for almost two months.  Maybe I cured her completely !? <br><br>  I hope this article will help someone to get rid of this unpleasant error that is often found among owners of smartphones from HTC (I have encountered mentions of an error on htc wildfire, htc hero, htc desire devices). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122884/</a></p>
