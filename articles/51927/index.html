A lot has already been written on the topic of what <em>needs</em> to <em>be</em> done to find a job: from the subtleties of resume writing to sign language in interviews.  but, if you, having studied all these techniques, nevertheless, are still far from the intended goal, consult the list below - it will help you to understand what you do <em>n‚Äôt need</em> to <em>do</em> . <br><br><br>  <a href="http://www.jobseekerweekly.com/newsletter.php%3Fnews%3D995"><strong>7 deadly sins when looking for a job</strong></a> <br><br><br>  in a stressful job search situation it is very easy to make a mistake.  however, a small briefing will help avoid most of the annoying blunders associated with finding a job.

      1. <strong>Do not prepare the people who agreed to give you a recommendation</strong> on how and what they should say in order to do this in the most favorable way for you.  Give them examples of your accomplishments and your greatest strengths so that they are well prepared. <br><br>  2. <strong>when changing the industry, do not adapt your resume</strong> so that it emphasizes and communicates to the potential employer how your experience and qualifications may be beneficial for this new industry and organization.  such a ‚Äútransitional‚Äù resume should also contain a goal that meets the required qualifications. <br><br>  3. <strong>spend too much time and energy in the formal labor market</strong> , responding to advertising publications about vacancies, while not devoting enough time to the informal labor market (friends who know about open, not yet published vacancies, people who can introduce you to their familiar manager hiring staff, social events, professional conferences). <br><br>  4. It is <strong>too early to start discussing salary during an interview</strong> .  If you are asked about the desired remuneration, you should answer "it really depends on the amount of work and responsibilities performed within the framework of the position under discussion. Perhaps we could discuss this later when I have more information." <br><br>  5. <strong>not focus specifically on the desired company</strong> .  Identify the companies and organizations where you would like to work, explore their websites and contact them directly about your interest. <br><br>  6. <strong>fall into the trap of the question "tell about yourself"</strong> .  if the first thing you are asked at the interview is ‚Äútell me about yourself‚Äù, you do not need to do this literally.  in fact, they ask you "why are you here and what do you want."  that's what you need to answer. <br><br>  7. <strong>Talk too much during the interview</strong> .  if you find what you say, say and say, take a deep breath.  the more you speak, the less you want to listen.  in each of your answers you need to make a beginning, middle and end, and then you need to shut up. <br><br>  <strong>disclaimer:</strong> <br><br>  I read from time to time what <a href="http://www.jobseekerweekly.com/">JobSeeker Weekly</a> sends me weekly;  sometimes come across quite practical, in my opinion, advice.  after all, I have already searched and found a lot of work, and who knows how much more will have to be done.  it would probably be too much to write my own advice, but to choose, translate into Russian and add salt and pepper to taste - that's enough for me.  in any case, having tried, we will not lose anything: you can always walk through the <a href="http://wojzeh.livejournal.com/tag/jobseeker">zhzhurnal</a> and see everything that goes under it under the heading JobSeeker. <br><br>  I do not know how the publication itself will relate to such an initiative, but just in case I will always provide a link to the original article. <br><br>  Your comments on the translation and additions to JobSeeker tips regarding their relevance to the specifics of this or that labor market are welcome and mutually enriching. <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51927/</a></p>
