  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello, Rails</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I watched on TV a popular science program about how ‚Äúclimate changed the course of history‚Äù.  And in connection with this, I want to add that if climate changes were not the only cause of certain historical events, then, of course, their influence cannot be ruled out. <br><br>  Actually, the weather can be a catalyst for changes in society, when, for example, employees of public utilities clean up three times more snow per month than during the whole winter in previous years.  This is a concrete example of such changes in the work of public utilities. <br><br>  Then, probably, the involvement of any tool software, the fruit of human thought, is no less remarkable in our life.  Further, this will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And not about the role of instrumental software in general, but about a particular Ruby on Rails framework.  Moreover, in order not to talk about it as a kind of ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, I will start by creating a simple web blog project, which is a beginner‚Äôs guide, which consists entirely of the first chapter of a complete Rails guide.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/cg/le/mtcgle7lqmuolnwfhewpxvqgjos.png"><br>  <i>Screenshot 1. My first Rails application</i> <br><br>  Well, about the manual "a couple of words."  First, after reading this guide, you can make a project.  Here the causal link is obvious.  Secondly, after that you can read another book on flexible development on Rails and create an online store, which is written in it (this book is a textbook). <br><br>  The connection between the web blog project and the online store project is not so obvious: understanding that to create your blog you don‚Äôt have to create a Ruby project when there are social networks, I wanted something more ... <br><br>  Etc. <br><br>  A CRM system for working with tickets in the technical support department of an Internet provider, or ICs for a pharmacy network can be created using Rails.  The use of this or that software has its consequences for the IP operator, system engineer, manual and, as a result, for subscribers or customers. <br><br>  For example, the number of operators that perform their duties, as well as the workload of the technical support department of these same workstations, may depend on the functionality of the user's AWP at a particular point in time.  The fact that the IP is cross-platform can determine the qualifications of the system engineers serving it (one thing is to repair Windows computers, and another is a zoo from Windows, macOS and Linux). <br><br>  The ability of a user to work with a computer may differ when working with a morally outdated IC, written in Delhpi 20 years ago, and when the application software was created in the so-called post-computer era. <br><br>  This is not a dogma, but only an example: in some hypothetical case, an AWP on Windows can work better than on Linux;  also, the user can get used to the existing CRM and not be familiar with the smartphone or Internet tablet, or the existing IC, despite the service life, is done quite well. <br><br>  You can also come up with something more radical: a radical change in the logic of the work of the information system during the transition to Rails and the training of employees with subsequent testing, according to the results of which someone will be dismissed. <br><br>  In conclusion, you can dream up about the implications of switching to Rails development for a programmer.  First, it‚Äôs necessary, after all, to repeatedly refer to the full Rails guide, which is more than 800 pages in length. <br><br>  Secondly, they are not limited.  There are more books on Rails and other resources.  And about the qualities of Rails programmers.  This is the third item.  If for some reason you want to work as a Rails programmer, you will have to have an interview and fill out a questionnaire on it, which will definitely have questions about something like that. <br><br>  During the passage of the step-by-step tutorial for beginners, I saw at least 5 mistakes, so such quality as some sense of purpose will not hurt ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6i/dz/gy/6idzgym_ayfeqr9_addxh_knc60.png"><br>  <i>Screenshot 2. One of the errors that I saw, step by step, passing through the manual</i> <br><br>  And fourth, again in connection with the work.  Especially you shouldn‚Äôt hope for help from colleagues and working documentation, because Rails ‚Äúallows you to write less code‚Äù and even the best understanding of this self-written code will not be enough without the knowledge of Rails. <br><br>  Of course, over time, Rails projects will become obsolete and will be replaced with something better.  How long their service life will be depends on how well they are made, as well as, possibly, on other factors not related to software quality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352148/</a></p>
