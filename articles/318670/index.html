One of the employees found an interesting question on the Internet asked by users of the forum for salespeople.  And he, more precisely, her, was born indignation post.  It seems to us that emotions are obviously not in vain, since the girl has been going together for the eighth year (head on code?) With various kinds of corporate software and knows what she is talking about.  In general, we give her a pre-New Year microphone. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/318670/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e98/496/56f/e9849656ffd91194b7730fecf7ee8e7a.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hi, Habr!  Thank you, RegionSoft, for letting me see it at least once before the blog.  I will try briefly and in the case.

      I will analyze this statement in parts. <br><br><h3>  Thesis 1. "This is good for the leader." </h3><br>  Any automation is good not so much for the manager, but for the business as a whole.  Because a well-organized project for the implementation of CRM, ERP, PM, or just electronic document management is a foundation for the growth of team productivity.  The case of the manager (and line managers) is as follows: adjust business processes before implementation and motivate employees to use software installed in the company.  This is a serious preparatory stage in which you need to disassemble the entire management system of the company, select problem areas, get rid of unnecessary processes (For example, in the early 2010s, when examining a single cellular operator, it was revealed that the logistics department handles the repacking of SIM cards manually. the process was automated on the supplier‚Äôs side, having signed an agreement with him. A huge amount of time was freed up, work functions were distributed, sales increased). <br><br>  After the CRM system is implemented, the manager should remember that he is not a celestial being, but a team member, which means that he must not only collect reports, but also actively participate in automated work: include himself in the chains of business processes, manage tasks , set reminders and even update the knowledge base.  In this case, employees will be able to evaluate the expertise of the chief, to feel that CRM is not for ticks and not for control, but for well-coordinated teamwork. <br><br>  Again, CRM is not a control tool, not a leader‚Äôs fetish, and not a place to drain the corporate budget.  It is a tool like MS Office, Internet browser or phone.  And it should be used by the whole team with the greatest effect - then such software pays off in a very short time. <br><br><h3>  Thesis 2. ‚ÄúHow do they work in CRM?‚Äù </h3><br>  Take the example of the <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> team.  All of us, from the secretary and sales managers to programmers and CEO, are simple users of RegionSoft CRM.  None of us have a magic button ‚ÄúMake it hurt‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemonstrate how I work cool‚Äù.  Everyone starts their day with the launch of the system (some do not turn it off in principle and climb into it even from a mobile phone through a remote desktop), because: <br><br><ul><li>  in CRM, we plan our working (sometimes personal) business, we get reminders from it about them, as well as about meetings, calls and other events; <br><br></li><li>  in CRM, we call via SIPphone and Skype to see the subscriber‚Äôs profile and keep a record of the call (in order to remember what we were talking about there for two hours with the client - a great alternative to frantically writing the entire conversation on paper); <br><br></li><li>  we have meetings in it; <br><br></li><li>  in CRM, we see all of our KPIs, resolve what we did not have time, and receive well-deserved awards; <br><br></li><li>  we also have a mail in CRM - it is very convenient to see the correspondence for each client; <br><br></li><li>  our alpha and omega in the customer cards: all neatly collected contacts, details and documents; <br><br></li><li>  Finally, we work and thereby become the best beta testers of our native RegionSoft CRM. <br></li></ul><br>  This is a very general to-do list, because each employee has a lot of his own tasks that the system solves: these are the needs of salespeople for documentation, integration with 1C, and technical support for recording incidents, and so on.  CRM-systems are good because they are universal, you do not need to produce several types of software on your PC, all the important information at hand. <br><br>  It works comfortably and quickly - this is important.  Personally, I changed several CRMs, among which was the legendary Siebel, the epic SAP, the corporate portal Bitrix24.  This is very, VERY, different solutions, but the scheme is always the same: to get used to the interface ‚Äî‚Äî&gt; understand the settings ‚Äî‚Äî&gt; learn the rules for data unification ‚Äî‚Äî&gt; work quietly.  Of course, systems differ in a set of possibilities, but this depends on the profile of the company and the tasks of a particular manager. <br><br>  The thingies, material, flat, dashboards do not solve anything at all, only the functionality, only the reliability of data storage.  And yes, I almost forgot, the speed of work is very important - if CRM thinks for a long time, this is a tool with bad architecture.  The interface should be not so beautiful as responsive and efficient. <br><br><h3>  Thesis 3. "We need specifics, real examples, not common words." </h3><br>  Real examples are real stories of implementation, with timelines, observations, reviews.  Any vendor has hundreds of them, there are successful ones, there are protracted ones.  At the first request, they will tell you about implementations in companies close to yours in the industry.  But believe me, not a single history of implementation will repeat itself in your business - because it is unique, with its own specifics.  You can say whether the users liked the interface or not, they mastered the business process designer or got confused, but scratching everyone with the same comb will not work. <br><br><h3>  Thesis 4. ‚ÄúThe opinion of ordinary citizens, and not developers or advertisers, is interesting.‚Äù </h3><br>  I can not speak for advertisers, in our company there are none.  Developers, salespeople, implementers - this is closer.  Again, I will voice my position: a sober-minded employee of the vendor will never begin to talk about "an intuitive, pleasant interface, an open design, personal settings."  So you can not sell software.  The software can be sold only when it is ‚Äúprohaval‚Äù from the bottom and you can perfectly match the client‚Äôs problems with what your software can solve. <br><br>  The employees of the vendors, as has already been written above, concurrently with ordinary CRM users, have formed an excellent expertise just from the user's point of view.  And they can be trusted.  It's stupid to say that software can solve problems that it actually cannot solve.  For example, <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> does not work with social networks - simply because the demand is inflated by some market players, and in fact there is practically no demand.  Of course, if a start-up calls us and asks if he will be able to receive orders for the delivery of his innovative nano-smoothie directly from VKontakte, we will answer ‚Äúno‚Äù and offer refinement.  Saying "yes" and hoping that the client will change his mind about using this feature is very strange, although this approach is sometimes found among business consultants. <br><br>  We, the staff, as well as the vendor as a whole, are interested in our software working and helping the client solve problems for which automation was started.  If this does not happen - this is including our flaw. <br><br>  In general, write, call, contact the vendor, watch its presentations and ask tricky questions - then it will not be rumors from "ordinary people", but professional information.  Without it, successfully with the new software does not start. <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, I congratulate my colleagues and all my favorite and read Habr for many years with me for the New Year!  Correct questions, competent answers, and cool results to all. <br><br>  Ufff, I‚Äôll go over with a link to this answer to the forum - let the questioner rejoice. <br><br><hr><br>  And if you need a <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">CRM system</a> , then we still have a <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Ddiscount/discount_ny">discount</a> - however, already only 5%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318670/</a></p>
