Personally, I prefer to give.  And the choice of an original and interesting gift often turns into a difficult test. <br><br>  Many, including myself, consider the box of chocolates and flowers to be too banal a gift, indicating a reluctance or inability to come up with something extraordinary.  An aquarium with fish, skates, a hookah is somewhat more interesting, but in this case you can ‚Äúnot guess‚Äù with a gift.  And guess always oh how you want. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once the idea was born to present an original gift in the form of a site. <br>  To do this, it is enough to register a domain, for example, oksana-i-love-you.ru, place a few photos on it and add the ability to leave greetings from best friends and (or) personally from you. 
      <br>

      <br>
      And only after a while the thought came to my mind that there are people who also want to donate a site, but cannot for a number of reasons. <br>  The search results on the Internet confirmed this theory: the most decent site contained only the color inscription "Kate, I love you" on a white background. <br><br>  To create such gifts could create a web-studio.  But in this area there are already enough competitors who indicate this possibility in their list of services.  True, the demand for them tends to zero due to the high cost.  To fight cybersquatters, you would have to buy hundreds of beautiful domains in advance and then rent them out, which means to become the same.  Such a prospect was not very attractive. <br><br>  In the end, the addressing situation was resolved as follows: <br>  1) the user name may be a third-level domain, which means that it is not necessary to make a separate registration for each name; <br>  2) recently the registration of Russian-language domains has been allowed; <br>  3) the creation of gifts is carried out with a specially created resource <a href="http://www.givesite.ru/">www.givesite.ru</a> automatically. <br><br>  As a result, the gift site may have a name, for example, Oksana.I-love-you.com or Ksyusha.I-love-you.com.  To do this, you need to register only one domain.  By the way, from the point of view of the Russian language, the separation of the address with the help of the punctuation mark ‚Äúmore correctly‚Äù. <br><br>  As you know, Russian-language domains are converted into an unreadable form xn--80aa2anct.xn-----blcbt7ab1dyfcfk.com. <br>  Here there are big inconveniences for users of old versions of browsers, in particular IE 6.0.  To make it work, you need to install a third-party application.  Most likely, IE 6.0 will not be supported, because if the user does not have the rights (hands, luck) to update his browser, then installing additional software will also be problematic. <br>  For security reasons, the display of Russian characters in the address bar is disabled in Mozilla Firefox (of <a href="http://givesite.ru/help/helprusname">course there is a solution</a> ) <br><br>  Another problem with third-level domain names.  If you donate a website to one girl (boy, friend, colleague), then another girl (boy, friend, colleague) with the same name will not get a gift. <br>  There may be several solutions to the problem: enter an auction for a domain and shorten its use to several days, or enter identifiers for the name.  Most likely there are more options, but we stopped at the second.  It looks like this: <br>  1. Misha. Hero-Russia. Com / 122 <br>  2. Misha. Hero-Russia. Com / 211 <br><br>  The site address in this case loses its attractiveness.  But if you remember the ID in the session and make a redirect to a page without an ID, access to the site will be obtained. <br><br>  At first glance, such frauds will make the use of the resource extremely inconvenient, because if you enter the site address without an ID, the user will most likely see an error message. <br><br>  <b>BUT,</b> <br>  First, blogs and similar Internet resources that display html links have not been canceled yet. <br>  And secondly, an application is already being created for the contact, with the help of which it will be possible to create websites as a gift and leave links on the user's wall. <br>  Hiding the ID to avoid confusion is available only to registered users who already have some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resource. <br><br>  It will of course be inconvenient to send links via ICQ and other messengers, but if there is a demand for such gifts, then why not start creating VIP sites without an ID at all? <br><br>  Most likely <a href="http://www.givesite.ru/">www.givesite.ru</a> will fall under the pressure of Habroeffekt, so I will show how it works. <br><br>  1. Homepage <br> <a href="http://givesite.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c7/b9/c7b96ec6e97f5f39249989bcb3abe633.jpg"></a> <br><br>  2. Choosing a domain <br> <a href="http://givesite.ru/create_site"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a3/e6/a3e67634b5764e0510a39b5179a7f380.jpg"></a> <br><br>  3. Ready website gift <br> <a href="http://xn--80aaacc1gd7ae.xn----btblb5bxac8f.com/1024429"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3c/59/3c59769548e9a526bd443cd801b5c62d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  At the moment, there are a few topics to choose from.  The imposed restriction on disk space does not allow storing user photos, so only an avatar can be downloaded for the time being.  Pictures can be selected from the existing list. <br><br>  As a result, we have made a resource that allows you to create original greetings in the form of a gift site for free. <br>  There is still a lot of work to be done, and we will try to make the resource better and better. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot <a href="http://xn--80aaacc1gd7ae.xn----btblb5bxac8f.com/1024429">http: //habrahabr.etotete.com/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94214/</a></p>
