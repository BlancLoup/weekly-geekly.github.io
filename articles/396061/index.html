  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A self-written game has been released for the Nintendo PlayStation that has not yet appeared on the market.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/098/1e8/601/0981e8601e4c387dedd2a8a963f774f9.jpg"><br><br>  In the mid-90s of the last century, a new console could appear on the gaming console market, the fruit of the joint work of Sony and Nintendo.  This device is called Nintendo PlayStation (or SNES-CD).  Unfortunately, only its prototypes were made, the device did not appear on the market for various reasons.  Nintendo could not agree with Sony and Philips on working together on a CD-ROM drive for the new console.  The drive company wanted to create for competition with the Sega Mega-CD.  The companies began to cooperate, but subsequently the negotiations failed.  Almost immediately after that, Sony began developing the PlayStation. <br><br>  Since then, about 20 years have passed, and only now there were craftsmen who were able to emulate the console.  The prototype SNES-CD was taken as the hardware basis.  A few months ago, an unpretentious demo was released for the emulator, which proves the efficiency of the software environment.  Now craftsmen have released a full-fledged game, which was called <a href="http://superbossgaiden.superfamicom.org/"><em>Super Boss Gaiden</em></a> .  If you wish, you can try to play it.  You just need to feel the moment - because you are playing a new game for the console, which was not there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When you try to download an emulator, antivirus warnings may appear about the danger.  The authors argue that <a href="http://ngemu.com/threads/no-sns-released-martin-is-back.147215/page-5">all is well</a> , but just in case it is worth checking everything extra.

      Since the software for the Super Disc format did not work out, the craftsmen themselves had to look for a way to run the disk image, forcing the entire system to work.  Last week, this problem <a href="http://superbossgaiden.superfamicom.org/">was solved</a> . <br><br>  The gameplay is a bit strange.  In the game, a nameless Sony executive finds out that the console prototype technology was somehow stolen and made public.  These technologies were used to create an emulator.  And the responsible manager goes to the streets to fight those who have leaked the technology.  On the way of a talented manager who turned out to be a fist fight master, there are various heroes of other games, including Sackboy from LittleBigPlanet, Parappa the Rapper and others. <br><br>  The game developer introduced both the ROM for SNES and the Super Disc option.  Both versions of the game look the same, the gameplay is similar.  This is not surprising, since Nintendo PlayStation is not too far from the original SNES in terms of performance. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/99-v8lkoOdo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvOqKSLloKwmW9g4WaDRT5ynpYFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Writing an emulator became possible only due to the fact that last year one of the few prototype consoles was discovered.  Initially, the images were posted on the network by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3bwyj0/it_took_forever_but_i_finally_got_some_pics_of_my/">user Reddit</a> .  For obvious reasons, few people believed him.  But a little later, the user was still able to prove the reality of the device.  The most important thing is that it worked, and it still works. <br><br><h3>  What is the Nintendo PlayStation? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b64/b57/b9e/b64b57b9e7530001263c102314e70cfd.jpg"><br><br>  At one time, 200 prototypes of the ‚ÄúNintendo PlayStation‚Äù were released, probably a small part is in the hands of collectors, the rest are completely gone.  One of the prototypes of this console fell into the hands of the famous video blogger Ben Heck. <br><br>  He screwed the device apart, showing its structure and main elements.  As you would expect, the console is a hybrid - there are many elements from both Nintendo and Sony. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ug-CyGXMabg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrNgQ5N5pyfq9fePbqV1q09Nww3Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  An interesting point is also the fact that a 2x CD drive is installed here.  The overall performance of the system is not much more than that of the Super Nintendo gaming console, equipped with only a slot for cartridges.  Unfortunately, the drive in the disassembled console did not work.  But Ben claims that he can fix it - enough technical information was obtained during disassembly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396061/</a></p>
