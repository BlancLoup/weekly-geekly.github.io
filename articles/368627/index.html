Since then, I have been watching how inexpensive Chinese solutions like my designer are gaining in popularity.  And I think this is right, with proper skill and little skill, such designers can give odds to eminent brands, which are several times more expensive and sometimes even orders of magnitude. <br><br>  In this publication, I would like to introduce Geektimes readers with such designers and show that there is nothing to fear.  And in a disassembled form, getting a printer is even more pleasant, since during its assembly you can spend time very interesting + get an initial idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow and what works.

The price began to fall about a couple of years ago, or rather, it has been decreasing for a long time, but a couple of years ago, options for prices began to appear more and more interesting.  And last year (in 2015), the prices reached their perigee.  The Chinese kits entered the market en masse, and not only from construction studs and not understand anything, but quite with tolerable components. <br><br>  I came across this set from Sunhokey right there on the giktimes in the comments to the post about the 3D-printer.  From that moment I began to follow the price.  Then one day the price dropped immediately to $ 15, the rate at that time was not the same as now, and I decided to order it quickly.  The price at that time was 275 bucks. <br><br>  Well, as usual with me.  I learned the question, the printer is OK, but the delivery is not clear.  In the comments to the order they wrote that someone had arrived almost in a couple of weeks.  Positive feedback at the time of the order was slightly less than 300. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/022/0f6/620/0220f6620d3759cf6a29d2d93df536f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As it turned out later, the order went on delivery in a sly way.  This is partly a plus, since I didn‚Äôt intersect with customs at all, or rather not me, but the package.  The downside is the delivery time.  Apparently, the package went by truck from Shenzhen to the border with Russia, where she somehow crossed the border, perhaps even on load mules (judging by the appearance of the package) and reaching Omsk, was sent already through the PEC from a private person with a Russian surname , again by truck.  Wow ... For almost a month I was waiting for the track update when the Chinese track changes to the Russian one.  And now, 24 days after payment, I receive an SMS from the PEC, that the goods left me and will arrive in another 20 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/917/2a9/d9c/9172a9d9c4d0a5d131854e407a739994.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After all the time and almost 2 months of waiting, we went to pick up the package on our family beetle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72c/462/849/72c4628497f36946e29ea95f9656a427.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I noted above, the package seemed to have been kicked from China itself.  For which I was very worried, because inside the acrylic frame and various shafts, which, if bent, do not see quality printing.  By that time I had already read that some customers received parcels with broken acrylic parts.  To the credit of the seller, such shoals were quickly settled and spare parts were sent free of charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fe/985/8f0/3fe9858f0de7d1ad31459d60f169397b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my package was "all the way", well, almost.  Affected 2 plastic coil.  One cracked the rim in two places, the other has the base split in half.  It seems that such shoals could also be replaced, but I did not press on the seller, but simply glued one coil with cyanocrylate and strengthened the other with adhesive tape, passing several tapes through the central hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9bf/a40/ead/9bfa40eade161c431dcc40fa85af0ae6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here in this photo you can see that the plastic lay without any protection at all, which is why it suffered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/fb4/7f3/336fb47f31a4bd76ced1d57882a9b683.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, everything was cool with the packaging.  The first batches were sent in foam plastic.  I can imagine what a nightmare it was when you take such a sandwich out of the box.  I had experience with similar packages (glass Chinese table). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06d/160/05a/06d16005acb350017cd515708b2facb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Concerns about acrylic are not confirmed.  Polypropylene foam worked at 100%. <br>  All acrylic is also in the protective film was.  On the one hand, transparent, on the other pink, I suspect this is a chip specifically for laser cutting.  By the way, since the acrylic is cut by a laser, there is some tension on the edge.  That is the strength of Luke.  Therefore, in no case do not try to wipe the frame with alcohol or something similar, otherwise it will be covered with micro cracks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f1/72e/0af/3f172e0af9f4de0bb0f69299a542c0d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here are all the details.  What where, at first glance, figs understand.  Anarchy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/941/50c/698/94150c698999e2bc706e20da03b78163.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is the main largest part of the frame plus a heated table.  But, by the way, a heated table is a big plus, you can already print ABS and other materials with high shrinkage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f1/dda/eb1/9f1ddaeb185a90ec6b8bc839ab60fe29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The basis of the table.  It is also acrylic.  For six months of the flight, everything is fine with her, not broken.  But still, I would not really trust her.  If possible, it is generally better to replace the entire frame with a steel one (the price of the solution is approximately 4000 rubles + time for disassembly / assembly). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/d03/136/305d031364b8ef3e46f059c6ab6d310e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, everything.  Enough to consider this disgrace, it's time for this chaos to get a finished look and show the miracle of the car to the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/67f/c13/2cc67fc13eb5c38a8bf4c272b275c16e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To collect everything is easy.  Just repeat after the silent Chinese video of all the actions.  Instructions for assembling + the necessary programs and pictures with the settings were attached to the disk by caring Chinese friends.  Yes, sometimes sellers with aliexpress also provide good service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da8/cfd/295/da8cfd29522430291eb50128d4368a2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Components here are not bad.  Here is a part of the carriage moving along the Z axis. Here are the normal NEMA17 stepper motors, and not the trimmed versions and the LM8LUU long bearing by 8mm and even the brass nut of the trapezoidal screw is also 8 mm.  In general, with a price in rubles of about 17,000, it is surprising what the seller earned.  And by the time the dollar went up, the Chinese also dropped the price and in rubles the printer still costs about 17 sput. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b1/c8f/7ba/5b1c8f7ba1625cfcd491f783dd7c298c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second part of the carriage.  Here you can see that there is a belt tensioner, and this solution is not used everywhere.  Even the cheap, inexpensive Wanhao Duplicator i3 uses springs from clothes pegs as tensioners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/445/604/78d/44560478d4142fa47d8bb9b54f63b73e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this is the most interesting part of the printer heating element with a carriage of the X axis. The clone from E3D v5 is installed here.  I can‚Äôt say anything bad about Chinese E3D clones.  How many have tried them, always everything is OK.  That's just v5, I do not like something and almost immediately I replaced it with a more compact V6, which I advise you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9f/1ac/c79/e9f1acc7931a4c9b500fe76d21fa4389.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It seemed to be a very simple thing, but what can be done with its help ... There is nothing complicated about it.  There is a 40W ceramic heater, a thermistor for temperature control, an aluminum cube for heat transfer to the nozzle and a steel thermal barrier enclosed in the aluminum radiator so that heating does not go above the nozzle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a74/4db/116/a744db11654329bb32b3432f6aed981b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, I repeat once again, you change this v5 to v6, you can all-metal, and you will not know the problems.  The main airflow is better and another secret.  I'll tell you about it later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c90/5ad/f4b/c905adf4bd77909ddff08cdae1a16f3f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These are the motors of the Z axis. Here they are immediately a couple and each on a separate driver.  I would honestly do it on one driver, and let out the one who was free would go to the second nozzle.  Already dealing with this issue, waiting for the missing parts ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/459/3c8/c19/4593c8c1953b09074a15915ed3db3bdb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Putting the base of the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfd/dca/5d5/bfddca5d55fa1559d24c120551381238.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another detail with a belt tensioner.  Now for the axis on which the table goes, Y means it turns out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/503/494/b42/503494b422fa2f4f2018572ee2362cd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An elegant solution, I believe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4a/abd/482/b4aabd4827d1e3f3c5ff6a35527ecefc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Putting up the coil stand.  On the one hand, this support is compact and convenient, on the other hand it is not very.  Remember, I wrote that the side of one coil broke off?  So if it were not possible to glue it, then such a holder would not be used.  In the photo is a sample of PLA plastic from FL-33.  Good plastic, but I won it not immediately.  In the beginning, he completely hammered the nozzle.  What about next time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f33/247/c3a/f33247c3a65ae32c3e0e43f1eea439d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here you can see that the bearings are used with a side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/264/f82/fc3/264f82fc3cf5321f855bc07b7197d53b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Go to the larger details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/849/38a/145/84938a145515f9925adabfda78862f2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The proud name is Prusa i3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71b/d26/b10/71bd26b10626e786bedd979348483445.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Studs are still used here, but not simple galvanized, but normal stainless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d40/aed/bbe/d40aedbbe2ddf37c945d6d525c3eaa13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Gradually vundervaflya acquires a finished look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/480/3d5/928/4803d5928fbc87965b48a1f9f3564098.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The X axis is already in place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/446/e30/0f2/446e300f2547e582192bca1fa342b29b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Table.  And here I was prepared immediately.  Wires at the table is better to replace the thicker.  And for this you need to separate the thermal insulator holding on the Kapton adhesive tape and solder them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fd/0d1/070/8fd0d1070e4bd94289baecdfac5b3cd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  No sooner said than done.  At the same time and we will enclose a heat insulator better.  I used a stopper from a bath mat, bought in a carousel of rubles for 60 or 80. If you did a recent repair, you will find a better insulating material.  Ideal thermal insulator for underfloor heating, it may already be with adhesive base, so it will be more convenient to mount this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/634/790/e92/634790e92661b13584026d35a3517cfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61f/c69/744/61fc697446038b2f2a8e9dfce14557e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two.  Is done.  Aluminum tape also came in handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16b/9f3/3d5/16b9f33d5d28c0924942ccbdfb0deb01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Half done.  Yes, yes, only half.  At this point, the assembly took about 6 hours, probably, maybe a little more.  There was a break to sleep :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd7/ab5/cc5/bd7ab5cc5f77b8d5e6e3ce6ddd9697a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We turn to the electronic electrical part.  The MKS GEN v1.1 board is installed here. In principle, this is the same arduin with RAMPS, only higher quality.  Plus, the fact that everything is properly diluted and there are connectors on the driver.  The drivers here are removable, and not soldered like on MELZI another board often used in inexpensive 3D printers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40d/828/af4/40d828af484f0eddb00f011e03f07d54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is an extruder of the type Bouden with all its disadvantages and advantages.  What does it mean?  This means that the head is light and will not give inertial waves when the direction of movement changes abruptly, but it is better not to fill the soft materials here.  FLEX just will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33f/242/f60/33f242f6014822066b86e71d9cd333f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, this model has a remote screen with a card reader, so you can print without a computer.  In the first week I did not know that the twist was also a button, and the printing started via a comp.  Then he pressed harder, and new possibilities opened up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7e/b29/526/e7eb29526a6ba73b266a19d9af9a81c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It remains to lay the wires neatly and you can proceed to print.  Damn is not enough patience, we collect them in bundles, then I will lay as it should. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d67/997/bdb/d67997bdbdca8eec01b27989da027286.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Beauty.  And, you need to stick the masking tape on the platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e99/74f/cf7/e9974fcf71d9f942aa484420e857fc59.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yeah, this is now quite good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e49/810/932/e4981093260f00eeeb760f72c71639a8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Well, at the request of comments recent print examples:</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Letter size 18cm (layer 0.2mm, nozzle 0.4mm):</b> <b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/b2e/ee6/4c4b2eee674f42d5b27616699dc94d80.jpg"><br><br></b>  <b>Bracelet on hand, immediately after removing the supports but still without treatment (layer 0.1 mm, nozzle 0.2 mm):</b> <b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/488/ff5/525/488ff55250d84eaf8180bd861affa6d9.jpg"><br><br></b>  <b>Statuette for the sample nozzle 0.2 height about 10cm.</b> <b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/498/db3/3b5498db37b44ad39151614d0b46c09b.jpg"><br><br></b>  <b>After a little processing, all the "snot" were removed.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>It is in the process of printing.</b> <b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31b/849/12f/31b84912f741454fadfe2a620d9825bb.jpg"><br></b>  <b>Parts used in the assembly:</b> <br><ul><li>  Printer <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/th">Prusa i3 Kit *</a> </li><li>  Nozzles: <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/ti">Nozzles 0.3 / 0.4 / 0.5 mm *</a> </li><li>  Head: <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/tj">E3D v6 head *</a> </li></ul><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
