After all, every time it turned out that customers were unhappy with the newsletter, unsubscribed from it or put in spam - this is a failure of the campaign.  Each mailing list manager wants to guess the movements of the soul of his client so as to create the perfect content: demanded, necessary, which customers do not really open and ‚Äúclick‚Äù through, which customers expect.  That's really what we dream about - and you say "spammers."  In this article, let's look at this problem from a different angle - perhaps happiness is waiting for us somewhere very close, behind a new turn? <br><br>  If we have a problem that cannot be solved, we need to do the following set of exercises of ancient magical Hatha Yoga: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      1. Remove the obstacle. <br>  2. Move forward <br>  3. Reach the Goal <br><br>  Our goal: to create content, from which the client will piss with boiling water, instead of using * bricks.  Let's see what we can do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  TROUBLESHOOTING </h4><br>  Let us turn to Eastern wisdom and paraphrase it.  We will have a mantra: "To make a letter work, you need to give up on yourself."  Now we will explain this difficult, but such an easy statement.  In fact, one of the most common mistakes of mailing list managers is to write a letter for their own reasons.  I need to write a letter, I have to send it to as many people as possible, I need leads and sales ... I, me, mine - as the Beatles sang, and little has changed since then. <br><br>  In fact, you are not writing a letter for yourself, so in order to make your letter work, you need to make it a useful client.  Your problem at the moment is: irrelevant content.  Translated into Russian, this means content that the customer does not need to fuck up. <br><br>  What to do?  You need to know that the client is interested / needed.  We must not forget that the specificity of marketing mailings is such that you most closely, closely communicate with the client, almost "come to his house."  Therefore, often, when you come to a noisy, demanding crowd, you are simply ‚Äúexpelled‚Äù, and they do it quite naturally. <br><br>  How to avoid this error, the whole works are devoted.  The problem of the sphere of interests and customer needs is as old as marketing itself. <br><br>  Of course, you can argue that if you sell any frank h-nude, then the client doesn‚Äôt need it anyway, which means whether or not you undertake what we will tell further about - there will be no result.  However, there is an axiom: you can sell anything.  If, as a result of the research, you came to the conclusion that your base is not your base at all, perhaps you will go to extreme measures and start collecting a new base, abandoning the old one.  Or maybe buy a pink elephant.  Whatever you do, your decision should lead you to the goal, no matter how extravagant it is.  Therefore, before reading further, go back a little to the beginning of the article and once again state the goal: why move and do something at all? <br><br><h4>  FORWARD MOVEMENT </h4><br>  Remember, we said that you come to the client practically home.  You are in a good position, because in this case you have in your hands a lot of tools for analyzing the situation.  Indeed, if you come to a man‚Äôs house, you will be able to recognize him at once better than a year meeting somewhere in a cafe. <br><br>  So the first tool you can use is money.  But it is far from being the only one and, often, not at all efficient, especially if there is little money, especially if we spend it on numerous pseudo-specialists of the RuNet.  Therefore, if you want to spend money, it is better to distribute them as cash prizes to customers, arranging a competition within one of the research tools listed below. <br><br>  As a rule, on the way of ascertaining the preferences of clients, the following simple techniques are used, with reference to clients of the newsletter: <br><br>  1. A client is asked to undergo various stress-free polls, in exchange for bonuses / downloads / other attractive things.  (Remember, you just wanted to spend money by ordering a study from an agency? Hammer in, better spend it here.) <br><br>  2. Base segmentation in order to more closely tailor the content of letters to the needs of specific groups of clients. <br><br>  3. Split testing * in order to identify mailing elements that cause the greatest response from the base. <br><br>  4. CRM-service, fixing complaints, requests and wishes of clients, their degree of satisfaction, which then must be heard to you (otherwise why collect them?) <br><br>  5. Collecting information about the client, allowing him to predict his future needs and acquisitions, which he plans, in order to influence them (the so-called propensity modeling).  - This method is no longer directly related to mailings, we just mentioned it as a possible direction in which you can search for something to implement the actions outlined above. <br><br><h4>  ACHIEVING THE GOAL </h4><br>  What are the parameters you can determine that the actions taken by you led to the achievement of the goal?  This is the most important question.  If you do not know how you will respond to it - do not start any project.  Including a project to improve, personalize and increase the relevance of your content.  In this case, we will give you the parameters by which you can determine the effectiveness of the measures taken.  These will be primarily standard indicators for mailings: <br><br>  1. Increasing the number of open letters - a very good indicator can be considered an increase of this indicator by 20% <br>  2. The increase in the number of clicks on the links in the letter - an increase of 30%, this figure cannot but please the eye <br>  3. Reducing the level of unsubscribing and complaining about spam - there will never be a zero anyway, because  a person may just have a bad mood in the morning, and he will unsubscribe from your letter without looking.  However, 0.01% is a good result. <br><br>  You can expect an increase in the number of leads when the results of your research efforts on your clients will be used to improve the content of your site.  So, knowing that your client is interested, you can offer just that in exchange for registration, and thus increase the number of registrants.  However, this will already be somewhat beyond the scope of a purely mailing list.  Although in our opinion, to any activity, and to mailing lists, including - you need to be comprehensive in order to achieve a synergistic effect. <br><br>  <b>*</b> Speaking of split testing.  Now we have a competition for the best split test with cool prizes.
