  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Believe in yourself or the first steps of a freelancer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This topic was probably raised and discussed several times in the Habr√©, but it was always done by experienced freelancers who remembered their beginning in this field in passing, finishing with phrases - ‚ÄúI did it all and you succeed‚Äù.  In this article, the story will be conducted on behalf of just starting his way of earning on the Internet and that most need to learn.  And so in this article I will talk about my first steps towards freelancing. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Do you need it </h4><br>  As a student, I often had problems with money, but as a student of information systems and technologies, I often looked towards freelancing, a free schedule, a favorite thing (yes, programming attracts me like a drug), a good income.  It seems that there is something else you can dream of, but I was always afraid to start, to say that programming was bad at my university, to say nothing, and despite self-education I was afraid not to cope with real tasks, not laboratory ones, I was scared that I wasn‚Äôt I can compete among experienced programmers, each of whom has more in his portfolio of work than I have done in my whole life, let alone the quality of these works.  This went on for a very long time, but here I graduated from the university, sat without money waiting for the issuance of a diploma, not knowing what to do and finally decided, told myself it was time and rushed into battle. <br><br><h4>  This huge world </h4><br>  The first problem I got in my way was the question ‚ÄúWhere to look for a customer?‚Äù.  Two answers came to mind: <br><ul><li>  freelance sites; </li><li>  forums. </li></ul><br>  Having visited the freelancing sections and the work of all programming forums I often visited, I didn‚Äôt find anything, of course there were no orders, but for each there were at least four applicants, I left my offers and went on. <br>  I decided to start acquaintance with freelance sites from the <a href="http://harumambu.ru/">Harumamba</a> project, I learned about it in Habr√©, from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/96074/">this topic</a> .  <a href="http://www.weblancer.net/">Having</a> looked at the appearing orders, I decided that the most popular sites for customers are <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">free-lance</a> and <a href="http://www.weblancer.net/">weblancer</a> I signed up for both.  Unfortunately, having discovered that full-featured accounts are not just expensive, but very expensive for a beginner, I had to be content with free limited versions.  The second unpleasant surprise was that the natives of these sites are really strong competitors, amid their reviews and portfolio, I felt like an ugly duckling who happened to be among the white swans and again I wanted to close the browser, turn off the computer and forget that I can program, but once again I overpowered myself and waited for the appearance of orders.

    <h4>  Who first got up and sneakers </h4><br>  An hour passed and I finally saw the order with which I could handle 110%, it was a small js script, without hesitation I applied for it and answered me about the miracle, within 20 minutes there were six applications from those same root freelancers, but the customer started working with me, whose profile was poor and glittered with the inscription - ‚Äúin the project 1 hour and 20 minutes‚Äù I made the first conclusion, the customer usually responds to the first applicant and, having agreed with him, does not pay attention to the other applications. <br><br><h4>  Self manager </h4><br>  I gave the icq number to the customer and waited, he knocked at once to say hello and became silent, I began to think about what to say and how to conduct the conversation correctly, without inventing anything better, became more or less a business language to find out the details of the order.  As it turned out, and despite the simplicity of the task, I had to spend 20 minutes figuring out the details, at the end of the conversation I made the result of the conversation in the list, writing down the points in my understanding, after which I had to correct it due to customer specifications. <br><br><h4>  I answer for the quality </h4><br>  The task was easily accomplished, but still I read a couple of topics on the forums on some points of implementation and finally made sure that I wanted to do everything as it should, I wrote a script.  I tested the result in four browsers, I decided that I could give it to the customer. <br><br><h4>  You to me, I to you </h4><br>  After the customer learned about the completion of the work, the question arose of the transaction.  Again it turned out two options: <br><ul><li>  - arrange a secure transaction through the site; </li><li>  - exchange the script and money directly. </li></ul><br>  After reading about safe transactions, I realized that this is reliable and there is a guarantee that neither side deceives the other, but did not have time to deal with the process of their execution, but I didn‚Äôt want to forgive the customer because I was afraid to seem incompetent. <br><br>  The option to exchange for direct was chosen, I registered a webmoney wallet (there were also many nuances here, since I wanted to not only leave the money on the Internet, but get it in my hands).  Having agreed with the customer that he would transfer half the amount to me, receive and check the script, and then send the second part of the amount, I sent him my wallet number (how great was my joy when I saw how the money arrived) and sent him a script , I was very worried, I was afraid that everything would not be as he wanted or would not work at all for unknown reasons, that he said two times wrong how to connect the script to the page, but in the end everything turned out well, the customer received the script, translated the second part of the amount satisfied  n and said that to turn again. <br><br><h4>  My boy has become quite an adult </h4><br>  So my first earnings as a freelancer went, I realized that I was more afraid, everything turned out to be relatively easy and simple, the next day I found a more serious order on the forum and wrote a desktop C # application a week, as a result, the customer was also very pleased and said he hoped for further cooperation.  I hope this article will help those who, like me, have long doubted the decision to become freelancer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97362/</a></p>
