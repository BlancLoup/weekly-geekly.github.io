In 1996, starting to learn the newly emerged Delphi, I could not imagine what the fate of this language will be, which greatly influenced Java and C #, as well as what fate Borland itself will have, from the name of which each old school coder has goosebumps over the skin. <br><br>  I tried to make a small slice of historical events, to tell about a little-known Russian programmer from Ulan-Ude.  It is very cool that one person from the outback of Russia can penetrate into history and influence the competition of large companies.  This gives us all reason to think that the efforts and hopes can be justified. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/tf/nx/xetfnxcrmc6fq56-htze-b8rctw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the photo one of the types of the ancient Greek city Delphi, in honor of which the development environment Delphi was named.

      The fate of Borland stood out uneasy.  Luring the main Delphi developer Anders Hejlsberg to Microsoft, followed by a strange renaming of Borland‚Äôs cult to incomprehensible Inprise.  The fall in sales, and as a result a series of resales of the company itself in parts. <br><br>  I will not tell you the details of how Google in 2005 realized the importance of the mobile market, which is yet to emerge in a few years.  But in 2005, Google buys Android for $ 130 million. <br><br>  In 2007, with the release of the iPhone, many realize that a new era has come and Apple will sweep away everything on its way to leading the mobile market.  Even Google did not have time with its Android, the first version of which, together with the SDK, appeared only in 2008. <br><br>  In 2007, the newly created fund Thoma Cressey Bravo buys back 100% of Embarcadero.  The following 2008, Embarcadero buys CodeGear, for which patents on Delphi were transferred, for $ 23 million.  I remember CodeGear since 2006 as a supplier of C ++ compiler for PalmPilot handhelds, which became the first prototype of today's powerful smartphones with large screens. <br><br>  In 2010, apparently going crazy about the analysts predicted opportunities, HP buys Palm for 1 billion at the peak of its value, in the hope that it will be steeper than Apple.  The very next year 2011, HP discontinues the launch of Palm Pre mobile devices, as no one buys them. <br><br>  Later there is a small, but very cool moment in this unequal battle for the mobile market.  I believe that the first buyers of new products are geeks, among whom there are many programmers, and not least they are the ones who determine the coolness and perspective of the devices.  One of the main prospects in the growing mobile market is the possibility of cross-platform application development. <br><br>  In 2011, the Embarcadero mentioned above, which inherited Delphi‚Äôs legacy, buys the rights to VG-Scene, a GUI framework developed by Evgeny Kryukov from Ulan-Ude as a vector-based GUI library of the next generation.  Evgeny Kryukov later received an offer to work in Embarcadero, which has offices in Toronto, Melbourne, Munich, Maidenhead (United Kingdom), Spain and St. Petersburg (Russia). <br><br>  In 2012, this library called FireMonkey (FMX) is included with the VCL into the main packages: Delphi XE3, Delphi XE2, C ++ Builder XE2 and RAD Studio XE2, including RadPHP and Embarcadero Prism.  It is this library that enables Delphi to execute the same code for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS. <br><br>  Quote from Wikipedia: <br><blockquote>  FireMonkey allows you to separate the user interface from business logic and data access mechanisms (see the model-view-controller), which in particular allows you to place non-visual parts of the application in cloud services: Amazon or Azure. </blockquote>  The development of Evgeny Kryukov returned both Delphi and Embarcadero to sustainable competitiveness.  Despite the fact that the popularity of Delphi / Object Pascal falls, in 2019 it takes 14th place in the ranking of TIOBE programming languages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445042/</a></p>
