And today I will tell you how to do it. <br><br>  I present to you <a href="http://www.adwired.net/">AdWired</a> : this is a mobile advertising network with beautiful interactive media banners that work on all major mobile platforms.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is AdWired better than others? </h4><br>  First, you need to figure out what advertising networks are like.  There are two main types - blind (blind networks) and premium (premium networks). <br><br>  <b>Blind networks</b> - this is where the advertiser does not know in which applications his banner will appear, and the owner of the application - does not know which banners will be in his applications.  Examples of such networks are Google AdMob, Begun, Wapstart.  Such networks are well suited for those who want to earn a little, but right away.  As a rule, they pay for the transition, and the low quality of banners leads to a small CTR, and as a result - a small but stable income. <br><br>  <b>Bonus networks</b> - this is where the advertiser chooses the applications in which he wants to show his banners, and the owner of the application receives high-quality, beautiful advertising campaigns, and sometimes can even moderate banners.  Examples - AdWired, inMobi, Millenial Media.  In such networks, advertisers pay for impressions, which allows quality sites to get a much higher income than in the blind networks.  In addition, attractive and interactive banners show a significantly higher CTR and therefore are very popular with advertisers who come to you again and again. <br><br>  AdWired is a premium network.  We work with the best brands and agencies on the one hand, and with high-quality, interesting applications on the other.  Our advertisers include BMW, Land Rover, Sberbank, Dove, IBM, Samsung, and many others.  Among our sites are applications Forbes, Vedomosti, Moskva.fm and many, many more. <br><br><img src="http://www.inapp.ru/img/advertisers.png"><br><br>  We have several formats, the main ones are a full-screen banner when launching an application, and a standard one with a pop-up when pressed inside.  Various actions are available for banners, ranging from a simple transition to a website to a direct call or installing an application from a store. <br><br><img src="http://www.inapp.ru/img/formats.png"><br><br>  Plus, we have prepared some interesting things for application owners: <br><br>  <b>Premoderation campaigns</b> <br>  In your account, you can always choose which advertising campaigns are more interesting for you, and only show them.  The rest of the time, your application will not show any ads.  Or, just take one and all and earn more. <br><br>  <b>Manage your campaigns</b> <br>  You can independently start campaigns on your applications, and independently sell them at your own prices.  And we will not take with you any percentage of this amount, only a small service fee, which is paid for with traffic (shows in your applications), and for enterprise solutions there is no service charge at all. <br><br>  <b>One window for monetization</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.adwired.net/ru/developers/">Our SDKs</a> are available on iOS (iPhone, iPad), Andorid (2+), Windows Phone, Blackberry (6+), Bada and for the mobile web.  Therefore, you can monetize all your mobile traffic in one place. <br><br>  <b>Analytics and statistics</b> <br>  In your account, without even displaying ads, you can collect and view application usage statistics and share it with your customers. <br><br><h4>  How much can you earn? </h4><br>  The average price per 1000 impressions on our network for a full-screen banner is 750r.  If you know the number of active users of your application, this is easy to calculate. <br><br>  Let's be honest, to our (and yours), unfortunately, about 40-70% of traffic is usually sold not in premium networks.  Therefore, we do not promise gold mountains at once and a lot, but if you have a really high-quality application, as our practice shows, there will always be demand for it! <br><br><h4>  Still in doubt? </h4><br>  If you already know the theme of application monetization through advertising and you are already using, for example, AdMob, try the syndication mode ‚Äî you can show AdMob, and when an expensive advertising campaign comes to you, switching to AdWired will occur automatically. <br><br>  And of course, we are always open to cooperation with developers, and listen to your ideas and suggestions. <br><br>  Let's make money together! <br><br><img src="http://www.inapp.ru/img/platforms.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147039/</a></p>
