On the subject of the upcoming operation, Kanavero and a partner wrote a series of articles <a href="http://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(16)30022-8/abstract">published</a> in the reputable medical journal Surgery.

      The Italian regularly communicates with his patient, a programmer from Russia, Valery Spiridonov.  In his last conversation with him, Kanavero expressed the opinion that surgeons from Russia would want to take part in the operation itself: ‚ÄúNow scientists all over the world have everything they need to verify for themselves that the GEMENI HEAVEN head transplant protocol is working.  I am sure that surgeons in Russia will be interested in these materials, as in the way to enter the race with China for the implementation of all stages of the procedure. "  With regard to the preparation for the operation, in one of the publications in Surgery surgeons revealed almost all the details of the project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In particular, experts have shown the possibility of minimizing damage to nerve fibers in the separation of the head from the body, and also proved that the brain can be protected from oxygen starvation and postoperative pain. <br><br>  Kanavero claims that Russian scientists have previously developed much of what will be used in the upcoming operation.  One of the solved problems is the ability to keep the ‚Äúdonor's‚Äù head separate from the ‚Äúrecipient‚Äù body (although the question is where the donor is, and where is the recipient in this case) in the process of preparing the transplant.  It will take doctors at least 30 minutes to transplant the head - and all this time the brain will be deprived of access to oxygen and nutrients.  Without maintaining access of oxygen and nutrients, the brain dies after 7 minutes.  The problem is planned to be solved by connecting the head to the circulatory system of another person while simultaneously cooling to a temperature of 29-33 degrees.  This will help reduce the brain's nutrient needs - metabolism will be slowed down.  If you cool your head to 15 degrees, the brain will be able to live in "autonomous mode" for about an hour. <br><br>  Kanavero also mentions domestic development - the drug Perftoran, developed by scientists of the Institute of Biological Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences as a blood substitute.  Perftoran, along with some other drugs, will be used to supply the brain with oxygen.  Russian experts believe that perftoran can prolong the life of the organs of the body by 4-5 times, compared with the ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù mode. <br><br>  At present, Chinese scientists are conducting test transplants of heads of corpses, trying to restore normal blood circulation.  Studies are also conducted on monkeys and rats.  So, in January of this year, Kanavero <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269656/">performed a</a> monkey head <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269656/">transplantation</a> , while, as the surgeon put it, ‚Äúthere were no neurological injuries.‚Äù  After the pilot operation, the monkey lived only 20 hours.  Canavero says she was left alive for such a short time for ethical reasons.  The mobility of the limbs was not preserved, but it was not set for this goal during the operation.  The main thing - the brain did not receive damage, while remaining fully functional and after transplantation.  ‚ÄúWe conducted a pilot study, realizing our ideas on how to prevent injuries during an operation,‚Äù says Carnavero. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yevlIEmW6hw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhIlwbwB7_rcad6vEcTcq7sNCKZgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Surgeons also train on mice, trying to ensure the connection of parts of the spinal cord of the donor and the acceptor with the help of polyethylene glycol.  It uses a special device that provides "fusion" of the nerves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369013/</a></p>
