For the customer of the site it‚Äôs like ... it‚Äôs like a stage of life 6 through which you just have to go.  In this market, I have to exaggerate a little in order to show the problem. <br><br><img src="http://forum.nanya.ru/uploads/post-17350-1189709994.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's start with Sharashkin office.  In principle, even normal promoted web offices will not be able to promise you ‚Äúall the chiki-yaks‚Äù, because the management may be very correct there, and the managers are caring, but the fact that the developers of this office is not enough is the developers.

      In general, after a beautiful layout is given in the layout with screwing to the engine - to see all 1: 1 as it was in the layout - this is a miracle.  You can arrange a holiday or go to church to thank the higher forces.  Although, if you are ready to behave like ‚Äúhere are 50 pieces of tanks, I need to have all the chiki-poji and super-duper, you have 4 weeks for the whole work, if after 4 weeks something is wrong - I take the money through the service of knocking out the dough and after you the real physical Kick-Ass, ‚Äùthen there is a chance that everything will really be chiki-idi. <br><br>  However, for the most part you find yourself in a very, very nice-looking virtual office (which is without an office) or real (with an office), which says ‚Äúwe will do everything you want, qualitatively and on time, here are our beautiful and high-quality work ‚Äùand naturally you decide to work with them.  After that, it turns out that there is nothing nice in addition to a nice manager in this virtual office.  The developers write to you every day what it is, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, and to do this with nothing, because this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, that, this, this, this, that, this, that, this, that, this, that this, this, and this.  After hitting a manager who is no longer dear, the whole story at once subsides for about a week (naturally, for good reasons, which you will learn about later), after which problems are partially solved in one place, partially made differently, and partially forgotten.  As a result, you need to reapply, after the manager sends the link ‚Äúlook at how cool everything is now‚Äù, you need to re-check everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, and persistently demand a solution to the problems.  And so somewhere for a month at least, if we are talking about the portal.  It is better to have patience for two months. <br><br>  Do you know why it's always like that?  ( <i>oh, in your office, everything is different? Give your address, I will work with you !!!!</i> ) Because managers receive a salary from sales, which sometimes encourages them to promise the customer even what the garlic developer will start hysterical and try to quit once again.  It doesn‚Äôt reach the leadership at all. What manager needs problems?  It is easier for a developer to buy a liter of beer, a bag of chips and sincerely smoke with him in the smoking room of expensive cigarettes.  Scold all customers and in general, talk about the eternal.  This is how the customer's problems are solved, which needs some new solution (not a new one at all, but a new one for the engine, which, by the way, you have just been given because the developer knows only this engine ... or this engine has been created by the office itself and now it can promote ..) <br><br>  Sobsno this all.  -))) I don‚Äôt know how to solve this problem, because for 5 years I have been desperately struggling with it, being an office worker in different offices, being a customer and being a manager in various projects ... and so, I don‚Äôt want to solve it ... I make a portal and this is the same ... I‚Äôll then tell you the name of the office.  And by the way pecked that they have cheaper, yeah ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30375/</a></p>
