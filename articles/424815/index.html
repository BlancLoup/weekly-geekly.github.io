      Vulnerability in the social network code allowed hackers to access at least 50, and perhaps even 90 million, personal information through a flaw in the ‚ÄúSee how‚Äù feature that allows you to view your own account as if you were someone else. .  Taking advantage of this vulnerability, hackers managed to get access tokens that ensure the safety of users and then penetrate their accounts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The company found out about the problem on Tuesday and it took several days to fix the vulnerability.  As a result, the tokens were reset, and now anyone who tries to connect with them will not be able to do this.  And all users who used the function ‚ÄúView as‚Äù over the past year turned out to be this morning (Friday, EST), after the release of the bugfix, they logged out and had to log in again. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe privacy and safety of people is incredibly important, and we regret that this happened,‚Äù such comments can be seen today in the news media, which began to replicate this topic at an incredible pace, which casts a shadow on the company's reputation. <br><br>  But why make this information public? <br><br>  The point is the new European GDPR, it obliges companies to immediately report hacking publicly, if there were any, otherwise it threatens with very large fines. <br><br>  This is not the first hack on Facebook and not the last; many users have seriously thought about who and how they trust their data.  After all, Facebook keeps everything up to your geo-location. <br><br>  Recently, according to the law, they asked everyone to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-gdpr-latest-data-ad-tracking-opt-out-stop-ads-marketing-a8310031.html">confirm agreement with the collection of geodata</a> . <br><br>  The security issue is more relevant than ever.  And therefore, probably not in vain, we post the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/424295/">MIT ‚ÄúComputer System Security‚Äù course transfer</a> , although in 2014, as well as other materials related to security, as the fundamentals never lose their relevance and often mistakes are repeated, including such large companies as Facebook, which rolled out the update containing the vulnerability, along with the changes they made to the video downloader, back in July 2017.  And who knows how difficult the vulnerability was, if until now independent pentesters have not discovered it. <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.  Do you like our articles?
