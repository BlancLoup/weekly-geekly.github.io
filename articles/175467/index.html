  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel plans for the release of new processors in 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear Habravchane.  As recently as three days ago, I was at the conference ‚ÄúMIF - Creating the Future,‚Äù which was attended by representatives of Microsoft, Fujitsu and Intel.  I would like to share with you some interesting in my opinion statements from an Intel representative (Andrei Grachev), as well as information obtained in a conversation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing I would like to point out is that at the beginning of his report, a company representative asked to take into account that <i>‚Äúmaterials are provided on an‚Äú as is ‚Äùbasis, without any express or implied guarantees, including, among other, guarantees regarding their market qualities, non-infringement of intellectual property rights ... ‚Äù</i> , etc. <br><br>  And so what are these materials?  First, the recognition that Intel profukalo two whole trends: mobile and microservers (representatives of fujitsu smiled), but is going to correct this year already.  The new processor Haswell will live in 3 reincarnations: the actual desktop version, versions for mobile phones, versions for ultrabooks.  Now in order.

      <b>There</b> will be no big changes <b>for desktops</b> .  The company will release the processor on the LGA1150 socket and, according to the representative, 2 more years, the processor releases will be under it.  The new processor has seriously increased the graphics module, so Windows 8 office graphics will be able to comfortably do without a discrete video card.  In addition, changes are not planned for the process.  And if the other Haswell branches are planned to be transferred to the 14-nm process technology by 2014, then for desktop models such happiness is not provided, they will continue to exist on the 22-nm technology. <br><br>  In a private conversation, Andrew said that for desktops, the planned performance increase is estimated at + 10% compared to Ivy Bridge.  So if you are still sitting on Core2Duo, then the transition definitely makes sense.  But to leave with Coreix, especially since models of the latest releases, there is no particular reason (of course, IMHO). <br><br>  <b>Go to mobile devices.</b>  The company is seriously going to take up the mobile processor market.  Moreover, he is quite aggressive and wants to, I quote "squeeze" competitors.  In the lower segments, modified Atom will be produced, in the upper - lightweight Haswell-M.  Actually nothing was said on the smartphones. <br><br>  <b>But</b> more <b>about ultrabooks</b> information.  First, it is planned to embed a bunch of sensors in the ultrabook itself (motion, pressure, accelerometer, temperature, gyroscope, etc.) and maintain their work at the hardware level.  Sensors are planned to be made non-switchable.  Estimated usage scenarios are described like this: <br><br>  Here you stand on the balcony smoking and typing.  Suddenly bang!  Beech falls down.  While flying to the ground, the accelerometer realizes that the acceleration of 9.8 m / s2 is not normal and quickly (due to fast loading / falling asleep), for 1.5 s., Goes into deep sleep, retaining the entire session on hard drive.  Voila!  Data saved (if lucky). <br><br>  Another scenario.  You sit on a plane, and <s>suddenly the acceleration of 9.8 m / s2</s> plane takes off.  Beech understands that now it is necessary to turn off and off.  When landing acts similarly. <br><br>  This "cleverness" of the car caused a lot of questions.  Including about false positives and about factory marriage.  To which was answered, <i>‚ÄúOur equipment is thoroughly tested and not by batches, but each copy.</i>  <i>If you find a failure, reject the entire party</i> . <i>"</i>  I am, of course, pleased with this zeal for the calculation of marriage, but wear and simple mistakes in identifying the surrounding reality does not exclude the fact of verification at the factory.  We did not receive a clear answer to this account. <br><br>  For ultrabooks, they plan to use a separate Haswell line, which is characterized by reduced heat generation, and later transfer it to 14-nm technology. <br><br>  Further conversation went <b>about servers.</b> <br><br>  The development of the server chip Intel Xeon E5 2600V2 (fourth quarter of 2013) compared with the release of 2012, the processor has gained over 50% of the cores and acquired the Digital Random Number Generator (DRNG) and Supervisor Mode Execution Protection Bit (SMEP) technologies for additional basic security at the hardware level.  In this case, the processor will retain the old socket and will be compatible with the C600 series of chipsets. <br><br>  According to the company's assurances, the main microserver platform in 2013 will be denlow (release is scheduled for the second quarter).  Among the advantages of this platform were called: <br><ol><li>  Intel¬Æ Xeon¬Æ E3-1200 v3 Processor Family <br><ul><li>  New instructions </li><li>  Processor Graphics with DX11.1 &amp; OCL1.2 </li><li>  Quad Core &amp; Dual Core SKUs </li><li>  Memory speed - 1600MHz 2DPC </li></ul></li><li>  Intel¬Æ C220 series chipset delivers faster I / O connectivity <br><ul><li>  Up to 6 SuperSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB ports * @ 5.0 Gb / s </li><li>  Up to 6 SATA 3 @ 6Gb / s ports </li></ul></li><li>  CPU Efficiency and Power Management <br><ul><li>  Improved power consumption of CPU and PCH at rest </li><li>  DDR3 and DDR3L * support </li><li>  Low Voltage CPU SKU with high frequencies </li></ul></li></ol><br><br>  The platform will be accompanied by the release of Xeon E3-1200 v3 (LGA1150). <br><br>  In addition, a separate mini server platform is being prepared for launch.  At the price of such a server will cost as a normal PC, or a little more expensive.  It will be based on Intel Atom chips (Intel Atom Processor S1200 series (Centerton) coming out this quarter). A special Bordenville Platform platform has been developed for mini-servers. The use scenario assumes as a server for: <br><ul><li>  low-end web hosting </li><li>  Simplest data nodes </li><li>  Ultra low-end web services </li></ul><br>  In conclusion, the new Intel Xeon Phi math coprocessor was introduced, which is attached as a separate bracket to the PCI slot.  The company sees the main purpose of this chip in the use of parallel computing for calculating models and other mathematically intensive operations.  There are options for both active and passive cooling.  The performance of one board is more than 1 teraflop.  From the point of view of the system, it will be recognized as a remote resource.  Parallel connection is unlimited (although the bar takes up two slots). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175467/</a></p>
