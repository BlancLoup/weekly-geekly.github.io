Previously I called and found out whether there are replacement devices, they asked me for a price, and said that there is no such functionality and price, but there is worse than a Nokia, but it's not all bad. <br><br>  I come to this Proservis, my phone is accepted, the act says ‚ÄúScratches on the screen and mechanical damage to the case‚Äù, those.  the specialist asks to sign the act of delivery, saying that I will not sign because there are no scratches on the screen, but they are only on the protective film, he says that for him it does not matter and in that case he will not take the device.  Okay, I gave it, and what was my surprise when he brought me some kind of shit in the form of a Fly from which Simka fell out and he did not turn on, then he brought Pantech. <br>  They told me on the phone that when I get a Nokia I have to write a statement saying that I would be given a substitute for the communicator when they appear. <br><br>  Okay, let Pantech, I ask the tech. Specialist for the application form, he refuses to give it, citing the fact that he has already given a replacement, says that they are not obliged to give anything at all, but he refuses to read the warranty provisions for me.  I call again in those support, they say ask for the form, write a statement, saying that they refuse to give the form.  And I get the answer "Solve your problems yourself." I left the office, arrived at the Euroset office, wrote a claim on this Proservis, wrote everything up, asking to be informed about the results of the phone call ... <br><br>  signatures and seals stating that the claim was accepted, asked for delivery, and took a copy <br><br>  look at the sequel when I'll get <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> A fault with a crack was recognized by HTC as a guarantee, they pulled some kind of bolt there, right now I found 3 more people with a similar crack <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> The first official service to which I carried the device called the 3G Zone on clean ponds, there I was done with the connector, really very good service, service for the top five.  He left there for the reason that they could not give a replacement. <br><br>  <b>UPD3: I wrote a little letter to Evgeny Chichvarkin ...</b> <br><br>  <b>Voila!</b>  <b>10:09 call from the Proservis manager.</b>  <b>They offered a normal phone for substitution.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23928/</a></p>
