This was not the wisest decision.  For almost the next two years I did not see any signs of desired personal, spiritual, intellectual or financial growth.  When I studied, my earnings grew, I had more time, and my successes were more noticeable.  Refusing education, I got the opposite result. <br><br>  The fact is that education and knowledge are transient.  They are erased not only because of non-use.  If you do not raise your level, then just start to forget.  Once acquired knowledge can not be stored in my head forever.

      I perceive education as food, water, air, physical education - that means continuous replenishment of stocks. <br><br>  You're not breathing a year, right?  So why do you think you can limit yourself to one book?  I do not understand this.  Without education it is impossible to survive. <br><br>  And it's not just personal growth.  As Benjamin Franklin said: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf a person eases his wallet in favor of the mind, then no one can rob him.  Investing in knowledge brings the most revenue. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Education is an investment in yourself.  It will bring you more dividends than any other investment. <br><br>  Here are 4 reasons why I think so. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. More successful solutions</font> </h2><br>  Our world is getting harder.  And any mistakes can lead to major consequences. <br>  No matter how smart or talented you are.  All that <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/21-sovet-pozvolyayushchiy-prevratitsya-v-samogo-produktivnogo-cheloveka/">matters is</a> how well you can <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/21-sovet-pozvolyayushchiy-prevratitsya-v-samogo-produktivnogo-cheloveka/">concentrate on serious things</a> . <br><br>  For a minute of weakness, you can easily pay by dismissal or loss of business.  A single mistake can lead to a crash. <br><br>  How to make the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-uspekha-i-produmannykh-resheniy/">right decisions</a> ? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Practice self-education. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Study the facts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Be interested in everything. <br><br>  The quality of your decisions affects your life and career.  Don't underestimate them. <br><br>  Everything can change because of one act.  How to find out if he is true? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Empowerment</font> </h2><br>  Education opens your mind and, more importantly, increases the number of possibilities.  Conservatives cling to their convictions remain in place.  But after all, change is the engine of life. <br><br>  Being engaged in self-education, you can think about those things that have never even crossed your mind.  And get under the influence of those <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-2-prevrashchenie-grez-v-realnost-chast/">ideas that have not been heard before</a> . <br><br>  By combining all this, you get the concepts and opportunities that you have enough for a lifetime. <br><br>  In the application for notes, I have 143 topics for articles.  And for most of them already have plans.  And I have dozens of business ideas.  And I bet 1, 2 or even 3 of them are worthy of attention. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhere do you get ideas?‚Äù </blockquote><br>  They come to me when I learn something new.  They do not need to pull themselves out forcibly, they appear themselves. <br><br>  Oh yeah!  You need to get acquainted with the new material every day.  "Damn, this is difficult."  Yes I know. <br><blockquote>  "Everything I know, I learned from the books." <br>  - Abraham Lincoln. </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. More knowledge - higher earnings</font> </h2><br>  There are 2 types of applicants.  At the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/proydi-tekhnicheskoe-sobesedovanie/">first interview,</a> they behave differently. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> One says, ‚ÄúYou have a great company.  I studied it.  And I want to work for you to make a contribution. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2.</b> And another remarks: ‚ÄúYour company is doing well.  But I found some weak points.  I am able to fix them. ‚Äù <br><br>  No. 1 is just another employee.  No. 2 is the one you need.  And which of them will you hire? <br><br>  There are 2 types of entrepreneurs. <br><br>  1. The first one shouts: ‚ÄúChoose me!  Buy from me!  You are welcome!  I am willing to work with anyone. ‚Äù <br>  2. And another declares: ‚ÄúI create exclusive products / services for a certain group of people.  If they don't suit you, that's fine. " <br><br>  The first entrepreneur offers consumer goods, the second - services and products, by which it is simply impossible to pass. <br><br>  How to become a representative of the second type?  Guess it.  Make your products / services people need. <br><br>  How?  Learn, exercise, be great. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Education is the only immortal investment.</font> </h2><br>  You can lose everything you have.  Money, work, customers, reputation, home, car, and even loved ones. <br><br>  But what will stay with you forever?  Knowledge (if you continue to invest in them). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If you know how to build a business, you will always have money. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If you have the knowledge and skills needed by others, you will never be without work. <br><br>  That is why I acquire all the books and courses that suit me.  And for the same reason, I spend most of my free time learning new things, visiting unfamiliar places and meeting interesting people. <br><br>  Finally, I spend so much time and money on education, because this is my survival strategy. <br><br>  People hate uncertainty.  And me too.  And education is insurance (do not confuse ‚Äúeducation‚Äù with ‚Äúdiploma‚Äù).  What matters is knowledge, not a degree. <br><br>  In fact, learning, getting "crusts", practicing skills is one of the most difficult activities in life. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Going to college is difficult. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reading 2 books a week is difficult. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Learning from online courses in the evenings after work is tiring. <br><br>  And that's why most people don't do that. <br><br>  The information revolution of the last 10 years has opened up all the possibilities for learning. <br><br>  In my opinion, not investing daily in self-education is madness.  I think learning is the main thing in life.  And this is not an allegation. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf I have some money, I buy books;  and if something remains, I get food and clothes. ‚Äù <br>  - Erasmus of Rotterdam. </blockquote><br>  I really put education above food, relationships, health, clothes and everything else.  Do you know why?  Because without it, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/8-yavnyx-priznakov-uspeshnoj-zhizni-ne-imeyushhix-nikakogo-otnosheniya-k-dengam-ili-slave/">other things are not so good</a> . <br><br>  And everything is simple.  I spend on reading / training / training for only 30 minutes a day. <br><br>  It's a bit, right?  For if you do not have 30 minutes for self-education, how do you live? <br>  Learning is important, it is an axiom.  You just need to do it every day.  And love this process. <br><br>  But we rarely do what we need.  Especially when it comes to long-term projects.  Everyone can start.  But perseverance - units. <br><br>  In my opinion, there are only 2 options: you either learn or die. <br>  Abram Maslow put it better: <br><blockquote>  "You will take a step either forward to growth, or back to safety." </blockquote><br>  I made my choice.  And you? <br><br>  <strong>PS We</strong> recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-stat-vysokoproduktivnoy-sovoy/">How to become a highly productive owl?</a>  . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315400/</a></p>
