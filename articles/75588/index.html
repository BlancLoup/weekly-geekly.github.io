      As always, this time it was not without interesting things about which I would like to tell.  I‚Äôll say right away that I‚Äôm telling information about the time keynote, so the data may differ slightly from the real ones or they need to be clarified. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Windows Azure </h4><br>  Windows Azure was the main pivot of the day.  The platform will be launched in January and will remain free until February.  Azure will support PHP, Java, MySQL and of course the entire .NET and SQL Server stack as Sql Azure.  A representative from WordPress spoke and confirmed WordPress support for Azure.  But the strangest demonstration of the possibility of a new cloud was writing code in pure C language, which can be published later in Azure.  C ++ is also supported.  In my opinion, this is somewhere beyond good and evil, but it perfectly shows the capabilities of the platform.  Of course, the code must be led to some requirements, but in general they do not interfere much. <br><br>  It was announced that for the Azure platform, Microsoft has already built 6 large data centers around the world and will build more. <br><br><h4>  PinPoint and Dallas </h4><br><img src="http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/Images/logo.gif?v=2304" alt="image" align="right">  Microsoft launches two new projects <a href="http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-US/">PinPoint</a> and <a href="http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-US/PartnerDetails.aspx%3FPartnerId%3D12884901889%26LocId%3D1249835483137">Dallas</a> .  The first is an online store of services, web applications and data for many corporate and not-so-many companies.  The second is the technology that allows you to exchange data sets using open protocols: sell, buy, subscribe.  Together - as I understand it, this is a kind of ordered Atom-based store where you can buy a data pool, for example, NASA and process it as soon as you want.  We will see what comes out of this, but for now the idea looks interesting - the data store. <br><br><h4>  Be a martian </h4><br>  On the basis of Azure and Dallas, the space agency NASA has launched an entertaining project " <a href="http://beamartian.jpl.nasa.gov/welcome">Be a Martian</a> ", which is designed to popularize science and tell about Mars. <br><br><h4>  Internet Explorer 9 </h4><br>  About IE9 will tell today.  Yesterday did not say anything, only dry spread throughout the Internet.  However, at keynote it was stated that IE would be the best browser for Windows :-) that, for sure, just marketing. <br><br><h4>  Silverlight </h4><br>  We are all waiting for some news about the next version of SL4.  And neither should appear.  Today will be the famous Scott Guthrie, so we are waiting.  Yesterday, in the context of SL, it was announced that Seesmic (makes popular twitter clients) migrates all its applications from Air to Silverlight.  Trifle, but nice. <br><br><h4>  AppFabric </h4><br>  A <s>new edition of the Windows Server 2008</s> add-on over IIS - AppFabric was announced.  It is designed to create high-speed computing servers for hosting the Windows Workflow Foundation and WCF services.  The server will contain a combination of new technologies for hosting and caching Dublin and Velocity. <br><br><h4>  Windows Identity Foundation </h4><br>  The former Geneva project has reached the final stage of RTM and is ready to exit.  It will be released for VS 2008/2010 with a GoLive license.  If you don‚Äôt know what the framework is, I recommend <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/wif">reading it</a> .  This is a new platform for creating trust relationships between different environments. <br><br><h4>  ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta </h4><br>  At the end of the keynote was announced the release of ASP.NET MVC 2 Beta, which anyone can download <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D157068">now</a> .  <a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx%3FReleaseId%3D36054">The</a> source of the project with the addition of Futures.  New in this version of the mass.  Wait for a separate note. <br><br><h4>  My impressions </h4><br>  For many, the first day seemed boring.  The thing is that here all the rules of Windows Azure and those who are not interested in this topic - missed.  Wait for Scott Guthrie today and tweet with the hashtag # pdc09, I think that will be about to write. <br><br>  I really liked it.  Multiple releases, slender cloud strategy.  Through all the narrative passed the idea that cloud computing is the future that is about to come.  And we need to have time to prepare for it.  Therefore, on the topic of Windows Azure should pay close attention and go for invite, while access to the service - is free. <br><br>  Today, on the second day of the conference, even more news should appear.  We are waiting for direct installation at 19-30 (MSK) on the site <a href="http://microsoftpdc.com/">microsoftpdc.com</a> .  By the way, Microsoft shares rose by 2% with an average Nasdaq growth of 0.27%, the news is warmly received by the market. <br><br>  <b>PS: a</b> very detailed sequential overview of keynote <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10399578-56.html%3Ftag%3Dmncol%3Btxt">on cnet</a> <br><br>  <b>PPS: the</b> first comment made some edits to the note, read it, it contains important edits and data <br><br> <a href="http://progg.ru/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-PDC09-%25D0%25A7%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE-Microsoft-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580"><img alt="Progg it" src="http://progg.ru/image.axd?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhabrahabr.ru%2Fblogs%2Fmicrosoft%2F75588%2F"></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75588/</a></p>
