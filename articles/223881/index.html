If these words mean something to you, then this event is for you.  June 21-22, Smolensk invites IT-representatives of business - programmers, designers, technologists, managers and IT-entrepreneurs - to the shore of beautiful Lake Sapsho.

      In the Smolensk Lakes National Park, we will hold a two-day summer IT-fest under the open sky.  Actively take a break from working days, share the experience of interesting projects and prepare the most delicious fish soup.  Especially for teams from other cities and speakers - a bonus (see below). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is ‚ÄúTabtabus‚Äù? </h4><br>  The autumn Tababus conference is the central IT event of Smolensk, which will be held for the third time.  The conference is held in the fall and gathers representatives of small businesses and IT specialists under its roof.  For entrepreneurs, this is an opportunity to discover new technologies, successful cases and try on all this in your business.  For IT people, this is an opportunity to get / share new experiences, find customers and communicate. <br><br>  Summer ‚ÄúTabtabus‚Äù is an opportunity to overload the brain, relax and recharge for new projects.  The format of the summer fest in the open air is a new experience.  We will not have formal reports, strict regulations and a coffee break.  We will live in tents, boil our ears, hold thematic tabs around the fire, dance to live music, bathe and sunbathe.  Link to the program and FAQ - at the end of the article. <br><br><h4>  To the participants </h4><br>  It will be the weekend.  Come teams, participate in our quests, share experiences.  The organizers will provide you with a transfer, a place for tents, a fire, firewood and a program.  For all participants the freshest ear will be organized.  Tents and meals on site you organize yourself. <br><br>  The time and place of departure of buses will be announced later.  <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/register/">Registration is required.</a> <br><br>  Orgsbor - 1000 rubles per person.  The fee will go to general business needs: transfer, equipment, payment to the national park for accommodation, etc.  You can pay in advance or upon arrival.  Better, of course, in advance. <br><br><h4>  Speakers and experts </h4><br>  If you want to speak, organize or moderate tabs (a thematic professional conversation by the fire), send your suggestions until June 5th.  <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/contacts/">Tell us</a> what you are strong in, suggest topics, cases. <br><br>  Preliminary tabs: successful startup (for entrepreneurs), useful design (for designers), extreme development (for programmers, layout designers and other specialists), project-dream (for project managers), mobile development (for everyone).  For each tab you need a moderator and experts. <br><br>  Partners, sponsors and other authors of interesting proposals <br><br>  We do not yet have information partners and almost no sponsors at all.  We are open to any suggestions.  Sponsors and partners will be generously rewarded with attention and positive PR at the event, published in newsletters, sung in songs and played in movies. <br><br>  Do you have a tasty service?  You can be a beer party sponsor.  Loud project?  Become a sponsor of the evening concert.  Fast hosting?  Help your sports program get better.  Not sure where you can help?  <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/contacts/">Just write to</a> us with a note ‚ÄúReady to be a sponsor‚Äù, and we will help you. <br><br>  For information partners, a special place has been prepared on our website, the smoothest place for tents in the media field of the festival and advantages in karma for helping to promote the project. <br><br><h4>  IT-musicians </h4><br>  If you have musicians in the team, <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/contacts/">write</a> .  We will have an open-air concert.  Amplifiers, speakers, microphones - everything will be.  You will have about 30 minutes to speak and the opportunity to speak in front of such a classroom audience.  In the application do not forget to include links to your speeches. <br><br><h4>  For those who still doubt </h4><br>  If you have not been to Smolensk, this is also an excellent occasion to visit one of the most ancient Russian cities.  Green city, where the most beautiful girls, green streets, tasty and inexpensive cafes :).  Guides will tell about the rest.  This will be a free bonus for those who arrive on Friday or linger until Sunday. <br><br>  By train from Moscow to Smolensk can be reached in 6 hours.  By car from Moscow to the place - about 4‚Äì5 hours along the excellent Moscow ‚Äì Minsk road and 1 hour along the scenic area.  From Smolensk, to the venue of the festival, a transfer will be organized (there and back). <br><br>  Come and <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/contacts/">share your ear with friends</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223881/</a></p>
