      Well, the list of the best projects and individual professionals <strong>undoubtedly arouses interest</strong> . <br>  The number of nominations announced at the beginning of the competition was only 8, by the time of awarding their number increased to 20 nominations (when and who managed to vote online for the companies that appeared at the end is also unclear). <a name="habracut"></a><br>  MTS earned its anti-award ‚Äúfor the inadequate operation of the billing system‚Äù as a result of online voting (either angry MTS subscribers rushed to vote, or other forces had an impact ...).  I personally have no complaints about the adequacy of the MTS billing system. <br><br>  However, let us return to the list of the <strong>most</strong> successful companies and leaders of Russia in the field of information technologies in 2007: <br><br>  1. More than 30% of all laureates are representatives of the public sector, in particular, the Ministry of Defense, the head of the FAIT ‚Äúfor their personal contribution to the development of electronic interagency cooperation‚Äù;  Director of the Department of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications, Deputy.  CB Chairman, etc. <br><br>  2. A very interesting nomination ‚ÄúFor innovations in the development of the gaming industry on the Russian Internet entertainment market‚Äù.  The winner was GDTeam for creating conceptually new products.  Unfortunately, I could not vote for the most conceptual company, because I did not see them on the online voting lists. <br><br>  3. Nomination "Technology of the Year."  Etersoft was announced the winner of the product WINE.  Serious technology.  Conducted a population survey.  Experts say that the decision and the company deserved this nomination. <br><br>  4. I will refrain from commenting on the IT company of the year.  But I just cannot quote the chief editor of CNews: ‚ÄúThis year we decided to award three companies that, in our opinion, differ from others in boldness.  They did what others did not dare.  So, while everyone around was selling computers, 1C has been developing software all these years, despite the monstrous level of piracy, and has achieved great success in this.  Armada was the first Russian IT company to hold an IPO.  Parallels is not afraid to compete with large corporations in the field of virtualization around the world. ‚Äù  And I naively believed that only the achievements of 2007 were taken into account and the nomination is called ‚ÄúIT company of the year 2007 (and not the period of the 90th pirated and beyond). <br><br>  5. For personal contribution to the development of R &amp; D awarded the vice-president and gene.  Director HP Russia.  They noted "the efforts that have made Russian scientists who left the country years ago return to Russia to implement their scientific ideas."  In addition, we note that the SP sponsored the ceremony. <br><br>  6. Among the sponsors, laureates, or laureates, sponsors, is the company Etegro, which became the winner in the nomination "Infrastructure solution for the authorities."  The company developed, produced and supplied an application server and an operation management server as part of the creation of a new generation state system for producing, processing and controlling passport and visa documents in the Russian Federation (I did not write this, I copied paste). <br><br>  These are the projects on the Russian IT market are the most outstanding ... <br><br>  Where are we, poor startups? <br><br>  A complete list of laureates can be found <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/04/18/297844">here</a> . <br><br>  Let me remind you that the prize for laurets was presented by the most informatively rich man in Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovsky. <br><br>  If any of my conclusions or comments seem wrong to someone, please inform.  I am open to conversation. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23879/</a></p>
