This type of file includes audio, video, subtitles and uninteresting service information.  These files can be opened in a regular video player if you have the necessary decoders.  In case you are watching a DVD on a computer, you probably have them.  (and if not, then you must put) <br><br><h4>  DVD preparation </h4><br>  Before starting the coding source should be prepared.  Generally speaking, you can not cook, encode right as it is, then cut, but this is not good - let us be a little bored and naughty.  :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The data we are interested in is mainly contained in VOB files.  Very well, if one movie takes a whole DVD, then we can take them (VOB files) and encode them all at once (if there is no advertising and the like), but I, for example, often have to encode serials, which means that in one A VOB file can be (and usually is) the end of one series and the beginning of another.  Therefore, the question arises - how to cut this thing correctly.  If the DVD was created by non-noname pirates (by the way, for the most part they have already learned how to do everything well), then the disc contains a table of contents (chapters) in which this or that series lasts for a long time.  In the end, we get the video of interest in one VOB file, which is very convenient. <br><br>  First, there is a terrible utility whose name I forgot, but as I recall, I will definitely write here to scare you.  ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/allemeine/" class="user_link">allemeine</a> suggested that this is an IFOEdit).  It gives all the information you can about DVD analyzing VOB, IFO and other files.  Now we need another program called vStrip.  You can download it, for example, <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/vstrip.htm">here</a> .  Initially, this is the command-line tool, but for it there is a GUI, which greatly facilitates the work. <br><br>  We select VOB files which contain information of interest to us.  In other words, we need to select those files in which those series lie (or the entire film) that we want to encode.  It all depends on the manufacturer of the disk.  There may be several options, but it will be difficult to describe everything, so in various specific cases you may have to break your head a little.  If you know what else, then I will add them here. <br><br>  First, let's see how the files on the disk are named.  And they are usually called like this: <br><br>  VTS_01_0.IFO <br>  VTS_01_0.VOB <br>  VTS_01_1.VOB <br>  ... <br>  VTS_01_n.VOB <br><br>  VTS_02_0.IFO <br>  VTS_02_0.VOB <br>  VTS_02_1.VOB <br>  ... <br>  VTS_02_n.VOB <br><br>  VTS_m_0.IFO <br>  VTS_m_0.VOB <br>  VTS_m_1.VOB <br>  ... <br>  VTS_m_n.VOB <br><br>  where n and m are some integers. <br><br>  Option 1. <br><br>  Small m, usually 2 and large n.  Then the files that we need are stored in the VTS_01 files, and in VTS_02 there is some kind of advertisement, announcements of new discs of the manufacturer‚Äôs company, etc. <br><br>  Option 2. <br><br>  Big m and not very big n.  In this case, the data of interest to us and sometimes the advertisement are stored in the VTS_m files. <br><br>  The second option is most loved (or loved, have not come across) for a long time.  You can check where you are with a regular video player by opening VOB files one by one.  By the way, I prefer <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Media_Player_Classic.htm">Media Player Classic</a> . <br><br>  Option 3. them.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/khim/" class="user_link">khim</a> <br><br>  In this case, part of the video that regularly repeats from series to series, opening and ending, for example, is stored in a separate file, due to which space is saved and unnecessary problems are delivered to us.  (see the original text in the comments).  In this case, this piece should be saved separately, and then, with the help of AviSynth, connected to the main part, but more on that later.  (and you can leave it this way, however, this is the business of the one who rips). <br><br>  OK.  You have identified which group of files contains what interests you.  It's time to cut it all out.  Run the vStrip GUI. <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/476/f46/7b9476f466d7adb73f6cf81c0c2f579f.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  Click on the Add ... button and add VOB files.  And add the whole group of files. <br><br>  For example, you have the following list of files: <br><br>  VTS_02_0.VOB <br>  VTS_02_1.VOB <br>  VTS_02_2.VOB <br>  VTS_02_3.VOB <br><br>  If the video you are interested in is stored in VTS_02_2, then add both VTS_02_1 and VTS_02_3 too.  In the event that the file does not fit, for example, a video with the initial menu is stored in it (why do you need to encode the menu?), Then the program will curse and offer to exclude.  So she swears: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/306/165/a85/306165a851df7b90b8fa717394ee98bc.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  This file is not worth adding, click on Nein.  Yes, I am also amused by the reluctance of the author to do the dialogue in English.  Probably a trick.  :) <br><br>  I got this picture: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/7d8/79a/6fe7d879a4413f0caba639e41af4f857.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  Now go to the tab IFO.  And open the IFO file corresponding to our VOB. <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b1/996/880/9b19968804c7ed30504dae8ee7d92673.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  If you have this list of files: <br><br>  VTS_02_0.VOB <br>  VTS_02_1.VOB <br>  VTS_02_2.VOB <br>  VTS_02_3.VOB <br><br>  then the corresponding IFO will be called VTS_02_0.IFO. <br><br>  I did it like this: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/449/018/024/4490180245e996b14d7dbf8e381b3a82.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  After the program opens the IFO file, you will see the disk's table of contents according to how the manufacturer has compiled it.  Make it quite differently.  For example, they can mark the beginning, middle and end or opening, the beginning of the series, the middle of the series, the end of the series, ending for each series.  In general, a lot of options, so here you have to mark empirically. <br><br>  First, let's expand the tree of the table of contents: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce3/a6f/731/ce3a6f7310e579a1f139181f6f3ded3a.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  Right click on the first leaf of the tree and click ‚ÄúSet Start LBA‚Äù <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a5/a08/96c/4a5a0896c62644858c1575d95ce86618.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  With this action we marked the beginning of the piece being cut.  You see, on each leaf of the tree there is a chapter duration: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b1/c6e/776/2b1c6e77645913f0d73fd27fc7ce6079.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  In mind, add these durations until they add up to the duration of the series.  For example, I know that in my case the length of the series is ~ 23 minutes: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ae/7de/e85/8ae7dee851c29a5392e571dbad0c65eb.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  As soon as you decide on the chapter on which your series ends, then right-click on it and select ‚ÄúSet End LBA‚Äù: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/ed9/392/6feed939290d284014dfa2bf882ff229.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  <i>Note: In particular for the case of them.</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/khim/" class="user_link">khim</a></i>  <i>Sometimes it happens that the required piece takes up exactly one leaf of the tree.</i>  <i>In this case, use the last remaining menu item, ‚ÄúSet Start &amp; End LBA‚Äù.</i>  <i>Thus, only this piece will be ‚Äúcut out‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  Everything, we marked the boundaries by which vStrip will cut out our video.  Go to the third tab ‚ÄúOutput‚Äù, enter the name of the output file and click Run: <br><br> <a href="http://tinypic.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a8/1cb/c17/4a81cbc179cb014abe1b9a32c8f2cd2c.png" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> <br><br>  At the output, from a bunch of VOB files, you get one, which contains only what we need and only what applies to a particular series.  It seems to me that it is very convenient. <br><br>  <i>Note: The exception is the case of them.</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/khim/" class="user_link">khim</a> and the like.</i>  <i>In this case, you will have a few pieces, which we then connect using AviSynth, but in any case it is better than trying to determine the boundaries of the series by eye.</i> <br><br>  In the next part - preparing the video for work in AviSynth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50256/</a></p>
