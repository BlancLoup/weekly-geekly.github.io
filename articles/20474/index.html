      <i>‚ÄúOn February 9, speaking at the plenary meeting of the State Duma, the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennady Zyuganov said that the government should resign.</i>  <i>According to G.Zyuganov, the country was divided into regions. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  And for the <a href="http://index.integrum.ru/">Index</a> for joy, the index is growing. <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/i_index/pic/0000hp9y"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c45/d18/99a/c45d1899a982795c77658dbc14036113.jpg" width="450" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/i_index/pic/0000fdh0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/078/5c9/f6f/0785c9f6f0bed549c2f642c7d124dfd1.jpg" width="450" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br>  And he slandered the Tsar himself: <br><br>  <i>"05/17/2005 (Zyuganov‚Äôs response to Putin‚Äôs message to the federal assembly)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúIn general, the president‚Äôs message does not respond to the challenges of the time and does not provide key directions.</i>  <i>With the current government, nothing in the country will change for the better.</i>  <i>Only the government of national interests is able to hear the people, feel their pain, understand priorities and problems and solve them in a timely manner, ‚Äùthe leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation considers.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  But Zhigan, as he understood that he was lagging behind, so let's catch up. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúOn February 9, speaking at a plenary session of the State Duma, LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said his party would support a vote of no confidence.</i>  <i>"We will support, because you, the government, do not know how to protect yourself."</i>  <i>V.Zhirinovsky regretted that Stolypin was no longer in Russia.</i>  <i>According to the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Zurabov should not go to pharmacies.</i>  <i>The deputy appealed to M. Fradkov: ‚Äúyou should have answered whether there was corruption or not.‚Äù</i>  <i>V.Zhirinovsky attacked with criticism of ‚ÄúMotherland‚Äù and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, calling on the heads of the Russian Government, as well as the leaders of the parliamentary factions, to commit collective suicide along with themselves. ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  And almost caught up with Zyugan something.  Almost almost, but not quite. <br><br>  Angry in earnest.  So during the great post, under a passionate week, he took up the old. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúOn March 30, 13:36, the LDPR deputies staged a fight in the State Duma meeting hall, after which they left the plenary session in protest against the election results in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District.</i>  <i>House Speaker Boris Gryzlov instructed the Duma Committee on Regulations to deal with the situation that has developed during today's plenary session, ITAR-TASS reported.</i>  <i>About 15 people participated in the brawl.</i>  <i>The leader of the Liberal Democrats was their permanent leader Zhirinovsky.</i>  <i>But, as it turns out, it was not he who hit him first, but him. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Bar fight, and at lackeys forelocks crack.  Saddled his horse Zhigan.  Index grows like yeast.  And all is not enough for him. <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/i_index/pic/0000b41w"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/472/fac/b81/472facb81605069b2f3fdf007294e3a5.jpg" width="450" height="278" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br>  Summer is nearing, May is in full swing.  And Zhigan again.  He refuses to put up (news for 05/17/2005 / Russia for 05/17/2005 / The deputies Zhirinovsky and Saveliev, who organized a fight in the State Duma, refused to apologize to each other), then he tells about Eastern gold. <br><br>  * * * <br>  And then I look at the index and do not believe my eyes.  Our sovereign, the seer, already knew everything, already then he was working for the people's cause, for choosing the best ruler for us! <br><br>  June was coming.  It was hot.  And money changers and merchants - all with his name on their lips. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúJune 24, 2005,‚Äú Gazprom‚Äôs stock market liberalization is planned to be completed by the end of the year, ‚ÄùDmitry Medvedev, the head of the Gazprom board of directors, said today, according to Reuters.</i>  <i>Medvedev also noted that liberalization implies the abolition of quotas for foreigners in Gazprom‚Äôs capital and the abolition of all restrictions on circulation. ‚Äù</i> <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/i_index/pic/0000p1r8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4d2/1b2/2bc/4d21b22bc5cd650a940cf5431e69922d.jpg" width="450" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br>  And when the snow fell, he take it and play with all his powerful force. <br><br>  <i>"On November 14, 2005, the former head of the presidential administration, appointed by the first deputy prime minister on November 14, will become the prime minister of Russia in the coming months, the Vedomosti newspaper reports, citing an anonymous source in the government."</i> <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/i_index/pic/0000r86w"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4d9/617/ea2/4d9617ea296cedff2a437377e25dec68.jpg" width="450" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br>  And now its Index is not an index ‚Äî the Kremlin bell tower, the Spasskaya Tower! <br><br>  <sup><i>To be continued</i></sup> <sup><br><br></sup>  <sup><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/politics_ru/1386786.html">A source</a></sup> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20474/</a></p>
