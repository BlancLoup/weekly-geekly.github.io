  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How old are you? I'm 11</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, dear users!  Last week came the same day, which, fortunately, only once a year.  Last time we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/article/283500/">told</a> how it all began - since then, little has changed in the history of Habr.  Therefore, on this day, I just want to congratulate all of you - those who make Habr as it is.  And, of course, to everyone who reads it. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/330084/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/750/f8f/8ae/750f8f8aeed1eff0626d80074a33ef9c.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For almost the entire year, we refactored projects.  As a result, much has changed, but much remains to be changed.  Perhaps the most noticeable is the imperceptibly implemented redesign.  We conducted it in several iterations: first we changed the main menu, then the footer, blocks, other parts of the site and sections.  Literally the other day the dialogues were updated.  In the near future, the post itself will be updated along with comments.  How do you change, by the way? <br><br>  In this publication, I would like to share with you current data and graphs from our admin panel, which we have never shown before :)

    <h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Height and weight Habr</font> </h2><br>  This year Habrahabr was visited by 56.7 million unique users;  Giktayms - 29.4 million. 32.8 million users visiting Habr were from Russia, 8.22 million represented Ukraine and 2.21 million from Belarus.  There were 21.4 million Russians on Hiktaims, 3.75 million Ukrainians and 1 million Belarusians. Almost all countries of the world are among the countries, but Kazakhstan, Germany, the United States, Georgia and Eastern European countries are next to the listed leaders.  Unfortunately, there are countries out of which less than 100 people have come in - Jamaica, Tongo, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Liechtenstein, Cura√ßao and Liberia. <br><br>  And on Habr√© and on Giktayms among Russian regions, the leaders of visits are Moscow and the Moscow region, St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region, the Sverdlovsk region, the Novosibirsk region, the Krasnodar region, the Nizhny Novgorod region, the Samara region, the Republic of Tatarstan and the Chelyabinsk region.  Although, of course, there are hundreds of thousands of visitors from other regions of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Almost nothing changes in gender structures: on Habr√©, there are more girls than three times no copecks, and at Hikttimes, three times more with a tail.  Although girls, in accordance with the general IT trend, have recently grown a bit. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Pulse Habra</font> </h2><br>  Below in the picture you can see the dynamics of publications.  The New Year holidays are clearly visible;  otherwise the pulse is smooth: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/d9b/a16/604d9ba167950e6de2e3f9d2b9079d15.png"><br><br>  But the dynamics of comments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54e/200/7fb/54e2007fbbb12291db0b8c24db96e979.png"><br><br>  Dynamics of voting for publications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a96/83b/39d/a9683b39d18a9548b0089bc120986857.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b13/91a/eae/b1391aeae0f465874dea3e7f87968a33.png"><br><br>  And, of course, commenting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a75/607/b85/a75607b85b9c6d1a465ecf102a0cdfa7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1a/e63/6f7/a1ae636f759984ea648246fe360fc4eb.png"><br><br>  If you want more numbers, we have them: <br><br>  Total for the year users posted 11309 publications, of which: <br><br>  - 5610 from companies <br>  - 5139 from users <br>  - 560 editorial posts <br>  - 114 in hubah-offtopic <br><br>  Threading: <br><br>  - Development: 6898 <br>  - Administration: 1603 <br>  - Design: 348 <br>  - Management: 1232 <br>  - Marketing: 423 <br>  - Miscellaneous: 804 <br><br>  In the sandbox, users sent 1641 publications, of which 1349 were rejected. <br><br>  During the year, 104144 users joined our ranks.  In total, Habr now has 779,628 users, of which: <br><br>  - 83664 users have a ‚Äúfull‚Äù account <br>  - 679502 users in ReadOnly mode <br>  - 16462 users in Read &amp; Comment mode <br><br>  In total for the year 290416 comments were written, of which: <br><br>  - 255710 comments from "full" users <br>  - 34706 from Read &amp; Comment-users (4130 comments were rejected) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Companies that can tell</font> </h2><br>  During this year, we made new friends not only among users, but also among companies that are happy to talk about their experiences in corporate blogs: GK LANIT with cool integration stories, Sbertech with machine learning and Data Science, ESF program with exciting stories about your platform, Avito with the secrets of the main ad repository, LEGO Education with smart systems for children, Tutu.ru with stories about the other side of the service, Clinic of Ophthalmology Dr. Shilova with an honest story about vision correction, Lakhta Center with the builder  stvom skyscrapers on the land of the St. Petersburg and many others. <br><br>  Of course, we have not forgotten about our reliable friends with whom we have been together for several years: Microsoft, JUG.RU Group, M.Video, Positive Technologies, Parallels and everything. <br><br>  We did not stay away from contests and events and helped to conduct ‚ÄúSAP Coder - 2017‚Äù, ‚ÄúPromotion‚Äù and the PostgreSQL article competition.  We have done a cool HighLoad ++ broadcast and are preparing unrealistically cool with RIT ++.  We tested several boxes of devices and several gigabytes of software.  We conducted three of our own seminars offline and closely engaged in the study of technical evangelism. <br><br>  You do not know yet, but we know how many cool projects lie ahead. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9cc2ce">Walk so walk</font> </h2><br>  This year, we will celebrate Habr's birthday on June 6 and 7 at the RIT ++ conference, where we will be glad to see everyone. <br><br>  On RIT we will have: <br><br><ul><li>  Direct video broadcast from Habrahabr studio from the main hall.
