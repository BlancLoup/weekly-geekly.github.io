A very long time.  It is difficult to resist this and decided to share with the community: the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335728/">first reaction</a> has already taken place. <br><br>  Today I decided to <b>turn to the White side</b> and look in the direction of the project, which was already lit up a bit on Habr√© - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335738/">DsPlus</a> .  Evaluation criteria, I think, everyone remembers: Team, concept, coin, code.  Let's not move away from it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Team</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9ae/2a9/8be/9ae2a98be46e4857a4e13d852d6acbd1.jpg">

      It's pretty simple here: <br><br><ol><li>  There is a site - <a href="http://dsplus.io/">dsplus.io</a> : it is not difficult to confirm the identity on social networks.  Moreover, I increasingly find common friends during checks (the market is painfully narrow in the ICO, although this does not make it better). </li><li>  Mikhail, the CEO of the project, can find a diploma from IIDF.  The thing is remarkable.  But maybe it's fake?  After all, the FI (O) person is interesting: Mikhail Mikhailov.  What is not Ivan Ivanov?  But simple checks on cross-links prove that this is not so: for fun, I note that they have one more person in their team, whose first and last names are the same, but about him later. </li><li>  The guys respond to the chat pretty quickly (tested slack), excluding, perhaps, the period 23.00 - 02.00 Moscow time.  I wrote several times, in general I would rate 8 out of 10 according to this criterion.  In the annex, too, there are answers to comments, but, first, not to all;  secondly, not all deployed. </li><li>  Of the oddities, these are social networks: it is clear that the project is not sharpened in the Russian Federation (however, in a private chat I was informed that it is also developing ‚Äúto Asia and the near abroad‚Äù), but still using Linkedin and not using vk is a strange choice considering the fact that while the main customers and partners of the company are in Russia.  In addition, some of the guys from the team do not have a normal social history.  Of course, as he wrote earlier: there is a frontman - already good.  But for others you can always find something interesting, at least by cross-references: after all, we all learned somewhere, worked, developed, worked ... </li><li>  <a href="http://dsplus.pro/">Partners</a> can also be found on <a href="http://dsplus.pro/">dsplus.pro</a> .  At first glance, cut eyes such as: Magnet, M.Video, Megaphone and the like.  But in fact, DsPlus people do not lie here: they really charge their pluses for being checked by a client in a place where such organizations are located.  I also did not quite understand what role Microsoftshop played in their system, I hope, they will answer here.  In general, the wish is simple: more transparency, so that no ordinary user needs to search for someone and why a partner.  For example, here's a review from the AppStore: ‚ÄúNobody heard about bonuses in KFC, charging occurs by geolocation next to points of so-called partners who are not aware that they are partners!", It is clear that the person wrote a review without understanding the system, but, as I see it, you need to respond to such a negative first of all. Again, from the comments of the team it follows that: ‚Äúwe check in partner companies which have‚Äú 250 PCs ‚Äùin a circle next to the name (you can open the Supermarkets section and look there) , and in companies where 00% Cash is written in a circle  Back, you can get a cashback when you click on the link in the application and purchase goods. The same goes for Microsoftshop - various gadgets and accessories for them are sold there: they are also our partners). ‚Äù </li><li>  Sergey Sergienko (known for the project Hronobank, SONM) is the team's attorney.  In the blockchain community, Sergey has a reputation for confirming that he is associated with the team - abound. </li><li>  Now I also see (according to the alerts) that the news background for the team has grown strongly: it is understandable - preICO passed, by the way, successfully, as the guys planned 200,000, and collected a quarter more.  This is indicative, but not the main one. </li><li>  The company is also searched on the maps and in the Unified State Register of Companies.  By the way, on jur.  A person can also find another site - <a href="http://couponsclub.org/">couponsclub.org</a> , which is registered according to the portal itself in 2016, and according to who.is - 2016: which is nothing but a story.  A plus.  In addition, it completely beats the fact stated on one site: ‚ÄúDSPlus is a unique mobile application designed for lead generation and retention of customers, which has existed for more than 1 year and successfully operates in the territory of the Russian Federation‚Äù. </li><li>  What is not clear: why is the <a href="https://vk.com/dsplusirk">vk.com/dsplusirk</a> group closed?  But less informative instagram - open.  The question, by the way, is open. </li></ol><blockquote>  On the last point, I received a response from the team in this form: you wrote about the VC that its normal is not (it is closed).  It really is.  The DSPlus group Irkutsk and other cities are closed, as the general all-Russian group <a href="https://vk.com/dsplusfork">vk.com/dsplusfork was created</a> .  We promote it) </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e26/7e6/dd7/e267e6dd7bab45cab602b774b258d520.png"><br><br>  <b>Code (technology):</b> <br><br><ol><li>  I did not get access to my personal account - this is still a minus, but I'm not strong, I must say, I tried.  The application itself has installed - it is quite functional.  Moreover - two of my testers also tried it - it works.  True, the iOS test is still ahead, but the installation showed that there is a contact.  And yes, the comment of the team again pleased (in a good way): ‚Äúpreviously, access was provided only to partner companies for tracking users' actions in their outlets.  After ICO, it is planned to open access to the personal account for PCT token holders + wallet integration.  For a simple user, the personal account is open in the mobile application, as there is access to their wallet. ‚Äù </li><li>  On the site as a whole, everything is smooth, but there are shortcomings: for example, the link to Golos and Bitcoin Start is the same.  But in the little things always devil.  Otherwise, it‚Äôs very watchable: I wouldn‚Äôt have done this to my site :), but the DsPlus team could. </li><li>  From what I didn‚Äôt like: it‚Äôs necessary to look for the code on Gita, but I don‚Äôt like to do that, because  the principle is simple: ‚Äúeither openly and simply find, or not necessary‚Äù.  However, WP covers the veil of <a href="https://github.com/dsplus/PlusCoin">github.com/dsplus/PlusCoin</a> , but it‚Äôs better to make more links to such things.  The second thing that caught my eye - preICO is not fully automated.  Not so much a minus as inconvenience. </li><li>  The undoubted advantage of technology is usability: in general, everything is available for ordinary citizens who don‚Äôt know that they are doing something with crypto coins.  In this sense, the team fulfills a promise: ‚Äúthe popularization of the PlusCoin cryptocurrency for people who have no idea or understanding about the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain‚Äù.  The paradox, however, is that the content of the internal <a href="http://blog.pluscoin.io/">blog.pluscoin.io</a> blog can <a href="http://blog.pluscoin.io/">not</a> be called full-fledged, much less readable.  I think this is something to work on.  In addition, there are no materials for the English-speaking environment. </li><li>  I think we will do a detailed analysis of the technology in pdf analysis. </li></ol><br>  <b>Concept:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  White book in two languages.  The main sections are. </li><li>  What needs to be clarified in the first place is this point: ‚Äúproducts that are DS PLUS competitors in the traditional market segment will be involved in a single partner network and will become one of the most important components of the infrastructure being developed by DS PLUS.  The main objective of the project is to introduce PlusCoin into real commodity and money turnover, which will ensure a steady growth of the exchange rate, as well as increase the number of people involved in the cryptoeconomy, both from consumers and from business. ‚Äù  To turn competitors into partners is laudable, but I would like to understand the exact mechanism that answers the question: ‚Äúhow?‚Äù. </li><li>  There is a road map: there are no rainbow targets.  Items painted not much, but subject. </li><li>  The economy is deflationary: ‚Äúin the future, First PlusCoin Token will not be generated, all unclaimed tokens will be destroyed during the ICO period‚Äù. </li><li>  The main risk, in my opinion, is the experience of cashback services earlier: almost none of them survived.  Including - in the world.  Of course, there are solutions in this niche, but nevertheless, it requires a thorough study of the economy, which I would like to see in the close blockchain of the implementation technology: for example, monthly reports like Golos - open and accessible. </li></ol><br>  <b>Coin:</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335548/">according to the matrix that I presented earlier,</a> this coin has a place to be and therefore this factor can be regarded as positive for the overall reputation of the project. <br><br>  Thus, I summarize the main aspects, first - the negative ones: <br><br><ol><li>  Partners are initially listed as all - equal (relative to the service) to each other.  Meanwhile, some of them are a beautiful marketing move, when enrollment takes place by geo-tag.  This is stated, but you need to search on the web.  Hardly ordinary users will do this.  I see that this moment needs to be worked out. </li><li>  The team is not all white on biographies, but nevertheless relationships are easily sought.  I think that you can add some minimal things.  Video interview gives a lot, but not all. </li><li>  Technically, you need to refine the blog, run through the thin places of the site. </li><li>  Find a model explaining economics before ICO. </li><li>  Go through the reviews in the app and answer all. </li></ol><br>  <b>From positive:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The team is trying very hard to show both its potential and its ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù, and to develop a technology that is close to me - this is commendable. </li><li>  The product is there, it works.  Judging by the settings and the stated figures - the overall figures are fighting, if not 100%, then almost.  However, sometimes you have to look for data for comparison - here you have to work (say, through a blog). </li><li>  The history of development can be confirmed from independent sources, which always gives a plus. </li><li>  Legal entity found.  Address verified. </li><li>  And most importantly, the information background after preICO did not decrease much. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/913/d82/975/913d82975c294d779efd3f364e70e6fd.jpg"><br><br>  In general, there is where to work.  While the <b>assessment is neutral</b> : it will go to plus or minus - we'll see.  But to all readers who sharpen their skills in the analysis of ICO projects, I draw your attention to the fact that <b>just in the case of DsPlus it is very clear that one factor (the stated equality of partners) does not serve as a final verdict</b> , all the more so as it becomes clearer with more thorough analysis.  Yes, it is time consuming, but if you want to invest your money, it is justified. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336112/</a></p>
