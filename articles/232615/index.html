Here is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/225771/">first post</a> on this topic, and here is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/226611/">second</a> . <br><br>  Both in the first and in the second record not only Watson was mentioned, but also other technologies of the corporation, including the IBM Cloud.  Now we want to show the scope of other services / technologies.  And of course, such a demonstration of opportunities will be held on practical examples.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  MD Anderson Cancer Center </h4><br><br>  Genetic information decoded by the genome is Big Data in the literal sense of the word.  There is a huge amount of data, and in many cases it is necessary to structure it and also find something in common in different data sets.  All this, like no one else, is understood by oncologists who say that there are no two identical cancerous tumors. <br><br>  The fight against cancer should be individual, so all methods of struggle are selected separately for each person.  And resources help this many times already mentioned on the Habr√© supercomputer IBM Watson. <br><br>  Its capabilities are used by the MD Anderson Cancer Center, where they developed a tool called the ‚ÄúMD Anderson Oncology Expert Advisor‚Äù using a supercomputer.  This tool, using the resources of IBM Watson, allows you to diagnose a type of cancer while indicating possible ways of treating cancer in a particular person. <br><br>  To select the best option, ‚ÄúMD Anderson Oncology Expert Advisor‚Äù analyzes the patient's genetic map, thousands of pages of specialized medical literature, diagnoses and examples of successful treatment in similar cases. <br><br>  The oncologist is simply not able to do the same work in any reasonable time.  IBM Watson performs all tasks in minutes and hours. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/emgk7DOL3go&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGZkRbvQ3h9OlQe3DBwG-ij_g3Xw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Kuma Games Game World </h4><br><br>  Kuma Games has been working in the gaming field for many years, and since 2007 this company has been using the resources of the IBM Cloud.  As a result, the Kuma Games team more effectively develops gaming services / applications based on such a powerful platform as the IBM Cloud. <br><br>  The company creates many projects, so it needs an environment that allows you to maintain the simultaneous presence of thousands of players and millions of game races.  Plus, this whole environment needs to be scalable to meet ever-increasing resource requirements. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wALPcWrLkhw&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHm-z7mPPSWs-mbrogLnHVTifqIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Macy Retail </h4><br><br>  Macy's is one of the largest and oldest retail chains in the United States.  Founded in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy (born Rowland Hussey Macy).  As of 2010, the network includes more than 800 non-food department stores.  The stores of the chain are focused on the sale of clothes and shoes, and the stores also sell furniture, household goods, bedding, jewelry, and cosmetics. <br><br>  Using IBM services, including IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics, the company was able to develop a personalized virtual advisor for buyers, the My Macy service.  This service tracks the purchase history for each person, and on the basis of individual information gives personalized advice and makes personalized offers.  Presumably, opponents of using natural leather / wool for making clothes and shoes, this service is unlikely to advise "elegant leather shoes."  But chic leatherette shoes - please. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb1UJOxB1mY&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiraaypHHv_FuXl1Kmsf0kx472h8w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Wine retailer Millesima </h4><br><br><img src="http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/madewithibm/stories/assets/images/s14/s14-t32-mD.gif"><br><br>  Millesima company sells wine is not the first year.  IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics has helped the company manage personalized customer service.  Now the wines are offered to customers based on the history of their previous purchases. <br><br>  In addition, when creating recommendations take into consideration such facts as the geographical location of the buyer, time of year and much more.  As a result, the company offers each person wine not just what they like, but also what is suitable for the current event (for example, it could be the buyer's birthday, or some kind of national holiday). <br><br>  The seller is unlikely to be able to analyze all these data, especially if we take into account the number of Millesima customers in tens of thousands. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4MjbUHIgP9Q&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibDQ9nllju92vCAh2y_AWIJAV22A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Wimbledon </h4><br><br>  This is more than a sports tournament. Wimbledon is a world-class sporting and cultural event.  Of course, not everyone likes tennis, but Wimbledon collects tens of thousands of visitors and tens of millions of spectators. <br><br>  Of course, most tennis fans watch the tournament remotely.  Who is on TV, who is in the online broadcast.  And just in the latter case, you need to be able to predict how many viewers will watch the broadcast in order to scale up the online broadcasting infrastructure accordingly. <br><br>  Previously, this was a big problem, especially during an unexpected influx of viewers.  Now the IBM Cloud tool helps to predict an increase in the number of viewers, which, in turn, allows you to adapt the infrastructure of online broadcasting "on the fly." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/On_NySOBnBM&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpBxcWW_Xy22b9pTsnCC5uDJ9osg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, only some of the most interesting examples of the use of IBM services and technologies were given above.  In fact, the range of their application is much wider, and a little later we will publish other examples that can be considered indicative.  Now both big and small business can rely on the computing resources of the corporation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232615/</a></p>
