This exploit kit was used to compromise users of malware with Flash Player exploits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/289/801/522/28980152265647b5abc9547c683d5554.jpeg"><br><br>  Starting at least since October of this year, users may have come across ads advertising such applications as Browser Defense and Broxu.  Below are the banners of these ads that were used to display on websites.

After receiving this information, the server decided which banner image should be provided to the client - a regular image or its malicious counterpart. <br><br>  The malicious version of the banner image incorporates an encrypted script located in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_space">alpha channel of the</a> RGB image.  This alpha channel sets the transparency of each pixel.  Since this change does not greatly affect the appearance of the image, it only slightly differs from its original version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/69b/29d/c5b69b29d23c4a01a125cd1e83f43f4e.png"><br><br>  The script, encoded in such an unusual way, exploits a vulnerability in Internet Explorer with the identifier CVE-2016-0162, and also checks its execution environment for detecting a virtual environment. <br><br>  In the event that the script does not detect signs that analysts are trying to track its activity, it redirects the user to the landing page of the Stegano exploit kit using the TinyURL service.  The landing page attempts to play a Flash file that specializes in exploiting the three vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, CVE-2016-4117), depending on which version of Flash Player is installed on the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c2/4fb/7ad/4c24fb7ad70b40bd8af6f5375891ad1d.png"><br><br>  After successful exploitation of the vulnerability, the executable shell code collects information about security products installed in the system, and also once again checks the environment in which the code is executed.  If the necessary conditions are met, the shellcode attempts to download the encrypted payload from the same server.  The payload is also masked as a GIF image. <br><br>  The payload is then decrypted and launched using regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe.  As a payload, we observed backdoors, banker trojans, password hijackers, and various bootloader trojans. <br><br>  We have already observed an earlier version of this set of cyber attacks on Dutch users.  In the spring of 2015, cybercriminals specialized in compromising Czech users, and now turned their attention to Canada, the UK, Australia, Spain, and Italy. <br><br>  In earlier campaigns, attackers attempted to disguise their malicious activity in the form of advertising.  At the same time, a set of exploits used domain names that began with the name ‚Äúads‚Äù, as well as URI names that contained watch.flv, media.flv, delivery.flv, player.flv, or mediaplayer.flv. <br><br>  In the course of today's cyber attacks, the attackers improved their tactics, they began to use ad networks that they had compromised, which redirected users from different countries to a set of exploits. <br><br>  A feature of current campaigns was the fact that the attackers used such popular exploit kits as Angler and Neutrino to a lesser extent than the Stegano exploit kit.  The number of referrals to Stegano from websites with malicious banners was higher than in the case of Angler and Neutrino. <br><br>  We observed that large legitimate websites, including news sites with millions of people every day, were hosting these malicious banners. <br><br>  In the vast majority of cases, advertisements specialized in promoting a product called "Browser Defense."  Not so long ago, we found banners promoting software called Broxu.  However, for simplicity of perception, we will focus on the consideration of the malicious campaign "Browser Defense".  In addition, both campaigns are almost identical in their properties. <br><br>  The ad was located on browser-defence.com with a URI format similar to the following. <br><br>  hxxps: //browser-defence.com/ads/s/index.html? w = 160 &amp; h = 600 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/9b5/c5e/1a69b5c5e8de4fe09fd64757e1dd42e5.png"><br><br>  The index.html document loads the countly.min.js script and gives it the initial parameters when executing.  This script, however, does not constitute a library for working with the stock market platform and open source web analytics.  Attackers use a heavily modified and obfuscated version of this library, from which certain code has been removed and a new one inserted.  This new code is responsible for the initial verification of the environment.  Then the information about the environment is sent to the remote server as parameters of the gif file, which are encrypted using XOR.  Information about this is shown in the screenshot above. <br><br>  The following information about the environment is sent to the remote server. <br><br>  systemLocale ^ screenResolution ^ GMT offset ^ Date ^ userAgent ^ pixelRatio <br><br>  After that, the script requests the ad banner from the server.  The server may respond either with a normal version of the banner image or with a malicious one, depending on the information about the environment in which it was launched.  Then the script tries to load the banner and read the information of its RGBA structure.  In the event that a malicious version of the script is received, it will decode the JavaScript code and some variables from the alpha channel of the image. <br><br>  In this case, steganography is implemented as follows: two consecutive alpha values ‚Äã‚Äãrepresent tens and units of code symbols encoded as a difference of 255 (full alpha).  In addition, to mask changes that can be detected with the naked eye, the difference is minimized using offset 32. <br><br>  For example, if the original few alpha bytes contained the values ‚Äã‚Äã239, 253, 237, 243, 239, 237, 241, 239, 237, 245, 239, 247, 239, 235, 239, and 237, they would be decoded into the word "function" (function).  In this example, the first bytes of the alpha value 239 and 253 correspond to the character 'f'. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4d/85b/cba/f4d85bcbaa644f45a25dc2da74892110.png"><br><br>  A closer look at one of the blank banners and its malicious counterpart can show a slight difference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f5/9fa/ac7/1f59faac76c04fa5ba5347b03af70802.png"><br>  (from left to right: clean image, malicious counterpart, enhanced malicious counterpart for masking) <br><br>  The alpha channel of unused pixels is filled with some pseudo-random values ‚Äã‚Äãin order to do so-called.  "Alpha noise" evenly distributed, which enhances masking.  After successful extraction, the script checks the integrity of the JavaScript code and compares the resulting hash with the previously fixed hash value, which is specified at the end of the picture.  After that, the script is executed. <br><br>  After its launch, the script tries to check its execution environment, namely, the web browser and the running OS for the presence of the network packet capture tool, sandbox (sandbox), virtualization software, as well as the presence of installed security products.  At the same time, the script code also tries to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2016-0162 in Internet Explorer.  It also checks for the presence of various graphics and security drivers in the system for detecting an automated malware analysis system. <br><br>  In the event that none of the above signs are detected in the system, the script creates an IFRAME (one pixel in size), sets the window.name property of the window, which will be used later.  After that, the user is redirected to TinyURL via https.  Next, TinyURL redirects the user to the http of the landing page of the set of exploits. <br><br>  After a successful redirection, the landing page of the exploit checks the UserAgent for compliance with the Internet Explorer web browser, then loads the Flash file and sets the FlashVars settings via an encrypted JSON file.  The landing page also acts as an intermediary for Flash and a remote server via ExternalInterface and provides encryption and decryption functions. <br><br>  The downloadable Flash file contains another Flash file inside it and, as with the Neutrino exploit kit, it contains three different exploits for different versions of Flash Player.  In the second stage, the Flash file decrypts FlashVars.  It contains a JSON file with a URI for sending the error message, the names of the JS functions for ExternalInterface, the name of the callback function, and some unused data. <br><br>  {‚ÄúA‚Äù: ‚Äù\ / e.gif? Ts = 1743526585 &amp; r = 10 &amp; data =‚Äù, ‚Äùb‚Äù: ‚ÄùdUt‚Äù, ‚Äùc‚Äù: ‚ÄúhML‚Äù, ‚Äùd‚Äù: true, ‚Äùx‚Äù: ‚Äù\ / x .gif? ts = 1743526585 &amp; r = 70 &amp; data = ‚Äù} <br><br>  Further, it calls JavaScript via ExtelnalInterface.call (), which checks the Flash version and sends this information to the server via the landing page.  This is done via the encrypted URI request parameter for the GIF file.  The encryption algorithm is quite simple and uses the value of the window.name from the advertisement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/29e/7e9/ef829e7e9eac43ac815efa5e56983c77.png"><br><br>  The answer is a GIF image in which the first bytes are discarded, and the rest is decrypted using the same algorithm, and then the control is transferred back to Flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cda/0f1/d0a/cda0f1d0a75a4c13ab395daa4bd9667c.png"><br><br>  The response is a JSON containing the character that indicates the exploit used (CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019 or CVE-2016-4117), the password for the corresponding exploit and the ready shell code with the payload URI. <br><br>  The shell code is decrypted at the last stage of exploitation of the vulnerability.  He is trying to load an encrypted payload into the system, which is again disguised as a GIF image.  At the first stage of its execution, the shellcode also checks the environment in which it is executed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a73/4cc/802/a734cc8024d94365a984ecacdb8d31ce.png"><br><br>  He is particularly interested in checking the presence of the following software. <br><br><ul><li>  vmtoolsd.exe </li><li>  VBoxService.exe </li><li>  prl_tools_service.exe </li><li>  VBoxHook.dll </li><li>  SBIEDLL.DLL </li><li>  fiddler.exe </li><li>  charles.exe </li><li>  wireshark.exe </li><li>  proxifier.exe </li><li>  procexp.exe </li><li>  ollydbg.exe </li><li>  windbg.exe </li><li>  eset *, kasper *, avast *, alwil *, panda *, nano a *, bitdef *, bullgu *, arcabi *, f-secu *, g data *, escan *, trustp *, avg *, sophos *, trend m *, mcafee *, lavaso *, immune *, clamav *, emsiso *, superanti *, avira *, vba32 *, sunbel *, gfi so *, vipre *, microsoft sec *, microsoft ant *, norman *, ikarus * , fortin *, filsec *, k7 com *, ahnlab *, malwareby *, comodo *, symant *, norton *, agnitu *, drweb *, 360 *, quick h </li></ul><br>  If one of the above components is detected, the shellcode will not attempt to load the payload.  If the payload is received, the first 42 bytes of GIF images are discarded, the remaining data is decrypted and saved to a file using one of the functions listed below. <br><br><ol><li>  <i>CreateFile</i> , <i>WriteFile</i> </li><li>  <i>CreateUrlCacheEntryA (* <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a> ‚Äù,,,,)</i> , <i>CreateFileA</i> , <i>CreateFileMappingA</i> , <i>MapViewOfFile</i> , {loop of moving bytes}, <i>FlushViewOfFile</i> , <i>UnmapViewOfFile</i> </li></ol><br>  The payload file itself is launched using the regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe tools. <br><br>  We observed in the download of shell-code malicious payload files (Stegano exploit kit) that have the following AV detection of ESET products. <br><br>  <b>Win32 / TrojanDownloader.Agent.CFH</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Win32 / TrojanDownloader.Dagozill.B</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Win32 / GenKryptik.KUM</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Win32 / Kryptik.DLIF</b> <br><br>  After analyzing the bootloaders and files with detection of the Kryptik families, we found out that they either contained or downloaded remotely malicious software Ursnif and Ramnit. <br><br>  Ursnif contains many modules for stealing email credentials, includes a backdoor, keylogger, a tool for creating screenshots and videos, a component of embedding code in web browsers Internet Explerer, Firefox, Chrome and modifying http traffic.  It can also steal any file from the infected system.  According to information from configuration files that were found in samples of this malware, it is focused on the corporate sector and, especially, on payment services and institutions. <br><br>  Ramnit is a file virus that was sent to the banking sector.  This virus also contains numerous malicious functions, including data theft, screen capture, file execution. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The Stegano exploit kit has been used by intruders since 2014. Its authors have made a lot of efforts to implement several methods to achieve the appropriate level of secrecy.  In one of the recent campaigns, we discovered what we had been tracking since the beginning of October 2016. The attackers distributed links to a set of exploits using advertising banners and steganography.  At the same time, the authors took care of hiding malicious activity from the eyes of analysts, who can use a special environment for monitoring. <br><br>  In case of successful operation, victim systems vulnerable to the exploits used are left open for compromise by other malicious programs, including backdoors, spyware and banker trojans. <br><br>  The malicious actions of the Stegano exploit kit or other exploit kit can be avoided if you regularly update the installed software and OS, and use a reliable anti-virus product. <br><br>  The presence of the following products on the system is attempting to be detected by the Stegano exploit kit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/2a5/0c7/7492a50c7d6c455c929098e086cd86d9.png"><br><img
