This is if you forget about drug addicts, targeted thieves and robbers.  Your home is your castle.  The entrance of your house is also your house.  (Yes, many people don‚Äôt understand this point, but it‚Äôs never too late to learn).  Classic entrance protection methods - installation of reinforced doors;  installation of an intercom;  installation of concierge;  the organization of video surveillance over entrances. <br><br>  But the doors open easily at the slightest mistake of their production, many intercoms are subject to ‚Äúall-terrain vehicles‚Äù keys, concierges often sleep and do nothing, and the video surveillance that nobody watches turns into a waste of money.  As a result, almost all attempts to improve the social situation are slaughtered by the neighbors using the elephant method: ‚Äúbut what for we need them‚Äù. <br><br>  However, if you turn on your brains and think about it, in fact you can get a very effective result with very small investments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Concomitant </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/f70/c4e/f48f70c4ecb8e372e69b3c32fb106e93.jpg" align="right" width="250">  First, so as not to get up twice, consider the first bastion of protection: doors with intercoms.  Quite a common mistake - the door with a handle-pipe.  What is bad?  You can take this pen firmly.  Very tight.  Also elbow.  Or take two or three.  In this case, even a magnet per ton will not help - the door can be opened even without tools.  By the way, so as not to get up twice, bug number 2 is a lever.  Look where the handle is fixed at the door, and where the point of application of the magnet is (metal anchor at the top of the door).  It is easy to see that the human jerk is applied to a larger lever, so the effectiveness of the magnet is still falling.  The best option is a pen-smooth round button.  It can easily be opened by hand, it is possible to hang a bag on it to find the keys, but no effort can be made to it.  It remains only fomka - and this is hacking.

For those who do not know, the ‚Äúall-terrain vehicle‚Äù key is a tablet compatible with the iButton dallas protocol, delivering code ending in FF: FF: FF: FF.  Since the EFROM with the settings after erasing clogged FF, then this code in the database of keys is, the door opens.  In other words, this is just a program bug.  The second key is 00: 00: 00: 00, for strange cases where the memory is clogged with zeros.  The rest of the keys from the all-terrain vehicle kit are generally some kind of local keys suitable for any batch or set of installers.  In fact, it makes no sense to take them.  Treatment - contact the manufacturer.  In the case of the classic Metakom intercoms (MK2003), the simplest solution is to buy firmware from <a href="http://exikom.ru/content/view/22/31/">exikom.ru</a> , after which when you attach the all-terrain key, instead of opening, you will receive a sound confirming reading and refusing to take a pill. <br><br>  And most importantly - concierge.  I saw excellent concierges - who know where what happened in the stairwell, even without leaving their rooms.  And he saw concierges who do not even know who lives in the stairwell.  Everything is very dependent on the person.  And the only way is if the concierge works badly, it needs to be changed.  It may be worth collecting 10-50 rubles more from people, and raising the salary to find a concierge a little better.  In any case, these are monthly expenses, and not small.  For example, we have 92 apartments at the entrance.  To concierge was around the clock, according to the Labor Code there should be 4 jokes (24 * 30 = 720 hours per month = 160 hours per month per concierge = standard 40 hours per week).  If each pay 6,000 rubles a month, it turns after payroll taxes, operating expenses of the Criminal Code and another VAT from above - 500 rubles per apartment.  That is, almost twice as much as getting a concierge on his hands.  It is logical that after looking at these calculations, the neighbors slightly refuse.  Therefore, concierges are usually not counted. <br><br><h3>  CCTV, the basics </h3><br>  And here we come to the topic of our conversation: video surveillance.  What is the use of cameras if no one is watching them?  And if there are cameras, what's the use of them?  The correct answer to this question will help to persuade the neighbors to agree, and improve the situation.  The cameras have a certain psychological effect that motivates those who are generally adequate, but relaxed in life.  The main thing is not only cameras, but also ‚Äúvideo surveillance‚Äù tablets in prominent places.  However, if you rely only on this item - you can not hang the camera, and dummies.  It will cost less, but to sense as much.  And you can only sign. <br><br>  You need to look at the cameras.  But if there is no selected person, the presence of cameras becomes a burden for someone.  The reasoning ‚Äúsomething will happen - we will find on the record‚Äù is broken at the first ‚Äúsomething happened‚Äù.  Why?  First, because what happened "something" must be very large.  This is either robbery, or tangible vandalism, or theft.  In general, something that will cause not just a ‚Äúpancake, again‚Äù but ‚Äúit is necessary to understand‚Äù.  Secondly, as soon as you start to look for this something, it will be almost the first time when you get acquainted with the interface of the recorder.  That is, do not know where to poke what to watch.  And the most interesting - well, if the number will be known when it happened.  View the day on a regular DVR - you need to have a non-sour experience of viewing, otherwise it will be long, tedious and unsuccessful. <br><br>  Cameras must be of very good quality.  If you watch the cameras continuously - it can be any disgusting quality, because by noticing something happening, you can go out, startle and remember who it was.  If you watch what happened after 3-4 hours, then from the fact that a handful of gray pixels moved towards a handful of other gray pixels, you will not feel hot or cold.  Yes, of course, it is with this quality that our valiant police most often work, but you still need it, not the police.  If the police cannot do it, they will close the case by timeout, and you will be left with money thrown to the cameras in the air. <br><br>  Cameras should hang intelligently.  What is the use of the hanging camera, if the incoming person is visible only from the back at an angle of 100 degrees from the top?  By recording, it will be impossible to assess growth even, not what to find. <br><br>  If you collect video surveillance not only at the entrance, but entirely at home, then it is necessary to take into account not only human, but also automobile flows.  Cameras with wide-angle lenses are good for viewing, but the car numbers are not visible on them.  If the whole territory is covered so that the numbers are visible, the cameras will need a ton.  Therefore, in addition to covering the review of the surrounding areas, it is necessary to provide a speed bump on organized entrances and exits, and a camera well focused over it, as narrowly as possible, with good strong IR illumination.  Then the numbers and sizes of the cars will be clearly visible, so in which case, any of the cars of the yard will be identified. <br><br><h3>  Placement practice </h3><br>  In our house there is a unique architecture - 4 entrances, and all 4 are different in terms of internal geometry.  General only the presence of entrances on both sides of the house.  And in all but the first by 2 elevators and a separate entrance to the stairs.  Additionally, a large area between the houses (belonging to the cadastre of both houses, since it is all a single complex with underground parking).  At the same time - it is surrounded by driveways, so it is impossible to separate the territory with barriers and a fence.  Since the microdistrict is located in the center of the old building, there is a certain problem with drug addicts who got into the habit of hanging around, stealing little things from the entrance (like fire hydrants), as well as breaking all the little things (mailboxes, switches, ceiling lamps) in search of bookmarks.  All this translates into a considerable increase in the bill for minor repairs during the year, and simply reduces the comfort of living.  For some reason, it does not please you when you need to turn on the light with an accurate neat poke into the broken switch hanging on the wires.  The concierge was already in the stairwell, but before my arrival.  According to eyewitnesses, she was from a series of "shobbylo", her neighbors did not see, and her location in the entrance due to the two entrances is very inconvenient - she did not even see half of them passing.  Therefore, the effectiveness of the concierge corrected by abandoning it.  Do not change the same, in fact. <br><br>  Plan of the 1st floor (obtained by hymp from the plan of the remaining floors, so that some inaccuracies are present): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/90b/219/26e90b219b6a371beb49f1e87066cc9b.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚Äú1‚Äù mark is located on the side of the main entrance - there is a staircase + a ramp for wheelchairs, made by a ‚Äúsnake‚Äù with two bends.  Label "2" is on the back of the house, at the door on the stairs.  Street bullets with white illumination were placed at these points.  Most of the time, the backlight does not work, but if a light bulb burns out, then this is a backup street lighting.  Cameras based on T38F, work in 3mpix mode.  What is bad is that there is no WDR, so an illuminated area forms in the bright sun.  In principle, does not interfere. <br><br>  On the reverse side (2) of the house, everything seems to be all right - due to the position, the camera sees the face as coming (when climbing the stairs and when leaving the entrance).  But on the face (v.1) you can clearly see only the incoming ones.  All leaving - only from a back. <br><br>  Inside, there are three interesting points - two elevators (points A and C) and mailboxes (point B).  Unfortunately, the corridor in front of the concierge room and the concierge room itself remain out of sight of the cameras, but this is not critical - there is nothing interesting there, and both corridors are closed with cut-offs. <br><br>  Initially, I wanted to get by with two cameras - only points A and B, but the system did not prokanala - from point A the entrance to the elevator is not visible, moreover, in the case of cold, so that it does not see through, it happens that the doors are closed.  Therefore, in the end, the cameras had to put 3. Point A, in addition to the small elevator, also monitors the entrance to the stairs leading to the parking lot. <br><br>  The main problems of placing cameras inside are the limited view.  Even placing the camera in the corner, you need to take the widest possible lens - I have all the cameras with 2.8mm lenses.  Initially, the Chinese sent me an internal 4mm lens ‚Äúsince there are black corners at 2.8‚Äù, I had to change it to 2.8 myself (and then I just replaced the cameras). <br><br>  Since we are collecting a budget set, in addition to the cameras, we will need: 8-port switch, UTP-5 cable, power supply, connectors, crimping, perforator, cable boxes, distribution box, stepladder.  Since I collected everything at my own expense and exclusively at my place, I placed the power supply MDR6048 in the dashboard at the apartment, a gigabit 4x greenhouse comes out of the apartment, which is pulled down to the 1st floor.  from the source it goes down one more, for power supply, the voltage of the source is raised to 50V (to cover the voltage drop on 9 floors).  On the 1st floor above the same panel a large distribution box is installed, inside which the switch TL-SG1008P, powered directly from the 48V.  power for outdoor cameras comes from the PoE switch port, power to the internal cameras is thrown through the collective farm-PoE (passive splitter to empty pairs).  Although all 5 cameras that are installed now have a regular PoE module, ‚Äúit happened‚Äù while picking up the equipment :) <br><br>  From distribution boxes under the ceiling throw cable boxes to both exits.  Smaller distribution boxes are placed near the cameras, in which wires from the cameras are hidden, and camera connections to the network.  Also, PoE power adapters fit in them perfectly (48V =&gt; 9V). <br><br>  In principle, when transferring this household to the balance at home, you just need to place the server in a room with fire-fighting equipment, take power from there, and throw the power cable to the distribution box with the switch.  There is no sense in carrying the switch anywhere, as you still need to pull the connection to the other entrances through the basement, the easiest way to get from the shield is through the same low-current channels. <br><br>  Installation is done perfectly in one day by two people with a break without tension.  The main thing - to find power for the punch, or take a battery punch. <br><br>  Additionally (how it all began) the camera hangs at point C on my floor, which allows you to know exactly all the comers and departures, all renters, advertisers so as not to disturb in case of improper behavior of anybody too much. <br><br><h3>  Using </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af3/3f1/ef3/af33f1ef3029682fb071a495d5fe3d2b.png" align="right" width="400">  As I wrote above, cameras without viewing behind them are practically useless.  Therefore, it is necessary to properly organize a permanent view of everything that happens, but with a noticeable saving of their own time.  The trial and error method was used to create the following scheme of use, which gives the maximum profit with minimum costs: <br>  - everything is being recorded around the clock - this allows us not to lose anything important even at the edge of the camera‚Äôs view, which usually does not capture the motion detector; <br>  - on all cameras, motion detection works, marking the presence of movement on the timeline of viewing - this allows you to check a full day later if necessary, to find out when someone walked, etc.  quickly; <br>  - a long-stay detector is working on the platforms near the entrance doors - thus, any person who is at the door more than the average time will generate an alarm and a note in the archive subject to mandatory viewing; <br>  - if necessary, separate zones are added, movement in which causes additional triggering of alarm generation; <br>  - the camera on the floor generates tags to the archive for any movement, as well as generating an alarm when the behavior is atypical - entering the garbage chute (which does not work) and climbing your hands above the elevator cushions (the classic movement of the narco-rod). <br><br>  Of the necessary functions, however, the absence of which does not kill: <br>  - closing alarms with a mark (norms, false alarms, danger); <br>  - search by movement in the region (the varieties ‚Äútrajectory search‚Äù and ‚Äúsearch for clusters‚Äù turned out to be practically useless); <br>  - search for ‚Äúfind this person‚Äù (worked very well in macroscop ... very much right); <br>  - inter-camera tracking (a little tired of jumping on the cameras manually); <br>  - search by signs; <br>  - hotkeys (one mouse will not run up); <br>  - easy software upgrade (complete uninstallation then complete installation ... this is ... not at least habrow-like). <br><br>  As a result, during the day I spend 5-10 minutes on fast gliding active alarms, marking them as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse alarms‚Äù.  If something interesting is found, export is immediately made from the archive of the event itself, it is searched for ‚Äúhow it came‚Äù and ‚Äúhow it left‚Äù and other details, a corresponding statement is generated, a frame is sent and a statement is sent to the appropriate authorities.  And if even the detector in Axxon worked as it should (and how they promise that it will work in version 4), then it took two to three times less time than now ... <br><br>  Unfortunately, none of the software packages tested at the moment did not allow to fully implement the entire method of use.  Currently almost completely covers the needs of Axxon Next from ITV, and, in theory, everything allows you to implement Trassir from DSSL.  Axxon Next is still actively used, Trassir is installed and configured in parallel.  After the final choice, I will describe in a separate post my experience of using various software, communicating with their technical support, pros and cons with this use.  If anyone has any other software in mind that can allow to implement all the above mentioned points at once - report in a comment or a LAN.  If there is an opportunity to also provide a test key, it‚Äôs quite good, however, if you want such a harmful tester as me, this is another question. <br><br><h3>  Practical results </h3><br>  Oddly enough, but after installing the cameras, even the number of drug addicts in the stairwell was much less.  Although this did not happen immediately, but after about three applications for junkies, reeling on the floor (even before installing the cameras on the 1st floor). <br><br>  By the way, about the statements.  For maximum efficiency, the application must be taken live to the ward.  However, I am lazy, so almost everything is sent from sites.  This is longer for 2-3 days before the start of the cases on the application, but do not go anywhere, but the result is the same.  A good statement should contain only facts.  Any speculation (for example, found in VKontakte "etazhdeti" should go with the mark "presumably ..." or "in my opinion." This immediately simplifies the work of operatives - which facts should be checked first of all, which in the last. If something you can clarify it yourself (name of the advertising company, child‚Äôs contact address or something else) - apply immediately. The more information in the application, the greater the chance that it will be considered first, since it requires less effort to disclose;) Immediately make freeze frames with key informa  tions - faces, actions, full-length silhouette, etc. The video is the most difficult to attach to the application (they need to download it, write it to a disk, file it, review it, etc.), but the video is still not proof therefore, a good set of freeze frames often again reduces the amount of work, and the ‚Äúthreshold of entry at the beginning of processing‚Äù.  Another moment - when you write what happened, write the date, time and actions as if you were watching it personally.  Then, instead of ‚Äúvideotaping‚Äù, there is a concrete witness to the action, which, if necessary, is evidence, in contrast to the mere fact of recording on non-certified equipment. <br><br>  Typical addicts: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVx9neBW2kA8">one</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNOJXWiLbIio">two</a> . <br><br>  But with the cameras on the 1st floor too, it was more interesting.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dzlt5QvetSbc">Input-output</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlSa81_5qz4U">their behavior inside</a> .  The cameras here were with a 4mm lens, so the review inside is disgusting, but quite sufficient.  The statement to the police was sent, the answer came quite interesting: they could not establish the identity, but they could not talk to a young man named Denis ... <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvciO8NK6NbA">But the lovely person</a> who called to different apartments to enter the intercom.  Called me too.  Turned out to be creative!  They said that in such an apartment (floor below), and that the intercom tablet does not work.  Someone did let him go, and they came ... To my floor.  Check the battery.  They took off her casing, and there they were carefully searched.  Not found, sir.  Considering that the same evening they came for the same girls (at 23:30 they called the random apartment and let them in!), Clearly some kind of drug dealer threw them: D <br>  We were pleased with the reaction of the district ‚ÄúOh!  I know this!  She's not a drug addict!  Although stop.  Her sister is a drug addict ... ‚Äù <br><br>  "This is the".  Out of boredom, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyKb6ZU_tqV8">walking kids</a> expropriated a tray with the ground from their neighbors on the 1st floor (after passing through the ledge into 1 tile wide at the height of the 2nd floor) and scattered about it.  Why they did it - it is not clear.  The IDN did not receive a response from them, but the suggestion was made. <br><br>  "This is # 2".  Children have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAuXFVvT9Pbw">little different fun</a> .  Squeezed out the window.  The juvenile inspector was told that they were ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù and ‚Äúcrawled to warm themselves‚Äù.  Let's say.  The window is planted on screws tightly.  What is remarkable is that the man who had been renting an apartment on our floor with his child for several days put the window in place. <br><br>  Hardest of all, of course, straining <a href="">such frames</a> .  Lifts are not a bulletin board.  Complaints to the FAS, of course, refer immediately.  I am glad that companies apologize, they ask to name the addresses, to fix them, they say that this is a personal advertising initiative of the company ... However, they have not removed any of these advertisements.  So at first I felt a little guilty for applying to the FAS ... And now I'm just waiting for it to be processed.  FAS work very slowly - 2-3 months on average processing a single application. <br><br>  Well, the hit of the season - the <a href="">theft of the stroller.</a>  Comrades simply annealed - first came, went around all the floors.  An hour later, they returned, entered, stolen, one of them changed the jacket on the other side, and carried it out on the other side.  The main joke - after checking out, the young one said, ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs a camera.‚Äù  And they all turned their heads in the camera.  In general, the stroller found, and returned.  As the investigators said, if not for the record, they could not find it.  And so, they were not looking for a wheelchair, but specifically for the dealers - one has three convictions ... In general, they did not believe in the cell ... <br><br>  Bonus - the answer is "why they did not believe in the camera."  <a href="">The</a> police usually work <a href="">with such</a> videos.  Well, that is, when I brought the video to the local police officer, he was glad ‚Äúoh, what quality‚Äù, but I was ashamed - it was blurred, the focus was not accurate ... I saw the usual recording, I calmed down. <br><br><h3>  Costing </h3><br>  Prices are at the time of order and purchase of all used components. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/291020500.html">Outdoor cameras</a> = ~ 13500 with EMS delivery.  If you order at the current price of the lot (&lt;$ 90), note that this is a camera in the same package but on a different module.  Therefore, ask in the comments that the camera was on DaVinci - it is more expensive, but it is worth it.  <b>update</b> : recently there have been frequent cases of marriage from this seller). <br>  <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/6003703302.html">Internal cameras</a> = ~ 17000 with EMS delivery <br>  Source MDR6048 - 729.16 rub <br>  Switch TL-SG1008P - 2580 rubles <br>  Fastening of outdoor cameras on the wall - 2 * 210 rub <br>  UTP-5 cable (100m) - 620 + 630 rub <br>  Distribution boxes - 5 * 50 rubles <br>  Distribution box large.  - 250 rubles <br>  Cable channels = ~ 700 rub <br>  Dowel, screws = ~ 50 rub <br>  Two lost drills = ~ 200 rubles (one is immortalized in a wall, one is bent) <br><br>  As a server, there is a homely old unnecessary systemic, but I had to upgrade it: <br>  AMD Phenom II X6 1100T processor = 4500 rub <br>  Hard disk on 3Tb under the archive = 4300 rubles <br><br>  So, everything for one trip to the circle cost me 45,800. Well, by the way, if you ordered not by EMS, but by regular mail, plus now the cameras are noticeably cheaper, so now it would be about 10k cheaper at the expense of the cameras. <br><br>  Another of the costs turned out to be a license for Macroscop for two channels = 7,500 rubles (by the way, if I sell, if anyone needs it, it turned out that it does not suit me). <br>  Fortunately, the comrades from <a href="http://ipeye.ru/">IPEye</a> fitted me with internal cameras (at the same time, thanks for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/219537/">editing tcpfix</a> and for the test, my hands grow from where ‚Äî bugs only go), so I‚Äôm selling old internal cameras and I‚Äôm happy to sell them ( at current prices), if anyone needs a camera based on 53H20L.  In principle, with the latest firmware, they have only two problems left - a problem on TCP (I could not fix them, as there is too much to do), and 8.33 fps with insufficient lighting (even with disabled WDR / AGC / etc / etc). <br><br><h3>  Future plans </h3><br>  It is necessary to cover the entrances and exits of 3 more entrances, organize the registration of the entire auto flow at both entrances, and capture the playgrounds and parking on both sides of the house.  But the expansion is planned only after the final selection of software, and the search for those responsible for monitoring in other entrances.
