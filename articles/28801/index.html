You can argue that all this can be done in a much easier and more accessible Movie Maker program, and you will be right, but the essence of the article is to BEGIN to use Sony Vegas, gradually moving to such things that Movie Maker never dreamed of. <br><br>  Open Sony Vegas (in my case - Sony Vegas Pro 8.0).  Its interface does not look very complicated, it is not.  At the bottom of a large field, there will be located audio and video tracks.  There may be a lot of them, that is, one video can be played against the background of another, all of which is framed by background music and sound effects.  Now there is not a single track, so let's make a new video track.  Video - because the picture or the inscription acts as a video in this program. <br><img title="01" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/01.jpg" width="312" height="232"><br>  New track created and it is empty.  It's time to insert ... I think you need to start with the title.  There are several options, in the end you can insert a picture (just drag the file from anywhere in sony vegas into this track), but this only matters in some cases.  If you want to insert text and just text, then I suggest the following. <br><br>  Select the place where the title will be on the track, right-click on the newly selected one and select Insert Generated Media.  Next, choose Sony ProType Tittler - this is a convenient way to create all sorts of inscriptions.  Double click on the large black field - and now we enter the text: <br><img title="02" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/02.jpg" width="500" height="265"><br>  Entering the text, you need to press 'Esc' and we will be able to move and resize it as we want.  On the left - the parameters, I think they are familiar to you, even if not - just move the sliders and you will immediately understand their purpose.  By the way, the text can be entered in several lines and change the parameters of each segment separately, that is, we can easily do this: <br><img title="03" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/03.jpg" width="500" height="360"><br>  As soon as you have finished inserting the text (let's talk about any effects and additional settings next time), just close this window.  Now on our video track there is the first video - a few seconds of text.  It would be great if this title slowly appeared from the darkness to the music and disappeared just as slowly.  Make it easy. <br><img title="04" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/04.jpg" width="187" height="79"><br>  This video segment has blue triangles in the upper corners.  If you hover the mouse cursor over them, it (the cursor) will turn into ... Ahem ... I can hardly explain the resulting geometric object, but you will immediately understand - drag this blue triangle to the side and get something like this: <br><img title="05" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/05.jpg" width="207" height="100"><br>  It turned out smooth lines.  These lines show the appearance and disappearance of the clip.  It is very easy to regulate them - you can make another speed or another place for the end / beginning of such an effect. <br><br>  Well, now the second part of our desire is ‚Äúto the music‚Äù!  Paste any audio file as easy as dragging it from anywhere into the Sony Vegas window onto the track field.  If there is no track, it will be created automatically. <br><br>  The audio file can also be ‚Äúdarkened‚Äù - slowly increasing the speed up to a certain point.  This is done in the same way. <br><img title="06" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/06.jpg" width="500" height="160"><br>  I think you already understand what is happening here.  Music slowly grows, a heading appears a little faster from the darkness, then disappears, the music continues to play.  All these actions take seconds, but in the end we have a pleasant start. <br><br>  Well, let's finally get to the video series itself!  Drag the video file to the same track where we have the title.  The audio part of it will fall on the lower audio track, but we do not need such a layering, so take the audio from the freshly-laid clip and drag it a little lower - the new track will automatically appear. <br><img title="07" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/07.jpg" width="500" height="228"><br>  I propose to do the following: the title slowly ‚Äúturns‚Äù into a video, at this moment the music calms down, then to play again by the end of the video. <br><br>  To begin with, we‚Äôll reduce the duration of the title a bit - just drag this clip by the end, while the blackout at the end will remain intact.  Then "dragging" the video to the title and impose one on another.  It will look like this: <br><img title="08" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/08.jpg" width="337" height="232"><br>  In the yellow rectangle that appears when moving, the number is shown - 1:00 - one second.  This is the period of time when one video turns into another, a kind of smooth transition and it lasts one second.  Naturally, you can drag and increase or decrease this period. <br><br>  Now you need to mute the music at the time of the video.  To do this, place the cursor approximately where it is located in the screenshot above, the second track should be highlighted (for this, place the cursor by clicking on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe second track, that is, directly on the red music file) and press "s".  This will split our file into two pieces.  Do not be afraid, nothing will happen to him physically, but for Sony Vegas these two halves now play the role of separate files and all their parameters, starting from the position, can be changed independently of each other.  This is what we will use.  I'll just show a screenshot, and you should already understand what happened. <br><img title="09" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/09.jpg" width="452" height="233"><br>  One small touch: the scale of the video clip (the lowest track) would be better to make the same appearance and fade effect, parallel to the opposite effects when you stop and continue the music. <br><img title="ten" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/10.jpg" width="196" height="154"><br>  Well, let's go further.  I want to, after the continuation of the song, we watched another video that will accelerate, then slow down.  Such is the "vzhzhzhzh-vzhzhzhzhzh" effect. <br><br>  We insert the video, we don‚Äôt need the sound from this video, so the audio part will need to set the volume to 0. To do this, move the mouse cursor to the upper border of the audio file and drag it down.  Next, we divide the video into 4-5 pieces, we already know this operation.  Total: <br><img title="eleven" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/11.jpg" width="500" height="172"><br>  Now we will deal with freshly cut pieces.  As you can see, I have 4 of them - two of them are short and two are long.  Short we will slow down, long - accelerate.  To make it easier is simple - you just need to change their size (familiar to us by dragging one end) while holding the Ctrl key. <br><br>  By the way, did I say that scrolling with the mouse will zoom in and out?  Not?  Hmm ... well worth it, because it is very convenient. <br><img title="12" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/12.jpg" width="500" height="165"><br>  Increasing the scale, we see such a picture.  That video, which has a changed tempo, has such lightning - stretched if the recording is slowed down, compressed - if accelerated.  Pretty clear! <br><br>  You know, I want to finish this uncomplicated clip by the fact that the picture slowly loses its color, turns into black and white, and then finally disappears.  Create a new video track.  She will appear at the top.  Take the last piece of the video, with the Ctrl clamped dragging to another place on the new track, so that they match perfectly.  Pull, as you understand, you need for the video itself, as during normal movement, and not abroad, as when changing speed.  Hold down the Ctrl key will turn the move into copying. <br><br>  Now apply our usual blackout: the top copy of the video should appear from the darkness, and the bottom one should disappear.  Now we‚Äôll go to the Fideo FX tab, select Black and White -&gt; 100% Black and White and drag this effect to the top copy of the video: <br><img title="13" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/13.jpg" width="500" height="342"><br>  Now the final touch - the upper copy of the video needs to be cut off from the left end a bit, just drag the left border to the right as you see fit - the speed of transition to a black and white picture depends on it. <br><br>  That's all!  That's all for today, but in general there are a lot of interesting things ahead.  The resulting video file can be downloaded from the <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/1376063000/podcastim_video_lesson.avi.html">people disk</a> , it is absolutely meaningless, the video and music were randomly selected, as you know, this is not the main thing today.  The main thing is to understand how close each of you is from idea to realization. <br><br>  See you later! <br><br>  <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/07/montazh-videopodkasta-v-sony-vegas/">Original on Podkastim.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28801/</a></p>
