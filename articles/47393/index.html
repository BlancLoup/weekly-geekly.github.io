  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reality show "Startup for the week." Post before starting weekly work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  What's happening? </h2><br>  As I wrote in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/47201/">first post, the</a> first (ie, zero) days we will carry out the organizational work, then we rest half a day, gain strength and begin the week of work.  I hope that all comments criticizing our planned holiday appeared because of accidental carelessness or reading not from the beginning.  If this is determined, go further.  If you have not decided, tell me about it.  We deliberately organized all the possibilities (broadcasting to a bunch of blogs, twitter, RSS) to monitor the progress of work, so that you, dear colleagues, would be comfortable reading and writing, of course, because  we are ready to take into account all the wishes of the organization, the process of work and the startup itself.  I don‚Äôt get tired of thanking for the suggestions already made, together we will make this startup a thousand times more interesting and useful than if we did it ourselves, and then we‚Äôll roll out the result. <br><br><h2>  What's happened? </h2><br>  Zero days were interesting, fruitful and overstrained.  The process of work and the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup give great pleasure, but at the same time, as it turned out, working in this mode and environment is quite complex and primarily psychologically (for a long time being in the same room, with the same people, each has his own character, your habits and worldview).  Theoretically, we can withstand the stated 168 hours of continuous work, working in shifts (some sleep, others work, then change, or continue working together).  If for you, colleagues, it is basically waiting for your comments.  But after the rehearsal days and feedback, it became clear to you that in order to preserve the productivity of work, you need to sleep and alternate your line of work and breathe fresh air.  Therefore, the 2nd version of the work - the longest time to work, but to comply with the sleep mode, go outside to change the situation, air for half an hour / hour and again for work.  It can be summed up that the first option is for the sake of a reality show, and the second for the result of the work.  Waiting for feedback about what is more interesting to you. <br><br><h2>  What will happen? </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today (December 20) at 12 o'clock in the afternoon we meet and begin work on a startup. <br>  Let's start with prescribing the concept of an idea, defining a business model, analyzing the market and competitors.  Perhaps we will have time to determine the methods of promotion and the need for investments (respectively, defining the types of expenses). <br>  In the process, we will create a schedule of "going on the air" (thanks to <a href="http://yurganov.habrahabr.ru/">Yurganov</a> for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/47284/">idea</a> ).  Approximately 1-3 times a day we will post about the results and plans, in an hour or two to go online again and collect feedback (thanks to <a href="http://ooprizrakoo.habrahabr.ru/">Alexey</a> for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/47284/">idea</a> ).  This means that we will turn off the Internet and other ways of communicating with the outside world (again, the idea expressed by <a href="http://yurganov.habrahabr.ru/">Yurganov</a> , thanked him for his karma). <br><h4>  Broadcast: </h4><br>  + <b>Text</b> : The <a href="http://startupweek.ru/">blog is</a> running, the project logo (reality show) has not yet been drawn, so the cap is temporary.  <a href="http://twitter.com/startupweek">Twitter is</a> configured, but apparently due to disconnect will be broadcast on schedule.  So far, further, taking into account the proposals and experience will be seen. <br>  + <b>Audio</b> : Let's write down the most important / interesting discussions on the recorder and lay out until I know if there will be a lot of them (after all, we‚Äôll have to spend time picking on some spicy moments :), but we promise one for sure. <br>  + <b>Video</b> : The most expected, I guess at what exactly.  Live video broadcast is questionable, because  the channel is not thick enough, there will be webcams, but negotiations are still under way on the hardware and the resource through which the broadcast will take place.  With a regular camera, you can shoot short video clips about the results and upload them to your blog.  But here again, as with audio, it is laborious and distracts from the main occupation.  Therefore, one is guaranteed to try hard :)

    <h4>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup: </h4><br>  We really want to keep the intrigue at least a little, so we‚Äôll tell the idea a bit later.  Of course, because of our decision to lay out all the working information for a long time to keep the idea in a cert not succeed, but we will try. <br><br><h4>  The announcement of the nearest posts </h4>  (the order is not taken into account): the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup;  analytics of the target audience, market, competitors, etc .;  in brief about the project participants. <br>  The next airing is in a day (tomorrow at 12:00).  Fidbek on this post we will collect in 3 hours.  I will also be online for another half an hour (until 11:30), I will have time to answer something. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and interest. <br><br>  <b>UPD1</b> : <b>Disconnect</b> and start working.  Let's hit the road! <br>  <b>UPD2</b> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/47444/">fasting 2nd day</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47393/</a></p>
