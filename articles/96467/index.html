I hasten to share with you the joy about my yesterday's DIY ... I feel that now I have five minutes to come, Cameroon, because I already have a camera for a long time, and I created the binocular viewfinder yesterday, and I am in a hurry to share it with you ... <br><br>  This fancy device makes it possible to observe a three-dimensional image from the video cameras connected to it, which, in turn, is necessary not only by the roulette wheel, but to see the scene being shot and build it relative to the screen plane, as well as visually assess the optical axes of the cameras or convergence (if I need it for some reason.) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I was inspired by the Soviet stereo 70 movie cameras, when I was able to try it with a special lens with an adjustable base and a binocular viewfinder at one stereo movie workshop, I literally fell in love with this thing. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a43/fa8/22f/a43fa822f327dee5dd49e01f6170634b.jpg" align="right"><br>  It seems to be a simple thing, but how convenient is it, compared to a bad tradition during stereo filming, you can use any dual monitors with a translucent mirror to monitor, you can put cameras on stereo riga on them, but this gives a very remote idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe effect depth in the real cinema , so the depth tables for the modern stereo consultant have become something of a holy Quran. <br>  I have long wanted to collect a set of equipment for stereo filming for myself, so that I could exercise enough with it, because the production of stereo movies differs in many ways from the usual views of the cameraman.  There are many questions, both compositional and psychological, because this is no longer a flat picture, but a piece of living space, and the screen plane that separates it has tremendous psychological significance.  For example, by taking the ‚Äúeight‚Äù dialogues, we can arrange this plane between interlocutors, or behind the listener, on the plane it is indifferent, in stereo it affects the perception of the dialogue by the viewer, like the size of the plan in a flat movie ... <br>  In general, forgive me dear% Username%, confusion of presentation, because my brain is in full swing with the opening opportunities, although I still have a lot to do in this direction. <br>  Would you be interested in reading about it? <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/zemskovd/view/258195/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4aa/22c/e12/4aa22ce1230d543de7bcbc1dfbba06de.jpg" width="500" height="460" align="right"></a> <br>  I made the stereo viewfinder from the two standard viewfinders from Sony video cameras, despite the difference in appearance, they are exactly the same inside.  From them comes a four-pin cable: + 5V, Earth, Video, LED. <br>  On the electronic part everything seems to be simple.  But it turned out that it was not at all easy to fix all this household, so that when the video signal was applied to both tubes, the picture would be reduced and appear in the plane of the screen.  The fact is that due to any manufacturing tolerances, the screens are not quite perpendicular to the plane of the viewfinder, well, and the size of the case is different.  Plus, I am not at all skillful in modeling, and naively thought that it would be enough to blind the guide gasket between the tubes, a naive idiot, I waited for twenty minutes until the polymorphus hardened, holding the tubes with my hands, and looking whether the picture had gone astray.  From time to time I would call my wife to include a video camera that was being cut down on timeout, which showed me the tuning table, and all in vain ... <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/zemskovd/view/258189/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/949/379/126/949379126ab45cec6b7e93f2ee12a277.jpg" align="right" width="500" height="281"></a> <br>  As a result, it dawned on me that you first need to wrap the tubes with polymorphus and let it freeze, and then, heating the corresponding sides with a blow dryer, put it on the base blank, install the partition, and only then reduce it when the polymorphus has cooled.  Having achieved a clear picture in the plane of the screen, I carefully disconnected the wires, and put them to cool in the fridge and lo and behold, everything worked out!

      Having connected two cameras and ‚Äúlooking out the window‚Äù with an increased basis, I realized that I don‚Äôt regret money for Kodak soap dishes and polymorphus, and I don‚Äôt feel sorry for disassembled cameras either, although I really expected a higher viewfinder permissions ... <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/zemskovd/view/258191/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36c/9d8/6c5/36c9d86c56d373282ab4011ce14979f8.jpg" width="800" height="302"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96467/</a></p>
