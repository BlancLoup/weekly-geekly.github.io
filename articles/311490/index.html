    <h3>  Whip or Gingerbread </h3><br>  To be a leader, you need to find your approach to people, sometimes to take an individual approach to different employees.  The eternal dilemma, which is better: a stick or gingerbread.  Need to make your choice.  It is better to combine these two approaches.  I am categorically against using only a soft approach (the carrot), because people around you will take you lightly and as a result, what you say will not always be heard and not fulfilled. <br><br>  In the work done, there will almost always be flaws.  As a manager, you are expected to receive competent comments, the addition of requirements for the implementation of further work. <br><br><h3>  Work with young employees, students </h3><br>  Obviously, new young employees are not always entrusted with serious responsible work.  But your task, as a manager, is to present the task of execution in such a way as to arouse interest and a sense of responsibility among your wards.  And then the young will have this amazing feeling: ‚ÄúI am participating in a real project!‚Äù <br><br>  If you misrepresent yourself, even performing a rather serious and real work, an employee may feel unnecessary in this project, which can lead either to a decrease in labor productivity due to lack of enthusiasm, or to dismissal.  One another is no better. <br><br>  However, do not overdo it with this feeling ‚ÄúI am participating in a real project,‚Äù since the CSW of young people can rise critically, but here a ‚Äústick‚Äù comes to the rescue. <br><br><h3>  Oratory </h3><br>  Heads love the ears.  When a person can express his thought competently and intelligibly, and even dilute <s>but not mix</s> his speech with relevant jokes or life stories - this is fascinating. <br><br>  To win the trust and respect of your employees, try to give lectures, seminars.  But in this case there are two possible outcomes: either you will show yourself well by winning favor, or you will disappoint the crowd, which can significantly aggravate the situation. <br><br><h3>  How to take the first steps if the moment does not turn up for the manifestation of your leadership qualities </h3><br>  There is a golden rule that I follow: do not go to a foreign monastery with your charter, if the charter is already there.  Sometimes people in a team seem to be working together on the same project, but it seems that most of them are single developers.  It is here that you can show yourself <s>in all its glory</s> , but only on condition that you can competently organize everything.  You can be heard even by older colleagues, if your opinion is really worth something.  It is necessary to understand that people must also be emotionally suited to each other, it will not work out to rally everyone.  It is important not to overdo it with the number of people: too much - there can be problems with organization, too little - the amount of work will be stifled. <br><br>  If you can assemble your mini-team, unite developers to solve one problem, then this is already a success, some experience <s>and a plus to your precious karma</s> , despite the fact that you do not formally occupy a management position. <br><br>  Leaders do not always have a crowd of admirers, often there are those who do not approve of their actions or the measures they take, but at the same time there are leaders who you respect and perceive as the driving force of your team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311490/</a></p>
