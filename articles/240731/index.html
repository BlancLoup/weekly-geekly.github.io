So, the regular vacation season has come to an end together with which, we bring a lot of impressions, positive emotions, tan, well, as always, I can not tear myself away from the cash world on the other side of the border and therefore, as always, I offer you a small report about how they live box office. <br><br>  So, this time my way lay on the popular places on the route of.  Mallorca - Madrid - Barcelona in Spain.  These places are pretty traveled by tourists and from there photos of famous sights are walking around the Internet, but for me they are different and as always I take photos of other places that interest me most. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Mallorca </h2><br>  By the way, what is worth noting, in tourist places, unlike if I just traveled around the cities, just a cloud of all sorts of different box offices.  On all about.  Mallorca, just at every step the SPAR mini-stores mainly use these portable cash registers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cc/5da/745/1cc5da74578646d1b1a39ce0e3ae3612.jpg" alt="portable cash registers"><br><br><br>  Walking around the island.  We go to the supermarket.  What we see?  We see a regular monitor with a checkout scale and a regular customer display: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c8/484/eae/8c8484eaebb24b65990e84cd652eb723.jpg" alt="customer display"><br><br><br>  I wonder what the interface looks like?  Everything is as usual: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44f/9cd/cb1/44f9cdcb1aba4f939206e6305b50ae1c.jpg" alt="cash program interface"><br><br><br>  We'll stop by the Majorica jewelry store and see what they have there with the cash registers.  Everything is also quite simple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/ff6/340/781ff6340b8b42a795b6c8d0bec03f94.jpg"><br><br><br>  Let's go back to the supermarkets.  On the whole island, besides the aforementioned SPAR supermarkets, I often met the shops of the local company ESKO.  I happened to be in England and Finland, and so, respectively, in England there are stores of the TESCO chain, and in Finke - KESKO, now we add to the collection and ESCO. <br><br>  It looks like a regular cash desk with a keyboard.  And it seems as if the customer‚Äôs display is turned in the direction of the cashier, but where is the cashier‚Äôs display? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/b54/850/521b54850f3d4bea998998fed834dd7f.jpg" alt="cashier keyboard"><br><br><br>  ABOUT!  Here he is!  Just hid on a black system unit with a cash drawer and receipt printer.  Well, there is a big disappointment ahead ... more on that further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b20/4f4/639/b204f46390cf4e519dc59b29502a2f2e.jpg" alt="receipt printer"><br><br><br>  Let's inspect the accuracy of twisting the wires.  As you can see everything is in order: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/7cd/c30/3b97cdc306e440c3bc7b95614c3813f9.jpg"><br><br><br>  We walk further to the store.  Let's see the price tags.  In principle, no surprises: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c1/0dd/1ea/7c10dd1eaaff45dda6119f32a68e6f4a.jpg" alt="price tags"><br><br><br>  Self-service scales are fairly standard, except that there is a plate with a picture of fruits and vegetables on top: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b81/e8b/bf2/b81e8bbf2d3b4519907bf88b0bb6e48a.jpg" alt="trading scales"><br><br><br>  I already wrote to you that you will be disappointed.  Well, I do not know about you, me for sure.  Remember, I said that I found the cashier's display, all my hopes came to an end, when I went to buy at the cashier.  So, meet: customer display single-line-two-line!  It would seem that there is a place to draw some beautiful interface for the buyer a lot, or even to make a font on more ideas did not arise, so it will do.  And where is the cashier's display then? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ae/46c/b35/1ae46cb35460481b936e6c47ec5c82fa.jpg" alt="customer display"><br><br><br>  And here he is.  The role of the cashier's display, just plays a device that should be for the buyer.  Of course, many of you who were, for example, in Auchan, also saw such a thing.  So here it is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/876/cc9/838/876cc9838ab64a8ba87afa3cdd25de69.png"><br><br><br>  Let's walk now on the tourist streets, where they sell all sorts of things and see what they have at the ticket office.  There are such raznosort that I just ran eyes. <br><br>  Simple interfaces: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05f/7a2/cf8/05f7a2cf86234cbcb8acea1bffb27374.png" alt="cash program"><br><br><br>  Simple ticket office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26d/368/b62/26d368b625bc4ca4a6a579cc74178016.jpg" alt="ticket office"><br><br><br>  Sometimes come across and tachi: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e0/abd/3b5/0e0abd3b50514e47955044caf6ff39a6.jpg" alt="pos system"><br><br><br>  And sometimes just computers with scales: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a1/243/918/6a12439182b948eb9441f484d6dca6ca.jpg" alt="pos terminal"><br><br><br><h2>  Madrid </h2><br>  Well, enough of the island exotics, let's move now to the capital of Spain - Madrid.  What can meet here?  Cashier with Micros fingerprint identification: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4f/3d0/2c0/f4f3d02c048e45b7891883f6c5846998.jpg" alt="pos terminal"><br><br><br>  Well check out the shops in Madrid?  - No no.  We will go to a place cooler - to the San Miguel market! <br><br>  There are dark inhabitants with dark blue interfaces: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d30/853/944/d3085394492a48f8a6c84d764c4d397e.png" alt="pos terminal"><br><br><br>  There is just an ASUS with the usual interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/98d/1e1/26c98d1e11cb4bdd83c7eac3867db1aa.png" alt="pos terminal"><br><br><br>  There are tachovo-button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/cd0/d1e/d33cd0d1e8f54da69b9a54968fbc94b8.png" alt="pos terminal"><br><br><br>  There is everyone's favorite Bizerba.  It was not by chance that I focused attention on the Bizerba scales.  And why?  Let's go further in the market ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfe/4ce/b02/cfe4ceb0272847f9b71c55e76809bdd5.jpg" alt="Libra"><br><br><br>  I go further and see just such a thing: on many shelves a cash drawer is connected to the scales and stands next to them.  The seller weighs the goods, the amount is considered, a check-type label protrudes from the weights and the drawer comes off.  Maybe someone saw this somewhere, but this is my first time.  Hehe: scales box office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/b34/546/29eb345468e74f0cbbd2cbae1608a3a9.png"><br><br><br>  Let us now take a closer look at this miracle of technology.  Let's approach the same Bizerb, but already suspended: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b3/b0d/bed/3b3b0dbed6e24b659ba660ee03482b29.jpg"><br><br><br>  And we see that the basic interface of the scales is altered under the cash regime.  As you can see, there are even drawings with bills.  Here is such a market automation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1f/19f/6c7/f1f19f6c71d04882b1d32c3d323901e7.jpg"><br><br><br>  Lets go through Madrid further and look into the rest of the shops. <br><br>  Somewhere everything is standard in Wincor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ce/851/250/9ce85125038842bf8c09f60068990e0c.jpg" alt="cash equipment"><br><br><br>  And somewhere IBM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/af8/36b/9c1af836b4b04338b982284d253cf5c8.jpg" alt="cash program"><br><br><br>  Interfaces with large buttons from GESPOS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a39/a84/d3f/a39a84d3f68d4ee1b926ff3dd71c253e.jpg" alt="cash program"><br><br><br>  And sometimes they even become purple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/85d/7cc/b5785d7cc3604332b07b52f7e984bb1d.jpg" alt="cash program"><br><br><br>  By the way, another feature that I met in Spain, in many stores, and especially in tourist places, is always a killer arsenal of banking terminals.  At least 3 is always there: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2c/cbb/cc2/a2ccbbcc2ef6464e87a373a50c9f95e2.png" alt="pinpad"><br><br><br>  Where there is one banking terminal one by one, but tachevomu: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ac/25b/8b5/5ac25b8b5edc4706879eb7dcb89dc933.jpg"><br><br><br>  But it's time to leave Madrid and go to the airport.  Yes, by the way, somehow I always avoided the ticket office at the airports, an unforgivable gap.  We make up.  Today, the box office of the Madrid airport Barajas.  In one of the Duty Free there is a standard Wincor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc8/3e9/548/cc83e9548e7f48f8b6363a70741cd53b.jpg" alt="wincor nixdorf"><br><br><br>  Well, these are all standard cash registers.  Let's go to one of the racks of the food court before departure and order a seagull.  And we see that many cafes have Cash Dro 4 self-service cash payment devices. That is: they poured you tea, gave you food.  Then, if you pay with a card, then the cashier does the operation, but if in cash, then please use this unit yourself, which itself will calculate the change.  By the way, all this is done to ensure that the hands of the cashier, who at the cafe behind the counter also simultaneously impose sterile food, without touching the dirty bills.  Hehe, you might think microbes will not crawl from the map: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/d94/e4b/4e3d94e4bc254a8197e4686469884f2b.jpg"><br><br><br>  We walk further along the airport.  Head over to some inconspicuous appliance store voila, what are we seeing?  There is a price checker that I haven‚Äôt come across in Spain yet.  It looks like a tablet with a barcode scanner insert below it.  Check: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/f5f/31b/e38f5f31b2a44dc3bc912c3bc0d8db28.jpg"><br><br><br>  Oh what is it?  Crystal ???  - Wow!  Well, that, we will check up, how the local Crystal does software! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/854/106/547/8541065470c64682ba8840015a8aaf7b.png"><br><br><br><h3>  Test 1 </h3><br>  Barcode scanning.  I‚Äôll say right away that, unfortunately, there is nothing to portray here, because when I scanned the barcode, this device didn‚Äôt react at all.  FAILED! <br><br><br><h3>  Test 2 </h3><br>  Well, since there is already a manual barcode input mode, let's try this.  The letters at the top of the screen for some reason sit on each other.  I am trying to enter the first two digits of my barcode looking for something, but not that.  Okay, click on any product: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/acd/b33/bdeacdb337844c5491b276b9e0e54bc6.png"><br><br><br>  So, at the top of us we solemnly announce the inscription ‚Äúyou selected product‚Äù at 399.00EUR, the number of pieces remaining in stock 3. But I wonder what kind of STE I chose for 399EURO.  Shop surprises! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76f/f7d/f6f/76ff7df6f3cb42a8b46949d9ad93142e.jpg"><br><br><br>  Yes, by the way, here there are also buttons Prodcut Video and Product Images.  But clicking on them, the device also did not perform any actions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/d34/2fa/c2ed342faac5421f8c38121d1ec4705a.png"><br><br><br>  Then there was a funny dialogue with the seller of the store: <br><br>  Seller: Do you want to know the price of this item? <br>  Me: Yes, I tried to scan the SK and enter it manually, but nothing works. <br>  Seller: Let me tell you the price. <br>  I: I understand, but I want to know the detailed information about the price and characteristics through this device and it behaves incomprehensibly. <br>  Seller: Why do you need this device because I am there. <br>  Me: And if I was not alone? <br>  Seller: Well, yes, it does not work, just until it weighs so much, it was recently hanged. <br>  (A curtain). <br><br><h2>  Next we go to the popular tourist city - Barcelona </h2><br>  Let's enter the first supermarket.  The same trend, but already the same, that for the cashier and for the buyer are almost identical devices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e61/8f4/59b/e618f459b32a45dd89645db9be059cb1.jpg"><br><br><br>  Scales Metler Toledo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/994/dea/488/994dea48803748a5b4a76fa757103f55.jpg"><br><br><br>  Twist the wires neat: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd2/64a/eb8/bd264aeb8b2f48ca990771449a0264c3.png"><br><br><br>  In the souvenir shops, interfaces with buttons, and you have to click on the buttons with the mouse: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/de4/bcb/023de4bcb91c494fa98e33aa7e813516.jpg"><br><br><br>  I think everyone remembers that I noticed that the Spaniards are using not 2 bank terminals in reserve, but 3 in tourist shops.  So, it was in Madrid, it should immediately be said that Madrid is not the first in terms of tourist richness; here, naturally, the palm belongs to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãboth in terms of tourists and the number of bank terminals.  There are 4 of them in the picture, but actually the 5th one was still lying: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de4/269/6f4/de42696f49294e969e568fde959e04db.png"><br><br><br>  Something became hot.  Let's go to some institution.  Wow!  Toshiba Cash Register Black: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/8b4/6cc/c7d8b46cce834effa87fa21b3da66a16.png"><br><br><br>  We continue our walk around Barcelona.  Head over to the candy store.  Oh ... there are also scales with connected cash drawers in a simple variant: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aff/2a0/c7c/aff2a0c7ca6b44d8840329a3476e726f.png"><br><br><br>  There are different interfaces.  Some of them are even nothing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/708/d6e/fc4/708d6efc4ddc48b0ad7680dc79b510c0.png"><br><br><br>  HP Monoblock: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/291/0f0/57f/2910f057f3e94e3990acfdbbdd10b1ee.png"><br><br><br>  Somewhere simpler: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02d/64f/94c/02d64f94c7b74fb69f6f54d899cbf8ac.png"><br><br><br>  In some cafes do not suffer and trust Microsoft Navision: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/879/02f/537/87902f5370334bf3809237dc3c06b861.png"><br><br><br>  HP monoblocks are found: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abe/60c/e3d/abe60ce3dfc746c496bb2104063bef74.jpg"><br><br><br>  Basically the DIBAL scales reign here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fff/4bd/8d7/fff4bd8d719442e0a3c13e9010ef7d4d.jpg"><br><br><br>  Let's buy something.  Let's go to the counter.  We see the scales: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/4b9/4b6/7564b94b67794b698f20add867db4242.jpg"><br><br><br>  Weigh the goods: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/804/ed2/452/804ed2452c42458891fa34aba97db91e.jpg"><br><br><br>  Add a position to the check: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/905/e5c/54e/905e5c54eaf74848807d865a43698855.jpg"><br><br><br>  And get a check from the receipt printer, which is naturally connected to the scales.  I did not find a cash drawer.  Apparently money goes somewhere along the way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/832/69d/7d5/83269d7d55044d57847bf58dbaad7cd4.png"><br><br><br>  And finally, let's go to another Barcelona supermarket.  Let's see another cashier: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/192/28c/56d/19228c56df0941e791995f22a0414330.jpg"><br><br><br><h2>  Afterword ... </h2><br>  In Mallorca, such devices take goods and print at the same time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/224/697/541/2246975417d94fc4a57d94ab8b55f16d.jpg"><br><br><br>  We will take the goods: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b16/ccc/e64/b16ccce64c1a4bb4a80cd1cf658f260f.jpg"><br><br><br>  In general, the Spaniards affectionately love the ticket office in their presentation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30c/b61/93d/30cb6193d8174cdbbc7be7fd865cdffd.jpg"><br><br><br>  Adios ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240731/</a></p>
