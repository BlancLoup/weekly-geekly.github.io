  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 9</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut text="  #9"> Russia and Ukraine call themselves the winners in the gas dispute, the Israeli Prime Minister does not stand national love and goes to the hospital, and the editor-in-chief of the Computer News newspaper tells in secret about the new project of his favorite newspaper.  But if all this is not written in blogs, then this did not happen! <br><br>  Wonderful Ukrainian girl Anna, hiding in LJ under the nickname six_ate, is engaged in translating to the great and mighty <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/six_ate">comics about Dilbert</a> , which <a href="http://dilbert.com/">Scott Adams</a> draws.  It seems that there is an animated series somewhere even in these comics.  Almost every day there is a new comic, so you will not be bored. <br><br>  <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/">Cold Flow</a> in his blog announces the holding of the contest " <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/2006/01/blog-post.html">World of Tolkien</a> ".  Anyone who knows how coherently and beautifully put words into sentences and understands the world of Middle-earth, I advise you to participate.  Competitions are an interesting thing.  True, there is little time left - until January 14.

      In the community " <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/perechniza/">Pepperbox</a> " tell stories of bygone days.  I want to bring to your attention the story of how at the network-knitting factory a young female team arranged a small unplanned vacation in the summer.  Because the plan was given only in winter, and <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/perechniza/123125.html">even the seamstresses</a> want <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/perechniza/123125.html">to sunbathe</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://jamshid.ru/">Jamshid is</a> amazed at Google's restlessness.  At this time, the search engine, whose shares have already gone wild for 400 evergreens, was delivered by the <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2006/01/07/google-pack">Google Pack</a> .  This is not a service, but a set of useful, according to Google, programs that must necessarily be installed in each.  And I tend to agree, especially since among this set there are both Open Source and third-party programs.  "Google" engaged in altruism and free advertising?  Another note about the Google Pack in the <a href="http://evilbot.ru/article/114">EvilBot</a> blog. <br><br>  Ivan Ilyin offers know-how for search engines or just a rational <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/illyn/145446.html">economic approach</a> to recycling.  Following the example of the Yandex.News service, it is possible to split up the information collected by the search spider on blogs.  True, explanations appeared in the comments why such a service is not yet possible. <br><br>  Maxim Kotin in his <a href="http://sketch-book.ru/">Sketchbook</a> <a href="http://sketch-book.ru/%3Fp%3D7">tells the story</a> that happened to him in Tbilisi.  While driving from the airport to the hotel, I learned a lot of interesting things about Russia from a taxi driver and another fellow traveler.  And all just because he did not agree that the taxi driver took another passenger. <br><br>  An employee of a bow and rosin tells a <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/filatovkirill/67046.html">common household story</a> .  My neighbor on top often applies to the "little white" and at three o'clock in the morning begins to catch the draw.  His wife hopes for a quick end for the hubby, there have already been a couple of heart attacks, because he couldn‚Äôt tolerate an alcoholic to anyone.  But the story is still sad. <br><br>  <a href="http://gordy.ru/">Gordy with</a> might and main is resting in Shanghai and on this occasion decided to dispel a series of <a href="http://gordy.ru/archives/87">myths about China</a> .  For example, such that all Chinese look alike.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs enough to stay in China for a couple of days to make sure of the opposite,‚Äù reports Gordy. <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/overheardmsk">Conversations Overheard in Moscow</a> ‚Äù is the name of a community that speaks for itself.  For example, here is a sample: A girl in a red and blue hat (on a cell phone): "So what, what is he for Lokomotiv? I don't care what color a rose is on him if he is a normal person." <br><br>  The " <a href="http://getnew.biz/">New Business</a> " blog talks about the <a href="http://getnew.biz/2006/01/10">worldwide feed notation syndication format</a> .  All smart and talented, who use the Firefox browser, have already guessed what the conversation is about, everyone else (also smart and talented!) Are sent to read and download an archive with all the necessary icons for their sites. <br><br>  Almost " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/tosainu/296462.html">In the World of Animals</a> " suits us Laura Beloivan.  And about bison with bison, and about the company "Russian Ostrich", and about pasties, and about larks.  In general, it is messy about the hard life of a veterinarian. <br><br>  Boris Lifanovsky explains on his fingers why, after all, ‚Äúan empty, worthless, evil and wrong person‚Äù can very easily create <a href="http://boris.lifanovsky.com/index.php%3Fitemid%3D143">beautiful music</a> .  From myself I will add, there is such an opinion, which I hold: a person of art creates something that he does not have.  That is, the poor and unhappy artist writes bright and joyful pictures, and a well-fed and happy musician - sad and melancholic melodies :-). <br><br>  Yuschuk Yevgeny Leonidovich wrote a very large and detailed article with pictures and examples about the Google search engine (yes, this is official!).  " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/yushchuk/35905.html">Google without secrets (Google operators in practical examples)</a> ".  For example, I didn‚Äôt assume that Google can be used as an explanatory dictionary only with the help of the operator ‚Äúdefine:‚Äù. <br><br>  Blog <a href="http://lifehack.ru/">LifeHack</a> offers to make " <a href="http://lifehack.ru/2006/01/03/net_temy">Breaking Template</a> ".  This refers to our pattern of behavior.  For example, start going to work in different new ways.  Or have lunch every time in a new place.  From myself I will add - to wake up every time in a new bed, apartment, city, country. <br><br>  This happened on July 21, 1969.  It was on this day that Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface.  But "Fire Dog" believes that everything happened a <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/ashykhmin/60155.html">little differently</a> .  No, this is not just another proof that there were no Americans on the moon, but everything was filmed in the pavilion.  Alternative history of mankind. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are styles of music that, even when listening to them at the same time, can cause very different feelings for different people,‚Äù writes the blog <a href="http://setti.biz/">Setti Biz</a> .  And <a href="http://setti.biz/321">lists several such genres</a> with definition.  Basically, for some reason electronics. <br><br>  Remarkable " <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/chtoby_pomnili">To Remember</a> " community.  Tribute to all the representatives of Russian and foreign cinema, theater, variety art and any other kind of art that are no longer with us.  You can already read about the leading actor in the TV series ‚ÄúGuest from the Future‚Äù, about the Handsome from the film ‚ÄúThe Green Van‚Äù, about Misha Polyakov - the main character of the three-part ‚ÄúDirk‚Äù and about many other actors. <br><br>  Relatives of the author of the blog <a href="http://regul8or.blogspot.com/">Tak ah lah!</a>  <a href="http://regul8or.blogspot.com/">Me en Tak</a> left for the New Year and Christmas holidays and left him alone with the cat and the fish.  To entertain themselves, they decided to watch several films from their extensive collection, especially since he had not seen much of this collection.  And he got the worst films that he could choose.  And he shares with us <a href="http://regul8or.blogspot.com/2006/01/blog-post_08.html">his impressions</a> . <br><br>  Ben Zonotov shows in pictures how <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/benzonotov/65092.html">children's books are</a> now <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/benzonotov/65092.html">drawn up</a> .  And I must say, very ingeniously make out.  After all, it is lazy to invent poses and faces, so they take what is ready.  And it does not matter that someone else and not quite decent.  There was a girl on the porn site, and now in the children's book.  Reincarnation. <br><br>  <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2006/stewart-brand">On the projects of Stewart Brenda</a> tells in his blog <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/">Kolesnik</a> .  I did not know that it was Stuart Brand who once printed posters with the words ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt we seen the whole photo of the Earth so far?‚Äù  and sold them in American universities.  It is thanks to him that the image of the Earth from space appeared, to which we are all accustomed.  Well, not he, of course, photographed. <br><br>  A cute girl on the blog " <a href="http://joyshua-xc.blogspot.com/">Someone Else and I</a> " is doing a research on " <a href="http://joyshua-xc.blogspot.com/2006/01/google.html">Who does Google love more?</a> "  ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù answers the request: ‚Äú30 kb of ice cream, please!‚Äù In different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand only in one case does ice cream come out. <br><br>  The author of the blog " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/">Details</a> " tells a nostalgic story <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2006-01-05/393.html">about his modems</a> .  It starts from the very first and ends ADSL: "The first modem that came into my hands in the early 90s was a 2400 modem without an error correction protocol. Needless to say that it did not take root?"  Here is the dialogue of two incognito <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2006-01-08/398.html">about two cups of tea</a> . <br><br>  And <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/">Manic Weblog</a> warns against the <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2006/01/07">invention of the bicycle for the web framework</a> .  Quote: "The classic case of the invention of a bicycle is when a programmer, looking at some library, says to himself:" And why are there such difficulties? "And begins to sculpt something of his own, unconditionally‚Äú right ‚Äùand‚Äú effective. ‚ÄùThen it turns out that in the task that he solves, there are much more difficulties and non-obviousness than was seen at the beginning. " <br><br>  In the last issue, I promised you that in every review there will be an opinion of one of the bloggers.  He promised, and he himself was happy - the article will be more without my special efforts (after all, they pay for the volume).  In general, I forgot about my promise, I punished myself.  I will try to treat my next sclerosis for the next review. <br><br>  <b>Your personal aggregator Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/164034.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/164034.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006020601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 2, 2006)</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288528/</a></p>
