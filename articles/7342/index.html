  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to become an IT person</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order to quickly get out of the ‚Äúadolescence of a young promising specialist,‚Äù I propose a plan for achieving success, which is based on rethinking my own life path. <br><br>  I doubt that in the part of my destiny I am somehow special.  Most likely, my plan is suitable for 80% of novice IT specialists ‚Äî in particular, those who have fallen in love with computers from school and have firmly decided to associate their professional activities with them. <br>  So: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After grade 8, drop out of school.  Chemistry, physics, astronomy is nothing more than a waste of time.  Re-education at night school, if you plan to go to college, or go to college.  To make a career, a diploma of secondary education is enough. <br><br>  Go to work for a meager salary as an assistant to the system administrator, "errand boy" (user consultations, solving small computer problems).  It is desirable for a large factory or state office.  Experience in a large structure is invaluable: <br>  - the reputation of a specialist with experience with a large number of various equipment is formed; <br>  - the summary will look very good line that you worked in a well-known large organization in the country; <br>  - since in such offices the salary is usually low, the turnover of staff is large.  There is an opportunity to make acquaintances.  Colleagues who have gone to more ‚Äúbread‚Äù places may well pull you along or give a good recommendation in the company if you want to get a job in the same place; <br>  - here you finally decide who you want to be: continue your career as a sysadmin or become a programmer.

      Gain experience, learn programming.  This is real, since in large offices the load is usually low;  the management, knowing that the salary is small, and, as if trying to compensate for this fact, looks through its fingers at the ‚Äúleft‚Äù classes and the employees' shabashki. <br><br>  Solve the issue of conscription.  For future career it is important - <br>  so as not to be distracted. <br><br>  One or two years have passed.  Well, you're ready to go out.  At the moment you already have work experience, you are already a mature specialist with connections and can count on a more promising job.  At the same time, your peers are still lining up on textbooks, preparing for the final exam in biology and entrance exams to the university. <br><br>  Do not enter the university for full-time education.  It is unacceptable to spend a lot of time for a programmer to study cultural studies, history, philosophy [A very unquestionable thesis.  I would like to remind once again that the opinion of the author of the article is his personal opinion and may not coincide (and does not coincide) with the opinion of the editor of this material (that is, me - Yu.R.)]!  After all, life is given once.  Every moment of life does not return, forgot, drove!  Therefore, I strongly advise you to break public stereotypes and not to enroll in full-time studies at a university. <br><br>  To legalize as a specialist, that is, to get an official ‚Äúcrust‚Äù, you can do it in several ways: <br>  - Graduate company courses (Microsoft, Oracle, 1C) and pass exams for a certified specialist.  Believe me, this certificate in the eyes of the employer will mean much more than a university diploma! <br>  - not everyone knows, but a diploma can be defended at work, that is, you are at work in a state law office writing a diploma on production topics and defending it; <br>  - in universities there are many other forms of education except day: correspondence, unseparated, evening, distance. <br><br>  Everything, now you can start to make a real career.  Get a good job and feel free to assign a good price for your work.  For three or four years, you will climb higher and higher until you reach the salary cap and you‚Äôll run out of opportunities for further growth. <br><br>  Now relax and ... marry.  You are 20‚Äì22 years old, the blood boils, the salary allows you to beautifully care for girls, rent an apartment separate from the parents.  What else is needed for family happiness?  Anyway, in the near future, career advancement does not shine, and yet another psychological crisis occurs at this age of consciousness.  Let everything be "settled down".  Pause to thirty years. <br><br>  Let's sum up.  As long as your peers defend a diploma and run in search of work for recruitment agencies, shouting that they are ‚Äúyoung promising specialists‚Äù (thus scaring employers away), you are already an accomplished specialist, with seniority, good pay, apartment and a beautiful wife .  And while you have resolved the issue with the army, selected specialization, and you probably already visited in Turkey, and Egypt, and maybe in the Cayman Islands ... <br><br>  The author: Karataev Vladimir <br>  Published in the journal "Computerra" ‚Ññ13 from April 3, 2007 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7342/</a></p>
