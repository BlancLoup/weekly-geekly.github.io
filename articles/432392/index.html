  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We had old school games and some mushrooms: mission completed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last week, GAME OVERNIGHT was held - the first tournament in Russia in the legendary old-school video games and an interactive exhibition following its results.  And we had to wait a whole week to share the results with you on Friday. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/432392/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/58/ot/ec/58otecxdupu_sdjftueuemrqqnw.jpeg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have already done several publications on the game theme (for example, ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/430648/">The Story of the Pa Man Game</a> ‚Äù) in which we mentioned GAME OVERNIGHT - perhaps, thanks to these publications, we were able to collect a considerable number of participants, many of whom were from Habr. <br><br>  The preliminary stage of the tournament started on November 15.  Over 10 days, more than 8,000 people took part in it, of which 470 were able to pass the qualifying round.  The final, which was held on November 30 at the Museum of Soviet slot machines, reached 80 people.

Participants were pre-divided into groups and different games, each group had its own winners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l5/dl/rt/l5dlrthya8insmez390jxxxjtoo.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8m/ct/4a/8mct4aq0qr4x7xeokj6kbshduqy.jpeg"><br><br>  In total, more than 20 devices with games installed on them were represented at the tournament.  Among the games are Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Need for Speed, Carmageddon, Mario Kart, FIFA, NHL and many others that we played in our childhood and youth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a39/132/29d/a3913229da86fe1a0f26bda9eb8f93e1.jpg"><br><br>  During the tournament, RUVDS DJ Unpushible admin spoke for the guests.  The finalists were awarded, and then the legendary DJ Oguretz, aka Sergei Mezentsev, the host of the popular show ‚ÄúReutov TV‚Äù, performed with the DJ set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bb/a0c/806/1bba0c806a9bdf6161c6d49698bb0f11.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xf/m7/oe/xfm7oes3dk_oobeu13u-nbsjbum.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sq/2d/fi/sq2dfiuw5ylufqzq7eky8fiyp00.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Memorial Cups to the winners</i></font> <br><br>  The finalists received as awards unique collectible game consoles.  Among the prizes were the television video game electronics VideoSport-3, produced in the USSR in the 1980s, the electronic information gaming complex Poisk, one of the first Soviet computers, Electronics IM-37, the electronic board game ‚ÄúFootball: Champions Cup‚Äù, Electronic game coast guard - table sea battle.  All games were checked by RUVDS admins and presented in working condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af6/f35/a76/af6f35a76d3ec22ffdd360593b220987.jpg"><br><br>  Also, many other prizes and gifts were raffled among guests and participants of the tournament. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/061/83c/b9e/06183cb9eb2ca9b944ab862049083e02.jpg"><br><br>  One of the winners was Alexei <a href="https://habr.com/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> , who took second place in the ‚ÄúRaces‚Äù category.  Taking this opportunity, we got several paragraphs of impressions from him: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAfter work, I drove not so much for the victory as to try the new Habraburger :) I stood in traffic jams and only the races remained from the free categories, although I wanted to kick everyone in the fighting games.  I love racing too, but I didn‚Äôt train them at all. <br><br>  For second place I had to win in five games - I was not familiar with everything.  More precisely, only two were familiar: <br><br>  - Carmageddon: you can win there either by killing an opponent, or by driving all the checkpoints, or by crushing all pedestrians.  All three tasks are not easy, considering the ‚Äúoak‚Äù physics of the first version.  Lucky - my opponent sawed off the wall :) <br>  - NFS (some kind of one of the first parts): at that time there was already quite good physics, and the route was relatively uncomplicated.  Therefore, all that was required was to correctly construct trajectories through apexes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qz/hp/pr/qzhppr5jgxejhoyv14d-ljjj5aa.jpeg"><br><br>  The most difficult were the Soviet games, "Rally" and "Highway" (in my opinion so called) - played them for the first time, it was unusual. <br><br>  In the final game, everything was against me: a completely unfamiliar race game with Mario, an unusual gamepad (it seems some ancient xbox, and I got used to ps) and a lot of RuVDS beer :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wo/fz/f1/wofzf1irh2mjcwp2uaoslxpggck.jpeg"><br><br>  But second place is also cool.  Won the Soviet Coast "Coast Guard" - Eeeeh, there were times! ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  By the way, yes, among other things, in the process of passing games, players and spectators were able to refresh themselves in the Burger Heroes corner in the Museum, where, especially for Game Overnight, they invented a Super Mario burger with mushrooms and truffle cream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f5/2c0/949/5f52c094912d3b18662f57b3d37ff350.jpg"><br><br>  For those who did not: the exhibition will run until December 14, 2018, you can get to it by a standard ticket to the museum (cost - 450 rubles).  All RUVDS clients can get to the exhibition for free.  To get a free ticket, write to the PM. <br><br>  Big thanks to everyone who came!  Well, have a good weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432392/</a></p>
