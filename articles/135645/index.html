  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is coworking in Thailand covered</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Friends, I rewrote this post, excluding all references to coworking / colicting Taicamp.</i>  <i>I am far from the center of Igor Didoshik and I am not an eyewitness to any events whatsoever.</i>  <i>Address all your questions to him, communicate with those who lived in the center.</i> <br><br>  If anyone does not remember, on April 8, 2009, I published an article entitled ‚ÄúDo you want coworking in Thailand?‚Äù, Which stirred the minds of the citizens.  In the article, I invited active people to come and make a coworking center together.  Unfortunately, the co-working center failed.  Fortunately, quite a few interesting people arrived in a few years, some even found themselves after moving, for example, Vova Provolod traveled all over Asia, and now <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/blogosphere/129017/">Latin America</a> (and, by the way, found his soul mate at the very beginning of the journey). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For me, the strategy I initially chose when organizing coworking was very important: it should <b>not</b> be a <b>business</b> .  This should be the community of those who work nearby.  In conversations, I described it with the word "gang".

    <h4>  And what about life? </h4><br>  In a few years before my eyes, several dozen of my friends and acquaintances moved to Thailand.  And I noticed that for most people, life after moving begins to follow the same scenario: arrival, search for housing, renting a house, entering a house and ... everything.  Then a man who came to Tai himself, sticks in a small world-house for months, and even years.  Without development, life becomes boring, happiness, for which a person went to Thailand, is completely absent.  Some, disappointed by such existence, simply return to their homeland, others lead a monotonous existence, from which they fled. <br><br>  That's all.  The cult of individualism, most people no coworking here is not needed.  Only a few that have gone through fire water and copper pipes of several years of life here, want to unite.  Rare activists, and those who understand co-working, want to unite.  And these people are few. <br><br>  In general, compare the number of Russian-language IT shreds here and in Russia.  Now, go see how many coworkings are in Russia and how much they are full and you will immediately realize that Thailand simply has no chance yet! <br><br><h4>  Legislative issue </h4><br>  Some nod to the experience of foreign colleagues.  Like, they have everything, come on, in chocolate, this is Russian Vanka as usual - Vanka rolls around.  I studied foreign experience.  All I managed to find was a few dead attempts to experiment with coworking in my offices (I‚Äôll explain a little later why they died), and purely commercial projects a la office for an hour that have nothing to do with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-working. <a href="http://thirdplacebangkok.com/live/thirdplace-club">THIRDPLACE CLUB</a> in Bangkok). <br><br>  Why is any public, glamorous coworking doomed to a quick, just instant death?  Thai law forbids everything that looks more or less like work.  Well, the root ‚Äúwork‚Äù in the word ‚Äúcoworking‚Äù seems to hint ... <br><br>  Only coworkings for their own, who are in houses, gardens, far from office space, can live in any way.  In my opinion, co-working for Russians wins in this regard, simply because we communicate in a language that is not understandable to Thais and other foreigners, and we can agree with each other.  However, for some reason this does not work ... <br><br><h4>  Russian Russian wolf.  Anyway, in Thailand </h4><br>  It seems that the Russians in Thailand are very hard to unite.  Wherever you look, there is confusion and vacillation.  In societies dedicated to Thailand, the cult of the ego reigns.  In real life, there is no any known, not that cult Russian clubs (and there are all Germans, Americans, Scandinavians there).  The principle of ‚Äútearing off a fellow countryman is more expensive‚Äù reigns in Russian business, any entrepreneur who knows more or less knows that it is better to partner with Europeans.  According to some long-livers ‚Äúthe Russian diaspora in Thailand did not work out!‚Äù <br><br>  I do not know how such trends can be justified, but all of this speaks not in favor of the emergence of co-working centers for Russians in the coming years.  In any case, this experience was useful and memorable, write to me, I will be happy to help you in any way I can. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135645/</a></p>
