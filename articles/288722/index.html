      I advise persistent comrades to start by choosing a domain and searching for a hosting.  If you plan to wait a little, and do not become a ‚Äú <em>star of blogging</em> ‚Äù in the first ten days of practice, feel free to take the <em>starter</em> pack.  Its content is different everywhere, but not essential.  Php 4.1, MySQL database, three or four gigabytes of traffic and a control panel - almost everyone has it.  Immediately after a resounding success, you will purchase additional places and traffic. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Good luck if you have a blogger buddy who has checked the promise of 99.9% uptime promised by everyone.  No less fortunate - owning a one-year budget of 100-120 dollars.  Hosting with bargain prices is better to beware. <br><br>  A normal hoster will give you domain registration in the .com zone.  Choosing a name is a separate task, with many solutions.  You can <em>poshikovat</em> and contact a special agency (prior to meeting with me, that is exactly what <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/09/01/vocabulary/">Voronin</a> did), you can check the intelligence and stress resistance of the hoster, irritate your friends, put down on the forums ... The best option is to come up with yourself, correlated with the goals and objectives of the future project, the disappointing work of all the best words on the topic, and the fact that the twenty-two-letter domain is, perhaps, <em>brute force</em> . <br><br><img src="http://www.design-freak.com/images/ustanovka.gif"><br><br>  For installation on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> ‚Ñ¢ hosting (I myself sit, and I advise you), you will need ftp-access to the server and MySQL database.  Synergy of " <em>straight hands</em> " and the ability to call for help will do their work.  You will ask for everything from the hoster, or you will do it yourself.  The slideshow shows where and what to insert and enter - do it yourself, or attract a ‚Äú <em>reasonable student of the polytechnic</em> ‚Äù: <br><br>  (There should be a slideshow with the installation process, but it is flash and therefore you can watch it <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/11/08/nude-bloging-2/">in my blog</a> ) <br><br>  <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is installed by default with a fairly good functional <strong>theme</strong> ( <em>skin</em> , <em>skin</em> , visual performance, interface).  But if you want to stand apart, you can go further, and change it to something more original.  By the way, this very step leads to the fact that there are five or six bloggers on a blogging runet on one ‚Äú <em>original</em> ‚Äù topic.  This concerns, first of all, those Russified, the use of which can be safely avoided. <br><br><img src="http://www.design-freak.com/images/plagini.gif"><br><br>  Omitting details and emotions, you can go to the <strong>plugins</strong> that I successfully use.  <strong>The damn dozen of the plugins</strong> described below have been tested for seamless interaction on <em>this</em> blog. <br><br>  (I give the links not to download but to the pages of plug-ins; it is very useful to read the comments of happy users, see the bug list and installation tips). <br><br>  1. <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/">Tiger Style Administration</a> - a ‚Äú <em>beautiful</em> ‚Äù version of <strong>the</strong> WordPress <strong>control panel</strong> .  Recommended to aesthetes and fans of CESES pieces. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> - <strong>working antispam</strong> .  Will require a WordPress API.  If the first plug is a relevant add-in, then this is a <em>necessary</em> basis. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/projects/wordpress-plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-generator/">Google Sitemaps</a> - <strong>builder</strong> " <strong>site maps</strong> ", without which a blog (for Google) - a bunch of scattered files. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://wp.uberdose.com/2007/03/24/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO Pack</a> - allows you to add the " <strong>correct headlines</strong> ", <strong>descriptions</strong> and <strong>keywords</strong> .  Addition to the care of how well your blog is visible from search engines. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://www.deltablog.com/popstats/">Popstats</a> - a plugin for visual <strong>statistics of attendance</strong> and reference to colleagues.  Gives (in the right direction), pleases the eye and vanity. <br><br>  6. <a href="http://trac.herewithme.fr/project/simpletagging/">Simple Tagging</a> - <strong>tag plugin</strong> .  Russified <a href="http://lecactus.ru/">Lekactus</a> .  I'm buggy with Russian tags.  With my love for English tags, this is a minor flaw. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://www.douglaskarr.com/projects/wp-contactform/">WP Contact Form</a> - <strong>contact form</strong> with "anti-spam nozzle."  It is a little processing, and speaks Russian.  With an accent, but pretty m-cute. <br><br>  8. <a href="http://elektroelch.de/blog/2007/10/16/pagebar-v133/">Pagebar</a> - <strong>paging</strong> - <strong>plugin</strong> .  Replaces the default page breakdown on cute tsiferki.  Color-size customizable to full satisfaction. <br><br>  9. <a href="http://www.1pixelout.net/code/audio-player-wordpress-plugin/">Audio Player</a> - the <strong>player</strong> is.  While only used once.  It worked. <br><br>  10. <a href="http://www.scriptygoddess.com/archives/2004/06/03/wp-subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe to Comments</a> - <strong>subscribe to comments</strong> .  I use it from others, I put it myself.  Seobakovody advised to configure it to "default subscription."  I'm against.  Bad taste, yeah.  But the choice is yours. <br><br>  11. <a href="http://www.ilfilosofo.com/blog/comments-preview/">Filosofo Comments Preview</a> - <strong>preview comments</strong> before posting.  For me, a pedant and a scavenger, I miss that on other blogs.  But in my, with the help of this plugin, self-check - I do not want. <br><br>  12. <a href="http://maxsite.org/addzakl">MaxSite</a> - <strong>social bookmarks</strong> .  Optimistic plugin.  If it is good (and ‚Äú <em>socially useful</em> ‚Äù) to write, a very useful thing. <br><br>  13. <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/help/wordpress_quickstart">FeedBurner FeedSmith</a> - <strong>redirector rss feed</strong> ;  subscription and remote reading.  It is important to remember the covenant that is made on the offsite of the plugin: ‚Äú <em>Satisfied with the results?</em>  <em>Then publish!</em>  " <br><br><img src="http://www.design-freak.com/images/shagi.gif"><br><br>  When the plugins are installed, the appearance of the blog is pleasing to the eye, and the head is full of ideas, ready to spill out on the numbered pages, a very important stage follows: ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù.  I was lucky with the knowledge of languages.  Information about the strata "necessary" and "not necessary", I read in English, French and Italian forums.  Temperament and national features of blogging vary from country to country, so I‚Äôll give you only those starting tips that have been helpful to me personally: <br><br>  1. <strong>Primary settings</strong> .  Make sure your blog has a relevant header and service e-mail. <br><br>  2. <strong>Order in address lines</strong> .  Edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalinks</a> .  It is pleasant (and useful) when the address of the post is beautiful and functional. <br><br>  3. <strong>Turn off the visual editor posting</strong> .  Bugs, interferes, strains. <br><br>  4. <strong>Useful thumbnail</strong> .  Draw a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> .  Ask for help drawing comrades, if he himself is weak in the subject.  Necessary thing;  compares to the strength of the meter poster " <em>I am special</em> ." <br><br>  5. <strong>Think about categories</strong> ;  add some basic ones.  Organizes and organizes (first of all - post ideas). <br><br>  6. <strong>Write five to seven posts</strong> and post them using ‚Äúbackdate posting‚Äù.  (In my case, the old posts came up from my blog on Habr√©).  Empty blog is better not to show anyone. <br><br>  7. <strong>Push your WordPress topic</strong> .  If you experience difficulties with this, contact a <em>specially trained person</em> .  For relatively modest money (as an option - for barter), you can get support from a php and css specialist, for whom the solution to your external problems is nuts. <br><br>  8. <strong>Describe the purpose of the blog</strong> in the ‚Äú <em>about blog</em> ‚Äù, and your own in the ‚Äú <em>about yourself</em> ‚Äù.  It is important that this is (or seems) true and does not look familiarly or arrogantly. <br><br>  9. <strong>Show yourself to the world</strong> .  The photo has, even if it looks like a household (like <a href="http://www.kraynov.com/">Krainova</a> ).  The main thing is not to emphasize your physicality.  At least, ahead of time. <br><br>  10. <strong>Illustrate posts</strong> .  Have money?  Paid clipart.  Any features?  On their own.  Have a connection?  <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/10/06/kartinki-v-blogi/">By the power of professionals</a> . <br><br>  11. <strong>Save the comments</strong> .  Attention!  Friendships are not good enough, because, as a rule, they are laconic and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù to disgrace.  ‚ÄúClass!‚Äù, ‚ÄúCool!‚Äù, ‚ÄúBurnout!‚Äù, ‚ÄúVasya, blow to the mountain!‚Äù - do not fit, only spoil.  Some experts advise to write comments yourself, under different nicknames.  This I have not tried, but prone to schizophrenia may come up. <br><br>  12. <strong>Put the icon</strong> (and in some cases - the icon) <strong>rss in a prominent place</strong> .  I advise you to show the indicators after 100 subscribers, but emphasize the opportunity to subscribe from the first minute.  Here, as elsewhere, without hysteria and fanaticism.  Subscription zaanuhi in every post - annoying. <br><br>  13. <strong>If there is no search in your subject, add it to the plugin</strong> .  Do not forget that search results should look neat and correct.  Experiment yourself before you forget about it for a long time (external search is extremely rare for the blog host). <br><br>  14. <strong>Do not post Google ads</strong> .  In general, do not play with advertising until the departure of 200-300 readers becomes an inconspicuous ‚Äúdrop from the sea‚Äù for you. <br><br>  15. <strong>Keep cross-browser compatibility</strong> !  Be sure to check how the addition of each plug-in (widget, graphic element) affects the display of your blog in leading browsers.  Install these browsers (Mozilla, Opera and the last two Explorer) on your computer. <br><br>  16. <strong>Start a blogroll</strong> .  Add to it only those who really read, but remember (!) Each subsequent removal from the blogroll is a very serious step. <br><br>  17. <strong>Do not sin</strong> <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/09/30/bloggeri-kakajut/">‚Äúlike‚Äù am</a> , until your own (successful!) Experience stands behind your advice. <br><br>  18. <strong>Be extremely careful in setting goals and objectives</strong> .  Especially when you declare them publicly.  For example, doing the author's project and calling himself ‚ÄúDaily‚Äù, you need to keep the brand, or shamefully stamp govnosta, or write up and hang.  To abuse the optimistic self-sacrifice is also not worth it. <br><br>  19. <strong>Make good friends among fellow bloggers</strong> .  Help when you can, do not hesitate to ask for help when needed. <br><br>  20. <strong>Be polite and loyal</strong> , as if ‚Äú <em>Guschevski</em> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <em>Oktyabryatski</em> ‚Äù would not sound.  Bloggers are a hundred times more open, polite and sociable people than the same people.  For professional and social reasons.  This is felt in the first weeks of the blog experience, but it is important to come with this spirit initially.  And there will be happiness, yeah. <br><br>  "The <strong>philosophy of the process</strong> " - <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/11/06/nude-bloging/">stayed there</a> .  The next post is about the most difficult.  About what happens when the blog is started and you have to do something about it. <br><br>  Original post - blog <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/11/08/nude-bloging-2/">design-freak.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288722/</a></p>
