Out of habit, from time to time to distract from typing (whether this habit is wrong), switching between the bookmarks of the opera, I, without coordinating hand movements, suddenly, involuntarily took advantage of the opera mouse controls (be it wrong) and ... <a name="habracut"></a>  Yes!  The bookmark has executed the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù command ... And the entire text has disappeared into oblivion.  In desperation, realizing that the text is lost, that I‚Äôm not going to type in my new laziness, I‚Äôm lying about being a liar, a person who doesn‚Äôt keep a word and lost a loser in the back of civilization, wanted to close the browser and go outside, drown the ducks in the pond.  But composure returned to me and I began to remember what I was taught in the university ... A computer expert, in the end I or not?  To the point. <br><br>  I restored the information lost in the browser opera, in fact from other browsers restored similarly.  OS - Win7.  No special professional programs are used, everything is done very simply. <br><br>  If you have closed the browser, then the text you typed will not be in the memory dump of the newly opened browser.  <b>The browser can not be closed!</b>

      Maybe when the hands reach, I'll write how to recover information from an already closed browser. <br><br>  The initial solution came quickly: Remove the memory dump from the opera and find the text there.  I did not remember the materiel of the dump structure, of course, but I remembered that the information from the dump baruser was quickly restored. <br><br>  So let's get started. <br><br>  First you need to directly remove the dump of the open opera.  For those who suddenly do not know how to shoot a memory dump from Windows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/251/544/95f/25154495f1728e64a44ddd90cd75e6e1.png"><br><br>  Filmed dump weighs a little bit, a bunch of megabytes!  In my case, he weighed about 930mb.  Of course, no text editor will open such a carcass.  But the notebook says that the file ‚Äúopera.dmp‚Äù, the quote: ‚Äú... is too big‚Äù, is apparently so low a program as a notebook, it is not supposed to defile the dust of the sole soles of the dump‚Äôs foot.  In general, the longest I could not understand than to open this miracle.  ‚ÄúColleagues‚Äù to my question ‚ÄúHow can I open a text file weighing in gigabytes?‚Äù, First responded with indignation, saying ‚ÄúHow much ?!‚Äù, and then with the final answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or advice to download the superprogram ‚ÄúI‚Äôm open with all 3000‚Äù.  Well, well learned, you will not say anything. <br><br>  The insight came unexpectedly.  Such a file is opened through the Total Commander view mode.  In the preview you will see a large text, in which of course you will not find a word in Russian.  But switching to Unicode - ‚ÄúOptions -&gt; Unicode‚Äù you will see a bunch of Chinese characters, but do not worry, you are on the right track!  Press Ctrl + F and enter a piece of lost text, better if it is as unique a piece as possible, and not common words like ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, ‚Äúice cream‚Äù, ‚Äúbought‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  Just do not forget that the text is likely to be broken and scattered on the dump.  If you have found a piece of text, but it does not have an ending, then copy a part adjacent to the end of the found piece and hammer it into the search, you will probably find a longer piece of text.  And remember that recovering the text completely is most likely not possible, but it will be possible to find most of it. <br><br>  Briefly about the stages of recovery: <br><br><ol><li>  Do not close the browser, open the task manager. </li><li>  Take a dump. </li><li>  Download and open Total Commander. </li><li>  Go to the directory (folder) in which you saved the dump, highlighting it by pressing F3. </li><li>  In the open window, switch to unicode (Options -&gt; Unicode). </li><li>  Looking for your text. </li></ol><br>  Then you either find it, and therefore rejoice and rejoice, or do not find it, crying, tearing the hair on your head or chest, going to the park to sink ducks in the pond.  Or check whether you did everything right, because most likely you did something wrong ... In this life. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350728/</a></p>
