  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impressions of the conference "The State in the XXI century"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This afternoon, the conference "The State in the XXI Century" dedicated to the electronic state and the information society. <br><br>  More information about her can be read on her website <a href="http://www.government21.ru/">http://www.government21.ru/</a> , and I also hope that the materials of the presentations will soon appear there, but I will share my own impressions, especially since I spoke there as a speaker. <br><br>  1. Igor Agamirzyan from RVC at the very beginning spoke about where in the World Economic Forum‚Äôs rating we are, what it is connected with and how to change it.  In principle, this rating / network readiness index was mentioned very often at the conference.  You can see it here - <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GITR_Report_2011.pdf">http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GITR_Report_2011.pdf</a> .  It was felt that he was worried about many.

      2. Ilya Ponomarev told about the laws on the electronic document and digital signature.  Their importance to citizens and the fact that finally became possible full-fledged electronic document management. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  3. There were relatively few people, but among those who were noticeable figures from regional IT officials, such as Sergey Kuchin - Minister of Informatization of the Nizhny Novgorod Region or Nikolay Nikiforov - Minister of Informatization of Tatarstan.  In fact, the conference itself was focused on the regions, and not on the feds. <br><br>  4. There was a speaker from the USA - Alan Zilberberg, their Gov 2.0 innovator.  He did not speak very vividly, but the topic itself was interesting - the initiative of Government 2.0 in the USA.  Of course, ‚Äú2.0‚Äù was already worn by many, but the American experience is significant. <br><br>  5. Open data has been mentioned many times.  Deputy Ilya Ponomarev spoke about them, Nikolai Nikiforov mentioned, Alan Zilberberg spoke and I devoted my speech to this topic. <br><br>  6. My presentation was called ‚ÄúOpen Data as the Foundation of the Information Society‚Äù.  I told about them, about world and Russian projects and the demand for this whole topic for citizens.  In my opinion, the performance was productive, on the sidelines, then there were a lot of questions.  I will post the presentation myself a little later, as soon as it appears on the conference website. <br><br>  In parallel, there were other sections where they talked about the blogs of officials, discussed government services, and shared experiences in regional informatization.  Honestly, all this was not very exciting. <br><br>  General impressions are mixed. <br><br>  The fact that we actively began to mention open data and the fact that there was a positive reaction to my performance is good.  The hope is that open data has begun to penetrate the minds of people. <br><br>  On the other hand, practically nothing and the very format of such ‚Äúformal conferences‚Äù become obsolete.  In my opinion, it‚Äôs time to change them to the formats √† la Barcamp / iCamp, in which I personally took part with much greater pleasure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117436/</a></p>
