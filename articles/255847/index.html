From the report of Alexander it is said that the sites for which excessive use of SEO links was revealed received a corresponding notification through webmaster.yandex.ru.  I asked the guys to get rid of our purchase base for notifications (where there is access to webmaster.yandex.ru), so there are very few such sites - within 5%.  Therefore, such a notification was received by sites where the share of purchased links is about 100%, their quality is very low and they have been hosted for a long time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will definitely try to understand more accurate criteria, since we have a complete index of links in runet and the world. 
      <br>

      2. Yandex has clearly stated that it will be impossible to ‚Äúfill up‚Äù a competitor (in their opinion).  This means that the purchase of new links (even the worst and cheapest) will not be able to drive the site under the filter. <br><br>  If the site has now received notification of SEO links about a possible downgrade on May 14, then removing links will also be a bad decision.  In this case, the positions will still fall on May 14, but not only in Yandex, but also in Google.  It is necessary to improve the state of the reference mass so that the site does not fall under these criteria.  You can offer several options: <br><br>  a.  Remove 20% of already purchased links and buy new ones in their place.  New links will not fall under this algorithm, since Yandex states that it is impossible to fill up the site.  And these links will allow you to save the parameters by reference ranking. <br><br>  b.  Work with other types of links that can improve the reference profile.  One way could be launching a campaign in the <a href="http://getsocial.ru/">getsocial.ru</a> service <a href="http://getsocial.ru/">.</a> We just launched it officially today. <br><br>  From the experience of past statements by Alexander, we can say that Yandex is actively investing in the preparation of spectacular reports (shooting videos, making special buttons, etc.).  Obviously, this is done to spawn discussions on these topics.  But as we see, real actions are very different from those stated: links continue to work well, etc. ... But the next topic for discussion will be for several months. <br><br>  Now about the money.  Yandex says that it wants to send money from link sites to real improvement of resources.  Since the average link budget in a number of stock exchanges is at the level of 5000 rubles.  per month, it is obvious that this budget is in no way capable of actually improving the quality of sites (especially complex and large) <br><br>  For many years in the Internet marketing industry, I have already done a lot of tools to increase conversion and improve websites ( <a href="https://uptocall.com/">uptocall.com</a> , <a href="http://helpclick.ru/">helpclick.ru</a> , <a href="http://getux.ru/">getux.ru</a> , etc.).  Unfortunately, site owners in Russia are not going to invest in improving their resources.  Everyone is interested only in the presence of a simple button for promotion. <br><br>  Even today we are holding a conference ‚ÄúConversion Enhancement Technologies‚Äù and it is clear that people are not interested in it - <a href="http://www.megaindex.tv/conv2015/">http://www.megaindex.tv/conv2015/</a> <br><br>  However, the current changes may finally finish off the exchange of eternal links and articles, but the exchange of rental links and automated purchasing systems will flourish.  There will be strategies for periodic updating of the reference mass, which use analytical algorithms based on big data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255847/</a></p>
