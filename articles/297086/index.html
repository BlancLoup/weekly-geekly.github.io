In fact, our people are much more open to establishing relationships than many others.  For example, the Swedes are starting to have things to do with you no sooner than after three years of dating.  But our compatriots, before getting involved in a long-term relationship, ask themselves: ‚ÄúI am ready and I want to work with these people, can I trust them?‚Äù

      An excellent reason to get to know people better is to go camping with them.  But friends, not businessmen, go on a hike, so a more attractive legend is needed.  So, a good reason for business acquaintance is an overseas conference, or rather, some joint event before or after it. <br><br>  What is this all about?  In March next year we are going to the annual conference <a href="https://jiveworld.jivesoftware.com/">JiveWorld16</a> .  It is conducted by <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a> , which makes the coolest collaboration solutions, the most social intranet and the most modern corporate portals. <br><br>  The conference will be held in Las Vegas and after it we are going on a two-day tour of the Grand Canyon.  This route has been tested by us several times.  I assure you - SO you have not yet traveled.  You'll like it.  100% guaranteed. <br><br>  Who is with us? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  *** <br><br><h2>  As we drive the Grand Canyon. </h2><br>  Here and below are photos taken by the participants of our trips. <br><br>  So, we gather people, ideally a couple of cars.  After drinking a morning coffee, we ride horses and leave the glorious city of Las Vegas.  On the way we drive into the Hoover Dam.  Just because everyone calls on her.  And forward to the prairie! <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/90c/823/8bf/90c8238bf7ff1f4c2efee94c775100ba.jpg" height="303" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  On Skywalk, a platform with a transparent floor for the review of the Grand Canyon, it is better to be in the afternoon, because the sun will be behind your back and give a chic pinkish tint.  After the bridge, we leave for a distant parking lot, where there are few people, no time limits, and only you and Canyon remain.  And only somewhere far below helicopters flying dragonflies over Colorado. <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3e3/7f5/b44/3e37f5b445de8df59d3907b232ca5c99.jpg" height="302" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  If the team wants to be in silence, then in the evening in a secret desert place we come to a rural hotel.  Here it is, the quintessence of continental America: the hozblok on the right is a separate hotel room with a shower, air conditioning and a coffee machine (!), On the left an indispensable attribute of American life, behind is a prairie with joshua and cacti.  By the way, for the destruction of cactus in Arizona you can get 20 years in prison, so be careful. <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/12e/d19/5ce/12ed195ceec6b881bbfc955a5abeabbc.jpg" height="302" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  But if there is strength and it is still light - we taxi on Stockton Hill Road, the one that leads to Kingman, and halfway we reach the dry lakes, which are not on any tourist map.  There are about five or six kilometers of absolutely flat dry land and no sheriff.  With full responsibility, I declare that skidding at a speed of 150 km / h is cool!  By the way, once we planted there and pulled Dodge Challenger together.  It was a fun story! <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/639/253/e9c/639253e9c61b7e65f5322043587ca687.jpg" height="304" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  After pokatushek going to spend the night in Williams, which stands on the old highway Route 66. There are a million motels, you can stop at any.  Here, after eight o'clock in the evening, you can buy food only at a gas station, so if the traveling team needs food for the night, we stock up in advance. <br><br>  In the morning already all my own!  We eat breakfast in the only restaurant, the whole menu of which consists of a combination of traditional ingredients - beef, eggs, corn and potatoes with rare splashes of vegetables.  Then the walk and the obligatory shopping, cowboy stuff and all that.  Here I once acquired a portrait of Jack Daniels himself. <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e59/558/b53/e59558b53762ab2d5c791d029dcd6724.jpg" height="302" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  Then we go to the north and again we admire the Grand Canyon.  At this point, it is wider, but there are already crowded and in general, expectations are clear.  Stealthily through binoculars we observe the life of the Alapaev tribe (or the Khalapai or the Hualapai, these are three different tribes, and I do not remember which of these tribes live in this part of the reservation). <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ce4/f5a/d54/ce4f5ad54cfaf58fa347b69575c4ddc0.jpg" height="303" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  And full of impressions, we are going back to Vegas!  For example, with a stop at Kingman, where you can eat steak, listen to country music and dance with cheerful local rural people in some steakhouse. <br><br><img width="1000" alt=" JiveWorld" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a79/a79/69f/a79a7969fcb99285d1acacb2672db68b.jpg" height="300" title="JiveWorld Conference"><br><br>  That's all!  Nobody bought anything dear to anyone.  No one owes nothing to nobody.  It's just that during these two days you and your companions became friends and were enriched with impressions.  Yes, and it's time to go home.  Work. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Yours sincerely, <br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297086/</a></p>
