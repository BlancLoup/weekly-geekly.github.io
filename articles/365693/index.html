Later they began to explain the expansion of the space of the Universe as a result of a widespread explosion in the hot Universe.  But in fact, the redshift is an optical phenomenon.  It is determined by the fact that mainly from which region of the galaxy the radiation falls into the spectrum of the galaxy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The general theory of relativity of Einstein (GTR) was created in 1916. The non-stationary solution of the equations of general relativity found by A. Friedman in 1922 and the Hubble‚Äôs law of dependence of the distance to a galaxy from its red shift formulated in 1929 by Hubble was the basis for introducing the Big Bang hypothesis.  The failure of a point explosion model in the cold universe, followed by the expansion of galaxies, was discovered very soon and in 1948 this model was replaced by a model for a universal explosion in a hot universe, followed by an expansion of the universe itself.  As far as we know, the question of whether the exploding Universe was infinite or finite was not posed.  And the question is interesting.  If the universe was infinite, then the ubiquitous (one-time?) Explosion can not be said.  And if final, then what was its size. <br><br>  These two scenarios (cold blast at a point and hot blast everywhere) are completely incompatible.  But this somehow ceased to be noticed and both concepts in the aggregate are now called the Big Bang, and the further development of the theory took place and is happening on the basis of GR.  The general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein is still considered the most perfect theory.  At least that's how it was appreciated by Lee Smolin in 2006 in his book ‚ÄúProblems with Physics‚Äù.  And as you know, Lee Smolin is "in the list of the 100 most prominent thinkers of the world" (Wikipedia).  But, meanwhile, as early as 1988, the study of academician A.A. was published in the International Yearbook "Science and Humanity".  Logunova "New ideas about space, time and gravity."  This paper pointed out two physical inconsistencies in Einstein's theory.  The first physical discrepancy noted by A.A.  Logunov and his colleagues, consisted in the fact that the laws of conservation (mass, energy, momentum, etc.) are not carried out individually.  In general relativity, only some combinations of mass, energy, momentum, etc. can have a constant value, but not each of these quantities separately.  The second discrepancy is that the basic postulate of the theory of the equality of heavy and inert masses, in fact, is not fulfilled in this theory.  Gravitational body weight is never zero.  For the inert mass in GR, one can obtain any values, including zero and negative.  The fact is that in general relativity the inertial mass of the body depends on the choice of the coordinate system.  The curvilinear coordinate system adopted in GR, allows you to make such a choice. <br><br>  It is clear that the consequences of a theory that has such heavy physical inconsistencies cannot be considered reliable.  In particular, this concerns Friedman‚Äôs decision on the expansion of the Universe.  Indeed, after Logunov supplemented 10 Einstein equations with four more equations ensuring the conservation of conservation laws (each separately), it turned out that there is no unlimited expansion of the Universe in such a modified system of equations.  Just as there are no black holes.  Thus, the Big Bang theory, based on GR, must be perceived with a great deal of doubt.

      The introduction of the Big Bang hypothesis means, in fact, the rejection of the law of cause and effect, which causes rejection in many scientists.  Here are the symptoms of this. <br>  May 22, 2004  the Internet and the journal New Scientist7 published an ‚Äú <a href="http://www.antidogma.ru/cosmology.html">Open Letter to the Scientific Community,</a> ‚Äù signed by thirty-three world-famous scientists.  The letter talks about the fundamental problems of the Big Bang theory and about the unjustified restriction of cosmological research to only the framework of the Big Bang theory. <br>  On March 15, 2014 in Australia, the documentary ‚ÄúWhat Was Before the Big Bang‚Äù was released, in which five well-known cosmologists tried to plan a way out of the impasse of the scientific situation caused by the Big Bang theory. <br>  There are other examples. <br><br>  It is already clear that the hypothesis of the Big Bang really leads to a deadlock.  The following concepts: the standard model, <a href="http://astrogalaxy.ru/919.html">inflation</a> , <a href="http://astrogalaxy.ru/920.html">dark matter</a> , <a href="http://www.astrogalaxy.ru/891.html">dark sky</a> , <a href="http://www.astrogalaxy.ru/923.html">theories of the age of stars, galaxies and the Universe itself</a> , which are not consistent with the results of astronomical observations and a number of others came to light, to substantiate the consistency of the Big Bang theory. <br><br>  <i>Remark</i>  Regarding the standard model, we give only one evidence of the emergence of the concept of ‚Äúquarks‚Äù (from the book ‚Äú <a href="http://s6767.narod.ru/k6/k6.htm">Introduction to classical electrodynamics</a> ‚Äù, p.132): ‚ÄúLiterally just mentioned FIAN professor B.L. Voronov (p. 144) is again ready to surprise us by my testimonies: ‚ÄúI may be amused about such a real story with regard to a quark.  Quark was proposed by Gel-Man [in the 63rd - 64th year].  In my eyes, I was a witness, Igor E. Tamm, director, head of the theoretical department of FIAN, in the 65th year, conducted a vote: who believes in quarks.  It was pure speculation.  This was a judgment derived by a theorist based on an analysis of the structure of elementary particles using group theory methods.  He studied some symmetry and said that in this symmetry all other entities are most fundamental.  Hence, there must be carriers of these fundamental concepts.  Only concepts.  Well, who believes?  Only one hand went up. ‚Äù  Here, everything is in abundance - and the methods of group theory, and some symmetry, and even voting.  There is no trivial matter - there is no discussion of the physical model.  The solution to the problem is ‚Äúthe proton consists of quarks‚Äù.  Quark arose as a certain carrier of a mathematical structure, a certain representation of a certain group. ‚Äù <br><br>  Numerous attempts have been made to find a non-cosmological explanation for redshift.  Their exhaustive review is given in the work ‚Äú <a href="http://ritz-btr.narod.ru/melnikov.html">Non-Doppler Explanations of the Red Shift</a> in the <a href="http://ritz-btr.narod.ru/melnikov.html">Spectra of Distant Galaxies</a> ‚Äù.  But most astronomers and many physicists still adhere to the Doppler interpretation of the redshift.  The fact is that the observed redshift has the property of proportionality: for any wavelength, the redshift is equal to the ratio of the wavelength increment to the wavelength <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/366/d7b/225/366d7b2254c44963a4919007ca7eacd6.png" alt="image">  , has the same meaning.  And only Doppler shift has this property. <br><br>  As far as can be judged by the statements of various authors, they are not seeing any other explanation of the redshift besides the expansion of the Universe.  However, there is such an explanation.  During the years 1987-1995.  in the abstract journals "Astronomy" there were consistently messages confirming the non-cosmological nature of the red shift.  The developed idea belonged to V.M.  Antonov.  At the end of 2005, the scientific site ‚ÄúSome Problems of Extragalactic Astronomy‚Äù was created, the first two chapters of which included almost all the works, which were reported in the abstract journal.  The site has existed until this year, when for financial reasons it was closed.  For those who want to familiarize themselves with the concept of Antonov, I can add the following: a fairly simple exposition of the main results of Antonov, related to the issue of redshift, is <a href="http://www.astrogalaxy.ru/784.html">here</a> .  In addition, the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe origin of the redshift is presented in the popular article "The <a href="http://astrogalaxy.ru/857.html">red shift of galaxies caused by the background of the night sky</a> ."  In this paper, this will be discussed very briefly.  Only the conclusions of the theory will be listed without explaining how they are obtained. <br><br>  SO: <br><br>  The redshift of galaxies and quasars is an optical phenomenon.  It is caused by two factors: <br>  1. <i>The first factor</i> .  Accretion (falling under the action of gravity) of intergalactic gas onto the galactic core.  The accretion of gas begins at a distance of approximately one and a half times the radius of the stellar disk of the galaxy.  The gas falling onto the nucleus gradually accelerates and reaches relativistic velocities in the deep layers of the galaxy.  When falling, gas particles collide with interstellar gas and between themselves.  In collisions, the gas atoms then ionize, then recombine, again becoming neutral.  This gives rise to radiation, called recombination.  At the beginning of accretion, the recombination radiation is very weak, much weaker than the radiation of stars.  But in the deep layers of the galaxy the situation changes - the intensity of the recombination radiation is many times greater than the intensity of the stars.  The peculiarities of the redshift of galaxies are determined precisely by what region of the galaxy the radiation falls into the spectrum. <br>  2. The <i>second factor</i> .  The presence of flickering night radiation (night sky background), even in a moonless night.  The magnitude of the red shift is determined by the shift of dark and light lines in the spectrum of the galaxy (Fig. 1).  The background of the night sky is unavoidable in obtaining spectra by both terrestrial and space laboratories. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/a3a/108/362a3a10890244cbb75715494d1f2231.png" alt="image"><br>  Pic1 <br><br>  If there were no background of the night sky, then for a distant galaxy it would be possible to capture the radiation from any region of the disk.  To do this, it would be necessary to make a sufficiently long exposure.  But the presence of chaotic sky flicker limits the duration of exposure, since if the exposure is too large, the disc will light up.  Therefore, radiation from the edges of a distant galaxy, which glow less than the center, does not enter the spectrum.  Figure 2 illustrates this situation: as the distance r to the galaxy increases, the radiation from all its deeper layers gets into the spectrum (in the figure r1 &lt;r2 &lt;r3 &lt;r4).  Therefore, for nearby galaxies, the spectrum mainly enters radiation from the outer layers of the galaxy, i.e.  star radiation.  For very distant galaxies, radiation from very deep layers, i.e.  recombination radiation.  For galaxies located at intermediate distances, both radiations will be represented in the spectrum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/a14/b4e/288a14b4e93b44f0bf862dec6a41e460.png" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  2 <br><br>  In the study of the accretion phenomenon taking into account the background of the night sky, the following was established. <br><br>  1. Although the gas accrets onto the galactic nucleus from all sides, the spectrum mainly receives radiation from a solid angle of 60 ¬∞ (Fig. 3).  In addition, noticeable lines in the spectrum are created only by radiation from a thin spherical layer, which was called the <i>emission layer</i> (in Fig. 3 it is highlighted in color).  From the side facing the observer, the gas from the observer is removed.  Therefore, the shift of the spectral lines from the emission layer will be red.  From the opposite side, the gas approaches the observer, and the shift of the spectral lines would be purple if they could be fixed.  But the violet shift was never able to be fixed, because this part of the radiation is shielded by the bright core of the galaxy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/266/94e/d60/26694ed6023e4382b8c2f9c1757d1db0.png" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  3 <br><br>  2. The farther from the observer is the galaxy, the closer to the center of the galaxy is the emission layer. <br>  3. In the galaxy spectrum, the redshift is determined from two types of lines ‚Äî dark (absorption lines) and light (emission lines).  Examples of such lines are shown in Fig.1.  In the spectra of very close galaxies, only absorption lines are present.  In the spectra of very distant galaxies there will be mainly radiation lines.  But regardless of which lines (absorption or radiation) find the redshift, the redshift value always corresponds to the accretion rate in the emission layer. <br><br>  These three properties listed above explain Hubble‚Äôs redshift phenomenon ‚Äî the farther away the galaxy, the more its emission is shifted to the red.  Indeed, the farther the galaxy, the deeper its emission layer.  The deeper the emission layer, the greater the accretion rate in it.  The greater the accretion rate, the greater will be the redshift found from this velocity.  The mistake of the Big Bang hypothesis is that the speed of the accreting gas in the emission layer was interpreted as the speed of the entire galaxy. <br><br>  Open VM  Antonov redshift mechanism was named by the author <i>accretion-gravitational</i> .  Of course, in addition to the three above properties, V.M.  Antonov established many other redshift properties.  In particular, the implementation of the Hubble law, which was previously found empirically, was established. <br>  In recent years, space telescopes have been providing new observations that confound the Big Bang theory and confirm the validity of the <i>accretion-gravitational</i> redshift mechanism.  In many such cases, a popular article was written.  Almost all such articles are posted <a href="http://www.astrogalaxy.ru/935.html">here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365693/</a></p>
