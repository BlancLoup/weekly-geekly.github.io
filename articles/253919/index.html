That is, I stick in my ears what's necessary.  When I started to play, the main problem was a mouse with a ball, a mouse with a very clogged ball, because it was played mainly in clubs.  After some time, everyone started dragging their mice with them. (Who controlled the game with a finger and pulled the ball off?) A little later, they were their own headphones.  For headphones, I had one requirement - that 2 ears work.  Then came the second wish.  To cord was longer than one and a half meters.

      Recently we gave a <i>real gaming</i> headset HyperX Cloud to the test.  The first thing I <s>sat down to play at LoL</s> was listening to ‚ÄúNo time for caution‚Äù from ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù.  What immediately pleased - a <b>long</b> wire (with volume control) in a very <b>strong</b> braid (the cat gnawed, gnawed, did not gnaw through), strict Zen design, <b>sound insulation</b> .  All the most frequent-breaking places are made of metal. <br><br>  I did not want to write another review with a bunch of photos and sighs from the quality of the wrapper (especially since I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/233387/">already have one</a> on Habr√©), but I wanted to share my experience and something that turns ideas about sounds in games.  Therefore, I began to recall what was interesting with the sound in the games I played (Starcraft, Quake2, League of Legends, Limbo, etc.).  And also I had a lot of questions for igrodelyam and to the players and invite them to share their experiences. <br><br><h5>  What next will be discussed: </h5><br>  <b>Crites</b> are moments in the game when sound was crucial information (and not just a nice addition), which gives an advantage.  I will share my findings and hope that game developers will tell you how they develop such moments. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Example from Virtua Fighter 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "Another example.  In the game Virtua Fighter 3, if Jeffrey uses his ‚Äúmain counter‚Äù on the lower kick (‚Äúmajor counter‚Äù low kick) against the opponent (meaning that he interrupts the opponent's reception), then after that he can make a guaranteed throw.  If the bottom kick misses the attacking opponent, then Jeffrey cannot make a guaranteed shot.  When I first asked other players how they knew they could make a throw, they told me: ‚ÄúJust listen to the sound of the counterattack.  When you hear it, you can enter a throw command. ‚Äù  At first I thought they were joking.  It seemed too difficult to break through the chaos of battle and hear this particular sound.  But in the end, when I pressed the button for the lower blow, everything around me stopped in anticipation of this sound.  When I heard him, I was so ready for him that it seemed to me ridiculously simple to have time to enter the cast team. ‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/blog/id2%25D0%25A1100000387/">Source: ‚ÄúPlaying to Win‚Äù, David Sirlin, member of the USA Street Fighter team</a> <br></div></div><br>  <b>Criteria</b> - based on what to choose gaming headphones.  On Habr√© on this subject there are several articles with discussions ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/250057/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227033/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/249389/">3</a> ).  I invite readers to share their arguments and look at the results of the habro. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Example from habrazhitel</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  I have been working with sound (and, accordingly, with headphones) for more than 10 years.  Basically - with studio headphones, professional, but sometimes you have to deal with consumer goods like the one discussed in this article.  And I know perfectly well that the most ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù, the most fragile place in any headphones is the mechanism for attaching the phones themselves to the arcs.  In the second place in terms of frequency of breakdowns are the arcs themselves, in the third place is the wire.  And I have seen many, many times how professional, studio or DJ headphones have broken, which are many times larger than these Soundblaster, and the mounting mechanism in professional headphones is much more reliable and has been developed taking into account the "difficult" conditions of use.  And yet - break.  Break with professionals who buy these headphones for their hard-earned money and who handle these headphones very carefully.  Here, the mechanism is clearly weak, such a construction would not withstand what the army fun you mentioned, but even a year of ordinary use by the ordinary user.  And even if they are attached ‚Äúin a human way‚Äù - this is just such a marketing name.  ‚ÄúHumanly‚Äù is not a characteristic and not a guarantee of reliability, it is just the first impression of a marketing-beautiful plastic.  I can calmly say to you that at least one third of the sold headphones will not live a year.  With the most usual exploitation, not from the Vandals, not in the army - from the most simple, "ordinary" users. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/207806/">habrahabr.ru/post/207806/#comment_7172786</a> <br></div></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>About HyperX Cloud</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/bab/676/ad5bab676bdb4dc0884960023632fdb8.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">TTX</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efa/6d0/5f4/efa6d05f4cdc4ee88e4f8175de7cc2f7.jpg" align="right"><br><h5>  Headset </h5><br><br><ul><li>  Sensor type: dynamic, √ò 53mm </li><li>  Operating principle: closed </li><li>  Frequency response: 15‚Äì25000 Hz </li><li>  Nominal impedance: 60 ohms per system </li><li>  Nominal sound pressure level: 98 ¬± 3dB </li><li>  Nonlinear distortion factor: &lt;2% </li><li>  Maximum power: 150mW </li><li>  Headphone Type: Full Size </li><li>  Suppression of ambient noise: approx.  20 dBa </li><li>  Headband pressure: 5H </li><li>  Weight with microphone and cable: 350g </li><li>  Cable length and type: 1m + 2m extension cable for iPhone (10cm) </li><li>  Connector: mini plug (3.5 mm) </li></ul><br><br clear="right"><h5>  Microphone </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e51/c4c/453/e51c4c4535fa4284aecfbdf32d705bf9.jpg" align="left"><br><ul><li>  Sensor type: electret capacitor (reverse type) </li><li>  Principle of operation: pressure gradient </li><li>  Pattern: cardioid </li><li>  Power sources: AB power </li><li>  Voltage: 2V </li><li>  Current consumption: max.  0.5 mA </li><li>  Nominal impedance: ‚â§2.2 kŒ© </li><li>  Idle voltage at f = 1 kHz: 20 mV / Pa </li><li>  Frequency response: 100‚Äì12000 Hz </li><li>  Nonlinear distortion: 2% at f = 1 kHz </li><li>  Max.  sound pressure level: 105dB SPL (CED ‚â§ 1.0% at 1 kHz) </li><li>  Microphone output: -39 ¬± 3dB </li><li>  Microphone length: 150mm (including stand) </li><li>  The diameter of the membrane: √ò6 * 5 mm </li><li>  Connector: mini plug (3.5mm) </li></ul><br clear="left"></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Equipment</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39c/09a/174/39c09a17493844789fd7d8a553d76b28.jpg"><br>  <i>Meter cable with remote control, two-meter extension cable, adapter with 3.5 mm plug for mobile devices, and also a microphone, carrying case with additional pockets and even an adapter for the audio system in airplanes and interchangeable velor ear cushions (for warm year and heated rooms).</i> </div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9b/f6c/91a/f9bf6c91a192e835a6b26db2485be1ea.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  I extended three matches in LoL in a row (~ 2 hours), and then I want to rest my ears. <br><br>  External sounds cease to exist (4 missed incoming calls), soundproofing norms. <br><br>  Convenient carrying case.

Therefore, it makes sense to abandon nishtyak or a little bypass the puddle.  Constant jumps in Quake 2 on level ground helped to mask those places where jumps are necessary. </li><li>  <i>Weapon</i>  In the first, it is infa how many people and how to fight.  The sound helps to count shots / rewind from the Railgun.  There was a sense of bullet from the automatics and then suddenly pull out a rocket launcher.

When the enemy team brings down the dragon, he squeals at the last breath.

But it turns out that most of us are wrong.  ‚ÄúWillie Steamer‚Äù was preceded by another cartoon with Mickey Mouse called ‚ÄúCrazy Plane‚Äù (eng. - Plane Crazy), released six months earlier.  What was so special about ‚ÄúWillie Steamer‚Äù that we remembered it as the first appearance of Mickey on the screens?  Technology.  In particular, ‚ÄúParakhodik Willie‚Äù was the first cartoon in which the synchronous voice was used.  And the sound was not a decoration - the whole cartoon was created around a synchronized sound series.  In the plot of ‚ÄúSteamboat Willie‚Äù, Mickey and Minnie play on different pets as if they were musical instruments.  It was cute, clever and fascinating, but without synchronized voice acting there would be no point.  This technology has become fundamental to the kind of experience that created this cartoon.

In the demonstration, two melodies are played - one increasing in tone, the other decreasing, and the notes are different for two ears - for example, the right ear hears the first note of the first melody, then the second note of the second melody, and so on.  Most listeners group high and low notes together, and it turns out that one ear hears first a decreasing and then an increasing sequence, and the second, on the contrary, an increasing sequence and then a decreasing one.  Our brain collects from porridge a more or less beautiful melody, which we ‚Äúpresent‚Äù to us.  In addition, if you are right-handed, then first you will hear a rising tone from the right, and a decreasing tone in the left, and vice versa if left-handed. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTKRR4IIdro&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhht4gU1ofR7UxqngV7LIkoYwnpthA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Increasing sequence</b> <br>  This illusion was discovered by the French composer Jean-Claude Risset.  The pairs of notes follow one by one, creating the illusion of elevation, as if on the piano you press the keys from left to right ... In fact, the tone does not rise, and if you immediately press the PLAY button again after the melody ends, the melody will continue, and so on to infinity.  But the tone cannot rise to infinity, unlike the illusion that our brain creates. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDI_YLrZzyE&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiS3GP00rcqFaB_oZ5PYpaYngF1RA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Phantom words</b> <br>  This illusion was first demonstrated by Diane Deutsch at the University of California, San Diego.  Recording features overlapping sequences of repeating words or phrases located in different regions of the stereo space.  When you listen to it you will be able to distinguish individual phrases.  However, in reality, no phrases exist.  It's just that your brain is trying to transform this meaningless noise into something understandable.  Usually there are those words and phrases that are related to what is on your mind. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUaYjanqT3Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgbMzybDRHJXz_pLREU1NyxLwHokw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48d/b33/71e/48db3371eec5adb04666bd961008a1bf.png" alt="image"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mushrooms are dancing</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtR63-ecUNo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDA0mILjRRLK-RyjK9pHAbliSgpg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8m5L2gqHPw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGqwbNcBqdNEBXgdOZA-wAL3apJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253919/</a></p>
