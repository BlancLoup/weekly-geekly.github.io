Now the main page of the service is a personalized showcase of movies and TV shows.  She clearly demonstrates what is on the box and what new items have appeared online.  In addition, with its help you can see the charts of popular films, thematic selections and the schedule of premieres. <br><br>  In addition to changes in the design of the site, there have been changes in its concept.  Now "Film Search" has become an online cinema and has become an aggregator of video content.

      ‚ÄúWe offer partners to distribute and monetize their content to our audience, and partners will share with us revenue from views - either partly from advertising revenue (from advertising within video content), or partly from paid subscriptions or content purchases,‚Äù Kommersant said. Head of Kinopoisk Olga Mansurova. <br><br>  Great hopes of the service developers are laying on a recommendation system.  Comments and user ratings will help to form a rating and will be the main factor for the recommendation system.  The more often the user will give ratings, the more accurate the recommendations will be, explained in Yandex. <br><br>  According to TMT Consulting, the Russian market of legal online video services with professional video content grew in 2014 by 58% and amounted to 2.6 billion rubles.  Of these, revenues generated by the advertising model amounted to 1.67 billion rubles, according to the paid model - 0.93 billion rubles. <br><br>  Restarting "Kinopoisk" can be a strong impetus for the further development of the market, Ms. Mansurova hopes.  ‚ÄúOnline cinemas are not so easy to constantly attract an audience, all players are interested in strong distribution, and our aggregation model helps them in this,‚Äù she believes. <br><br>  If market trends do not change and the online show market continues to grow, revenues from working with online cinemas may exceed the advertising revenues of Kinopoisk, Ms. Mansurova is sure. <br><br>  <b>UPD.:</b> Opinion of the founder of "Kinopoisk" - Vitaly Tatsiya. <br><div id="fb-root" class=" fb_reset"><div style="position: absolute; top: -10000px; width: 0px; height: 0px;"><div><iframe name="fb_xdm_frame_https" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media" id="fb_xdm_frame_https" aria-hidden="true" title="Facebook Cross Domain Communication Frame" tabindex="-1" src="https://staticxx.facebook.com/connect/xd_arbiter/r/d_vbiawPdxB.js?version=44#channel=faa53be9f1bdf&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.googleusercontent.com" style="border: none;"></iframe></div><div></div></div></div><script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-post fb_iframe_widget" data-allowfullscreen="true" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/tatsiy/posts/10200875475606224" data-width="466" fb-xfbml-state="rendered" fb-iframe-plugin-query="app_id=&amp;container_width=780&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftatsiy%2Fposts%2F10200875475606224&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey&amp;width=466"><span style="vertical-align: top; width: 0px; height: 0px; overflow: hidden;"><iframe name="f2c5aecdec4f5" width="466px" height="1000px" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media" title="fb:post Facebook Social Plugin" src="https://www.facebook.com/v2.3/plugins/post.php?app_id=&amp;channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2Fr%2Fd_vbiawPdxB.js%3Fversion%3D44%23cb%3Df1be33f49cd278%26domain%3Dtranslate.googleusercontent.com%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftranslate.googleusercontent.com%252Ffaa53be9f1bdf%26relation%3Dparent.parent&amp;container_width=780&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ftatsiy%2Fposts%2F10200875475606224&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey&amp;width=466" style="border: none; visibility: visible; width: 0px; height: 0px;"></iframe></span></div><br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>2:</b> And here is the statement that the Kinopoisk team distributed through the Yandex press service. <blockquote>  We foresaw that the reaction would be acute - from denial to delight.  So it happened.  When the project does not change over the years, the audience is keenly reacting to any changes.  For 10 years, both service capabilities and design trends have changed. <br><br>  Before rolling out the new version, from about May to October, we showed a closed beta version to Yandex employees, which is about 6,000 people.  For many of them, KinoPoisk is one of their favorite services, and we received a huge amount of useful feedback, which resulted in changes to the project.  After we worked with the responses inside, we went to the "outside world".  In the summer, the partners and the most active and loyal users of the service joined the testing of KinoPoisk, which is more than 1000 people.  Members of the team themselves answered questions from users; all wishes were constructive and very helpful.  Now we carefully analyze all appeals and try to respond to each.  Our main task is to do everything to help users get used to the new version, and to continue to develop KinoPoisk thanks to the ideas and wishes of our audience. <br><br>  The feedback we receive from our users can be divided into several topics.  First, some users did not link their KinoPoisk account with a profile on Yandex (the new version uses Yandex.Passport general authorization) and did not see their ratings, lists, etc. We tell how to link accounts - and all data appear.  Secondly, some users cannot immediately find their movie lists - in the new version they are in the ‚ÄúMy Cinema‚Äù section. <br><br>  Unfortunately, during the rollout, some users got into instability: some people saw errors, some could not log in.  These problems are already fixed, and the service is available to every user. </blockquote><br>  <b>UPD 3:</b> Users managed to convince ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù to return the previous design of ‚ÄúKinopoisk‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is what the company's press service writes about: <br><blockquote>  We apologize to all who have difficulties with the updated KinoPoisk, and, as soon as it becomes technically possible, we will open for users the version in the previous design on a separate domain.  This version will work until we make sure that we have prepared all the conditions for the comfortable relocation of all our users. <br><br>  At the same time, the ‚ÄúKinoPoisk‚Äù team continues to collect feedback: it is important for us to make sure that all new functions are understandable, and we have saved all the significant things that users have asked us for. Thanks to all KinoPoisk users for their indifference. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295182/</a></p>
