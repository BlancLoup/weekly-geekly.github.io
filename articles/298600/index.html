  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do if the presented keyboard broke</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a previous birthday, my beloved relatives chose the most direct way to choose a gift for an IT person and gave me a wireless keyboard.  In fact, not the keyboard, but the wireless kit from the keyboard, mouse and digital unit aka numpad.  All this together is called Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop and costs some gigantic money from my point of view.  But beautiful and at the same time completely useless for current tasks.  Well, they gave - and gave, more or less everything was heard about the gift horse, and the set itself turned out to be a very high-quality thing, both in appearance and touch.  The donated kit was obspepun, examined, strapped with the tongue and put in the closet until better times. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/818/552/c34818552cd04c9084eee76282e0c95d.jpg"></div><br>  The best times came in nine months, when it took to work remotely, and it was not very comfortable to fully program from the laptop keyboard.  A little bit, you can guide, but doing something serious is not a fountain.  Well, okay, we connect a large monitor, pragmatically purchased some time ago for the task of remote work, we get a mega-kit from the bins of the motherland, connect the laptop to the outlet and voila, the remote workplace is ready.  Work went, but something was uncomfortable all the time.  At first, I sinned on a nonstandard (for me) divided keyboard and mouse of almost spherical shape, but in the end everything turned out to be much more trivial - the space does not work in the keyboard.  Actually, there are two whole spaces, it is an ergonomic keyboard, but according to the law of meanness the left one, the one that I use when typing, did not work.  Moreover, this harmful key even occasionally worked, but not always, but in about three out of four cases when pressing the middle and about one out of four when pressing the edges.  It was not possible to rebuild oneself to use another space, so it was a brilliant decision to repair the device.  And since I myself try not to climb into complex and incomprehensible devices, because it is much easier for me to break a piece of metal than to fix it, the question arose of finding people with the right hands who are capable of such feats. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Ripping templates: Microsoft as the bright side of power </h4><br>  Remembering repeated success stories with Logitech technical support, I immediately called Microsoft with the words: ‚Äúguys, I have a broken keyboard here, let me tell you a serial number, and will you repair or change it for me?‚Äù.  The guys did not bother much and offered to turn to the store under warranty.  As you know, we need checks for the guarantee, almost a year has passed since the purchase, so the checks from relatives, of course, have been successfully lost.  Well, okay, thought the harsh Siberian lumberjacks, and went on to code on the laptop.  But the pain in the soul remained, for it is a pity to throw out - it‚Äôs almost-very-working, and it‚Äôs very inconvenient to use it in its current form, the flight of programming thought is constantly interrupted due to missing spaces. <br><br>  Another month passed, the splinter quietly grew to itself and at some point bloomed with violent color.  This moment somehow very successfully coincided with the next birthday, so, remembering that the standard warranty for most pieces of iron is a year, I started to look for unofficial repair offices with a clear conscience.  Practical service providers were greatly surprised at the proposal to fix the keyboard, offered to throw it away and buy a new one, then find out the price, fuck up and mumble something on non-standard equipment.  Finally, there was one service that I took to try.  To their credit, the guys immediately said that they would take money for repairs only if they could do something.  Alas, it did not work out, they took the keyboard, disassembled it, were happy with the modern technologies, collected it and sadly said that there, apparently, the mechanism was broken and it was not necessary to repair it, it was necessary to change it.  But they have nothing to change, the item is non-standard and there is no place to order it for them.  Unfortunately, I failed to realize my, as it then seemed to me, ingenious idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransferring mechanisms between spaces (well, let the right blank space that I do not work) does not work.  In general, a few days later I was back to square one - there is an expensive super-duper-mega-kit that cannot be used. <br><br>  But the spiritual splinter had already gone into a wild growth, and even a toad was unable to stop it.  Green, of course, tried, but it was not there, such trees no longer break.  Okay, let it not be repaired by non-official, but official services should be able to repair such devices.  This is Microsoft, this is not some Chinese.  So, a second call to technical support, and a surprise surprise - it turns out that you can buy a piece of metal from them, but you can no longer repair it.  Those.  repair the phone or Xbox - please go to the queue, on any software advise up and down, but the owners of mice and keyboards in orderly rows go into the distance.  Or they don‚Äôt go, because at this step the aforementioned toad entered the war: ‚ÄúGirl, I understand you correctly, you (as a company representative) consider to take $ 130 for the purchase of iron normal, but to provide technical support for the device during its life cycle - not necessary? "And the control in the head:" Girl, I understand that the situation is non-standard due to the lack of documents for the purchase, so I am ready to pay for the repair, just tell me where to bring the money? "Ops, there‚Äôs no place to repair such keyboards  in Russia.  "Then, perhaps, Microsoft will be able to replace the defective keyboard under warranty?", The impudent I asked ...

      It turns out that Microsoft can do anything.  Including such trifles.  After sending my coordinates (name, address, telephone number) and photographs of the kit from different angles, including different serial numbers from the keyboard, mouse and box, I received a confirmation by phone that within a few days I would be sent a replacement.  Why by phone?  Because the cute girl could not correctly write down my address (11 English letters with a dot in the middle on the server gmail.com), and for some reason, for some reason, I couldn‚Äôt respond to my letters (as it turned out later).  It's okay, I decided, the main thing is that after a few days I received a text message from UPS about my keyboard being located in the Vnukovo customs terminal. <br><br><h4>  The second part of Marlezonsky ballet </h4><br>  After receiving a text message from UPS and a voice confirmation that it was the very long-awaited kit from Microsoft, I had already begun to rub my hands, but it was not there.  UPS started playing postman Pechkin: "I brought you a package, but I will not give it to you, you have no documents."  Well, really, if you send a parcel worth $ 130 by mail and specify the customs value of $ 15, then any more or less sane customs officer will stand on it.  No problem, the UPS manager told me, this can all be solved very easily: all I have to do is arrive at the Vnukovo customs terminal from 10 am to 5 pm every day from Monday to Friday, run back and forth between UPS and customs, fill out a stack of papers and with a successful result, the next day I will bring the package.  Such a wonderful quest during working hours.  Welcome to reality, Neo, did you really think that everything would be easy?  And in order to be completely bored, there are 10 working days to solve the riddle, then the parcel will go back to Germany. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt even become maliciously interested in what I would have to do if I didn‚Äôt live in Moscow, but somewhere in the Urals (go to Moscow for the sake of sending O RLY?), But simply pleased the very nice girl from the support Microsoft that UPS offends me.  Well, yes, the girl said, they have changed the rules for the passage of cargo through customs, just from the first of January of the current year, so you are not lucky.  But nothing, you do not worry, we will now start the process of shaking up bureaucratic subtleties, and our next customers will be sending parcels delivered to their homes, but you will have to go to customs.  No, dear, but let's start this very process right now and the first customer to whom the parcel will come home will I?  And I'm even ready to wait a bit until you solve your bureaucratic issues with UPS.  The girl hesitated and offered to call back in a month, as earlier something is unlikely to be decided.  Well, we played in a civilized technical customer support and that's enough, let's go do a little real life.  I wrote a reminder to the calendar that in a month it‚Äôs time to call Microsoft, and went to work. <br><br>  Two days passed, and then the bell rang from UPS, which puts me in a state of stupor.  You know what, the manager tells me, we have some kind of global fuss here with Microsoft‚Äôs participation, so let me just change the price for the package to the one specified in the official Microsoft price list and send you the package.  At that moment, only one censor thought fought in the head - ‚Äúand what, was it also possible?‚Äù - and several obscene ones.  But pokerface saved the world and not in such situations: yes, of course, thanks for offering, let's do it.  Just send me a confirmation, the manager asks that this is a warranty replacement.  Yes, no question - a quick call to a well-printed technical support number, the first employee is caught and with short chopped phrases is encouraged to send mail with the necessary text, the postal address is spelled by the spelling of each symbol heard.  Hooray, the letter came to me, the letter went to UPS.  And a day later I receive a courier call, specify the delivery address and the parcel is finally in my hands. <br><br><h4>  A bundle of clever thoughts </h4><br>  Why did I write all this?  Well, first of all, in order to share a positive experience, this is an success story.  Secondly, as a boring and correct reminder that the documents for the purchase of more or less expensive equipment should be stored, especially if it is bought as a gift.  Thirdly, before starting to panic, it is worth exploring the warranty period for the selected piece of iron.  As I found out after the end of this epic, for most Microsoft Microsoft products, this period is two or three years, and in some particularly interesting cases, as much as five years.  So the movements with unofficial services were clearly redundant.  Fourthly, quite unexpectedly for me, the guys from Evil Corporation behaved extremely decently, in the style of Logitech technical support, even better, because no one asked me to destroy the original kit.  And finally, fifthly, you should always try non-standard approaches.  Now, of course, it is easy to say, but my heart feels that it was necessary to immediately offer UPS to change the cost of the package without my participation. <br><br>  PS By the way, I now have two identical sets of keyboard + mouse.  However, in one of them the left space does not work for the keyboard.  Maybe it can still be fixed? .. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298600/</a></p>
