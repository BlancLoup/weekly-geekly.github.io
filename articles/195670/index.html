  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google introduced the new search algorithm Hummingbird</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At a press conference devoted to the 15th anniversary of Google, a new search algorithm was introduced, which was given the name Hummingbird - ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù.  The name should symbolize the accuracy and speed of its work.  Representatives of the company reported that the changes were made to the search engine a month ago and cover 90% of search queries, but it was decided to coincide with the announcement of the transition to the new search algorithm Hummingbird for the 15th anniversary of Google. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e7a/d7b/c53/e7ad7bc5302c028e62f1612b516fc03e.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The press conference was held in the garage, where 15 years ago Sergey Brin and Larry Page laid the foundations for the future search giant.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a81/d47/d73/a81d47d73f7a71f7fb2b3b7a14c40d3d.jpg"><br><br>  Amit Sinhal, head of the search engine development department, said that this is an update of the search algorithm, perhaps the most dramatic since 2001, when he started his business with the company.  The previous major update of the search engine Caffeine was aimed primarily at increasing the speed of indexing information, and not at processing the collected information.  Hummingbird processes requests not so much for keywords, but also for their meaning.  Thanks to this, users can make longer and more complex queries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3fd/591/415/3fd591415ec7636acc91e49898646b8c.jpg"><br><br>  The need to change the search on Google is explained by changing the most requests from users.  If earlier search queries were formulated as short phrases with a large number of keywords, now many search queries are common colloquial phrases, sometimes quite long and complex. <br><br>  The second reason that necessitated the introduction of a new search algorithm was the development of voice search.  ‚ÄúRemember what the search looked like in 1998?  You sat down, turned on a bulky computer, connected to the Internet via dial-up, entered some keywords and received 10 links to sites that contained these words.  The world has changed so much since that time: billions of people are online, the Internet has increased exponentially, and now you can ask any question on a powerful gadget that fits in your pocket, ‚ÄùSingal said. <br><br>  Tamar Iehoshua, vice president of research, demonstrated the capabilities of the new search algorithm to understand related queries.  She invites Google to open photos of the Eiffel Tower, and immediately thereafter, without specifying what it is about, she asks the questions ‚ÄúWhat height is it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen was it built?‚Äù, ‚ÄúShow me the photos of construction‚Äù.  She then presented the results of using Google‚Äôs voice search to search for information about impressionist artists.  A fragment of the video presentation can be seen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24299870">here.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/120/b13/4c2/120b134c2f1b1baad3f605acfdba779d.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no way to compare the results of the search results "before" and "after" the introduction of a new search algorithm.  Although, Google gives a few examples. <br>  So, on the request of ‚Äúacid reflux prescription‚Äù (acid reflux prescription), a <a href="http://www.drugs.com/condition/gastroesophageal-reflux-disease.html">list of medications was</a> previously offered, which could be useless to users who were looking for general information about treatment and generally information about the need to take medications.  A new algorithm offers <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gerd/DS00967/DSECTION%3Dtreatments-and-drugs">this article</a> , which in this case will be more useful. <br>  The request ‚Äúpay your bills through citizens bank and trust bank‚Äù (payment of your bills through Citizens Bank and Trust Bank) used to lead users to the main page of <a href="http://www.citizensbank.com/">Citizens Bank</a> , and now a <a href="http://www.citizensbank.com/online-banking/mobile-banking/default.aspx">page</a> for paying bills is displayed on this request. <br>  The result of the query ‚Äúpizza hut calories per slice‚Äù (the calorie content of a slice of pizza hut) was pages like <a href="http://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/pizza-hut">this</a> , says Google.  Now you can get an answer directly from <a href="http://www.pizzahut.com/nutritionpizza.html">Pizza Hut</a> . <br><br>  Could it be that the new Google search algorithm has become worse? <br>  Here is the <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816">answer</a> to this question: ‚ÄúAlmost certainly not.  And although we cannot say that Google search has become better, we know that Hummingbird - if it was actually used during the past month - did not cause a wave of user discontent or complaints that Google‚Äôs search results had worsened.  People complain when it gets worse, but they often overlook improvements. ‚Äù <br><br>  Read more here: <br>  <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.ru/2013/09/fifteen-years-onand-were-just-getting.html">Fifteen years on ‚Äî and we're just getting</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-hummingbird-172816">FAQ: All About The New Google ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù Algorithm</a> <br>  <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-birthday-event-172791">Google Reveals ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù Search Algorithm, Other Changes At 15th Birthday Event</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24292897">Google unveils major upgrade to search algorithm</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195670/</a></p>
