The Association of Student Business Incubators of Russia launched the ‚ÄúTime to Act‚Äù educational program. <br>  The essence of the program is in distance education of students and active young people with the knowledge and skills that are necessary for starting and developing a business.  Training is an online broadcast of well-known speakers and independent work on the educational platform.  For better assimilation of information, additional materials and services are offered that are available on the Time to Act educational platform.  The program itself, tea, coffee and cookies are all free for participants in the filming in Moscow, as well as students and university staff who run this program. <br>  I attended all the classes, talked with the organizers and is exclusively for readers Megamind is ready to share my impressions of what this program is and how to take part in it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Location </h4><br>  Every Thursday we are going to <a href="http://timeforaction.pro/">‚ÄúTime to Act‚Äù</a> in Moscow City, Empire Tower, 53rd floor.  The place, I tell you, is fabulous.  Get out of the subway and get as if in another city.  The city of the future, where houses are more than 200 meters high, is like 20 five-story buildings to put on each other.  But the cars do not fly yet, but this is a fixable matter, they promised to present the first flying machine as early as 2017. When you take the elevator, you feel as if you were on a plane, sometimes your head is spinning and your ears are up, as the elevator rises at 7 meters per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a33/851/dc3/a33851dc37bc4348aabc96233ca368d1.png"><br>  Fragment of the film "The Fifth Element".

      I think this place was not chosen by chance.  As one speaker said, ‚ÄúTime to act‚Äù, Oleg Torbosov: <br><blockquote>  "It is very important to think in a non-standard way, to‚Äú break patterns ‚Äùand then you can get a very cool result.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Here the organizers exceeded all our expectations.  When you find yourself in such an atmosphere, you completely disconnect from reality and the focus remains only on the main thing - to get new knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/519/a7e/f4b/519a7ef4b2284c84bef4baaff52bfc35.jpg"><br>  Moscow studio ‚ÄúTime to act‚Äù, Moscow City. <br><br><h4>  Who are the speakers </h4><br>  At the moment, there were three classes. <br>  The first lesson was very ambiguous.  There were two experts and mentor "Skolkovo" Maxim Kiselev and Alexei Lukovenko, as well as two speakers of the program "Business-youth" Yuri Terekhov and Denis Kuznetsov.  The position of Skolkovo experts is close and clear to me, I and all my colleagues are engaged in technological entrepreneurship, but the business community is treated differently by the ‚ÄúBusiness Youth‚Äù.  I will not dwell on this in detail, there are many materials on the Internet about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/547/a66/a8c/547a66a8c43445548789cadf7306db5d.jpg"><br>  Picture from the community Business Youth "VKontakte". <br><br>  As the organizers explained to me, this approach was made specially. <br>  The task of the first module of the program (April-May) is to motivate young people to do business and for this you need to use all channels and all sectors of society.  Pass a broad front from the knowledge-intensive business to the business of "buy and sell." <br><br>  The second lesson was the battle of the opportunist Vitaly Vinogradov and the visionary Vyacheslav Semenchuk (a startup surgeon).  I talked about this in the article <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/26182/">‚ÄúWhy an investor refuses.</a>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/26182/">Work on the bugs</a> .  It was a real battle of two titans.  To summarize, the visionary is a person who creates new trends and directions, and an opportunist is a person who takes an unclaimed or poorly defended idea and tries to do business on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea9/a26/7ca/ea9a267ca8904f19a2ceda173bbbadc4.jpg"><br><br>  The third lesson was conducted by an entrepreneur Oleg Torbosov, unknown to me so far, who spoke on the subject ‚ÄúBusinessman's Helmet‚Äù.  He had a very fiery, motivating speech about how he was art director at a nightclub in the closed city of Ozersk, fled from the pursuit of drug dealers when he forbade them to come to the club and how he began to live from scratch in St. Petersburg, not having nothing but debt and the desire to succeed in life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/c5e/925/a61c5e92592e467b8eb591e85b3e224e.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, he is now a successful entrepreneur, owner of several businesses, and he has made great progress in terms of personal development, personnel management, and understanding of the world as a whole. <br><br>  During the formation of the business, he filled many lumps (which he described in detail), he has many innovative innovative ideas, and here I was surprised to find out that some of what he says I read in blogs on ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù, for example, about <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/testutor/blog/25882/">toxic relatives</a> .  Once again, I express my respect to the authors of articles on the Megamind, guys, you are all very cool. <br>  In subsequent classes, the organizers of <a href="http://timeforaction.pro/">‚ÄúTime to Act‚Äù</a> promise us many new surprises. <br><br>  And such meetings are a great networking, communication with new people, the opportunity to find a partner in the business, and maybe even a life partner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab6/cbf/32b/ab6cbf32bc764f59b1e64615b76ae1ee.png"><br><br><h4>  Lecture hall </h4><br>  Talk a little about the audience.  Currently, the program is developing mainly in the universities of the Russian Federation and some CIS countries.  Now, about 5,000 people and 50 people in the Moscow studio are watching each online broadcast, and new people are constantly joining this movement. <br><br><h4>  Profit </h4><br>  The first module, as I already wrote, is devoted to the motivation and choice of a niche, and, in principle, I did not learn anything new for myself.  However, such events held on a regular basis, give the very "magic kick" that we all need to start doing something. <br><br>  I think this is extremely useful.  As they say, water wears away a stone.  Some people decide to start doing business after the first lesson, another part after the second, the most conservative after the tenth, but sooner or later the critical mass will still accumulate and everyone will understand for himself that his purpose is not to sit in the office for 8 hours but take the risk and do what he likes.  If you already have a job that you like, you are incredibly lucky, but you still have room to grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/b7a/e74/baab7ae74966421998889bf117a86844.jpg"><br><br>  Here I am reminded of the speech of the President of the Association of Student Business Incubators <a href="https://www.facebook.com/borovik.nasulime">Dmitry Borovikov</a> , the author and the head of this program.  He says: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI worked in a provincial town, in a large bank, I held a good position there with a salary that many could envy.  Every day was similar to the previous one, in the morning I thought about when it would be lunch, in the second half - when the working day would end.  On Friday, I thought that finally at the weekend I would be able to do what I loved. <br>  At one point, I quit everything and decided to become an entrepreneur.  I moved to Moscow and now I do what I love, not only on weekends, but all the time.  I do not think about lunch or about the end of the working day, because what I do gives me great pleasure. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  The previous quote well illustrates the question of where the procrastination comes from, which has been so hotly discussed lately on the Megamind.  As Nikolay Krasnykh wrote in his article <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25842/">‚ÄúHow we earn procrastination‚Äù</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSlavery was abolished, but, in spite of this declared fact, Vasily cannot raise his fifth point and go to enjoy life.  He must be constantly under the watchful eye of the chief for all 9 hours, otherwise the free Vasily will be dismissed, and no less freely die without shelter and food. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8f/cfc/c65/b8fcfcc65cf145189d8a8687c430de98.png"><br><br>  For a bummer and a procrastinator, such work is best suited, but for idleness at work, are you ready to give up the expensive car, apartment, private house in a picturesque place, traveling with family and friends and going to a restaurant and other attributes of a beautiful life? <br>  Oleg Torbosov, for example, admitted that he doesn‚Äôt like to wash dishes, therefore he dines only in restaurants, uses Hubert for trips, because he will be served a car for a couple of minutes and he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about parking, and he also has 11 holidays year and do not need to ask for leave from the authorities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42c/732/5f4/42c7325f4b854638bb6b6a8a44c229ac.jpg"><br>  Profit or loss?  Choose you life, as they say one. <br><br>  Of course, entrepreneurship is not only freedom, travel, restaurants, expensive cars and elegant women, it is hard daily work, but if this work brings pleasure, it does not strain, but only energizes. <br><br>  Ready to start? <br>  It's time to act!  You can register for the next seminar on <a href="http://timeforaction.pro/">the program website</a> .  By the way, there you can also watch videos of everything that I was talking about here.  Good luck! <br><br>  PS Sorry for longrid, in short you can not write and do not divide into two parts =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300818/</a></p>
