  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lipstick as a tool of the candidate. America ... with a close look</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Upon completion of the three-day quarantine period, I open this note for all to see.</i>  <i>I was forced to close it because, due to the sharp devaluation of the ‚ÄúHabrava currency,‚Äù its three-hour open publication dropped me from 300 to 3,000 place in habrarating.</i> <br><br>  <b>Pitbull in a skirt.</b>  <b>So, not without her help, it is safe to characterize Sarah Palin, who appeared on the political arena unexpectedly for the overwhelming majority of Americans.</b>  <b>To some extent, a unique figure, at the last moment chosen by John McCain as a candidate for the vice-presidency of the Republican Party.</b>  <b>On behalf of a very aggressive shark subspecies it is also called Sarah Barracuda.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Politicians, political observers, and ordinary voters are now increasingly inclined to believe that the current presidential election is unusual.  For the first time, a black man really claims for the highest state post.  For the first time, a woman fought with him for a very long time and with great success.  For the first time, a person who is at the time of taking office for more than 72 years can become president of the country.  Not so often, and perhaps for the first time, the authority of America in the international arena so much fell amid the extremely difficult economic situation in the country itself. <br><br>  The choice of this completely unknown general public regarding the young mother of five children, the governor of a sparsely populated Alaska, the provincial state of America, is magnificent in its ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù plan and has drastically changed the course of the already very tense election campaign, adding additional elements of originality to it.  And not only because Palin is again a woman, second in the history of America, claiming to be the vice-president.

      However, after a few days, especially after Palin‚Äôs famous speech at the Republican Party Congress and in America, and around the world, they recognized that Sarah could turn fortune, which at that moment almost completely turned away from the Republicans, towards McCain.  And recent public opinion polls are a bit more confirmation.  If before the republican congress Obama was in the lead in all the polls with the advantage of up to 10 points, now this advantage has completely dissolved, in some polls even McCain broke free. <br><br>  And all this happens, by all accounts, only thanks to Palin.  And it began, in fact, all with her speech at the Republican congress, when she asked: ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between a mother of many children and a pit bull?‚Äù, And she herself answered ‚Äúonly with lipstick.‚Äù  True, she said not ‚Äúmother of many children‚Äù, but ‚Äúhockey mom (hokey mom)‚Äù, but the essence does not change.  Just hockey moms in America are called women, who usually carry their children in different ‚Äúcircles‚Äù in the morning, and then before they start work they manage to take them from there and take them to school. <br><br>  For a week, the topic of hockey mother (women of the people) and lipstick did not leave the media reports.  There were even clubs of lipstick and hockey moms society.  Barack Obama, who, despite his fiery speech at the curtain of the Democratic Party congress in front of 85,000 people, almost completely lost the attention of the press (McCain announced his choice a few hours after this speech - again, a strong marketing ploy!) something to do. <br><br>  And again came to the aid lipstick.  ‚ÄúBecause you put it on the pig,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit won't stop being a pig.‚Äù  A well-known proverb in America, however, in this case is clearly hinting at Palin‚Äôs last speech.  There was no limit to outrage among Republicans and fanatical supporters - Obama was accused of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù (they say he is a supporter of gender discrimination) and demanded a public apology. <br><br>  However, the accusations soon died out: after all, no one can ban the proverb, but he explained that he applied it only in the context of condemning the old economic policy of the Republicans, the essence of which his rivals are trying to hide with lipstick.  Nevertheless, Obama, although not for long, managed to catch the attention of the press.  Again all week talking about lipstick.  Only now they mentioned it not with the pit bull, but with the pig.  Nothing can be done, these are the laws of the genre. <br><br>  Well, and if you go back to the political struggle itself, then why did the appearance of Palin change the course of the election campaign so much?  About this and other interesting points of the current presidential campaign in the United States, I tell in my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D118197">iTech Bridge - blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39829/</a></p>
