  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hadoop and Automation: Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues! <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a68/93c/224/a6893c224e8a271beb8ba230ae2e1c06.png"><br>  For the last couple of weeks I have been working on an interesting (from my point of view) occupation, which was the creation of <b>Hadoop-as-a-Service</b> solutions for our company's private cloud.  First of all, I was wondering what kind of beast <b>Hadoop is</b> , why so often now are heard the combinations of the words <i>Big Data</i> and <i>Hadoop</i> .  For me, familiarity with <b>Hadoop</b> began with a clean slate.  Of course, I was not a <i>Big Data</i> expert and was not, therefore, I went into the point as much as was necessary to understand the processes in the context of cluster deployment automation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My work was facilitated by the fact that the task was formulated quite clearly - there is a cluster <b>architecture</b> , there is <b>a</b> Hadoop <b>distribution kit</b> , there is a <b>Chef</b> automation tool.  It remained only to get acquainted with the process of installing and configuring parts of the cluster, as well as options for its use.  Further in the articles I will try to simplifyly describe the cluster architecture, the purpose of the parts thereof, as well as the configuration and launch process. <br><br><h2>  Cluster architecture </h2><br>  What did I need to get in the end?  Such a scheme with architecture was available to me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ff/4cc/6be/7ff4cc6be3a756614e65252fce5ed6db.png"><br>  As I understood later, the simple architecture of a <i>bare</i> cluster (without <i>Hbase</i> , <i>Hive</i> , <i>Pig</i> and other third-party products related to <i>Hadoop</i> ) is quite simple.  But, at first glance, everything was incomprehensible.  Well, Google to help, and that's what turned out in the end ... <br><br>  Hadoop cluster can be divided into 3 parts: <b>Masters</b> , <b>Slaves</b> and <b>Clients</b> . <br>  <b>Masters</b> control the two main functions of the cluster ‚Äî data allocation and calculations / processing associated with this data. <br>  <b>HDFS</b> is responsible for data placement - <i>Hadoop Distributed File System</i> - presented in our architecture <b>NameNode</b> and <b>JournalNode</b> . <br>  <b>YARN</b> , also known as <i>MapReduce v.2</i> , is responsible for coordinating the assignment of tasks and conducting distributed computing.

      <b>Slaves</b> do all the <i>dirty</i> work, they are the ones who receive and perform tasks related to calculations.  Each <b>slave</b> consists of <i>HDFS</i> parts ( <b>DataNode</b> ) and <i>YARN</i> <b>parts</b> ( <b>NodeManager</b> ), respectively.  Each part is responsible for the corresponding function, whether it is distributed data storage or distributed computing. <br><br>  And finally, <b>Clients</b> , such kings of a cluster, who do nothing but submitting <i>data</i> and <i>tasks</i> to the cluster, as well as getting <i>results</i> . <br><br>  Hadoop is written in <i>Java</i> , so any component requires its presence.  The interaction between parts of the cluster is hidden in the depths of the <i>Java classes</i> , but only a part of the cluster settings is available to us by making the necessary settings in the right place. <br>  By default, the configuration files are in the path <i>/ etc / hadoop / conf</i> and are parameters that can be reassigned in a cluster: <br><ul><li>  <b>hadoop-env.sh and yarn-env.sh</b> - contains specific settings of environment variables, it is here that it is recommended to make settings for paths and options required by <i>Hadoop</i> ; </li><li>  <b>core-site.xml</b> - contains values ‚Äã‚Äãthat can be reassigned instead of the default values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the cluster, such as the root file system address, specifying different directories for <i>Hadoop</i> , etc .; </li><li>  <b>hdfs-site.xml</b> - contains settings for <b>HDFS</b> , namely for <i>NameNode</i> , <i>DataNode</i> , <i>JournalNode</i> , as well as for <i>Zookeeper</i> , such as domain names and ports on which this or that service is running, or directories needed to save distributed data; </li><li>  <b>yarn-site.xml</b> - contains settings for <b>YARN</b> , namely for <i>ResourceManager</i> and <i>NodeManager</i> , such as domain names and ports on which a particular service is running, resource allocation settings for processing, etc .; </li><li>  <b>mapred-site.xml</b> - contains the configuration for MapReduce jobs, as well as settings for the JobHistory MapReduce server; </li><li>  <b>log4j.properties</b> - contains the configuration of the logging process using the <i>Apache Commons Logging framework</i> ; </li><li>  <b>hadoop-metrics.properties</b> - indicates where Hadoop will send its metrics, be it a file or a monitoring system; </li><li>  <b>hadoop-policy.xml</b> - <i>Security</i> and <i>ACL</i> settings for the cluster; </li><li>  <b>capacity-scheduler.xml</b> - settings for CapacityScheduler, which is responsible for scheduling tasks and setting them in the execution queue, as well as distributing cluster resources by queues; </li></ul><br>  Accordingly, for our automation process, not only an <i>automated</i> installation is necessary, but also the ability to <i>change</i> and <i>create</i> this configuration without actually editing it on the nodes. <br>  The cluster was deployed on <i>Ubuntu</i> using <b>HortonWorks</b> (HDP) distribution kit version 2.0. *. <br>  To create the cluster, 1 virtual machine was allocated for each part of the <i>Masters</i> , 1 <i>Clients</i> virtual machine and 2 virtual machines as <i>Slaves</i> . <br>  When writing a <i>wrapper cookbook,</i> I used the ideas of the <b>Community</b> , namely <a href="http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/hadoop">this project by</a> <b>Chris Gianelloni</b> , who turned out to be a very active developer who quickly responded to the bugs found in the <i>cookbook</i> -e.  This <i>cookbook</i> provided the ability to <b>install</b> various parts of the <b>Hadoop</b> cluster, the basic cluster <b>configuration</b> by setting the <i>cookbook</i> attributes and <b>generating</b> configuration files based on them, as well as verifying that there is enough configuration to start the cluster. <br><br><h2>  Automate the deployment of Clients </h2><br>  <i>Clients</i> are virtual machines that provide data and tasks for the Hadoop cluster, as well as capture the results of distributed computing. <br>  After adding records about <i>HortonWorks repo</i> to the Ubuntu repositories, various deb packages collected for various parts of the cluster became available. <br>  We were, in this case, interested in the <i>hadoop-client</i> package, the installation of which was carried out as follows: <br><pre><code class="ruby hljs">package <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"hadoop-client"</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> action <span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">:install</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Simply?  It doesn't get any simpler, thanks to colleagues from <i>HortonWorks</i> , who saved system administrators from having to build <i>Hadoop</i> from source. <br>  The configuration for <i>Clients is</i> not needed, they are based on the configuration for <i>Masters / Slaves</i> (how the process of creating <i>configuration files</i> based on attributes is implemented in the <i>next article</i> ). <br>  As a result, after the installation is completed, we will be able to send tasks for our cluster.  Jobs are described in <i>.jar files</i> using the <i>Hadoop</i> classes.  I will try to describe <b>examples of</b> starting tasks at the end of a series of articles, when our cluster will be fully operational. <br>  <i>The results</i> of the cluster are added to the directories specified when starting the task or in the configuration files. <br>  What should happen next?  Further, after we send the task to our cluster, our <i>Masters</i> must receive the task (YARN) and files (HDFS) necessary to accomplish it, and carry out the process of distribution of the resources received by <i>Slaves</i> .  In the meantime, we have neither <i>Masters</i> nor <i>Slaves</i> .  It is about the detailed process of installing and configuring these parts of the cluster that I want to talk about in further articles. <br><br>  Part 1 came out in a lightweight, introductory part in which I described what I needed to do and which path I chose to complete the task. <br>  <i>Further</i> parts will be more full of code and aspects of starting and configuring a <b>Hadoop</b> cluster. <br>  <b>Comments</b> about inaccuracies and errors in the description are welcome, I clearly have something to learn in the field of <i>Big Data</i> . <br><br>  <b>Thank you</b> all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222485/</a></p>
