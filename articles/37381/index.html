In my previous post, the habr-community replied with almost half a thousand comments, which finally convinced me that the problem I identified really exists and is close to many.  Purely physically, I do not have an opportunity to answer everyone, although many comments were worthy of a reaction, and therefore I decided to write a sequel. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "... Let them shout:" Ugly ", <br>  And we like her ... " <br>  Y. Shevchuk <br><br>  There is a word Sputnik.  After October 4, 1957, the whole world recognized this word.  We were then the first.  When Ilya Kovalchuk scored his puck, we became world champions after 15 years of falls and failures.  When CSKA won the UEFA Cup in 2005, I could not refrain from tears, although, for obvious reasons, I have been a fan of Zenit all my life.

      I work almost every day with people who once went abroad and live there.  Overwhelmingly, they are very talented people.  Many of them studied here, and then finished their studies there.  Of course, first of all, the reasons for the ‚Äúleakage‚Äù are political ‚Äì economic, but there are also those who left because there is an opportunity to do science, which nobody here does.  I'm not talking about physics, not about mathematics, I'm talking about Computer Science. <br><br>  All the terms, concepts, technologies are invented there, and quite often by our own guys.  I am not a Slavophile and, even more so, not a nationalist.  Just sincerely worried about what I consider to some extent my own.  I think almost everyone knows that the proportion of code that is produced in Russia (in Ukraine, in Belarus, and so on) relative to all the code in the world is impressive.  Not ready to accurately assess, but I am sure that we are in the top ten, or even in the top five.  But, with all this, there are only isolated cases of truly scientific breakthroughs created here. <br><br>  Many in the comments on my last post wrote that all this is connected with the level of teachers' salaries, with the speed of development of the industry - I agree, but only partially.  Now you can really do science, teach students, and at the same time receive quite decent money, for example, on grants, and so many do, but these many are physicists, mathematicians (you can continue the list).  Among them there are no, or almost no, those who would be engaged in Computer Science.  And, in my opinion, in many respects precisely because the majority of officials do not consider this to be a science.  And not everything needs to be transferred to money, for example, in the spring I taught a course in IT to students for free, simply because at least something needs to be done if we want to meet adequate people at interviews. <br><br>  PS I went to the office today, in the car - Shevchuk's song ‚ÄúMotherland‚Äù.  The song was written, if my memory serves me in 1992, when there was almost nothing to be proud of, to be honest.  And we do not launch Sputniki in IT. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37381/</a></p>
