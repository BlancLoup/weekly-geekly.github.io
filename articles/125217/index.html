Despite the early days, the sun roasted unmercifully.  Sweat rolled in a hail from the freshly shaved tops of the recruits, the brand new form was smeared with mud.  The strap painfully rested under the scapula, but none of us dared to move under the watchful gaze of the impostor. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, salagi,‚Äù the prapor paced slowly along the line, a satisfied smirk did not leave his stern face.  ‚ÄúBut this was just a morningchek.‚Äù <br><br>  We were breathing heavily, our heart was pounding as if after a five-kilometer race.

      - We are all harsh here.  All the level.  Bank &amp; Finance.  Hard life  Heard about this?  - he abruptly stopped.  - I can not hear the answer! <br>  - No, no! <br>  - Nothing, hear.  Administrators unfinished.  Script writers.  Scripts, I ask, know how to write?  You are bespectacled.  Step out of order. <br><br>  For disobeying a direct order, the recruit shone for three days in the helpdesk, so I literally jumped forward. <br><br>  - Yes sir!  We are able <br>  - Tongue? <br>  - PowerShell, Comrade Ensign! <br>  - TEAM ensign.  Power, means, shell.  It is necessary so to call a body shirt.  All right, listen here, writer.  What you used to do for one domain will now be done for twenty.  God forbid - can you hear me?  - God forbid something goes to you offline.  In order to return, so as not to see you, intellectual. <br><br>  The sun was shining right in my eyes, and I was holding back with all my strength so as not to sneeze.  Here, on the front lines, awkward traffic could cost the admin life. <br><br>  - Okay.  Who can disassemble viruses?  Step forward. <br><br>  Three people stepped forward.  After hesitating, the fourth joined them - my neighbor in the ranks. <br><br>  - Well.  It means that there are rags over there, and a toilet over there - for dinner so that it shines.  We do not administer IP telephony here, who is not yet clear?  - Timprapor terribly bulging eyes, the wings of his nose fluttered like a mountain gorilla before mating.  - This is the landing squad Bank &amp; Finance operations.  Here you are not ... not here, in general. <br><br>  Minutes flowed, gluing together in a continuous stream, heated by the heat of the day.  I came to myself already in the barracks, after the third handful of icy water. <br><br>  - Hey, spirit.  There is no smoke? <br><br>  A polished tunic, a brilliant baldness and a mountain of muscles gave out an experienced administrator, at least the middle.  And even senior. <br><br>  - Yes, do not be afraid.  I will not hurt.  Been here long? <br>  - The second day ... sort of.  This ... I do not smoke, in general ... <br>  - And to hell with him.  Oh listen, he lowered his voice.  ‚ÄúDo you know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">penetration test is</a> ?‚Äù  Stay where you are! <br><br>  He caught me at the exit of the shower. <br><br>  - No, no, we are not animals.  We have no bullying.  At the operation time, in any case, the fellow laughed loudly. <br>  - Yes, probably ... this is what I wanted to ask.  What is it here? <br>  - Where? <br>  - Well.  In infopulse. <br>  - A. Yes, it is normal, - he patted himself on the sides, and took from his pocket some papers, neatly folded, but slightly battered in the corners.  Looking closer, I recognized them as an agit-poster and a leaflet with the gilded emblem ‚ÄúInfopulse‚Äù in the upper right-hand corner. <br>  - Here look.  ‚ÄúPay the salary,‚Äù he grinned.  - Pay, do not be afraid.  Further, "walking tours in Europe."  Pedestrians are not about us, they are about field services.  We ride the aircraft. <br><br>  While I was reading the flyer, he unfolded the agit-poster.  The inscription below read: "Join the Infopulse."  Three administrators in full gear posed against a BSOD.  Apparently, the battle has already ended - the sky was controlled by our aircraft.  A banner flying from above: Excellence in Outsourcing. <br><br>  - No, I saw the poster.  I hung near my house ... because of the fighters and entered. <br>  I sighed: memories of the house rolled over me.  Soft bed, red borscht for lunch, and no timpraporschikov. <br>  - What did you want to become a pilot? <br>  - Yeah.  On "efkah" fly.  If you know, Forefront Identity.  King of heaven <br>  - Nothing.  In the landing party, too bad ... <br><br>  We were interrupted by the prolonged roar of the siren, coming from the speaker mounted in the ceiling. <br>  - SLA alert stage 3, all staff ... <br>  - Sorry, the service is calling.  Do not get lost! <br><br>  A short brunette ran past me, with putty at the ready, and I was distracted involuntarily.  And when he turned back, my interlocutor was already out of sight.  It‚Äôs a pity ... maybe I saw him for the last time, but he seemed like a good guy to me.  But this is advanced.  One crazy ticket, and all ... at best, the infirmary.  I understood this, and took IT operations as is.  In all the harsh beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/097e92c3/90b5e383/08f64ca9/f1e2bc1f.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125217/</a></p>
