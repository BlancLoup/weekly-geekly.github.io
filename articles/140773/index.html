  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A selection of interesting arcade games for Android-smartphones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The resources of modern devices, as a rule, are enough for the most productive games with high-quality graphics.  But you will not play for a long time in three-dimensional races or shooters, your eyes will get tired, and the battery can remind you of yourself.  But seemingly unpretentious, but no less fascinating two-dimensional arcades - what you need to spend your free time somewhere in the queue or in the waiting room. <br><br>  The legendary Angry Birds with their success led not only to the emergence of numerous clones, but also the releases of a set of high-quality games, which are excellent alternatives to the certainly boring adventures of hapless birds. <br><br>  There are a lot of worthy representatives of the genre in the Android Market, and choosing specific games is not a trivial task.  However, after a long search, we would like to bring to your attention truly outstanding products, each of which is able to permanently exclude you from all types of social interactions.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, the wealth of the app store from Google is not limited to the arcades Greedy Spiders, Roll in the Hole and the wonderful ‚ÄúCrocodile Swampy‚Äù (the original name ‚ÄúWhere is my Water?‚Äù) Reviewed in the review.  If you prefer to spend time with another game of this kind, we will appreciate the indication of its name in the comments. <br><br><h2>  Greedy spiders </h2><br><br>  A classic arcade game that differs from colleagues in the workshop with just a few touches.  Among them is the possibility of choosing the quality of graphics (you can immediately fix the detail at the maximum value and take the time to play, there is simply nothing to slow down) and the presence of several tools at once to achieve the goal set for the player.  However, initially only the simplest is available, namely scissors.  What for?  It's very simple - the player is faced with the task to protect innocent insects from spider legs.  In order to cut off the trap master to the offensive and at the same time free the bugs, at first it is proposed to carefully cut off the web links with scissors, one per turn. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ca/4a0/031/5ca4a0031826dc17a678999938ee825c.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the future, they can be set on fire, isolating entire nodes, but everything has its time.  The game turned out pleasant in appearance, fascinating and sometimes forcing for a long time to ponder over the correct course of action.  After all, after each move, the spider moves in an arbitrary direction, and you need to watch its trajectory very carefully, avoiding a critical (within one segment) approach to any of your wards. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/caf/191/150/caf191150c2bf399fb2a5b910fca7508.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06c/2a1/d24/06c2a1d24c0270960cd16d0fa72c56fa.jpg"></div><br><br>  In order to avoid mistakes, the price of which may be too high, it is recommended to increase certain sections, but sometimes the available range is still not enough, and here you have to be careful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cce/8f7/09c/cce8f709c72987f56d1569255b50926d.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a79/146/9c2/a791469c29047af8a66e38f1c9269de9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Greedy Spiders begins as a simple game for five minutes, but after a dozen levels, puzzles begin to occur, requiring a certain concentration.  If you can‚Äôt get out of a specific web, the level is not forbidden to skip and go to the next couple. <br>  You can quickly turn off the sound not only in the settings, but also on the screen of the successful completion of the level, inviting you to move on or go to the general list. <br><br>  [ <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/065/099/aa0/065099aa04998e6c55011d9cebaedca8.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f71/e93/7f7/f71e937f72995841b5f2faeb5f8a2323.jpg"></div><br><br>  There are no traces of tight integration with social networks, but this cannot be considered a disadvantage.  It is much worse when an application starts posting on Twitter and Facebook numerous entries on your behalf, annoying friends and readers immensely, and all just because the first tickers were not accidentally removed when you first started. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/237/e1a/e14/237e1ae14c0f1a9479d96470c369933c.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5f/563/2ec/c5f5632ec3d65ab02f7405c4532642b0.jpg"></div><br><br>  The differences of the free version are in the display of advertising banners and the inaccessibility of the full set of locations.  On the other hand, if the game enthralls you, and the available levels seem small, why not thank the developers for an interesting and high-quality product? <br><br>  Free to install from the web market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.blyts.greedyspiders.free">market.android.com/details?id=com.blyts.greedyspiders.free</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/498/c8a/301/498c8a3018fb643adf2be732fa979b3a.gif"></div><br><br>  Buy the full version for $ 0.99 from the web market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.blyts.greedyspiders">market.android.com/details?id=com.blyts.greedyspiders</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab6/c12/6a7/ab6c126a7d4951871c7e6410e260df0c.gif"></div><br><br><h2>  Crocodile Swampy </h2><br><br>  Deservedly popular game from the studio Disney.  By now, an addon acquired inside the application has already been released with the adventures of the protagonist antagonist, the evil crocodile Krenki.  Nevertheless, a classic set of levels is able to bring a lot of fun, and in the free version they promise several unique locations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a1/c9d/6ab/1a1c9d6ab04826b91026d59bde2b38ff.png"></div><br><br>  The goal of the game, as many should already be aware of, is to help a cute green crocodile to wash himself, who is very different from his fellows in love of cleanliness.  With plumbing in the underworld, things do not matter, so that the path for the precious water will have to pave their own. <br><br>  In the process we expect a lot of surprises and additional gameplay elements, among which it is worth listing the activated fuses, various taps, valves and latches.  So that a set of points for passing the levels does not become too easy, at times, spacious locations are scattered easily recognizable rubber ducks.  To take them into account according to the results of passing the level, each must be filled with water, and given the limitations of this resource, it is sometimes necessary to think seriously, because the fluid may not be enough to achieve the main goal. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cc/485/06b/0cc48506b356cbc55635ec63bdd15fef.png"></div><br><br>  In addition to banal clearing the way, in the process you have to think about other things that are directly related to the success of your mission.  So, some key pipes or sections may be overgrown with moss.  From the influx of fresh water, it only strengthens its position, irretrievably wasting valuable resources.  The only way to cope with it is to pour out the bright purple acid stored in some reservoir in the vast expanses of the location, and then drain the residue beyond the level in order to prevent it from entering the water supply system. <br><br>  Some locations are placed on one screen, while often you have to think through a multi-pass combination, gently scrolling through the level using the bar on the left.  Any touch of the display in the place where the soil is located removes it, so be careful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1e/7db/b92/a1e7dbb92a8efdbe0144d06b5052edbb.png"></div><br><br>  Finally, an action plan has been drawn up, several lightning-fast movements have been made in order to minimize water leakage and the level has been passed.  Almost everything, but do not forget about the treasures, the probability of finding which is indicated by a question mark in the top panel. <br><br>  Of course, the faster and better the location is completed, the more points you get.  And if the water is constantly leaking on the road or trying to mix with poisonous acid - skip the level, you can return to it another time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b17/444/09c/b1744409c8a65ad96f8727f45ab21b69.png"></div><br><br>  On the side of the Crocodile Swoopy, of course, excellent localization, high-quality graphics and addictive gameplay.  Willingly, you want to move further, opening up one level after another.  And taking into account the relatively mild requirements for the opening of new plots, the game claims to be the leader among the so-called "time-killers". <br><br>  Free to install from the web market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.disney.WMWLite">market.android.com/details?id=com.disney.WMWLite</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d06/521/e22/d06521e22522a9622c6220d80816b221.gif"></div><br><br>  Buy the full version for $ 0.99 from the web market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.disney.WMW">market.android.com/details?id=com.disney.WMW</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/952/915/a7b/952915a7bfd0dba5167e1b189ef6dddd.gif"></div><br><br><h2>  Roll in the hole </h2><br><br>  In this arcade, the object of increased interest is none other than the main character.  Tell me, have you often seen a spherical bear?  We think that only certain analogies can come to mind, but not the representation of a living being.  The developers decided to go their own way and diluted the seemingly unpretentious fun with such a memorable hero. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf7/0b3/036/bf70b3036bd987449b263d1786c89e1a.jpg"></div><br><br>  This time the trophies are ice cream, which looks like an eskimo, and the goal of the game is to get into the tempting portal, flickering at the opposite end of the level, as quickly as possible.  Due to the fact that the character can move only under the influence of gravity, each location is perceived as a descent to the goal, and sometimes this process requires maximum concentration. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03e/c4d/afa/03ec4dafa3faa826de34f46eb96db4c7.jpg"></div><br><br>  Management is carried out in two ways, between which you can quickly switch through the pause menu.  This is an accelerometer, which brings to mind the well-deserved hits like Doodle Jump, and the actual touch screen, clicking on the right or left side of which will cause the panda to roll in the right direction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d5/c8c/5dc/0d5c8c5dcdf6b2b30b9317227bcd6d16.jpg"></div><br><br>  The sensitivity of the accelerometer may seem superfluous, it is not possible to configure it for use in the game, so the choice provided is good.  Unlike the situation in other representatives of the genre, the location is not closed, so that when you move beyond the edge of the level the character does not appear on the other hand, you will only politely be offered to make another attempt. <br><br>  The level completion screen contains the traditional buttons to return to their list, repeat and advance.  In this case, they are not duplicated by text signatures, but visual icons exclude the possibility of misunderstanding the purpose of the control elements. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ad/651/431/4ad6514319a0da3494ab9efd6dcbb30a.jpg"></div><br><br>  At first, the locations flash one after another, new elements gradually appear in them, but here comes a moment when a single level makes you linger a little, demanding accurate timing and trajectory.  But it is also realistic to overcome difficult moments, because the colorful decorations of the first world are only the beginning of a long journey consisting of jumps between portals. <br><br>  Unlike the previous defendants, the levels must be completed in a strictly established manner, at least in the beginning.  It seems that it will not create any special difficulties during the passage, but it is worth mentioning for comparison. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72d/3d9/53a/72d3d953ac9333fc4928a0737af95771.jpg"></div><br><br>  It would seem, is it possible to make a variety of the usual gameplay of a two-dimensional platformer?  It is possible, and how.  Bright and colorful Roll in the Hole convincingly proves this in practice. <br><br>  Buy for ~ 36 RUR from the web market: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.chillingo.rollinthehole.android.row">market.android.com/details?id=com.chillingo.rollinthehole.android.row</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d3/b67/93b/3d3b6793bc11690000eec40b498abcf6.gif"></div><br><br>  The considered representatives of the genre of arcade games are good, at least for several reasons - they are extremely interesting and exciting, sometimes even more than individual representatives of the world of modern 3D games.  You do not need to get used to the management or master the complex rules of some puzzles.  These arcades will help pass the time with taste, appreciating both the increasing complexity and the pleasing visual design. <br><br>  Without setting a goal to compare these, somewhat similar, but, no doubt, completely different games, we just hope that they will be able to bring you pleasure in those rare moments when suddenly there is a free minute in the life cycle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140773/</a></p>
