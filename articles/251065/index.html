Remember their unassuming design, the crowd of pensioners at the coin-receiver, the ringing of falling five-ruble - it fell three identical numbers, to the joy of the player and to the envy of others. <br>  The probability of winning a armless gangster varied from 0.95 to 0.98, depending on the owners' greed, and did not give a chance to enrich even the most successful players. <br><br>  The situation around the columns was heating up.  Relatives of playing pensioners protested.  Grandmothers squandered money fast and fun.  As a result, the devices were removed. <br>  Pensioners went home to grow tomato seedlings, and I wrote for myself an application - a column emulator.

      I repent, I loved throwing pigs, making all sorts of desires.  On the day when three sevens fell out (the maximum win is 200 coins) - Steve Jobs told the world about iOS. <br>  With the advent of a personal iPhone, I rewrote the application from Symbian to Xcode, from Epoc32 to Cocoa. <br><br>  And put it in the store for $ 1. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Good old OpenGL </h4><br>  Generally speaking, the application was written under OpenGL and used a single low-resolution texture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b2/ff2/991/3b2ff2991f4d452887bde9be24d587d3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The texture of the first application. <br><br>  The rules are simple - throw a coin and get a three-digit number in response.  With certain combinations of three digits, you return the money. <br>  The conditions for winning money are written on the side of an old pay phone.  Yes, nostalgia. <br><br>  Let's run from 000 to 999 and calculate the probability of winning. <br>  A simple calculation says that for 1000 shots we will earn 681 coins.  In this scenario, no one will play.  Therefore, the following condition is added to the game algorithm.  If 2 identical first digits fall out - the last one is thrown. <br><br>  Under this condition, it is already more difficult to calculate the probability of winning. <br>  I got 1079. <br><br>  That is, playing endlessly, every 100 coins bring 8 percent of profit.  Oh, another thing, interest in this game will not disappear. <br><br>  However, my interest in the application quickly disappeared.  The years have passed. <br>  I changed four iPhones and a couple of rented apartments, and suddenly I remembered my ancient application.  How much money did it bring? <br><br>  But how many. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/077/0fb/fda/0770fbfdab5547f19042c2f94ab2d278.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I looked at the screenshots of my ancient creation and was horrified. <br><br><h4>  Reincarnation game </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/358/e7d/af9/358e7daf9ed14431a31b73f702a69f12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The application was rewritten in two days, without using any OpenGL and other Unity. <br>  The design is stolen from some cartoon game (according to the method described in one of my previous articles). <br>  The payment was removed, put the advertisement (10 coins are given for viewing the advertisement), for which I apologize, five children require porridge. <br><br>  The new application turned out nicer and more fun. <br>  Code refactoring was solid, if not 100 percent, then about. <br>  The animation is done by native SDKs. <br>  Three-dimensional rotation of the coin around the axis - drawing 8 sprites. <br>  The shadow of a girl running through borrowed from the network, 6 sprites. <br>  Stars and coins fall under the action of gravity with g = 4.0 m / s * s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7e/3b7/1f8/e7e3b71f8d884822bc428096eb8ba50a.png" alt="image"><br>  For full-screen advertising I use Chartboost, the average advertising income is $ 2 per week. <br><br>  I hope you enjoy the game. <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/777/id366970586%3Fls%3D1%26mt%3D8">Good luck to</a> everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251065/</a></p>
