If you, like us, reading Habr, do not forget to flip through and Hicktimes, then you probably know that for two years already, M.Video has been running its <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/">blog about gadgets there</a> .  But rabbits are not only valuable fur, and M.Video is not only products on the shelves, but also a large IT team that deals with both external systems (for example, an online store) and the internal automation of the work of all departments.  And believe me, this is not boring: we use modern approaches and tools, follow the market trends and constantly try new things.  Most new: we are even preparing to introduce elements of artificial intelligence into the work of our network.  Therefore, we always have something going on for the first time: for example, now we are conducting a <a href="http://hackathon.mvideo.ru/">hackathon</a> for the first time.  And for the first time officially appear on Habr√©. <br><br> <a href="http://hackathon.mvideo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c7/803/63a/9c780363a53c4506a5b4be2891e350c2.png"></a> <br><br>  Hackathon will be on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the work of our services and sales.  It will take place next weekend in the Moscow office of M.Video, and you can apply for it until Friday.  Since this is our first experience of this kind, we have enlisted the support of reliable partners by organizing it in cooperation with <a href="http://www.iidf.ru/">FRIA</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> .  And the prizes will be not only money (150 000‚ÇΩ), but also the possibilities: more precisely, the possibility of concluding a development contract with the team that offered the best solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the winners in special nominations will receive an Xbox One S game console as a gift, so that there is something to rest with after the hackathon.

    <h2>  How it goes </h2><br>  Hackathon M.Smart will be held September 23-24 in Moscow.  We promise participants a great mood, friendly atmosphere, stickers on laptops and delicious pizza.  But most importantly, the team that offers the most interesting solution according to the jury will get a chance to sign a contract for its refinement and implementation in M.Video.  You can see how your solution works in four hundred hypermarkets throughout Russia and on the website with an attendance of 20 million people per month.  Not to mention the opportunity to grow as a project, having acquired in the portfolio of such a large (and loyal, honestly, honestly!) Client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30d/73b/7af/30d73b7afb364b99b71ddb0dde7faa82.jpg"><br>  <i>We even asked our supplier for pizza drawings, which we will feed you on the hackathon.</i>  <i>He sent it to us (actually not)</i> <br><br><h2>  Hackathon themes </h2><br>  The retail market is a ‚Äúeternal‚Äù business, on the one hand, and very competitive and dynamic on the other.  Therefore, we did not waste time on designing ‚Äúspherical horses in a vacuum‚Äù, but formulated very specific and urgent tasks for us now: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Assistant seller for the selection of goods in the store</b> . </li><li>  <b>Aggregation of reviews on the site</b> . </li></ol><br>  Already on the hackathon, you can choose for yourself one of these two tasks.  And you can do both if there is time and effort.  And we will not limit the participants in the choice of approaches and methods - use whatever you think is most effective for your decisions.  From our side, there will be experts and mentors on the site who can always help and answer questions. <br><br><h2>  Who will rate </h2><br>  The first hackathon we carry out together with experts from Microsoft and IIDF, therefore, among the mentors, experts and the jury there will be representatives of all parties. <br><br><ul><li>  Sergey Sergeev, IT Director, M.Video </li><li>  Evgeny Jamalov, Release Management Team Leader, M.Video </li><li>  Dmitry Sviridov, MSP Release Manager, M.Video </li><li>  Vladimir Litvinyuk, Head of Data science, M.Video </li><li>  Denis Doroshenko, Lead Developer, M.Video </li><li>  Mikhail Morozov, head of M.Video Internet marketing and e-commerce department </li><li>  Sergey Negodyaev, director for work with portfolio companies, FRIA </li><li>  Anna Fenyushina, Data Platform &amp; Azure IoT Technical Specialist, Microsoft </li><li>  Alexey Ternovsky, Data &amp; AI Solutions Expert, Microsoft </li></ul><br><h2>  Register for a hackathon </h2><br>  To get to the hackathon, participants must solve a test task - one of the challenges we face in our daily work, simplified to a certain level of abstraction.  You will see it when you <a href="http://hackathon.mvideo.ru/">apply</a> . <br><br>  Most importantly, have time to register before September 15 inclusive.  At the weekend, our jury will carefully review all applications and decide.  And on Monday, September 18, we will post a list of teams that have passed the qualifying stage on the hackathon website and will contact them to invite them to the final in Moscow. <br><br><h2>  Bonus for your gray matter </h2><br>  If our hackathon for some reason is not for you, but you still read this far, then we suggest you entertain yourself with a solution of three not too complicated tasks for programmers.  To the first 50 commentators who correctly answer any question below, we will give out promotional codes for a discount of ¬£ 1.11 when buying from ¬£ 3,000.  Use them in the M.Video online store, or present to close people.  <b>Winners will be determined in the evening of September 15.</b> <br><br>  <i>Rules: you can solve the problem in any way convenient for you.</i>  <i><b>The decision (if you recorded it), the program code and / or the answer must be hidden under the spoiler,</b> otherwise the answer will not be counted.</i>  <i>The first 50 people who solve problems will receive one promo code each.</i>  <i>In case of doubt in honesty or inability to justify their decision, we reserve the right to ignore the participant.</i>  <i>Play fair.</i> <br><br>  You can solve with the involvement of any tools. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 1</b> <br><blockquote>  Imagine a closed railway.  A train is traveling along it, the last car of which is connected to the first one so that inside you can move freely between the cars.  You ended up in one random wagon and your task is to calculate their total number.  In each car, you can turn on or off the light, but the initial position of the switches is random and not known in advance. <br><br>  All the cars inside look strictly the same, the windows are closed so that it is impossible to look outside, the train moves evenly.  It is impossible to mark cars in any way other than turning the light on or off.  The number of cars of course. </blockquote><br>  Describe the principle of counting cars. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 2</b> <br>  The task of logic and a little knowledge of physics. <br><br><blockquote>  You put a glass of water on a turntable disc and slowly increase your rotation speed.  Under what conditions: <br><ul><li>  the glass slides to the side; </li><li>  the glass will tip over; </li><li>  Is water splashing over the edge? </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Justify your answers in terms of physics. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 3</b> <br><blockquote>  On a deserted highway, the probability of a car appearing in a 30-minute period is 0.95.  What is the probability of its occurrence in 10 minutes? </blockquote><br>  We repeat the request the <b>decision (if you have written it down), hide the program code and / or answer under the spoiler,</b> otherwise the answer will not be counted. <br><br><h2>  And once again about the hackathon: </h2><br> <a href="http://hackathon.mvideo.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/112/69d/961/11269d961a7f4b299af4df1cf1344ee9.png"></a> <br><br>  Team applications are accepted until Friday, but if you need more time - write in the comments. <br><br>  See you in Moscow or again on Habr√©! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337844/</a></p>
