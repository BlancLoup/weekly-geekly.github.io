". <br><br>  But, not wanting to give up the habit of making money with the help of a surgical knife, in China, before the Olympic Games, they are trying to bring the legal basis for trade in organs.  This is harder than running a razor blade.  Or more precisely, on the edge of a scalpel.

      The Deputy Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China, Huang Jiefu, said in an interview with the Xinhua newspaper in an interview on March 26, 2007: about donation and the distribution of donor organs. " <br><br>  Until now, in China it is impossible to find out the simplest information related to organ transplants.  It was officially announced that organs of executed criminals are being used, however, some relatives of Falun Gong practitioners who were detained in custody stated that they had found surgical incisions and the absence of separate organs on the bodies issued to them.  No explanation from the authorities followed. <br><br>  Speaking at the III All-China Scientific Workshop on Liver Transplantation convened on Sunday in Tianjin, Huang Tszefu noted that since the 1990s, especially in the last 5 years, organ transplantation technologies in China have been accelerated and Chinese surgeons are able to do all operations of this kind carried out in other countries of the world. <br><br>  According to a report by D. Kilgour and D. Matas, until 1999 there were 22 liver transplant centers in China and 500 in 2006. Until 1998, 135 liver transplants and 3596 kidney transplants were performed there, and in 2005 - more than 4,000 and more than 10,000, respectively.  The increase in the number of operations took place simultaneously with the intensification of the persecution of Falun Gong. <br><br>  However, continued Juan Jiefu, a limited number of donor organs are far from meeting the needs of patients.  According to him, in the country every year about 1.5 million people need organ transplants due to functional disorders or the deterioration of their own organs, but only 10,000 of them can receive appropriate treatment. <br><br>  Clinic websites in China promise amazingly short waiting times for organs.  Within two weeks, a maximum of a month, they guarantee the selection of the necessary organ from a healthy one and, as the doctors answered questions by telephone, a young and living donor.  They did not find it necessary to conceal that Falun Gong practitioners were their donors (a record of these talks was attached to the report). <br><br>  ‚ÄúEncouraging the spirit of humanitarian aid‚Äù - this is, in the opinion of the Deputy Minister, the goal of creating a network of organ donation.  He also said that the State Council of China on March 21, in principle, approved the Draft "Regulations on the Transplantation of Human Organs";  The document has earned high praise from the World Health Organization. <br><br>  Here are the prices from the website of the China International Transplant Assistance Center: en.zoukiishoku.com (before this information was removed from it, after the revelations of their crimes began). <br><br><ul><li>  Kidney - $ 62,000 </li><li>  Liver - $ 98,000-130,000 </li><li>  Liver - Kidney $ 160,000-180,000 </li><li>  Kidney - Pancreas $ 150,000 </li><li>  Light - $ 150,000-170,000 </li><li>  Heart - $ 130,000-160,000 </li><li>  Cornea - $ 30,000 </li></ul><br><br>  Since the beginning of the persecution of Falun Gong, China has produced 60,000 internal organ transplants.  Moreover, according to the existing evidence, not one necessary organ is extracted from the donor, but all those that have a price. <br><br>  Human rights organizations can not accurately track where the money goes.  But if there is a possibility that some of these funds will be used for the Olympics ... Then only two options remain for athletes: either, as the government of Australia suggests, to boycott the games, or get used to the smell of blood. <br><br>  Source <a href="http://www.epochtimes.ru/content/view/9839/4/">www.epochtimes.ru/content/view/9839/4</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6501/</a></p>
