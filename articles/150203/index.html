      <b>The right things</b> - scram do not care if the right thing is being done.  The formation of a backlog is given to the merchant product.  The development team, by and large, doesn't care if they do the right thing or not.  There is a scapegoat - a product of a ouner.  With him all the demand.  The product of the ouner turns into a monumental figure, which should know everything about users, know everything about the market, know everything about trends, generally know dofig everything to single-handedly decide which product to make. <br><br>  Moreover, attention, <a href="http://agilitrix.com/2010/03/product-owner-and-customer-team/">quote</a> <br><br><blockquote>  The Product Owner </blockquote><br>  By and large, the success of the entire product is based on the product of the product.  If he has a file, it is not so important what cool beavers were in the team and what a cool test coverage on the project. <br><br>  <b>Things right</b> - scram generally do not care how it is done.  This is given to the team.  The main thing is for the team to get together and discuss what is right and how we can do things more correctly.  As a team, it doesn‚Äôt matter to Scram.  Scrum suggests the team is cool enough to improve their process.  Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  For example, a team without experienced developers can hardly quickly figure out what is good and what is bad. <br><br>  <b>Quickly</b> - scram don't care if things are done quickly.  As a team can - it does.  Maybe fast is great.  It can not - let's get together and talk about how to fix the situation.  For this we have a retrospective. <br><br>  <b>Although something good</b> - in fact, Scrum still gives something, it speeds up the feedback and strongly recommends creating cross-functional commands.  For a manager who has been waiting for the result of the project for a year, it seems like a miracle to see a working version with limited functionality after 3 months.  It became possible for him to poke the buttons and say that the system behaves unexpectedly here.  It became possible for him to influence further development and select features by priorities.  The reduction of the feedback loop is by and large the only useful thing that definitely gives Scrum.  Everything else comes directly from Scrum-trainers, from their personal experience and vision of the software development process. <br><br>  Due to the apparent simplicity of the process, Scrum seemed very attractive to many managers.  But for an inexperienced team without external consultants to improve their process based on Scrum is quite difficult.  This is a time consuming and lengthy process that can take years. <br><br>  Scrum itself is not a strong innovation.  He was just lucky.  Extreme programming contains almost the same things, but has not received such popularity.  Scrum was commercialized and managed, through marketing, to become the number 1 methodology in the agile world.  Nevertheless, it serves as a good basis for developing and building your own processes.  With a certain refinement by a file (or rather tuning), Scrum can be turned into a workable development process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150203/</a></p>
