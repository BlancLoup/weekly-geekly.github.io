At the same time with the first news, Yandex published a traditional study of the Russian blogosphere ( <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/yandex_on_blogosphere_autumn_2007.pdf">PDF</a> , 1 megabyte).  From there, in general, we did not learn anything new: our average girl-blogger matured for a year (one would be surprised: only six months had passed from the previous study) - now she is twenty-two, and 75% of all diaries are hosted by the top five of <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/services/">the services rating</a> blogging from the same Yandex. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bc4/cdd/7b2/bc4cdd7b20642297486f9d76b7dee753.jpg" alt="    " title="The distribution of Russian-language diaries for blog hosting sites"><br><br><h2>  Zhezheshechka and licrushechka </h2>  From the same place, it became known that the average user of LiveJournal, despite the trend, remained a man of twenty-five years old - presumably an office worker - the nineteen-year-old girl is the author of an average diary on Liveinternet.ru - you need to think a second-year student.  So, one third of all blogs are supported by the two largest services, the audience is distributed - everyone understands whose diaries are on the servers of both companies, now it is not necessary to go from zhezheshechki to lirushechku and in the opposite direction with shouts "Fu, what a horror!" And "Oh, what boredom! ‚Äù, respectively.

      It's time to recall the second news: ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, after 7 months of closed testing, opened registration at Ya.ru. <br><br><h2>  Yarushchechka </h2>  It seems that Yandex tried to solve all the problems of LiveJournal and Liveinternet.ru: photo hosting service was integrated into the service from the very beginning, so that it was possible to publish pictures in one click;  here the social component is much more seriously thought out - connections, profiles and common interests - so that the blog hosting site can be considered a full-fledged social network;  All publications are correctly divided into four types - mood, photography, link and thought;  Friendlet is expanded by blogging from other services until the OPML file is downloaded;  an additional reward system works, not just the number of "friends."  At the same time with all this, it is possible to import your LJ along with all the records and friends. <br><br>  It looks like an ideal blogging service - modern and thoughtful to the end.  But Yandex doesn‚Äôt need only office workers or only students ‚Äî they need both, and some others who accidentally look in from a search engine, ‚Äúabout one-sixth of the world.‚Äù <br><br>  So, the mechanism of flowing user mass from LiveJournal and Liveinternet.ru (however, as long as they keep communities formed around services) is quite understandable, users are already <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top/%3Fusername%3Dya.ru">hanging out in the overall rating</a> , there are many bright ideas that will appeal to white-collar workers, bright design templates, ‚Äúphotos ‚ÄùAnd even the opportunity to publicly quarrel that they should appreciate the already notorious second-year students, and the advertising campaign has not yet begun, and the support of the First Runet Button has not yet had time to appear. <br><br>  It looks like I know who is not on the goat curve going around the top five services in five or six colorful PDFs with research on the Russian blogosphere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287460/</a></p>
