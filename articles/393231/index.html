MI Guitar is an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/19/magic-instruments-guitar/">electronic instrument</a> similar to a guitar, with buttons instead of strings on the fingerboard.  Each button corresponds to a particular chord, and the creators assure that everyone can learn how to use this tool in 5 minutes. <br><br>  Anyone who wants to play this instrument launches a mobile application that shows the lyrics - and instead of the names of the chords above the lines are the numbers of the buttons (the number of the button consists of the number of the key and the number of the button in this mode).  The application automatically tracks which buttons you have already pressed, and scrolls through the lyrics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fingers of the left hand press the buttons, and the right one hits (or sorts) the short strings connected to the sensors.  When you select a song or key, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the buttons may change, adjusting to the desired song.  Motion sensors are read from pseudo-strings.  The strings emulate a real guitar, without needing to be tuned.

The authors invented this hybrid between the controller for the ‚ÄúGuitar Hero‚Äù and the real guitar, trying to give people who cannot play to feel like musicians. <br><br>  Learning to play a musical instrument is a difficult task, requiring a lot of time, perseverance and purposefulness.  Most people quit trying in their first year of study, and tools get dusty in cabinets or put up for sale.  MI Guitar doesn‚Äôt look much harder than a controller from Guitar Hero, and it‚Äôs not difficult to portray a guitarist with it even to those who have never held a real instrument in their hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbc/b30/e27/cbcb30e27af6e0e133a6771fa798074d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, such a toy will not replace a real guitar, but it can be useful to those who like to sing and have not learned to play, as well as, for example, musicians who compose songs but cannot play.  The last idea was presented by Matthew Bellamy - a British vocalist, guitarist, keyboard player and composer, frontman of the Muse group, and part-time co-investor of the project. <br><br>  Bellamy claims that she enjoys using MI Guitar for writing songs - it is easy to record the melody that sounds in her head with her, without having to think about where to put your fingers.  At the same time MI Guitar automatically remembers the last 30 minutes of the game. <br><br>  Will it be possible to impress girls with the help of such a toy with the same intensity as it works in the case of a real guitar?  To answer this question, you can participate in the project and for $ 300 in the near future to get your own copy of the device. <br><br>  The instrument is equipped with a variety of convenient and additional functions, from highlighting the fret numbers to adjusting the sound.  To MI Guitar, you can buy a case.  The device's neck is easily detached for easy transportation. <br><br>  However, while orders are available to residents of the United States.  Campaign authors give foreigners the opportunity to reserve their MI Guitar for $ 50, so that when international shipping becomes available, pay the remaining $ 250 plus shipping. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393231/</a></p>
