  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to deal with customer loyalty using the website</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To get the subway, little tram into the ground to bury.  To get an effective Internet site, it is not enough to make a set of scripts and dump it into the network.  Internet service is not just a ‚Äúif-then‚Äù digital logic, it‚Äôs also a lot of work to integrate the system, check its reliability and carefully select the formulations that are used to communicate with the user.  Let's see how it is when people think about it not enough. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I returned from Krasnoyarsk, where I spoke at the Second Krasnoyarsk Conference on Internet Technologies (By the way, greet the <a href="http://www.weballiance.ru/">Web Alliance</a> and thank you for the excellent atmosphere of the event!). <br><br>  Flew back and forth from the former Siberia, now S7 Airlines.  Departure from Moscow in the morning, getting to the airport for a long time, given the reserve for registration, will have to get up very early.  Naturally - laziness.  And then - about a miracle, service!  The airline's website says that you can register online, starting a day before departure.  Great news! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And now we open the site, enter the e-ticket number, select the airport of departure, see our last name, register.  The next step is to print the boarding pass.  And here the connection with the site breaks.  We update the page, re-enter the ticket number - the site thinks for a long time: <br><br><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/SO_1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then suddenly he is stunned: <br><br><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/SO_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We repeat several times, but the result does not change.  We do not lose courage, we call in support.  The support report that ‚Äúapparently, some work is being done on the site now,‚Äù so the site is unavailable and they cannot go there either to send me a file with the boarding pass.  But that's okay - you need to arrive at the airport in advance and complete the registration there. <br><br>  In total, it took me about three hours to various attempts to register online, including several support calls, since  after long inquiries and attempts to log in, the operators recommended ‚Äúto call back later, it may work‚Äù.  Plus that time, which in the end did not manage to save money at the airport.  As a result, the declared service turned into something opposite. <br><br>  However, this whole article is not at all for the sake of complaining.  We have didactic tasks, and let's move on to them. <br><br>  So, what problems can we point out in organizing this online registration service? <br><br>  <b>The first</b> is that for some reason it was not possible to achieve stable operation of the service.  Either the bug was ‚Äúby itself‚Äù, which was a disaster, or, as the operators said, ‚Äúwork was being done‚Äù, that in general no door would climb, because  white day and quite a lot of visitors. <br><br>  Therefore, we <u>note</u> that if we launch a project that provides service to our clients, it should work ‚Äúin any weather.‚Äù  In other words, always, and always well and steadily.  Problems with the operation of such a project should be considered a critical event, and not to treat it calmly and relaxed (lie down, lie down, and get up ...).  Accordingly, the operator, faced with a problem, had to report it to the ‚Äúrapid response team‚Äù, and that, within the shortest possible time, the problem was resolved.  At the same time, all other operators had to receive notification of the problem and a forecast for the restoration of working capacity in order to promptly orient customers. <br><br>  In the above example, the service was not operational for at least 14 hours, specially checked late in the evening. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> .  Of all the possible ways to report an error, the most probably unsuccessful one was chosen.  Look again: <br><br><img src="http://www.marketing-audit.ru/netcat_files/Image/SO_3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They notify us in intelligible human language that they cannot process the request.  However, there are no explanations or assumptions about the causes.  Just "well, not shmogla."  What can the user think?  For example - that his electronic ticket "flew" from the base.  Why not?  Will this thought add peace to the client? <br><br>  It's funny that any unreadable technical message in this situation would be better - it would immediately indicate a technical problem. <br><br>  <u>We write</u> : Informational messages of the service should be as specific as possible and not force the user to guess and invent various horror stories.  In this case, the first part of this phrase could sound, for example, like this: ‚ÄúYour request could not be processed due to technical reasons.‚Äù  But this is not the whole phrase, so next is the third. <br><br>  <b>Third</b> .  User left alone with this message.  What should he do next?  "We could not process" - and what should I do?  The wording used sounds even somehow apocalyptic - we could not, and no one can.  And never.  The user is offered the only possible option - to leave (the ‚ÄúExit‚Äù button) and no longer load ‚Äúus‚Äù with their exorbitant requests. <br><br>  <u>We fix</u> : The error message must necessarily contain instructions for further action.  For example: ‚ÄúYour request could not be processed due to technical reasons, try to repeat it after a while.  If the problem persists, contact our support team. ‚ÄùAnd the buttons -‚Äú Repeat ‚Äù, returning to the initial form,‚Äú Support ‚Äù, leading to the contact page, and‚Äú Exit ‚Äù, since there is no way without it. <br><br>  <b>Fourth</b> .  In the above situation, both parties - the client and the operator of technical support, had a common tool, a web-based application, which, having blocked, prevented the first opportunity to use the service, and the second - to help in this matter.  It seems that when organizing such a service, separate tools should be provided, duplicating each other, allowing ‚Äúin manual mode‚Äù to bring the problem to a resolution. <br><br>  So, the summary. <br><br>  The title is not by chance the word "loyalty".  It is such ‚Äútrifles‚Äù as buggy, unreasoned services, in theory designed to make the life of the client easier, but in practice they create unnecessary problems and difficulties that affect the subsequent attitude. <br><br>  A client who has broken off in his expectations becomes negatively biased and begins to interpret all the manifestations of the company in this sense.  And broadcast your displeasure further - in conversations, in a blog, on forums.  Or in the didactic articles on marketing :) <br><br>  Therefore, remember that, declaring a certain service, you are not just doing a cool thing.  You are creating a new type of relationship, taking on new obligations, creating a new loyalty management tool.  Users satisfied with your service will become more loyal.  And recommend to others.  And vice versa - the opposite. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106139/</a></p>
