Therefore, acquaintances turn to me on any question that seems creative to them - from "how much will it cost to repair the foundation under the bath" to "how do you like my nails?" In fact, this is very cool, like Travolta - and in the movie to be removed and driving a Boeing for my shooting to fly, but I have a catastrophically lack of time to know everything in the world, for example.  And this is despite the fact that most of my life passes with an optical cable that is connected almost directly to the brain, through which all free clusters are filled with the necessary and, possibly most of the accompanying information.  For not one video design man is alive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Social groups </h3><br>  For several years now I have been periodically creating groups in social networks and testing them for self-completion.  That is, my ideal is an autonomous existence of a group of people according to their interests with a constant increase in traffic.  In general, the ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù formula is simple - a certain minimum of subscribers plus a lot of core content.  One of the discoveries was a group with pictures in the "It seemed" style (when at first glance the picture appears one thing, and when carefully examined it turns out something else).  At the time of the emergence of a group of similar communities did not exist, the group was distinguished by its rapid occupancy and user activity, the subscribers themselves offered pictures, two voluntary administrators appeared, the group was highlighted in the top queries for keywords in Yandex and Google, the subgroup with the top pictures by likes was born.  During the year the group reached 20k subscribers and was close to the ideal.  But the irreparable happened. <br><br><h3>  Loan day </h3><br>  In one day, going into the statistics, I saw a sharp drop in daily attendance from one and a half thousand to a miserable hundred.  The brain refused to believe in the irreversibility of the situation, but the understanding that everything was over was supported by an internal search for the social network by keyword in the title: it turned out that several such communities appeared at once with a large number of people, and the largest was about 800k people.  That is, the largest communities understood the topic and created similar ones to mine, in a few days bypassing my traffic at times.  At this point, it became clear that research is research, but if you want to save your work, you need independence.  In the sense - for the profile group of people your profile site.  But there was a lot of current work and there wasn‚Äôt enough time even for more pressing things - to go hiking with friends, go to the village with my father, etc.  And I postponed the creation of the site for an indefinite period.  The only thing I realized at that time was to register the profile domain name ‚Äúit seemed‚Äù in the zone of the ru.

    <h3>  Site </h3><br>  And now, after three years and one move from city to city, several months of work in Southeast Asia, a long journey across the Crimea, the birth of one child, cooperation with a dozen repair brigades, the capture of a large perch and one "what are we friends with? ‚Äú, Two factors came together - desire and some free time.  And I took the site. <br><br><h3>  Engine </h3><br>  Last year we received a sudden order for a website design for state.  organizations, I was interested in new sensations, I agreed and used Adobe Muse.  Adobe is close to me and feels - very cool, especially that the output is a ready-made site, not a prototype, but it is suitable for a presentation site with a small number of pages.  According to the results, the site was collected by a programmer (my own was a completely redesigned structure and design).  Earlier, I created several sites on WIX for different purposes, but even to me, a layman, it was obvious that the code at the exit from the visual designer would be full of unnecessary water. <br><br>  In general, the engine needed a simple, structured theme (adaptive, since the statistics in the groups showed that over the past 3 years the visit to the groups has finally moved from the PC to the phone), it is necessary to have simple free or inexpensive adaptive templates (taking into account the current financial status income = expense).  The eyes of the number of engines widened, panicked rushed in understanding the mass Wordpress rating and Bitrix.  But the cold search issued Altocms, and from it found its ancestor Livestreet.  I chose the first one, because free of charge "out of the box" was a suitable adaptive template.  I did not consider any additional criteria, I tried to penetrate into the forums of both CMS, but the keyword "tried". <br><br><h3>  Hosting </h3><br>  Everything is simple, the search is a price comparison, since it is too early to compare it with my knowledge for other indicators.  Hostiman seemed adequate with a free trial period of one month.  I don‚Äôt know if this has always been the case, but when I first launched the site myself, I was very pleasantly struck by this fact, I previously thought that there was a lot of difficulties.  Apparently, these are the most notorious big eyes of the fear of something new. <br><br><h3>  Design and content </h3><br>  The simplest design of the template arranged for me, made the logo in the form of a gradient orange-red letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù, I wanted it to be at the same time similar to the sign of the number Pi, as I plan not just entertaining (with ‚Äúit seemed‚Äù illusions in style), but also science-applied Content on the site: for example, on the one hand, I am attracted to the subject of robots, on the other - the construction of mobile homes is interesting. <br><br>  A few years ago, I saw clothes with Christian Audigier prints on American eBay and thought: ‚Äúthere it is!‚Äù A week later, driven by the desire to put people around on top in the beautiful, I already bought small lots of clothing from various brands from the USA, the UK and, of course, Of china.  After half a year, the disappointment came: premium clothing is a boutique, where people come once a month and buy one thing for a lot of money, the mass clothing is average black and white, and color clothing is a sport and around hiphop.  I was not interested in any of the niches, besides, due to the uninterrupted turnover through social networks, I pulled only the most boring - the mass one.  I chose to round out with buying and selling clothes, because through selectivity I realized that I was not interested in doing this. <br><br>  The choice between high traffic and really interesting things is here.  I do not want to slip into the trash, using the most primitive instincts of the audience - reactions to fights, insults, rape, degrading dignity, etc., than such communities usually sin (and it is precisely this content that extremely attracts with its resonance). <br><br><h3>  Search devil </h3><br>  The structure of the initial template is the so-called ‚Äúarticles‚Äù, that is, the topics are divided into topics that are called ‚Äúblogs‚Äù.  There were no complaints about the title ‚Äúarticle‚Äù: the first incoming analogue ‚Äúmessage‚Äù is something short, and more news, suitable for Twitter, the rest of the type ‚Äúpublication‚Äù is even more distant, and ‚Äútopic‚Äù is too general, can be interpreted as rendered on the first page, in the top, "publication" - too formally.  But to the ‚Äúblog‚Äù I felt internal resistance.  Blogs in my personal understanding is a personal thing, a certain column or a tape of messages maintained by one person, his diary, the event log.  That is, in this context, a blog can only be called a personal tape of one of the group members.  The remaining tapes must be distributed under a different name.  There were options "theme", "section" and in the end, a wonderful "heading"!  The rubric is derived from the Latin ruber "red" (meaning "red line").  See how accurately the word "rubric" defines division.  It is in the rubric that different people can write their articles on one given topic.  Headings can be new and traditional. <br><br>  Probably, this is not the most significant element of the site, but it seems to me very great that already at the first acquaintance with the site the user can intuitively understand where to look for a topic of interest to him. <br><br>  There is still a lot of work on optimization, tuning, and probably a lot of things, which I don‚Äôt know and don‚Äôt understand, but if my experience seemed interesting to someone, ask, I‚Äôll answer all questions.  I would be glad to offer other variants of titles for ‚Äúarticles‚Äù and ‚Äúsections‚Äù, and in general, any criticism is welcome. <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  All titles are not ads, I'm new and describe my personal path.  Surely what I found is the tip of the iceberg, which is more free, faster and easier in the underwater part (I really want to see this particular underwater part). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323874/</a></p>
