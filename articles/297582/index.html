Honestly, I expected something completely different, since the HSE business incubator <a href="http://pro.inc.hse.ru/">does not give money, does not buy ideas, and does not take a share</a> .

      Many are looking for ridiculous money: $ 10-15 thousand for developing a prototype and testing hypotheses.  You guys are students!  Time - heaps!  You have a team of 5 people.  Any sane investor or business angel will send you for 1-2 months to earn these small funds in the nearest McDonalds.  And only then, after creating the prototype, 3+ months of work in the market and entering the break-even point, it makes sense to look for venture capital investments for scaling. <br><br>  Perhaps this is a very early pre-planting stage and a potential business angel has come to terms with the fact that it occupies an honorable place in the <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246404">FFF</a> scheme (not family or a friend).  In short, it is difficult to understand where the student's initiative ends and the real business begins.  Previously, students participated in KVN, and now they are played in startups. <br><br>  I give descriptions of the teams that spoke and their answers to the experts' questions.
