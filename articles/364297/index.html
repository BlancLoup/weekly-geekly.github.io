And they are also part of this life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And a few weeks ago I decided to conduct an experiment for myself.  Is it possible to reduce these devices to a minimum.  I purchased a Nokia 515 phone, and an Apple iPad Air with a Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio keyboard.  But in this set I lost a common ecosystem.  Of course, these are just different devices and companies.  Although I was able to connect the Nokia phone through ‚ÄúGogol.contacts‚Äù with iPad.  It is quite possible to replace the handset with a small iPhone4S, and then the YaBBL ecosystem and even with it will remain.  But believe me, I am also very keen on holding a little Nokia in my hands.  This love is from the 90s.  I still have Nokia 8850 stored and working.

      <br>
      Time passed, and I decided to fantasize about the future of phones, and in particular, what I would like to see in my hands and pocket.  I do not remember exactly how I came to this device, but I liked it as a kind of future.  The quickest thing is that it is very often remembered now, as a prototype of the MOTO360 screen.  And in fact, the watch and this phone have the same parents - Motorola.  But technologies already allow us to go back a little and solder a bit of the future into the past. <br><br>  And now I'll start telling you how I see this project now.  To begin with, what I want to use in it, and then I will describe how I would implement.  You can already transfer the brain to the mode of criticism. <br><br>  As I said in the phone, you need to solder modern technologies.  These are TouchScreen, Wi-Fi, GPS (GLONASS - GLOBAL Soviet Navigation), Bluetooth, NFC, and QI charging.  I almost forgot ... the camera. <br><br>  Before describing the software I want to talk about the interface of the phone from the screen.  I will call it a hex interface for example.  The basis of the interface in sliding and pressing a finger (click).  But according to the given patterns. <br><br>  The interface can offer the user up to six icons.  Each has a concise intuitive symbol.  To use it, the user touches it with a finger and pulls it in the opposite direction.  To indicate the opposite side, I suggested some navigators, a lot of examples can be drawn from the designers of watches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e5/38f/c47/2e538fc477d2f129c09c2a60473713ca.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After this movement, the picture changes smoothly on the screen.  In the video, I created a kind of animation, where the outgoing screen pulls the comer along.  The information itself can be arranged on a transparent basis, and during the screen change the background can smoothly change its color or picture. <br><br>  If the software requires the user to show the list, then it can be issued in this form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa2/fb7/001/aa2fb700173544f48b759acf83e1a2ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The interface offers a list, and below the semi-transparent b / w icon hints that you can scroll through it.  After selection, the user swipes his finger from the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù icon in the opposite direction.  I want to note that I specially placed the ‚Äúundo‚Äù icon on the opposite side of ‚ÄúOK‚Äù and at the top of the menu.  This will solve the problem of ‚Äúnot intelligible‚Äù movement with your finger.  As well as will let the user understand the opposite tasks of the called actions.  If the list assumes a multiple selection from the menu, then clicking on the same ‚Äúb / w icon‚Äù will help to ‚Äúremember‚Äù the selection and the user will continue to scroll through the list. <br><br>  Even the basel is a sensor with a circular motion on it, you can change the value of volume, brightness or other ‚Äúlevels‚Äù (progress bar). <br><br>  My list of software can be supplemented to a million applications from any AppStora, but this is how I see it in my ‚Äúsimple‚Äù phone.  And all these applications are necessary and can be reduced to the minimum for informative and design form.  Now I will try to describe how they should work and look. <br><br>  <b>Dialer</b> <br>  It seems that everything is simple from the very beginning of the era of phones, and mobile in particular.  Only now the phones have voice search and commands.  And if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking, then an intuitive search in the ‚Äúaddress book‚Äù.  Actually this is the old and good T9 only in wider distribution.  But if the system is able to recognize your voice and find a match in the address book, and we already know that by the command ‚Äúcall your beloved‚Äù, the phone will ring ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù, then I just have to open the phone, say this command and wait.  The phone has another chip for the dialer.  Suppose I work, and I need to call someone, or rather call.  Modern networks have technical codes.  When there is a ‚Äúcall‚Äù, when a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù, or ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù.  If you listen to someone's freaking call melody, then very often this is not seconds, but minutes.  Or the waiting mode, which happens more often, especially for those who do not want to talk to you - the insurance company.  I just dial a phone number or call from the address book with a voice and hear ‚Äúour call is very important for us ....‚Äù.  I press the icon on the screen, turn off and put the phone on the table, and he waits.  Waiting for ‚Äúpick up the phone‚Äù there.  And then the phone will signal that it‚Äôs time to talk.  I just lift the table, tear off the (rotor) apparatus and the phone turns on the connection.  And if I do not answer, for example, I went away and forgot, then they will already listen to ‚Äúyour call is very important for us‚Äù from my phone. <br><br>  <b>Messages and instant messengers</b> <br>  SMS, SMS, Telegram, Whatsup, Viber.  Here I am most in thought.  How to type texts, or rather large texts?  Until the end I do not see a solution to this problem.  Perhaps all the same swype based on T9.  The keys on my handset are not only mechanical, but also sensory.  Everything can be clarified only by genius and experiments.  I still think, and the dream I needed has not yet dreamed. <br><br>  <b>Navigation and maps</b> <br>  For me, the basis of the search is the voice.  I caught myself in the habit that in most cases I use voice search in Yandex.Navigator.  Very rarely have to enter the name from the keyboard.  In this case, more often with symbols, I‚Äôm not looking for street names, but organizations.  If the same ‚ÄúStarbucks‚Äù Yandex knows, then VoldKlass (as correctly pronounced WorldClass), he does not find immediately.  In Moscow, there are millions of organizations and sometimes you have to look for them through input on the keyboard.  Again, here I return to the unsolved ‚Äúinput problem‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Browser</b> <br>  I understand that in recent years, the Internet, as it is called, has been transformed by many.  Pages are complex and rich.  But the browser in the phone can serve both as the main and only one, if there are no other gadgets, or fast, to search for the necessary information in the way.  I suppose that on the way, when you urgently need a browser, this is more often a search for some information.  So on the screen of my phone a reasonable search engine can give me a concise short answer.  And why do you often use the browser on your phone?  I am ready to think more about its specificity of ‚Äúreduction‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Payment systems and banks</b> <br>  One of the few points that is solved simply.  Of course in terms of my hex interface.  Again, on the basis of an experiment on myself, I identified three programs that I use, and only two of them that I use often.  I‚Äôll say right away that I use PayPal from this list only to view the balance and confirm the payment. <br><br>  The other two are QIWI and Alpha Click.  I think that apart from the design there is nothing different in them anymore.  I look at the balance of different bills, look at receipts, pay bills for various services, and less often use full lists of recipients.  Initially I think that all of them will fit well into the hex interface. <br><br>  <b>Weather</b> <br>  Well, no comments at all.  Only the thoughts of interface designers.  The main screen is the ‚Äúcurrent GPS‚Äù position.  The remaining selected cities simply by a horizontal swipe across the screen.  Vertical, you can see the forecast for the following days.  I need it because of the frequent trips. <br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br>  Apparently this is the unsolved problem number two.  First, we need FB to view the news feed.  Secondly, for communication.  We have already put the second problem ‚Äúon a pencil‚Äù, like all messengers.  But from the first you need to think.  It is possible that you just need to simplify the output information from the tape.  For example, a photo tape can be viewed separately.  The same solution will close the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with Instagram.  But with a text tape need experiments.  Although the same Twitter and its 140 characters can be conveniently read on my screen. <br><br>  <b>Instagram</b> <br>  Well, there were squares, and after all your favorite vignettes there are still circles.  So with photo tape, we do not lose anything. <br><br>  <b>Music</b> <br>  The solution has long been found in smart watches.  The question is only in design. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  Actually here is a description of the phone.  All these software designs we will see soon on the round screens of the clock.  It is possible that soon it will be possible to call from the clock, as it was done on the HOT watch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efd/d15/a7c/efdd15a7c6a08fe0a41168b954ff2040.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But I still want Old School in the form of a good phone.  I think that its production will already be penny, as the Motorola Aura cost $ 2000. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364297/</a></p>
