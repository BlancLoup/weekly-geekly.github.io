      In the remaining sections you will find: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Study of the topic TsMIT in Russia, list TsMIT <br>  ‚Ä¢ Problems of the educational system.  What school do we need tomorrow? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video about the first 3D-modeling studio for children <br>  ‚Ä¢ Optimal scheme of work of TsMIT, business plan <br>  ‚Ä¢ Problems solved by TsMIT <br>  ‚Ä¢ Prospects for the opening of TsMIT <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weapons that children printed <br>  ‚Ä¢ TsMIT as a network project <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Relevance </h4><br>  <b>Caution!</b>  <b>Reality.</b>  The reality that is outside the windows of our apartments and the walls of houses.  The reality that offers us challenges that the state cannot answer.  Only we, progressive youth, can respond to these challenges. <br><br><h4>  Relevance of education </h4><br>  I worked as a teacher, teacher, organizer, head of the scientific and technical department, and acting.  Director in the House of Children's Art Oktyabrsky district of Yekaterinburg.  I created a 3D modeling and 3D printing studio for children and teenagers, which was extremely high in demand, especially against the background of other associations - macrame, aeromodelling, etc.  The video can be viewed below.  In the course of the work, we had to face colossal difficulties of an administrative-bureaucratic nature.  After analyzing them, I realized that the school system and the system of additional education are not just overloaded with bureaucracy, it is in a systemic crisis, which is caused by: <br><br>  <b>1. The isolation of teachers from the modern post-industrial, market and industrial economy.</b>  Teachers and teachers of schools are state employees who simply do not see, do not feel and do not know what kind of world they live in.  These are people of a long gone socialist era who simply cannot teach children to live in the modern world. <br><br>  <b>2. The institute of education is turned off from the production process.</b>  Pupils today are simply overloaded with knowledge that is divorced from reality, which are not applicable and even harmful.  The education system does not have the opportunity to get involved in the production economy - there is no legal basis for this, and if at least one school starts producing something, then the director will be charged with a criminal case.  Today's obsession with the USE kills everything creative in children, or kills their future, if the USE does not pass. <br><br>  <b>3. There are no strong players interested in the education system.</b>  Earlier, graduates went to industrial enterprises, but now they are simply scattered in small businesses, serving nature, with fully atrophied brains.  At best, they can open their own business.  Only the most talented can rebel against their education and defeat him.  Neither business nor state are interested in high-quality school education.  Well, and parents?  Most parents donate their children to school as in the ‚Äúchild custody bank‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>4. Failure of continuity of generations.</b>  The last strongholds of engineering knowledge - Soviet engineers are aging and dying.  Kalashnikov died today.  These people tried to pass on their knowledge, but now they are not.  Together with me, the only sports modeling teacher in the House of Children's Art in Yekaterinburg (designing ships, airplanes), Tropin Anatoly Petrovich, worked in Yekaterinburg, in 2013 he was 70 years old.  In the coming years, there will be no real engineers in the education system.  Schoolchildren already elementary there is no one to teach. <br><br>  <b>5. Young entrepreneurs have nothing to do at school.</b>  As already mentioned, the school does not imply ANY participation in the real economy, therefore, those who want to work there must accept the beggarly wages and the lack of the possibility of creative scientific and technical self-realization.  Adequate people do not go to schools, but oddly enough, technically schools are well equipped.  I myself saw whole racks of new kits for robotics, children's lathe-designers, which are waiting for their cancellation.  There is simply no one to work on the new equipment (MAOU Secondary School No. 128, Yekaterinburg). <br>  The educational structure of the TsMIT is deprived of the insanity of the school, and besides, as a factory of ideas, business needs. <br><br>  In any case, in the foreseeable future, the school‚Äôs institute will have to either be dismantled or modernized.  Perhaps he will be replaced by TsMIT. <br><br><h5>  Economic relevance </h5><br>  The world is now being completed, and according to some data, the process of globalization of the economy has completed.  The old economic system and economic growth was based on the expansion of markets; there was struggle and war for these markets.  Now that the world is global and markets can no longer expand, the economy is changing.  Until now, demand has exceeded supply, and now supply exceeds demand in the global market.  This means that the global market economy has come to an end.  There are many implications of this.  Let us dwell on those relating to Russia. <br>  Russia sells oil and buys products, things, goods.  As a result of falling oil prices, Russia will not be able to purchase these products.  In this case, there are 2 ways - either die, or develop your own production and create your own domestic market.  I see that a customs union is being created for this.  So, Russia chooses the path of its own market.  A huge advantage of Russia in relation to the developed countries is that the domestic markets in Russia are free for their own producer, and in developed countries they are already occupied, so they are waiting for a depression, but Russia is not.  Russia is such a country, which seems to be technically developed, but somehow it does not want to, the crisis will enter an acute phase, oil will fall, and will immediately want. <br>  The creation of the Center for Critical Materials Research is an anticipation of the situation and the creation of modern high-tech centers capable of becoming generators of the products of the new economy ‚Äî innovations. <br><br><h5>  Study of the topic TsMIT in Russia, list TsMIT </h5><br>  In Russia, the movement of creative laboratories, fab labs, TsMIT is gaining momentum.  All the centers are diverse, some of them are created by children on a voluntary basis, like clubs, some - at universities, as part of the innovation infrastructure. <br>  I will give a list of CMIT, schools of robotics and related areas that I have. <br><br>  <a href="http://makeitlab.ru/">makeitlab.ru</a> Ekaterinburg <a href="http://makeitlab.ru/">Hakspeys</a> <br>  <a href="http://lab115.com/">lab115.com</a> Yekaterinburg Creative Laboratory <br><br>  <b>CMIT</b> <br>  <a href="http://cosmoport.club/">cosmoport.club</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/xmashina">vk.com/xmashina</a> Yekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://cmit.ru/">cmit.ru</a> Tomsk <br>  <a href="http://fablab24.ru/">fablab24.ru</a> Krasnoyarsk <br>  <a href="http://fablabufa.ru/">fablabufa.ru</a> Ufa <br>  <a href="http://fablab77.ru/">fablab77.ru</a> Moscow <br>  <a href="http://fablabastrakhan.ru/">fablabastrakhan.ru</a> Astrakhan <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/fablabspb">vk.com/fablabspb</a> St. Petersburg <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/fablabpolytech">vk.com/fablabpolytech</a> St. Petersburg <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/nanoelectrolab">vk.com/nanoelectrolab</a> <a href="http://cmitnanolab.ru/">cmitnanolab.ru</a> Penza <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/club53985613">vk.com/club53985613</a> Penza <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/3dprint">vk.com/3dprint</a> Kazan <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/club32743379">vk.com/club32743379</a> Irkutsk <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/club20052635">vk.com/club20052635</a> Yeast <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/kids_a">vk.com/kids_a</a> Moscow <br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/132808813567898/">www.facebook.com/groups/132808813567898</a> Krasnodar <br>  <a href="http://www.lab3dprint.ru/">www.lab3dprint.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Schools of Robotics</b> <br>  <a href="http://robot.uni-altai.ru/">robot.uni-altai.ru</a> Altai Krai <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/loreby">vk.com/loreby</a> <a href="http://www.lore.by/">www.lore.by</a> Minsk <br>  <a href="https://it-schools.org/">it-schools.org</a> Ekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://legocomp.ru/">legocomp.ru</a> Yekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://robotural.ru/">robotural.ru</a> Ekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://mygenius.ru/legoroboti">mygenius.ru/legoroboti</a> Yekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://xn--90agrobbj.xn--p1ai/">robokod.rf</a> Ekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://robotcenter.ru/">robotcenter.ru</a> Yekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://pallada-deti.ru/">pallada-deti.ru</a> Yekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://ddtor.ru/">ddtor.ru</a> Ekaterinburg <br>  <a href="http://cgtarian.ru/">cgtarian.ru</a> Online school on 3D-modeling <br>  <a href="http://istracenter.ru/">istracenter.ru</a> Educational center of information technologies ISTRA <br>  <a href="http://ucs-ustu.ru/go/Uralskaja">ucs-ustu.ru/go/Uralskaja</a> Ural Computer School <br><br>  Most of the TsMIT are organized by initiative groups that aim to popularize scientific and technical creativity.  And most of them were founded in the last 3-4 years, this may mean that a new trend is starting - the trend of creating such scientific and technical laboratories.  The process is developing spontaneously, what is called "who is in the forest - who is for firewood."  Someone gathers in the evenings as a club, someone creates courses in robotics, someone innovates, someone simply executes orders for 3D printing, but somehow promotion and structuring still goes. <br>  Let me give you a video about my 3D modeling studio, which I created, it was rather spontaneous, but the experience turned out to be positive: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/apN5jkCrRqg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhEVa0J_mBtRXHWBrt84_LIt07gJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  The optimal scheme of work TsMIT, business plan </h5><br>  The business of creating a CMIT is a very bright, interesting thing.  This business of the future is the production of innovation and work with young people.  But even the brightest business stops or develops slowly, if interest is not supported financially.  The question arises: how to make your TsMIT profitable business? <br>  I developed and tested the organizational model of the work of the TsMIT.  When using this model, it is guaranteed that you can reach a positive turnovers in the first 2-3 months of the center. <br>  As an organization, TsMIT is a united center of three directions: <br>  1. Execution of orders for 3D printing, robotics, automation and other applied engineering surveys; <br>  2. Engineering school for children, adolescents and adults; <br>  3. Mini-production, producing small series of products. <br><br>  Education in TsMIT - subject.  Children at the training stage are attached to engineering, learn to develop and design equipment, acquire entrepreneurial skills, thereby learning and preparing for future adulthood.  But from the school of engineering a great benefit for other areas - the flow of ideas and the enthusiasm of children enormously helps in creating innovation. <br>  Direction 1 (Prototyping Center) is the initial base of the TsMIT - it brings a small stable income.  Direction 2 (School of Engineering) - generates income, but is mainly a factory of ideas for the production of innovations.  Direction 3 - (Mini-production) is the main organizational and financial part.  All 3 directions are divorced in time and space so that the safe operation of the center is ensured. <br>  For those who create TsMIT according to such a model, or in some other way, there is always the possibility of receiving grants and other fundraising activities.  In some cases, when the focus is on education, grants and fundraising can be a major source of income. <br><br>  <b>A sketch of a business plan might be:</b> <br>  1. Buying an average 3D printer <br>  Costs -100 000 rubles <br><br>  2. Implementation of orders for 3D printing (prototyping studio) and the sale of plastic <br>  Costs: Advertising -1000 - 3000 rubles / month Materials -3000 12000 rubles / month Revenues: 15000 - 100 000 rubles / month <br><br>  3. Conducting 3D modeling classes for children + teacher training and teacher employment <br>  Costs: - 5 000 - 25 000 rubles / month (rent, salary) Income: 5 000 - 84 000 rubles / month <br><br>  4. For participants, teachers, children, teenagers, there is an opportunity to produce small series of products - an innovative business. <br>  No cost Profit unpredictable <br><br>  My business went on payback, and then in a small plus already in 2-3 months of existence, there was no significant rent and advertising expenses, because the business is very mobile - I took the printer in my arms and went.  The class room is taken by the hourly rental.  Printing can be done right at home.  Who cares, he can conduct a study of the demand for 3D printing in his city and district through Yandex.  You can also see the market for additional commercial education in your city.  If there is demand, go ahead.  On the web, you can find materials and webinars on the topic of opening TsMIT as a business. <br><br><h4>  Social problems that are solved by TsMIT </h4><br>  Just list these problems.  If you see more positive aspects of such a project, please write in the comments. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Employment of children in their free time from school (prevention of drug addiction, crime, extremism); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Engineering education of children and the elimination of scientific and technical illiteracy of the population; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The problem of continuity of generations in engineering sciences; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The problem of engineering personnel in Russia and the transition to a post-industrial economic formation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The problem of the lack of social elevators and youth innovative entrepreneurship. <br><br><h4>  Prospects for the opening of TsMIT </h4><br>  When you open your TsMIT, it will immediately make you a tasty morsel for the media and state authorities.  authorities.  The media is very interested in everything unusual, bright, that may interest the public, including positive, such news also exists.  But the authorities need real actions - and you will only have such actions.  Thus, you become a prominent figure in your region.  These words can confirm those who are already engaged in this.  Further in your hands there are all opportunities for development wherever you want.  All this makes the opening of TsMIT a real social elevator, open now for engineers and teachers. <br><br>  <b>Weapons that children printed</b> <br>  In my studio 3D-modeling (Xmashina), the children came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhandheld weapons.  This is a crossbow shooting darts.  I deliberately did not interfere in children's creativity and allowed the children to independently solve the following questions: What to do?  What to model?  How to name the invention.  It was quite a bold experiment.  The experiment ended with the launch on the market of a new product called ‚ÄúYayestrel‚Äù pocket arbalest.  The eggstrel can act as an independent device and as an accessory (cover) for a cell phone.  I quote a screen of 3D models in an Iphone 5s case without a harness and metal parts.  It was one of the first experiences of children's invention, so one should not judge strictly.  The children simply spilled what was inside them.  Judging by the conversations of children, Yaystestrel is designed exclusively for firing at teachers, even for each teacher did a separate dart.  As a result, of course, not a single teacher was hurt - they regretted.  This information is provided solely to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.  A separate article will be devoted to teaching in my 3D modeling studio and the topic of the school of the future. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29e/954/83c/29e95483ce8e88cc2ed8888fd549bb28.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Figure 1 - Pocket Crossbow "Eggtrestrel" - Case for Iphone 5s</b> <br><br>  <b>TsMIT as a network project</b> <br>  I am ready to share my experience and knowledge in the organization of 3D-modeling and 3D-printing studios, as well as TsMIT as a whole. <br>  We will make the network structure of centers throughout Russia.  The centers themselves will be autonomous active units with their sites, legal entities, sovereignty, ideology, territorial and other features.  We combine information resources - interfaces for communication with customers, state.  structures, business.  Such a structure is more productive. <br>  Before you open your CMIT, think, maybe it should be immediately attached to the existing network structure, because it will significantly save your money. <br>  Let us consider the advantages of cooperation and the creation of a network company of independent centers. <br>  Savings due to: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reduced advertising costs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reduced reputational costs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reduced organizational costs. <br>  In the network structure it is possible to replicate your projects, it becomes possible to organize global projects, and communicate with like-minded people from other cities. <br><br>  Summing up, I will only say that I sincerely believe that the future of Russian education, youth innovative entrepreneurship and the industrial potential of the country depend on new forms of work organization, and among the most promising is the CITI. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207466/</a></p>
