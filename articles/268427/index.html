  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dynamic IP address for free or IP change when changing device to connect to network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Briefly about the main thing </h4><br>  This article is an ordinary Petersburger using a very unstable provider WestCall, creating problems on level ground.  As well as having an Internet speed of up to 100 Mbit / s (during peak hours it can sink up to 50 Mbit / s) and a static IP address (the service is included in the data plan). <br><br><h4>  The essence of the problem </h4><br>  While playing the game (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for the record), I noticed that by the 20th round the ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù and sound delays began (that's how I realized that, in addition to determining the coordinates of players and other logical things, the change of weapons (or rather the switching sounds) are sent to the client from the server).  At the same time teammates spoke normally, without any friezes and "e ..." "be ..." "me ...".  I check ping - 350-400 (my region is characterized by ping within 20 on European servers).  There was already a similar problem and I wrote off everything on my provider.  Then I remembered that technical support would require <a href="http://winmtr.net/how-to/">WinMTR</a> test data) and quickly wrote ‚Äústatus‚Äù to the console (after which I was ‚Äúkicked‚Äù with the error ‚ÄúNo Steam Logon‚Äù).  Copied the server IP and pasted in the hostname in WinMTR.  The results struck me: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  A list of 25-30 servers (usually no more than 10), 15 of which were listed as ‚ÄúNo response from host‚Äù, and, accordingly, had ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù equal to 100%. </li><li>  Usually, the local IP router (192.168.0.1) was in the first place in the server list, but now it was marked as ‚ÄúHostname is unreachable‚Äù (or something like that), which made it possible to worry about the router. </li><li>  WestCall servers had 100% losses (usually losses barely reached 1% after an hour of testing). </li><li>  The Valve server was also unavailable. </li><li>  Strange hosts have appeared with the names ‚Äúae5-334.RT.OV.SPB.RU.retn.net‚Äù and ‚Äúet010-9.RT.TC1.STO.SE.retn.net‚Äù with IP ‚Äú87.245.250.25‚Äù and ‚Äú87.245 .233.170 ‚Äùrespectively.  Retn.net is the site of the international backbone network, whose hosts mysteriously disappear when testing the connection with vk.com, yandex.ru and skype.com (and, therefore, are not used by my provider).  So why are "weird" hosts?  Yes, because I do not remember them in the list during previous tests of Valve servers. </li></ol><br>  Then I go to yandex.ru, after switching the Internet cable from the router directly to the computer.  It is more convenient to tell all the events in chronological order. <br><br><h4>  Chronology </h4><br>  [15:30] The browser, when switching to yandex.ru, first displayed the error ‚ÄúNo network access (ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED)‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúNo response from host page‚Äù. <br>  [15:35] The problem was solved, but instead of the web page, I was shown a provider‚Äôs page with a suggestion to enter my personal account (or something like that, in general, enter a subscriber number (login) and password) to continue using telephony services.  Standard procedure at the end of the session in the personal account of the provider, or its expiration. <br>  [15:36] Having entered the login and password, I make an attempt to enter.  Unsuccessful.  Appeared ‚ÄúAuthorization Error‚Äù <br>  [15:43] The error disappeared, I was redirected to the page for completing the current session, after which they demanded to re-enter my login and password (also a standard procedure, already used to it) <br>  [16:00] I managed to ‚Äúenter the Internet‚Äù, but now I switch to the DHCP settings page for the user.  It said that "Your IP address (172.23.XXX.XXX) does not fall within the range of user addresses" and the proposal to change the MAC address (they explained this by saying that "Your MAC address is not recorded on any of our servers" or something like that, since WestCall has a link to the MAC address of the device, and, as you remember, I switched the Internet cable from the router to the computer). <br>  [16:05] Change the MAC address bound to IP 172.21.XXX.XX (I did not immediately notice the discrepancy 172. <b>23</b> .XXX. <b>XXX</b> and 172. <b>21</b> .XXX. <b>XX</b> ) to the current MAC.  Saved <br>  [16:06] Oh miracle, I opened my eyes to the fact that I, by some <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">Robert Kayo</a> , had changed the IP address!  Only not so clearly explained: "Your MAC-address (such and such and such) is already tied to a different IP-address other than 172.23.XXX.XXX.".  At that moment, two <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">Supernovae</a> were born in my apartment right below me, in my own chair. <br>  Yes, I did it, I changed the IP, not getting up from my chair melted from two Supernova chairs ... <br>  [16:10] A provider is already responsible for my burned-out chair.  Verbatim: <br>  - Hello.  This is the kind of problem that I did, and called the data WinMTR.  Explain why and correct. <br>  - Good afternoon!  Now we have a massive loss of something there, most users cannot access the Internet.  Let's see.  Name your personal account and wait a minute.  [A minute later] Ah, so you have another MAC address tied to an IP (here my chair burned down 5 times), now the internet works? <br>  - [I explain to him that the problem is not in the MAC, but in the IP address] <br>  - Oh, well, I understand, I'll check it out.  Wait another minute.  [After 2 minutes] Check, please, now. <br>  [I go to yandex.ru] <br>  - With a sin in half, but everything is loaded.  Thank you bye. <br>  - All the best! <br>  [16:20] I switch the cable from the PC back to the router and ‚Äúgo online‚Äù. <br>  [16:21] I see the same error as at 16:00 - the IP address changed again.  In this case, it is possible to change the IP, just by switching the cable from one connector to another, I can not imagine. <br>  [16:22] All the same is repeated as at 16:10, but without switching the cable. <br>  [16:30] It may seem black magic, but after 1.5 hours of suffering, I, together with the provider, manage to solve this problem.

    <h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  If your IP changes with cable switching, do the following: <br><br><ol><li>  Dissolve a fire in your chair with a mixture of diazonium salts and diazo compounds in a dry state from point G. </li><li>  Call the provider and ask for compensation for material and physical damage. </li><li>  After his refusal, explain the essence of the problem. </li><li>  Wait for a good internet and a new chair in a week </li></ol><br>  <b>Addition.</b>  Using standard Windows tools, I managed to determine that IPv4 was still working, and IPv6 had the status ‚ÄúWithout Internet access‚Äù. <br><br>  Thanks for reading.  Sorry, that without pictures.  While I did not have the Internet, as you can see, I had no time for screenshots :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268427/</a></p>
