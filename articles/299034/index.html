  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selling as an acquaintance with a girl</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just want to note that <b>this is not the guide "How to seduce a girl</b> . <b>"</b>  This article on the example of a normal life situation shows that salesman skills are in all of us.  Information can be useful to doubters who want to try themselves in this area, as well as managers who are looking for ways to give confidence to newcomers. <br><br>  <b><i>Sale</i> - exchange of goods for money, confirmed by the contract.</b>  In other words, you get what you want in exchange for money or another equivalent that the other party finds acceptable. <br><br>  Few people thought that this term accompanies us from our first steps to the very end.  We begin to make deals in the nursery, where for good behavior or porridge eaten with appetite we get the desired toy.  With age, the needs and desires grow, and now, one toy is not enough, we want more.  Namely - there is that sweet, beautiful girl in the cafe.

      Gathering our strength, we go to sell ourselves to her.  Only here one porridge will not do, the process becomes more complicated.  After all, the difference from the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù educator who is interested in closing the deal, this client is of the type ‚Äúcold‚Äù.  He does not know you and perhaps does not want to know. <br><br>  In this example, I want to convey the idea that everyone can sell, because we get the necessary experience throughout our lives.  You just need to understand exactly how this happens.  In our case, we take the standard 5-stage scheme <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3bb/b8b/f48/3bbb8bf48e434cc2fc238700e2119ef0.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u><b>Greeting</b></u> <br><br>  <b>The effect of a first impression</b> is an opinion about you, which is formed by the subject in the first minutes of communication.  As a rule, it is almost impossible to change it in the future.  To our happiness with you, following only a few rules, the chances of moving to the next stage grow significantly. <br><br>  <b>Smile</b> <br>  It is not necessary to advertise your dentist and smile in all 32 teeth!  A light, sincere smile will be quite enough. <br>  <b>Make eye contact</b> <br>  Welcoming the person - do not hesitate to look into his eyes.  Just do not play, because too long glance can be mistaken for aggression.  We do not want to be mistaken for a maniac? <br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br>  These should not always be shoes from LOUIS VUITTON.  Enough to look neat, and a t-shirt with slices of last year's sandwich left at home. <br>  <b>And finally - the words of greeting.</b> <br>  Remove dry and annoying hello \ hello.  Instead, use a listenable phrase - ‚Äúgood afternoon‚Äù or in our situation the usual one - ‚Äúhello‚Äù will do. <br><br>  <u><b>Identifying needs</b></u> <br><br>  In short, this is getting the information you need.  Experienced sold, before the meeting will prepare these same questions, because he knows that what information he needs to extract from the client. <br><br>  <i>There are three basic needs</i> : time, quality and cost.  If you delve into this question, then of course they are much more, but they all boil down to the three factors listed above.  The main types of questions are also of three types. <br><br>  <b>Closed questions</b> - questions for which we get a short answer (yes / no). <br>  <b>Guiding questions</b> - questions through which we push the client to a favorable answer for us. <br>  <b>Open questions</b> - questions that get a detailed answer. <br><br>  Also, before you identify needs, you need to thoroughly examine your product.  Knowing all the pros and cons, you can make maneuvers and move away from uncomfortable questions or topics.  In this case, it will be easier, because no one knows about the person, better than himself. <br><br>  <u><b>Presentation</b></u> <br><br>  If you have reached this point, then everything is going well.  The interlocutor is interested in your campaign, otherwise he would have already stopped the dialogue. <br>  <b>Having identified the need - start selling.</b>  Only not the product or service itself, but the benefit that the buyer will receive.  After all, no one needs a non-working TV.  When buying it, a person wants to watch the matches of his favorite football team on him, and not just put it for beauty.  In the case of a girl, everything is a little more complicated.  After all, one cannot say in the first few hours of our acquaintance that if she chooses you, you will go to the cinema, cafe and fly to Egypt.  Talking about your hobbies, work or vacation, you are already putting into her head the information on which she draws conclusions about you.  What kind of relationship you will have depends on your desires.  It will be a marriage to the end of life or an easy affair - you decide. <br><br>  <b><u>Objections</u></b> <br><br>  <b>What is the deal without a doubt?</b>  With girls in the same way!  It is extremely rare that you hear <i>‚ÄúSilence you!</i>  <i>And make an order! ‚ÄùOr‚Äú Do not crucify, I fell in love with you as soon as you entered the cafe.</i>  <i>Here is my number and address. ‚Äù</i>  But doubts are much more common.  It is normal when a person doubts.  And do not persuade him, you just push him away.  At this stage, a person needs help to overcome these doubts.  Of course you can think of it yourself, but it is better to ask what are these very doubts?  And when he answers you, you will only have to parry the objections with facts, arguments and figures.  And against the stubborn fact you will not trample. <br><br>  <b><i>Closing a deal</i></b> <br><br>  <u>The final stage in which simply can not be blundered.</u>  After all, it will be a shame to get here and not get a phone number, right?  The most effective way is to give the client a choice.  More precisely to create the illusion of this very choice.  It is clear that you are not just come to chat.  But let the man choose himself.  This is very nice, do you also like to make decisions on your own?  So?  Just help him decide.  In the case of our girlfriend, this may sound something like this: ‚ÄúWe had a nice time with you, and since we still communicate, it means I was an interesting conversationalist.  If so, I would love to record your number and repeat tonight.  What do you think about that?".  In fact, you said the obvious things.  Only against the facts on which you have paid attention you will not trample.  Therefore, in most cases, you get what you want. <br><br>  <b>For dessert left a very important quality.</b>  The presence of this quality should be at all five stages of the transaction.  Confidence in yourself and in your abilities.  Believe in yourself!  You are the master of your destiny.  You determine whether you succeed or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299034/</a></p>
