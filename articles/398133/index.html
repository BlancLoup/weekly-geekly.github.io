      According to the website, <a href="http://satoshitalent.com/">Satoshi Talent</a> is the first blockchain recruitment agency.  For job seekers, service is offered by job vacancies and career prospects in blockchain companies, and organizations can find and hire blockchain developers and general engineers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://coinality.com/">Coinality</a> is a free service that allows employers to post vacancies with payment in digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin.  The range of activities varies from one-time projects to full-term long-term employment. <br><br><h3>  Market forecasting </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.augur.net/">Augur.net</a> is a decentralized, open source forecasting platform based on the Ethereum-blockchain.  Users get the opportunity to "invest" in one or another forecast regarding any event in the real world and earn, if it turns out to be true.  At the heart of the service is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe value and accuracy of the collective "wisdom of the crowd." <br><br><h3>  Distribution of multimedia and other content </h3><br>  <a href="http://bittunes.co.uk/">Bittunes is</a> developing an international solution that simplifies the distribution of music, aiming to return control of the works back into the hands of artists and their fans.  The platform uses Bitcoin as the main currency.  Artists and connoisseurs of compositions can earn Bitcoins automatically - this mechanism is built into the process of buying / distributing digital products on the platform. <br><br>  <a href="http://peertracks.com/">PeerTracks</a> is a platform for streaming and distributing (selling) music, as well as finding talent and organizing a community of fans.  PeerTracks allows everyone - content creators and consumers - to make money from music.  The service is based on its own peer-to-peer network called MUSE, which automates the main operational processes and eliminates the costs associated with them.  In addition to broadcasting and downloading music, the service also allows you to tip, patronize, and even trade musical scores of any compositions. <br><br>  <a href="http://jaak.io/">JAAK</a> is a decentralized platform based on Ethereum-blockchain, which, according to the description on the official website, aims to ‚Äútie together media, metadata and rights to content‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúcreate a decentralized market for media‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="https://paperchain.io/">Paperchain</a> is a decentralized tool for the standardized collection, storage of metadata and the exchange of this information between various participants in the music industry. <br><br><h3>  Network infrastructure </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> is a platform for creating and publishing next-generation distributed applications.  Ethereum‚Äôs capabilities can be applied or are already being used to develop, decentralize, and protect solutions in various areas of human activity: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company management, most varieties of contracts and agreements, intellectual rights, and even smart property, case of integration with hardware solutions. <br><br>  <a href="http://chromaway.com/">ChromaWay is</a> an open corporate blockchain platform based on the use of ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colored_coins">color coins</a> ‚Äù and an emphasis on enhanced security and scalability.  The ChromaWay portfolio has several customer cases dedicated to the implementation of decentralized tools and described on the website.  According to information from the same place, at present ChromaWay is also working to create a platform of smart contracts, allowing you to digitize workflows safely, simply and efficiently. <br><br><h3>  "Transparent" charity and socially useful activities </h3><br>  Charity programs are rarely able to provide donors with information about the effectiveness of a project, which creates barriers of trust and keeps many people from participating in them.  Fortunately, the Blockchain technology can be useful in increasing the transparency of charitable work, allowing sponsors and donors to track the real benefits that their funds bring. <br><br>  Among the interesting examples of companies that use decentralized distributed registries to manage charity projects and increase their transparency, we can mention a platform such as <a href="http://bitgivefoundation.org/bitcoin-charity-2-0-initiative/">GiveTrack</a> , created specifically for non-profit organizations that provide transparency and reporting to donors.  GiveTrack displays information about the results of the project directly and in real time.  Among others, such projects as <a href="https://helperbit.com/">Helperbit</a> , <a href="http://alice.si/">Alice</a> , <a href="https://startnetwork.org/">Start Network</a> should also be noted. <br><br><h3>  The property </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.ubitquity.io/">UBITQUITY</a> offers real estate, mortgage and testing companies the services of its own SaaS blockchain platform for keeping records of property and related property rights.  The platform is positioned as a parallel alternative to the inherited paper transaction management system, which allows speeding up the process of legal audit of real estate, increasing the transparency of transactions and trust through full decentralization. <br><br>  <a href="http://silvertown.tech/">Silvertown</a> helps home builders and large asset managers monitor their physical condition with smart home technology.  The information received from smart beacons and sensors is transmitted and stored in the blockchain, which ensures the integrity of the data and the privacy of the tenants. <br><br><h3>  Reputational ratings </h3><br>  Applying distributed registry technology to the feedback domain can lead to increased reliability of recommendation systems.  For example, <a href="https://www.worldtable.co/">The World Table service</a> launched <a href="https://openreputation.net/open-reputation-high-level-whitepaper.pdf">Open Reputation</a> , a quantitative reputation system for collecting data and forming trust ratings for individuals and organizations. <br><br>  As The World Table marketing director John Corosella explained: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe Open Reputation architecture assumes that the identification data and their ratings are indexed and, in some cases, stored using the Blockchain technology, which prevents their counterfeiting and eliminates the need to be owned by any one player.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://thankscoin.org/">ThanksCoin</a> - Ethereum-based Internet user reputation rating with built-in remuneration system. <br><br><h3>  Ridesharing services </h3><br>  One of the most important properties of blockchain technology ‚Äî the elimination of the need for a centralized management body or intermediaries ‚Äî can be the basis for creating a genuine interaction economy or its updated version.  The work of each such modern service is tied to a kind of centralized management.  Their transfer to Blockchain would allow to link supply and demand directly and in the most effective way. <br><br>  For example, in the ridesharing industry, Uber and Lyft are two dominant players leading the rest.  And both companies have built intermediary brands in such operations, which are trusted by both consumers and drivers.  In the near future, however, the developers of the next generation of similar services based on Blockchain can capture this niche. <br><br>  The ability to authorize the actions of a driver or a client without the mediation of Uber, and it is this service that young players of <a href="http://arcade.city/">Arcade City</a> and <a href="http://lazooz.org/">La 'Zooz</a> hope to offer, will save drivers from having to share their profits with popular centralized ridesharing services. <br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  Various options for implementing decentralized social networks (BCS) are still in the early stages of development.  Here are some examples of projects that have aroused the interest of professionals: <a href="http://datt.co/">Datt</a> , <a href="http://decent.ch/">DECENT</a> , <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora *</a> , <a href="https://www.synereo.com/">AKASHA</a> and <a href="https://www.synereo.com/">Synereo</a> . <br><br>  As reported in his review of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/social-network-bitcoin-facebook-youtube">CoinTelegraph</a> , open source <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/social-network-bitcoin-facebook-youtube">DSSs</a> offer mechanisms to establish communication between different remote servers using the same software deployed on them, ensuring high standards of privacy protection.  This is achieved due to the fact that data is stored and managed without the mediation of a certain central agency or company-owner, which is so characteristic of Facebook and other classic social networks. <br><br>  According to the forecast of the hot supporter of the DSS idea and the founder of <a href="http://productank.com/">ProducTank,</a> Anari Sengbe, the future of social networks <a href="http://productank.com/">lies</a> in decentralized platforms.  Sengbe, in particular, shared this vision of the situation: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDue to their characteristic mechanism of motivational rewards, decentralized social networks will become the norm in the near future.  ... The system of real rewards for likes will lead to the fact that whole generations of people who do not use Facebook will grow, because the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãobtaining psychological satisfaction as a motivator for actions will be incomprehensible to them. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h3>  Food Chain Certification </h3><br>  If <a href="http://www.everledger.io/">Everledger</a> and <a href="https://www.ascribe.io/">Ascribe</a> mentioned in the previous part work with diamonds and digital products, fighting against fakes and fraud, then the food industry has its own counterpart - Provenance.  This is one of the most interesting initiatives aimed at creating a transparent supply chain for all types of products at every stage of their life cycle. <br><br>  The company intends to achieve this by introducing Blockchain-based chain of custody certification. <br><br>  The creators of the service describe it this way: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAt any stage, the prototype of our model determines the key properties relating to all consumables and supplies: their nature (what it is), quality (how to describe it), quantity (how much) and ownership (to whom it now belongs).  Key attributes can be read and linked to previously defined data sets (such as barcodes) or assigned during work. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The company offers a system whereby each step in the supply chain can be recorded on the blockchain, which will allow for a safe audit of all transactions that led to the current state of the goods.  That is, for example, participants of the blockchain network Provenance can trace the entire path of transformations: from primary raw materials to the moment of selling the finished product to the consumer. <br><br> <a href="https://wirexapp.com/ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/329/5ba/c7b/3295bac7b7fb4687b452049ac5cec9bc.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398133/</a></p>
