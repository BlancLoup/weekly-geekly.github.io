      Almost all higher education institutions in France receive financial support from the state, which is why the cost of education in France is much lower than in other countries. <br><br>  The government provides significant financial support to higher education institutions.  The annual subsidy to universities for each student, both French and foreign, is about 10,000 euros. <br><br>  That is why the cost of studying at French public universities for French and foreign students rarely exceeds 300 euros per year. <br><br>  In state higher engineering schools the cost of education is about 600 euros per year. <br><br>  In other universities, in particular, in business schools, the cost of education is much higher and varies from 8,000 to 12,000 euros per year and higher. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Accommodation</font> </h2><br><br>  <b>Student residences Crous</b> <br><br>  French universities do not have their hostels.  All student dormitories are managed and managed by <a href="http://www.cnous.fr/">CROUS</a> (Centers R√©gionaux des OEuvres Universitaires et Scolaires). <br><br>  CROUS dormitories are located either on campuses on the campus or outside it. <br>  All hostels are designed for single occupancy.  The monthly fee at CROUS hostels varies from 120 euros for a regular room to 350 euros for a studio. <br><br>  It is worth remembering that the number of beds in CROUS hostels is limited.  First of all places are given to scholars of the French Government.  At the same time, many universities have agreements with CROUS, which allow them to reserve places for foreign students participating in inter-university exchange or inter-university cooperation programs. <br><br>  <b>Dormitories of higher schools or private educational institutions</b> <br><br>  Unlike state universities, higher education institutions and private educational institutions, as a rule, have their own hostels.  Although the number of places in them is also limited, these institutions of higher education are trying to reserve rooms for foreign students. <br><br>  Monthly payment: from 250 to 350 euros per month and above. <br><br>  If you are planning your studies in one of these universities, we advise you to familiarize yourself with their website for more detailed information on finding and booking accommodation. <br><br>  <b>Private residences</b> <br><br>  Private dormitories for students exist in most cities in France.  They are more expensive than CROUS hostels, but they have a higher level of comfort and offer all sorts of services (intercom, common living room, cafeteria, self-service laundry, underground garage, room cleaning).  Such hostels are located, as a rule, not far from universities. <br><br>  We recommend several sites for rental housing in France: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.lamyresidences.com/">R√©sidences lamy</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.estudines.fr/">R√©sidences Estudines</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.leclubetudiant.com/">Le club Etudiant</a> </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/b09/574/38fb0957470b48a3a80aba57c0006826.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Scholarships and grants</font> </h2><br><br>  In France, there are a number of scholarships and grants for foreign, including Russian students. <br><br>  <b>French Government Fellowships</b> <br><br>  The French Embassy in Russia has opened a new information resource on scholarship programs for study in France.  The new site is designed to inform potential candidates about existing scholarship programs and the conditions for their provision. <br><br>  Candidates for scholarships can find comprehensive information and submit applications on <a href="http://www.bgfrussie.ru/fr/Home.aspx">www.bgfrussie.ru</a> . <br><br>  If you are applying for scholarships of the Government of France and other scholarships listed on this site, you must register and fill out all forms within the specified time frame to apply. <br><br>  Online recording is simple and free: just create your own page with a login and password and select the scholarship programs you are interested in. <br><br>  The criteria for granting scholarships can be very different: your academic performance in a Russian university, knowledge of foreign languages, motivation and professional plans for the future are important.  That is why we advise you to pay special attention to completing the online application, on the basis of which the decision will be made. <br><br>  Important information: when applying for scholarships, you must specify the name of the French university in which you are already enrolled, and the name of the curriculum. <br><br>  <b>Erasmus mundus</b> <br><br>  This program is a chance for talented and energetic young people, who have been studying at a university for at least four years, to continue their education abroad - in several European countries. <br><br>  Students with a diploma of higher education (bachelor‚Äôs degree, specialist or master‚Äôs degree) of the state sample can apply for participation in the <a href="http://www.agence-erasmus.fr/">Erasmus Mundus</a> program to continue their studies in Europe and receive a master‚Äôs degree from European universities. <br><br>  <b>Global Education Program</b> <br><br>  The program on social support for Russian citizens who independently enrolled in leading foreign educational organizations and enrolled in them in specialties and areas of training, the quality of education for which meets the best international standards, and to ensure their employment in organizations registered in the Russian Federation, in accordance with qualifications obtained. <br><br>  At this stage, 9 French universities are included in the program: <br><br>  Universit√© Paris 6 Pierre et Marie Curie <br>  Universit√© Paris 7 Denis Diderot <br>  Universit√© Paris 11 Sud <br>  Universit√© d'Auvergne Clermont-Ferrand <br>  Universit√© Joseph Fourier Grenoble 1 <br>  Universit√© de Strasbourg <br>  Ecole polytechnique <br>  √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure de Paris <br>  √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure de Lyon <br><br>  More information on the <a href="http://educationglobal.ru/">official website of the</a> program. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Employment in France</font> </h2> <br><br>  <b>Work while studying</b> <br><br>  A long-term student visa and, in the case of its extension, a temporary residence permit in France (carte de s√©jour) entitles a foreign student to undertake professional paid activities, the duration of which should not exceed 60% of the annual working time (this does not require prior administrative permissions).  On average, a student can work no more than 18-20 hours a week. <br>  For information: the cost of hourly wages in the minimum wage (SMIC) is 8.71 euros gross. <br>  As a rule, students work in cafes and restaurants, bookstores, cultural and exhibition centers, libraries, etc. <br><br>  <b>Work in France after receiving a French diploma</b> <br><br>  Master in France sharpened to the requirements of the labor market.  Many students carry out their research projects within companies, where they continue to work after graduation. <br><br>  Russian graduate students of French universities who have obtained a state master‚Äôs degree or a diploma of an equivalent level of education may apply for a temporary permit to work in France for a period of six months (without the right of renewal).  This permit allows them to work 60% of the time of official full employment.  If the employer agrees to enter into an agreement with a foreign graduate of a French university on the profile of his diploma (specialization) and with a salary of at least 1.5 SMIC, there is the possibility of full employment;  In this case, a foreigner may apply to the prefecture with a request to reissue his student status to the status of an employee. <br><br>  All other Russian students (who, for example, did not receive a state diploma or received a diploma of a lower level) can also be hired by a French company and, accordingly, change their student status to employee status.  For this, it is necessary - after signing a contract with a French company or receiving a job offer - to go through a specific procedure for obtaining a work permit in France.  Each application is considered individually, and the conditions for issuing a permit depend on many factors, such as the profile of the candidate, the number of years he spent studying in France, the motivation of the enterprise, etc. <br><br>  It is also possible to work after studying in France, having received a special residence permit called Carte Competence et Talent.  It can be obtained by foreigners whose exceptional activities or work contributes to the economic, intellectual, scientific, cultural, humanitarian or sporting prosperity of France and their home country.  Permission to work in this case is given depending on the submitted project and is valid for 3 years with the possibility of renewal. <br><br>  More information <a href="http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/F16922.xhtml">here</a> . <br><br>  <i>Education in France offers many opportunities for students and graduates.</i>  <i>We hope that we have confirmed this with our article.</i>  <i>Very interesting direction - we recommend!</i> <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/5-mifov-ob-obrazovanii-za-rubezhom/">5 Myths about education abroad.</a> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289896/</a></p>
