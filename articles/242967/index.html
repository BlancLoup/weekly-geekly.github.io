Who, for example, will like a person who finds fault with trifles and constantly pays attention to minor inconveniences, instead of just enjoying life?  In fact, on the contrary, pettiness is priceless. <br><br>  Over time, you understand: to create something a little bit worthy, you need to stop putting up with even the most seemingly minor inconveniences of your clients.  Often, only parts differ from the gray mass of followers.  But they are important.

      We have <a href="">enough</a> competitors in <a href="">UBANK</a> , mankind has invented many ways to pay for services.  But we are one of the few who aims to create the perfect payment service for smartphones.  This encourages us to come up with more and more new ways to make life easier for users.  While others do not exchange small things, we try to dig into the details. <br><br>  Sometimes it becomes a shame that some people, having paid for the phone once, think that this is all that our service is capable of. <a name="habracut"></a>  Therefore, today we decided to talk about some interesting features of UBANK, which may not be obvious when we first met, although they can make life much easier for the user, and sometimes we had to break our brains over the implementation of these features. <br><br>  It's all the little things in life, you say, and you will be right.  But we believe that it is on such trifles that a truly cool service is built.  Stay tuned! <br><br><h2>  1. I write SMS myself, I read it myself </h2><br>  Gone are the blessed times when to make a transfer it was necessary not only to enter a password in the Internet bank, but also to load a digital key.  Today, the standard has become a much simpler way: authorization via SMS, which is rapidly conquering the world.  I drove the mobile number, waited for the message, entered the code - and it was done.  Conveniently, only can this method be made more convenient? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/5ee/fe4/6ce5eefe4c294a14a34ae5ed6742ab55.png"><br><br>  We at UBANK use this mechanics only once, when registering a profile, but in the Android application we managed to teach the application to read the code sent via SMS independently.  You do not need to go into the messages and type the cherished numbers that UBANK itself has just sent you.  The application itself will see that the code has come.  After you enter your mobile number, registration is automatic. <br><br><h2>  2. Photograph of your card </h2><br>  If you like to pay online, every month you enter your bank card details dozens of times.  Rarely does a payment application go without a Visa or Mastercard binding.  In principle, to enter this information is not so difficult: sixteen digits, the expiration date of the card, the code on the back side is ready.  After a few months, you can even memorize all this data by heart.  But for those who have not yet achieved such enlightenment or do not always fall into the correct numbers on the small keyboard, we screwed the scanner of the embossed cards (these are those with convex digits): just click on the camera icon, how the camera turns on, in a couple of seconds recognizes numbers and the application itself will fill in the required fields. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67d/a35/248/67da352482984380974144cfd153d2fa.png"><br><br><h2>  3. Reporting period </h2><br>  Probably at least once in our lives, each of us tried to accustom ourselves to financial self-discipline: to put all the checks and stuff the data into programs on a computer or applications on a smartphone, trying to get a general picture of how expenses are distributed at the end of the month.  How quickly - in two days or in two months - you drop the case, depends on temperament.  But the result is usually the same. <br><br>  A good payment application is required to give the user an automatic report on all of its transactions, doing all the boring work of sorting expenses for it.  This, in general, is obvious, but today only a handful of banking applications do such work well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7e/4a7/001/c7e4a7001f4b466189ab2872953fa0d9.png"><br><br>  In addition, if you use several cards of different banks for payments, the statistics of each of them is not very useful to you.  By connecting all your cards to UBANK, you will receive a complete picture of your expenses made through the payment service - without any effort.  We believe that in the future more people will make payments from a mobile phone, which means that there will be more practical benefits from such statistics. <br><br><h2>  4. complain we like it </h2><br>  Usually, communication with customer service of any service is a separate song.  It seems that all the existing scenarios of interaction between the company and its customers are specially designed so as to wag the nerves of users.  In most cases, you have to call the call center and listen to music for a long time, or get involved in a long-running email correspondence, telling the support of the details of your actions that led to some problems.  You can contact the support of UBANK directly in the application - the dialogue is designed as a chat.  At the same time, the description of the transaction that caused the user some questions is automatically loaded; you do not need to send any additional information to the technical support, such as the date of the transaction and its addressee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/858/1a2/fbc/8581a2fbca4c43e78d591ba9af83aee1.png"><br><br><h2>  5. From card to card </h2><br>  UBANK is able to transfer money from card to card.  It is damn convenient, because for us there is no difference who issued the card, while many banks limit transfers in applications to their cards only.  Return money for lunch?  To compensate the representative of the parent school committee spending on notebooks?  Pay for an old chest of drawers on the "Hammer"?  Yes, no problem, we need only the same sixteen digits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4a/215/df6/c4a215df68944ee4b21e119baca82753.png"><br><br><h2>  6. Telephone law </h2><br>  And, no, they are not needed - if the payee is also registered in our system.  In this case, you only need the phone number of the person to whom you want to transfer money.  Log into your contacts through the UBANK application and you will see which of the friends listed in the phone book of the smartphone has our application.  Sending payment to such people is a matter of a couple of clicks.  And if the addressee has not yet become a happy user of our application?  Well, the next item will help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f57/412/a3e/f57412a3ea134b328d93929edce1e32d.png"><br><br><h2>  7. We give out money </h2><br>  No, we are not screwed to UBANK "Forex", and launched a bonus program.  By completing our various "quests", you can get very real money. <br><br>  The simplest quest: send a promotional code to a friend.  As soon as he registers in the application and enters a promotional code, both of you will receive five rubles for the account.  Someone seems to be quite a bit.  But this is how to look (much depends on how old you are and where you live).  One of our users on the first day, as the program started, sent out promotional codes to dozens of friends and received a hundred rubles, but, most importantly, he ensured that he could transfer money in the future without fiddling with the details. <br><br>  It is not necessary to invite friends, you can simply actively use the application and get bonuses by performing some actions (by linking a card, making five or ten payments).  We calculated that if you wish, thanks to participation in the bonus program you can get about seven hundred rubles, which, you see, does not hurt anyone. <br><br>  Paying for services is not the funniest activity in the world.  The bonus program allows you to turn it into some kind of game.  As they say, a trifle, but nice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242967/</a></p>
