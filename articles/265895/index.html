When the code was written, tested, everything suited in the work - it's time to publish in the Play Store.  For me it has always been a problem to draw graphics.  Therefore, I took everything from our forum.  I pressed the ‚Äúpublish‚Äù button, and after 10 minutes my application was in the bath! <br><br>  History under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Act I: google plays white </h4><br>  After I had a shock, I began to understand.  It was my 2nd (in the history of publication on the Play Store) application, and not even having time to get lost, it fell under the autobahn.  No specific reason was given.  Something about copyright and about the fact that it is trying to impersonate what it is not (sorry, I did not keep the original text). <br><br>  I had our logo on the icon and in ‚ÄúFeature Graphic‚Äù, with the name of the project (game).  I sinned against him.  I thought: banned for copyright, because, in their opinion, my application is trying to mow under the game.

      So, I am writing a ticket, explaining what my application is, trying to emphasize that it is not profitable, for a narrow circle, and has nothing to do with the game except that we (the community) are playing it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Google Auto Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Dear Google Play Developer, <br><br>  Thanks for getting in contact with Google Play.

The whole logo, and the name of the game to do with it?  As so, I know who drew graphics for the forum, and I know that it was just drawn, from scratch.  I know, but I check, I was assured that the logo is entirely ours. <br><br>  <b>How to prove Google that this is our logo?</b> <br><br>  Praise to the internet, he let us down, he saved us!

People <br><br>  So, this whole story seems to me nonsense.  Google, on the one hand, does the right thing by protecting the authors of applications from people trying to cash in on their name.  But on the other hand, for some reason, Google considers those who are not content masters of content to be tech.  I do not know the algorithms of their work, but it seems that scanning the content on the sites, they consider the owners of those who have this content indexed in the first place.  Not registered in any way, but just appeared earlier (according to Google)!  Anywhere on the Internet! <br><br>  And even if you put your logo on your website, and your website considers Google as the owner (is there an open registry?), You are not insured that Google will not be able to link your developer account on the Play Store with the website "owner" and your application will not will fly to the autobahn.  And they will demand from you a document confirming <s>that you have not camel</s> your right to use the content, but your content. <br><br>  In any case, if you are sure that you are right, you need to fight! <br><br>  <b>Reflections on the topic of "how to avoid:"</b> <br>  - draw new logos / banners / graphics for your applications? <br>  - How can I tell Google about the connection of your site with your account on the playlist? <br>  - upload your work to a repository with a date stamp? <br>  <s>- not to develop an android application?</s> <br><br>  UPTD: <br>  <b>The reasons for this behavior Google</b> perfectly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/khim/">wrote khim</a> in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/265895/">his response</a> <br><br>  You can check your schedule before publishing using the <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp%3Fhl%3Duk%26tab%3Dwi%26ei%3DEoHpVa2PB8a9ggSt7oDACQ%26ved%3D0CBEQqi4oAQ">Google Image</a> service <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp%3Fhl%3Duk%26tab%3Dwi%26ei%3DEoHpVa2PB8a9ggSt7oDACQ%26ved%3D0CBEQqi4oAQ">.</a> <br>  Here is <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Ftbs%3Dsbi:AMhZZisOo2XTV7_1kaRpYbPaMJox8GYEfogSiiZxCd02QQRhBEwUfBH6UPdLCwzAww3P2xWy1Sl9mqcDZ4ky6tHBprrpV1NtFR_120B3wGaQv_1LhNNkc3_1xomDX7QNmNvtnPz9bPzaUWAq9ElaNgwpOnuBUiWfuj1Dhw6txMhG5C2qiMjZd-85bsI3fEAmy4MKMZZs_1f4CLeJ5UiCh8MDM5v2nn8rXaFVqGQYq2rsAo1Ip1OSNAlnhAyk7eIAKksPnnoR9jUKHxFjiAKif-A0TsNQFrHj6ahAtgMjbaFbd2NxksNJTaT43uhfQqsdirB-KsaKYkiiFYvaYOtfi1weJTY9W4U2oH1sRxyoSwcHd6ga1d-zeMXfToOmpHDATl2n8JgRQFWLtRyacSqHxnflaROpDG6M5ZWTxkJa58ZO3ICYg_1Vyzz7ntUsKSkWT_1daw-FeoXEb8fSuNv39TJCOcJTZFt4ZpgbmyMMWcsuaLCmc9aboPCOMUxXyTrbIybxEVXYcb-2zsWuC3H2LnCDcH5k3pFzX3MvD8RP_19GgUPxj8fFiU3WCjuq3YV5Hk_15YoPsE98tlWIRjxEoq8yQMNgnt9g4iXCBfym_1YgZ2aIiHaUjZCaJQ75WtDQ3P40CRGHqubWaOfnEswAJeW2BWCuquVv2EXAXUXnArAfdA8dX-M8zQRMK7TMTpyid1NoebmIkStTtUtyZyYkMcyXhPXv_1XnsplVYNCXzMuijQnn0TEnCfj_1tiNAj3uajAjjE1sXWDNykCTHtWQUjWEEp9HxkG-OMoup15_13-dH1ssxdyOn2daGC5JbY1H28XNeFhpkHZT7LK3iRvMHv0RGyPvW31vu75M1ArteDOeEr_1ovguclq4HySxaxGEBP0yhiO0etCvXSDSuR2ajMcm-HCHIu1NhQuuw-e-_1noEnvy49Zvex6oH_1PL_1qLFQHXqYOnO3xa8YHDqIWKmTwE2hj1af1TaQopV9NnSCnPWMqPzO4SypBpIPM3QNO3Gvr3n1hJBZ4GQQoQBU3dU7cGGqJRwFp5UUZ70uK5GX1OEVGcqGvhlosl99u4LvxaLFKeprIT36pQqEZ12SdGeZDwmWSgk3x69mgSkX7h4NchzYp1Gj8ee7sWbC-4czyor9e7sVw0WtzX8Muk72K_1Lwg7FgLmcM1FEkLD8gN6dLAxK9kObNcUj9dfqbLPNDi4JelAoQSzGA0nv86YI0VkK6k2ahNItRypyo9_1kaGHt1b9FxA25pkp7GpGGRhB6WheBYQpiI2dQM-6SF9O9PzzlJcMzJKr7fkJWWL1icYWbEeNh0uIgRCOGnT0WU3wsqWojmj0Whf9HeR7T9f8e2ZZ9vF3JG90qaAAKdMUQrZ04o1RcVK56-z6z47HZd2zzkUNfhYML7k8cZkOXgVIT6QaDMmtw91Qm2Db7HCK_1oLo3rqrel45K8v6UVK392dOM4x_1UaCGmDwFJk5q3uu_1rF0Xsca9BcCX7O29bJiDsbdAwqCuASnm_1A%26hl%3Duk">an example of</a> checking the logo from this article.
