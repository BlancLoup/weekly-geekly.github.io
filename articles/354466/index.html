For example, I could do something neatly, scrupulously, but incorrectly, simply because of a lack of experience.  Now I constantly observe the same problems of designers and, to help, gathered a few practical tips.  Here are some of them: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  Use mounting areas </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/assemblies.gif" alt="Assembly areas in Photoshop"><br><br>  This greatly facilitates the work, both with small and with large and complex projects.  It is no longer necessary to create multiple psd files or use groups inside to show different interface states. <br><br><h4>  Work at a scale of 2: 1 </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/scale.gif" alt="Scale 2: 1"><br><br>  The quality of the screens is growing along with the graphics requirements.  Working on a larger scale you will always have a small margin.  It is not very convenient to change the outline-icon in the size of 16x16px or to write notes 11-12 with the font and see this dud. <br><br><h4>  Observe the correct order of the layers. </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/layers.gif" alt="The order of the layers in Photoshop"><br><br>  By default, a new layer is created above the rest.  Do not be lazy, move them according to where the object is located or start from the end.  We read / look from left to right, top to bottom.  It‚Äôs good when you don‚Äôt have to search for the top icon somewhere below or, which is worse, in the middle of the layers. <br><br><h4>  Use color selection layers </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/layers_color.gif" alt="Color selection of layers in Photoshop"><br><br>  There are two extremes.  Either all groups are decorated or all gray.  But, if you use it where appropriate, it can be a handy tool.  For example, if you have many similar layers (icon + text) or graphs, charts, tables ... <br><br><h4>  Take out the mesh in a separate layer </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/grid.gif" alt="Grid on a separate layer"><br><br>  Usually, the mesh is shaped by guides.  In the process of work, they can be lost, added, removed and, never, it is not clear why this or that object is aligned as such or which of the guides is basic and which is not.  Bringing the grid to a separate layer will be easier to check. <br><br><h4>  Collapse the properties of layers and groups </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/layers_style.gif" alt="Layer and group styles"><br><br>  Often, layouts can contain hundreds of layers and finding the ones you need is not always easy.  And even more difficult when the styles of the layers are revealed.  Usually they do not carry much information. <br><br><h4>  Do not leave empty layers or groups. </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/layers_empty.gif" alt="Empty layers and groups"><br><br>  This also applies to the last item, but may be aggravated by the fact that you turn them on / off, hoping to see something useful, and not rubbish.  Why do these nerves. <br><br><h4>  Let's say the names of the layers </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/layers_names.gif" alt="Names of layers and groups"><br><br>  Here, of course, everything is individual, but the basic rule is this: sign the layer according to its content.  At the same time, train yourself to use English, in case you grow and work with international projects. <br><br><h4>  Work with SVG </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/svg.gif" alt="Svg icons in photoshop"><br><br>  Try to use as little as possible raster graphics, icons, and especially icon fonts.  For a long time there are no problems with the use of SVG format.  It scales easily, has flexible settings and good support. <br><br><h4>  Place related objects </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/import.gif" alt="Import in Photoshop"><br><br>  Whether you insert an icon, a picture or something else, do it through "Put connected."  Practice shows that it is more convenient to change one file than to make changes in many places.  For example, such parts as a basement or hat are more often static and it is more convenient to put them into separate files and place them through import. <br><br><h4>  Apply clipping masks </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/mask.gif" alt="Clipping Masks in Photoshop"><br><br>  How often I observe pictures in the form of circles, pentagons, stars, which are not made in the most practical way.  Most of the images cut out the desired part in the desired form and paste.  But when it comes to editing, it becomes sad.  For such tasks it is good to use masks.  They show the desired part and at the same time the picture remains intact.  It can be scaled, cropped or replaced without unnecessary action. <br><br><h4>  Use smart objects </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/smart-object.gif" alt="Smart objects in Photoshop"><br><br>  They are like groups, but they can keep styles.  For example, if you have several identical buttons on a page, then it is more convenient to use smart objects.  Editing one applies to everything in the file limit.  It is also convenient to use if you want to reduce the countless number of layers. <br><br><h4>  Add security fields </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/buttons.gif" alt="Button Security Fields"><br><br>  It happens that the designers do not understand what size the button provides, if the design does not use backgrounds or edging.  Add a security field in the form of an empty block under it or add a prefix to the name. <br><br><h4>  Use text blocks </h4><br><img src="https://sergeiplohotniuk.ru/files/blog/povyshaem-kachestvo-svoih-rabot/text.gif" alt="Text blocks in Photoshop"><br><br>  It is very inconvenient to copy the text from the layout, if it was inserted not as a block and the transfers are put in manual.  You have to delete them.  In addition, this method helps to see how it will look when the layout of the layout. <br><br><h4>  Do not forget about related materials. </h4><br>  Upon completion, do not forget to attach fonts, original images, infographics, descriptions ... Usually, a lot of time is spent on search / query.  For example, I often have this structure: <br>  svg - all icons; <br>  materials - pictures, infographics, fonts; <br>  from client - what originally came from the client; <br>  includes - related parts of the template <br><br>  Each of these techniques is good, but together they help you and others more efficiently work with layouts and save time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354466/</a></p>
