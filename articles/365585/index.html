  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Deliver right</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  We here recently sorted out pieces of paper and found terrible figures in them.  Over the past year we had to write off almost 53 million rubles (!) For the broken matrix of LCD TVs.  People take the box, do not check what's inside and how, they shower it into the car - and at home they see it: <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/251132/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95b/9db/f46/95b9dbf4653a4af5aba290c7edfde4af.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Since no one has opened the box to the house, people return ‚Äúdefective‚Äù TV to us.  Why is this so?  Very often, our compatriots are strikingly indifferent to the markings on the packaging of goods.  Meanwhile, the rules of transportation and storage (and the corresponding markings, also called handling signs) are not invented for beauty. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All of these icons are rigidly derived from the design features and material properties of a particular load, its packaging, center of gravity, flexural strength, and all that.  And if, with respect to, say, clothes, no one doubts that markings like ‚ÄúOnly manual spin‚Äù or ‚Äú40 degrees‚Äù on the labels must be observed (otherwise you will have to send your favorite blouse to rags), then for some reason Indifference prevails in relation to household appliances: <i>what will happen to the refrigerator or TV?</i>  <i>Yes, he will not do anything ...</i>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/eb2/536/73aeb253650d43aa9f20809655323e7d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">How to transport goods</font> </h2><br>  Here, for example, all the same long-suffering televisions.  On the box of any modern plasma or a large format there will be obligatory markings "Fragile" and "Top", often with accompanying inscriptions.  Which means, respectively, that the goods must be transported as a crystal vase, especially carefully and only in an upright position.  But buyers put svezhepriobretennye TVs flat in the trunk of the car (or even on the external trunk, on the roof, in the rain; after all, you can‚Äôt put 65 inches upright in the trunk), and after the very first ‚Äúspeed bump‚Äù complex or store) the TV gets either cracks on the screen, or invisible plasma damage - the damage on the box may not even be, but the TV may not save you from shaking the protective foam. <br><br>  To save you time and money, we have compiled a small selection of pictograms found on the packaging of household appliances and electronics with brief explanations of what they mean.  In the case of these icons, it is better not to ask the question ‚ÄúWhy is it like this?‚Äù, But simply to observe them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0be/9a5/b89/0be9a5b8918f403580a0f68ffe97cc5c.png"></div><br>  " <b>Fragile</b> ."  Well, everything is clear here - easily damaged goods: dishes, glass containers, mobile gadgets and so on.  And yes, TVs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ff/ab5/230/9ffab5230d234f6e9d58ba52a265c712.png"></div><br>  " <b>Top</b> ".  Here it is often not noticed (although it is almost always adjacent directly to the ‚ÄúFragile‚Äù icon), and if they do, they do not interpret it quite correctly.  This marking means that the goods should be transported and stored only in the position where the arrows point to the top.  This applies, for example, to refrigerators - there is freon there and, if not properly transported, the cooling elements can cause significant damage. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bc/5a3/b0a/8bc5a3b0a4db481f85028836ac9760c2.png"></div><br>  " <b>Temperature Limit</b> ".  Shows the range of temperatures at which the product should be stored or used. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c30/6af/847/c306af84725f417cacf66fcb2edcf30b.png"></div><br>  "Keep away from moisture."  Understand except literally difficult - means that the product should be protected from flooding, splashes and from storage in very wet rooms.  Naturally, it concerns not only water. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4aa/65a/117/4aa65a11782b4ea18998146163b60d0d.png"></div><br>  " <b>Protect from sunlight</b> ."  We do not put any packaging or goods in direct sunlight.  On the boxes of technology and electronics is rare, but it happens.  Here is an example (box from the printer): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2e/942/47c/a2e94247c684464385e7218e1784c510.jpg"><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5f/fd1/419/c5ffd1419e0446e8ab7fc1d2fa9dcdef.png"></div><br>  " <b>Stacking is prohibited</b> ."  As the label "Top", also a source of problems.  Perhaps some simply do not understand the meaning of the word ‚Äústack‚Äù (we hope that this is not the case).  To put it simply, do not put packages with goods on top of each other and, as a result, do not put anything heavy on the packages from above. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/970/ede/c3f/970edec3f1ef4d96a13787ce6c7f2baf.png"></div><br>  " <b>Stacking is limited</b> ."  It is found on the technique much more often than the previous one.  He says that it is still possible to load the package, but it shows the limits of the pressure mass. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/e02/612/241e02612191441ca3bc6c614d29b371.png"></div><br>  " <b>The limit on the number of tiers in the stack</b> ."  In the same steppe as the two previous icons, but not the weight is indicated, but the number of similar packages that can be put on top. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88b/94f/744/88b94f7447da406eb79f097fe0f1e6c8.png"></div><br>  " <b>Do not roll</b> ."  We do not roll, and even just do not transfer the packaging to the other side.  Especially if there is the same icon "Top". <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/968/abb/e16/968abbe167bb4342bd36f36d383dc7da.png"></div><br>  " <b>Open here</b> ."  Well, everything is clear.  It is highly recommended to follow it literally - expensive equipment is still not kefir, it can be damaged from improper extraction. <br><br>  Just save yourself this picture and share it with your friends: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/1f9/ad2/8f51f9ad26d148bcb7eaa85550b115f3.png"><br><br>  These are the main markings that you will find on the packaging of electronics and home appliances.  In total, of course, there are more of them - whoever is interested, can study in the corresponding <a href="http://ohranatruda.ru/ot_biblio/normativ/data_normativ/6/6376/">GOST</a> e. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">How to unpack and install the product</font> </h2><br>  To bring the purchase home safe and sound is only half the battle (besides, large-size and heavy loads will most likely be delivered by loaders who know exactly what and how to transport correctly).  Unpacking and preparing to use household appliances and electronics also need to be correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/8fb/95e/b018fb95edf546d7b2b76de02ac20f31.jpg"><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that if you brought the acquired equipment in the winter with a strong frost on the street - you should not, tearing off the packaging from her house, immediately rush to include a novelty.  It is possible that the supercooled device will not turn on, it happens - and then you will panic and think that you bought the marriage.  Not necessary.  Just be patient, let the equipment warm up to room temperature, and the condensate deposited will evaporate. <br><br>  Further, if we are talking about a washing machine, you should definitely remove the shipping bolts (holding the drum) from them before switching on.  We emphasize - necessarily!  In general, a bona fide seller must inform you that a particular model has such bolts.  Failing them before work, at best, simply will not allow you to turn on the machine, at worst - will spoil it.  And according to the letter of the guarantee, the breakdown will be considered your fault - so we definitely advise you to read the recommendations for the first use of the device before switching on.  There all the instructions are described step by step and some are given with the note ‚ÄúIMPORTANT!‚Äù ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0b/854/28d/d0b85428db584c35929145a312499faa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sometimes, by the way, there are transport bolts on refrigerators - they keep the compressor.  If they are not removed, there will definitely be a roar and vibrations during operation, and this will not only please your family members and neighbors, but also reduce the life of the refrigerator. <br><br>  Yes, to the question of refrigerators.  If the refrigerator has survived a long and difficult journey to your door, then at home you will again have to be patient - for at least 5 hours after installing it in place it should not be turned on.  The fact is that the coolant (freon) must first merge into the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù position (it spills over during transportation).  In addition, oil may fall into the cooling circuit - it needs the same thing, and when the compressor is on, the valve will not let it flow back.  If you turn on the refrigerator when oil is in the discharge circuit, the compressor motor will have to work without lubrication, which may lead to the need to replace it very soon.  By the way, it is also highly recommended to choose a place for the refrigerator in such a way that normal air circulation is provided behind it, near the coils. <br><br>  Among the frequent mistakes in preparing equipment for operation, we can mention, for example, the installation of a microwave near the TV in the kitchen.  Believe me, no equipment will be happy to turn on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">magnetron</a> , even for 30 seconds. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g91xkISmp2g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjHRRoVrMkVNxB5iudp6p22n8aXCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <sup>For the link to the video, thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/navion/" class="user_link">navion</a> 'u.</sup> <br><br>  We hope that now you will be more attentive to the rules of transportation of the purchased equipment.
