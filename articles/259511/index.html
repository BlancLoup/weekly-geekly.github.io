      But no, one of the most fun problems is staff sabotage.  Why?  Because when the implementation is over, the manager will better see each specific document (any from any employee).  That is, there will be more control.  Speaking in simpler language - in particular, stealing will become much more difficult. <br><br>  <b>The first example of sabotage</b> is when the workflow system is introduced along with the automation of processes simultaneously.  At this moment, the people are deeply indignant at the "square-nested" method and other innovations, and almost gather rallies that all this is from the evil one.  Most often observed in remote branches, where for the first time somehow comes control.  Naturally, it is solved only by the will of one of the first persons of the company, otherwise all the chances of getting stuck in interdepartmental "showdowns". <br><br>  <b>The second stage</b> is after implementation, when a clear understanding comes that it is necessary to work transparently.  In one state-owned company, users even wrote treatises that not smoothly opening screen forms of the system contributes to the deterioration of vision and the development of epilepsy. <br><br>  But let's start from the beginning, from why, in general, Russia needs SED when there is already a pack of paper, a pen, a stamp and a hole punch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About experience </h4><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that we have ready projects in the nuclear power industry, all M.Video accounting is based on the <a href="http://www.croc.ru/news/detail/21918/">ECM platform</a> we have assembled, there are several open source projects based on Alfresco, for example, one for a state institution with 250 users.  Below are examples of solutions for various well-known companies, but for now I‚Äôll tell you about the market. <br><br><h4>  Why do you need a company SED? </h4><br>  First, control.  Who, where and what he did, who did not work ,.  As with any automation, SED solves this problem quite effectively.  Plus, you can see the details of who and what is doing to the last person in the company.  It can be seen where a document is stuck and who is at fault. <br><br>  Secondly, getting rid of paper.  Products and solutions that allow to save here and now come out on top now.  Pay off faster, show results faster.  Paper logistics is expensive, and if it turns out to get rid of printing and sending paper documents within the group of companies (holding), this is already a significant bright achievement.  For him, the initiator may well give the star of the hero and generally note the career.  Also, many people are interested in the functionality of a handwritten electronic signature (not an EDS, but one when the client or employee signs on an electronic scoreboard over the image of the document being signed).  It helps to receive documents from various mobile devices, plus, as Western colleagues say, when a person signs each time, instead of clicking a button, this greatly increases responsibility. <br><br>  Third, the availability of information.  Any information important to the company should be available in the system at any time, even if the employee leaves.  If you have never looked for a piece of paper on the shipment of a steel car in a company with a hundred factories - you do not understand this pain. <br><br>  Fourth, information security.  Employees, in principle, should not keep files where they want, but store them in the SED in the necessary sections.  It is important to protect files not only when they are stored on disk, but also when they are moved, both inside and outside the company.  IRM systems (Information Rights Management) are used for this, they allow you to protect documents outside the organization‚Äôs perimeter.  For the recipient to read the file, he must have the appropriate rights to decrypt. <br><br>  Finally, there is another important aspect of the requirements for SED - the system should be comfortable so that employees do not beat their heads against the wall, but work normally in it (otherwise the level of sabotage increases).  People should choose this tool by default instead of sending files by mail or keeping them on a local disk. <br><br>  In particular, in this direction is the development of corporate social networks (the same Jive can also solve this problem as a corporate social network of the company).  When integrating a corporate social network, corporate mail and EDMS, it turns out that it is much easier for users to immediately put a document in the system than to send a regular message. <br><br><h4>  Vendors </h4><br>  In the SED projects we built solutions on both Western and domestic platforms.  Western ECMs have a positive experience with EMC Documentum and with Alfresco.  The first is a large commercial platform from a large vendor.  The second is a compact, but unlimited, open source version of ECM. <br><br>  From Russian products we work with DocsVision and Directum.  They are distinguished from Western ECM by the rich functionality specialized for the SED tasks.  That is, to start a project implementation and get a good result can be much faster.  In fairness, it must be said that there are functionally developed superstructures above western ECMs that facilitate the implementation of EDS projects.  CROC, for example, built such an add-on over Documentum and Alfresco. <br><br>  There is also a separate class of platforms with the help of which it is possible to solve electronic document flow problems.  Speech about BPM-platforms.  For example, our contract is automated on K2 + Documentum.  The KM Blackpearl BPM platform is responsible for routing electronic documents that are placed in the Documentum repository. <br><br><h4>  Who needs EDS in the Russian Federation </h4><br>  Initially, there were no electronic document management systems in Russia.  There was a hole punch.  Then came the electronic numbering of incoming-outgoing (some kind, and accounting), then - storage of images, because the paper was often lost.  That is, the main reason then was the creation of an electronic archive of papers, backup.  It was only in the early 2000s that the movement began on the formulation of processes in electronic form - that which will become modern SED.  Just in 2005, our project began in Perm, where all the officials had to be transplanted to the SED.  At first, secretaries worked there for managers, because very few people understood what it was and why, but the most important iron will led to the fact that gradually every paper and every penny (I exaggerate) began to be taken into account (imagine the "joy" of everyone involved).  The generation has changed - and the system works, but managers are already familiar.  By the way, in the same place we introduced a legally-significant EDS, which was quite difficult at that time. <br><br>  For many, the volume of documents has grown so much that the old SED simply does not pull the base.  It sounds ridiculous, but it is often enough - a big problem for companies with old implementations. <br><br>  Quite a few companies now put from scratch.  As a rule, large businesses already have some kind of solution.  If the SED is normally implemented, then it is an aid for business processes, or a generally based process support system.  On it everything keeps in the company, and therefore if you became big business - you automatically already have something like that.  If the electronic document management system has problems, then the problems are with the whole organization. <br><br>  There was, for example, the case when the company remained to live on the SED, which ceased to develop 2-3 years ago.  We need new features - and the vendor can not do them.  Somewhere crutches were scored, somewhere external modules were pinned up, somewhere they just lost some of the processes. <br><br>  One of the new reasons for modernizing EDS is interfaces.  People are used to Facebook contacts, and the SED for them should be just as simple.  It happens that the cost of training at some point outweighs the cost of modernization.  And most of the new EDS is almost always already usable. <br><br><h4>  Examples </h4><br>  <b>For the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat),</b> we did an <a href="http://www.croc.ru/news/detail/20267/">upgrade of the SED</a> , which they already had.  The project at Rosstat was implemented by CROC based on the first solution based on EMC Documentum.  The training phase for staff working with the system was organized using the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù - the CROC Virtual Data Center.  Of the important was achieved: <br><ul><li>  The transition to paperless circulation (there are a number of important documents that are signed manually, but they are few). </li><li>  Control of the status of execution of documents (which is very important for a large organization).  Thanks to the principle of end-to-end control, the management team was able to control the execution of its orders at any stage and level of the organizational hierarchy; </li><li>  Increased staff productivity (everything is at hand, plus reminder hints).  The economic effect on each of them is 144 thousand rubles.  in year; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>For Rosavtodor,</b> we have implemented an <a href="http://www.croc.ru/experience/8091/">electronic document management</a> system designed for more than 2000 users.  The solution has a full set of functions necessary for the implementation of clerical work and archive.  With the help of the ‚ÄúContract Enforcement‚Äù system, Rosavtodor employees keep records of concluded state contracts, monitor the fulfillment of their obligations by contractors, track deadlines and volumes of work performed, and take into account claim-related activities under contracts.  Important: effective group work on the preparation of documents, well-established communication between the central office and regional divisions, a high degree of information security, the integration of the workflow system with the in-line scanning system. <br><br>  <b>For one very large bank,</b> we have implemented a system for more than 4,000 users of the central office and territorial branches.  The system allows you to create and coordinate various forms of applications and routes for their passage.  As part of the project, the system is integrated with HP OpenView ServiceDesk to synchronize information resource directories, as well as the status of incidents to execute applications.  The main priority is to reduce the time of preparation and processing of documents. <br><br>  <b>At NLMK,</b> we made Russia's first implementation of an electronic document management system <a href="http://www.croc.ru/news/detail/1165/">for Linux</a> .  This is generally our first introduction, very, very old.  The business application automated 100 administrative workstations.  The uniform format of documents and the correct archiving and reservation - then it was happiness for them. <br><br>  <b>For one very large production group from the oil and gas sector,</b> we did an SED for more than 4,000 people (approximately 6.5 million documents per year). <br><br>  Here is the diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aae/e60/a39/aaee60a398a84e1ea6fb42861b8e1f89.jpeg"><br><br>  Used: Oracle Database 11.2.0.3 DBMS, EMC Documentum Content Server 6.7 SP1 content server, ORACLE WebLogic Server 11g 10.3.5 application server, also EMC Documentum xPlore 1.2, ABBYY Recognition Server 3.5, WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus 4.5.1 and Pentaho Data Integration 4.4.0, plus IBM ODM 8.5 Business Rules Management System.  Integration with customer information systems: SAP ERP, 1C, DIA NSI, BOSS-Kadrovik, ISUP, bank client, scanning system, mail and fax server, Active Directory, OeBS, ESID (Oracle OIM). <br><br>  Previously, there was no single exchange system, and therefore productivity often rested on paper exchange, conversion and generally strange logistical issues.  Plus, there are all the charm of control and accurate tracking. <br><br>  <b>For ourselves</b> (we have over 2,000 employees and up to 3,000 projects per work per year, of which about 20% with a budget of more than a million dollars) we use Documentum and K2 based EDS.  To simplify the approval of documents by top management, a system of reminders is organized by mail with the possibility of approval by pressing a button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/d6c/479/d23d6c47920747d789cd70b0113125ab.jpeg"><br><br>  In parallel, the Jive corporate social network is used to collaborate on documents, their discussion and storage, as well as loading reminders about birthdays. <br><br>  SED and Jive may well be integrated with each other to simplify work with documents (we have this process at the initial stage).  Social network was implemented like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/840/128/2a9/8401282a905b45e191d6b25d15c5c1dd.png"><br><br>  Here is the profile view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a8/970/81b/1a897081b8d1459a9de28ff1d96f2605.jpeg"><br><br>  And the design view: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/25f/ba9/62525fba9a804aa391b56f84fb7940a0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  About the market </h4><br>  If you look at the western situation, the ECM market there grows by about 8-10% per year.  We have a similar course, but there are two big fundamental differences: firstly, the world has a fairly large share of open-source solutions (and we are just beginning to look closely at them), secondly, the average share of electronic document management systems in ECM sales is about 40%, and we have - 50%. <br><br>  In our country at the beginning of 2014 there were more than 6.25 million jobs that can be automated using ECM-functional systems.  That is, specifically in Russia, the demand for electronic document management platforms has not yet been closed, the market will still develop and grow to a saturation stage for at least a couple of years (taking into account the current situation - more, the process has slowed down). <br><br>  Why is that?  Simple enough, the fact is that medium-sized businesses are entering this market.  Years, say, 10 years ago there was only an option to write something different, a small applied one.  The license for the finished product was simply unaffordable for the price.  Now there is an opportunity to buy something quite affordable and at the same time fully functional, or assemble from open-source components (with the necessary qualifications).  Naturally, the state sector has greatly influenced the development of electronic document management systems in Russia - there is a big movement on electronic exchange between departments, and there is a difference in comparison with the situation of 10 years.  Plus, the natural factor of geographic distribution works - not every enterprise in Russia can often travel in person because of distances, therefore for large companies it becomes important to improve management efficiency.  That is, first of all, to see all those responsible and get rid of the uncontrolled paper exchange, shorten the search for documents. <br><br>  In a crisis, there is a chance of growth - the introduction of the SED can reduce printing costs, and significantly improve the efficiency of processes.  For some, the crisis will be a chance to finally ‚Äúpush through‚Äù the long-needed implementation program. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Now almost everyone understands that electronic document management is important.  Many people want to put the system in order to save on the same paper logistics, many want to replace expensive imports with a new, more affordable solution.  In practice, one import is replaced by another.  Often they move from high-profile brand labels to open-source.  Vendors wrap open sources in the Russian label and call it the original Russian product.  The market is growing (at least, it has grown until recently), so many players come to give rise to entire groups of jambs during implementations - from a banal misunderstanding of the scale and load on different points of the infrastructure to insufficient ability to respond to changing customer processes. <br><br>  We often see how small players try to complete a quest to match the data in state-owned companies during integration - the mere task of obtaining data in the right format can put an end to the whole plan.  We are able to work, we are able to show prototypes once a week, we are able to properly negotiate - without experience there is nowhere.  We are able to withstand a huge wave of the first days of calls to support after implementation, in the end.  And only after half a year-year of torment it is seen how the percentage of overdue documents, for example, in a state-owned company, begins to affect the premium of a manager or official ‚Äî and how all processes suddenly begin to spin magically faster. <br><br>  Something like this.  Here you can also find interesting statistics.  If interested - ask questions, try to talk about specific features.  Or write to SPlaunov@croc.ru mail, if the question is not for comments. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https//habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/251995/">"Heavy" applied software</a> : everyday development and implementation </li><li>  The process of constant changes in the company: <a href="https//habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/242851/">how it is automated</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259511/</a></p>
