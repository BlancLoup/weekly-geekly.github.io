Moreover, for each it began in different ways.  In the corridors of the Nizhny Novgorod office one could meet trainees with thoughtful, bewildered, or confused faces;  organizers who observed how the giant machine ‚ÄúIntel Summer School 2010‚Äù started working;  anxious mentors and admins who tried to ‚Äúguess‚Äù their trainee.  The only one who could not be seen, it is IT storekeepers, but more on that below.  In this regard, I asked everyone to share their impressions about the first days of school.  Under the cut, see what happened. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><img src="http://software.intel.com/file/29029" alt="image" align="left">

      <b>Maria Oseeva, Intel Summer School Program Manager:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThis year, with the participation of all five Intel offices in Russia, our first day of the Intel Summer School turned out to be a rocket launch into space. <br>  6 am Moscow time: ‚Äúthe first step was undocked‚Äù - the Novosibirsk office opened its doors hospitably. <br>  9 am Moscow time: ‚Äúthe second step has gone‚Äù - the summer interns of Nizhegorodsky and Sarovsky offices met. <br>  10 am Moscow time: ‚Äúthe third stage separated‚Äù - Moscow and Peter woke up, who are also happy to welcome new young employees. <br>  And we watched the whole process, as the Central Flight Control and dreamed that the start was without excitement and catastrophe.  Without catastrophes - quite real, without worries - never!  The organization of the Summer School hides the work of about 100 Intel specialists from all over Russia and at least 4 months of daily work of the organizing committee to make such a colossus interact harmoniously. <br><br>  The first day is always the most difficult and in format, because it needs to be balanced and comfortable from a business and human point of view: a bit of solemnity, friendly formal acquaintance, passing mandatory procedures, explaining internship tasks, informal communication, etc. <br><br>  In general, I am more than satisfied with the start of school.  Yes, it didn‚Äôt do without overlays, someone didn‚Äôt go anywhere or didn‚Äôt come on time, someone didn‚Äôt meet someone, something remained slightly under-prepared, but we flexibly ‚Äúbeat‚Äù, completed it, took it by the hand and made sure no further was lost.  Before lunch, time in cares and corrections flew by unnoticed, and after lunch the countdown began - a beautiful birthday cake was eaten by trainees and mentors from the Novosibirsk office, the students of Sarov office were released for the evening rest, and so on. <br><br>  The most pleasant thing about the first day is that it has an inescapable tendency to end, and then it becomes easier. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Eugene Kholodkov, IT storekeeper:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI work innl it client service in the position of IT storekeeper. <br>  Preparing for summer school is a huge burden when looking for a bunch of ‚Äúnot fresh‚Äù equipment.  Same, all the same for 2 months in total.  Urgently looking for what you need.  As a result, our cube looks like a hive.  And this is only a preparation for summer school. <br>  That seems to be all ready.  During this time, everyone is already on their ears, and most importantly, never to be mistaken, otherwise there will be huge problems with the issue of iron. <br>  Well, the first day.  Downstairs there are a lot of young people, someone is serious, someone is smiling. <br>  You can only hear the door opening with a squeak of the sensor and a voice says: ‚ÄúNext ...‚Äù <br>  This students do pass.  We are all starting to giggle nervously. <br>  It is very good that this time the curators smashed the students into parties of 4 people.  So everything should go more smoothly, and not like 2 years ago, when a crowd of people stunned by impressions filled the entire floor and all the aisles, not responding to requests to come in turns. <br>  The first four ... <br>  Engineers begin their work, the first hour is difficult.  This is very similar to ping pong. <br>  The engineer twitches between the new ones, alternately pressing the buttons and instructing, the eyes are already wild and weakly understanding, apparently the program has started. <br>  After an hour and a half, the pace becomes slower, the actions are worked out.  Schoolchildren with satisfied people get laptops and phones. <br>  So it will be 2 days.  And then requests for something else will be sprinkled.  And just as massively. <br>  Well, nothing, we are not used to, we are the client service. " <br><br>  And now, listen to the interns. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Pavlov, Ivanovo city:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI hasten to share my impressions of the first days of the summer school of Intel. <br>  Finally, what I had been waiting for so long came ... The Intel Summer School began its work, and I, like 20 other lucky ones, had the chance to try and see the life of the huge Intel company from the inside.  To say that the first days will be remembered for a very long time, and that I was just stunned and pleasantly surprised, means to say nothing.  From the first minutes I was struck by the clear organization of the registration process for summer schoolchildren.  And the first lectures, I think left no one indifferent.  I haven‚Äôt met lecturers who could so skillfully, ridiculously and in constant contact with the audience talk about seemingly boring things like workplace safety, and so that the whole audience was rolling with laughter.  In addition, working in the same team with people who have tremendous experience and knowledge is a special pleasure and desire to learn and learn something new.  I was also struck by the friendly attitude of the company's employees to the newcomers and the atmosphere reigning inside the company.  I think you have already understood that Intel is a great place to work, study, professional and grow, and much more interesting ... " <br><br>  <b>Aleshkov Ilya Rybinsk, Yaroslavl region:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI will speak about people, and others will say that NN is beautiful. <br>  I want to start with a really first impression.  As we approached departure, calls from various Intel employees were increasing.  From each came interest, spiritual warmth.  After each such call, I was convinced that I had not dreamed all this.  The expectation of something incredible was growing.  So it turned out - everything here is unusual, interesting, fun and convenient.  It is very pleasant in the morning to walk from the hostel to the office.  It is unusual to use a very familiar, but now also a licensed software.  Fun to speak a mixture of Russian with English. <br>  We have already made friends with the guys, only we confuse names. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Tikhonkikh, Chelyabinsk:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe first day at Intel was very intense for me.  It seemed that several days had passed, and not one.  Received a lot of new information, which then the whole evening went through and realized.  The impressions are only positive, the jobs are wonderful, all the staff are attentive and friendly people.  Free coffee on the floors is a little captivating.  At the end of the first day there was a tea party, at which we got to know each other better.  Lots of positive impressions! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Sergey Vedernikov, Sarov:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI want to tell you about my first day at Intel Summer School.  A lot of new information.  Everything around is interesting!  The tasks that employees work on, how they interact with each other.  And most importantly - they took me to a topic that I wanted to get into!  I think there will be a lot of great moments ahead of our internship at Intel! <br>  Yes, I also wanted to note the safety instructions.  We were really scared, but it was fun! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Marin, Ufa:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúEven before arriving at the company's office, you already get an incredibly pleasant impression, thanks to the attitude of the organizers and HRs to you, as a full-fledged employee, always ready to answer your question, accompanying you with information.  In short, the attitude can be described as benevolent.  The same atmosphere reigns in the office itself. <br>  Workplaces made in the form of work cubes make it possible to concentrate more on work and not be distracted by the environment.  It is also worth noting the increased attention to the safety of employees' health, protection of information.  It is clear that the company is trying to do everything possible to make the employee more comfortable and more pleasant. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Victor Getmansky, Volgograd:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúA trip to Intel is a unique chance for me to feel like an employee of a large and serious company developing advanced computing technologies.  I was very happy when I received a positive response to my third application for participation.  To become a summer schoolboy of Intel is to be among the best people from different universities in Russia who have had the opportunity to try their hand at real projects.  After arrival, we immediately joined the team, met our neighbors in the dormitory, walked to the Kremlin and by the end of the day returned to a friendly company, in which everyone was looking forward to the new day - the first day in Intel.  We really liked Nizhny Novgorod.  In the summer there is good weather and very beautiful nature.  In addition, many historical monuments.  It is no coincidence that it is here that most places in the Intel summer school.  On the first day of work we were met by Intel employees.  The reception was hospitable, introductory lectures were given by experienced employees of the company.  They told with wit and humor, so everyone liked it.  At the end of the day we had a dating evening, where everyone learned about the talents of everyone else.  In addition, we were introduced to former summer schoolchildren who became Intel employees.  They shared their impressions with us and immediately made it clear that in addition to work, many interesting activities awaited us.  With our mentor, Cyril Mavrodiev, we quickly found a common language.  He, too, once passed the summer school and told us all the key points of the summer school.  I was most pleased with the flexible schedule, teamwork and free tea and coffee in the corridor of the office building!  According to first impressions, Intel Summer School in Nizhny Novgorod is a great place to work and play. ‚Äù <br><br>  Finally, I want to add that we plan to duplicate part of the training for Summer Schoolchildren with online seminars.  So that you have the opportunity to feel like an intern at the Summer School of Intel 2010. <br><br>  Please refer to <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/optimization-notice/">the Optimization Notice</a> page for more details on performance and optimization in Intel software products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98451/</a></p>
