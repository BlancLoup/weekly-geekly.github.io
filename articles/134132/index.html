  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cretaceous period</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the white board is a charismatic teacher and, illogically placing accents in words, fills it with wonderful scribbles.  Red, blue, black.  Under the top layer is already indelible old. <br>  At some point, the romance of the Cretaceous period ended and everywhere educational institutions switched to white boards and markers.  Convenient, practical, durable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d3/cc9/711/9d3cc9711044af32da8b0993b9cccca9.jpg" alt="The picture is honestly cursed"><br>  For me, this is like plastic windows - this is a brilliant invention, salvation, one might say, for millions.  They are cheaper than good wooden windows, neat, comfortable.  In each shack they already stand: the house to the ground is rooted, the walls are already in different directions, but the windows are plastic - because it is very rational. <br>  But the romance and beauty of the wooden windows are gone.  They have no carved patterns, no thirty-three layers of unevenly laid paint.  They are knocked out of the general appearance of the building, like the Euroset logo on the facade of the Bolshoi Theater, toys are no longer placed between the frames, they do not need to be warmed or plugged, flies do not fly in and do not die with hordes ... As if in a laboratory. <br><br>  The same with chalk.  When I studied in my Kemerovo University, we had a teacher of Matalysis - Shalaumov Vladimir Andrianovich - the smartest person - Riemann quoted and could even divide by zero.  At the height of the proof of a theorem, he could crush half of the chalk on a board, eat the other half.  He writes, writes, and writes, ‚ÄúNo, not that,‚Äù he erases with his hand, writes again, and again erases, then with this hand he scratches his forehead, takes up his chin, puts it on his chest or side.  At the end of the pair, the whole face and body is white.  Despite his formidable character, he looked very funny at such moments.  And he loved to throw a piece of chalk at the careless students.  But this is by the way.  And now what - rubbing the marker on the lips? <br>  In KemSU there were only ordinary brown boards everywhere, except computer classes.  When someone was very hot, there was only a knock of chalk on the blackboard and creaking - thick pieces broke off and fell to the floor.  And if the board together.  Oooo.  Like artillery or platoon drummers.  The whole epoch is over, friends. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The children will no longer hang their chalk or change the chairs for the girls, or rub the board with wax so that it does not write chalk, the unpleasant squeak of the stupid chalk will not curl your ears into the tube, no one will slam you on the back with a hand stained in the chalk and teachers for a pack of new chalk will not put four.  You will no longer search all the shelves and corners in search of a more or less decent piece and finish drawing the last curlicues, sliding your fingers on a rough board, you will not run and then wash your hands and in general you will not experience these sensations, like rubbing your fingers together in chalk. . <br>  The movement of presenters and tablet players has not yet gained strength, maybe it is worth enjoying the era of markers? </div>
