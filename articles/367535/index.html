Attention was attracted by the fact of money: the company <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/267418/">invested a</a> billion dollars in an electric vehicle factory.  It was rumored that Apple owns the dark horse.  It later emerged that the company <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21096/">belongs to</a> Chinese billionaire Jia Yuetin. <br><br>  Yuetin and other representatives of the Faraday Future <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/268588/">promised</a> that at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) the concept electric car will be shown for the first time.  The company kept its word. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/eff/c9e/e2ceffc9ec6346f9946403a0fbd8827d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On Monday in Las Vegas, the eyes of the press were presented with what can be compared to a Batmobile.  This is a concept electric supercar FFZERO1 with a capacity of 1000 horsepower.  The seat is exactly one, and how to get into it is not very clear.

The dashboard gives the driver a visualization of data in real time, a special helmet - oxygen and water.  Systems may collect data about the body in the driver's seat.  Came 2016, so Faraday Future promises autonomy for a supercar.  He can meet the driver or even make a couple of perfect laps at the circuit. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/613/a83/b47/613a83b4745f44528501ce43e3589ff4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The supercar will be driven by four electric motors - one for each of the wheels.  The total power will be more than 1000 horsepower.  FFZERO1 will reach 97 km / h in less than 3 seconds, and the maximum speed will be released in 320 km / h.  Of course, such indicators can be achieved only in those conditions for which the supercar was created - on the racetrack. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/89e/3aa/20f89e3aa5d14a44a2248b14cae9c1ad.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The creators have worked on the design.  The body of the electric vehicle made of light carbon fiber and composite materials directs the flow of air, allowing it to pass through and not bypass the electric vehicle.  So the designers tried to reduce aerodynamic drag, which in turn allows to achieve better efficiency and increase the maximum speed.  The air must cool the batteries and engines. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d5/a5f/fd7/8d5a5ffd76e7403a8361e2a29098fd63.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Render FFZERO1 shines through channels.</em> <br><br>  But this is only the beginning, a concept that should attract attention.  Faraday Future will release other more affordable electric cars.  Much attention was paid to the modular platform Variable Platform Architecture (VPA).  On its basis it is possible to create any configuration: from SUVs and pickups to compact city cars.  The FFZERO1 concept is a demonstration of VPA capabilities. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c00/fe9/bec/c00fe9bec31c474aa3d182465d63b74b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The core of any electric car are batteries.  Without a source of electricity there will be no movement.  Faraday Future conceived to collect batteries in rows.  To get an array of the required capacity, you need to change the number of these rows.  The battery platform is different in length, which allows you to create vehicles with different stroke ranges on a single charge and size.  Batteries are own development of Faraday Future.  The company does not name who will supply the battery cells. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d9/9c9/210/8d99c92100ce4857b0533b0862ea4af7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The batteries themselves are located in the center of the car, between the axles of the front and rear wheels.  One, two, three or even four engines can be inserted into the axes.  In the latter case, some modifications will be required.  Variation of engine configurations will allow to set the driving characteristics: speed and all-wheel drive.  VPA also provides a deformation zone configuration.  By changing the characteristics of a single architecture, electric cars Faraday Future will be created. <br><br>  The company understands that this is CES 2016, so various electronics are built into the VPA platform.  Including there are systems for autonomous driving.  Faraday Future did not name what. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAXoVSXnNTg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJZuOvJpwfloETPQzOuY5vdJ0YDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>The promo video explains the platform structure in English.</em> <br><br>  The company also <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10711164/faraday-future-ffzero1-concept-car-announced-photos-ces-2016">hinted</a> at the possibility of subscribing to cars.  Anyone can receive cars on request: today he needs a large SUV, and an electric car will drive up to his house on his own.  Tomorrow the same person can order a half-sport sedan. <br><br>  You can recall the story of another relatively successful manufacturer of electric cars.  When creating their first product, Tesla Motors <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/251022/">took the path of adapting</a> an existing one: batteries and an electric motor were put into a little sports car Lotus Elise.  Only the next for the Roadster Model S was created completely from scratch.  Faraday Future goes its own way. <br><br>  The company believes that the modularity of the VPA platform will help improve safety and quality, significantly reducing the costs of research and development.  Creating new models will be faster thanks to VPA, according to Faraday Future.  Whether this approach will help make electric cars massive is a billion question. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTLum2m6iqw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2T8IbFrVsbCAOHp-8c_P5JQRTKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <em>The company has released a panoramic panoramic promo, which seats the viewer in the driver‚Äôs seat of a supercar.</em> <br><br>  Neither the date of commencement of the sale of the products, nor the detailed characteristics of the batteries and engines were mentioned.  The company is only 1.5 years old, but Nick Sampson, senior vice president of Faraday Future, believes that the first mass production will begin in a couple of years.  The company currently employs 750 people: 550 in California and 200 outside the United States.  These are specialists who left BMW, Tesla, Audi, Google and Apple. <br><br>  As for FFZERO1, this is still only a concept, a set of renders, drawings and a full-size model on the stage.  It was announced about the possibility of limited release. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.faradayfuture.com/">www.faradayfuture.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367535/</a></p>
