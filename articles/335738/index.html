    <h2>  <a href="http://pluscoin.io/">DS Plus</a> : national cryptocurrency </h2><br>  Today, when new cryptocurrencies appear almost every day, it is difficult to understand all their diversity, and business often does not understand whether it can be used somehow.  To solve this problem, the authors of the PlusCoin project, a startup DS PLUS, are the creators, by their own definition, of the ‚Äúfirst national cryptocurrency‚Äù running on the Ethereum platform.  The meaning of the project is to maximally simplify the use of cryptocurrency and provide new sales channels for business representatives.  According to the ‚Äú <a href="http://pluscoin.io/images/dsp/pluscoin_wp_ru.pdf">Whitepaper</a> ‚Äù published on the site, it all works this way. <br><br>  DS Plus is a mobile application with a cashback service.  It works by analogy with the usual loyalty systems, where each user can receive cryptocurrency - in this case PlusCoin - for various actions: <br><br><ul><li>  visiting the shops of partner companies; </li><li>  shopping; </li><li>  writing reviews about products; </li><li>  inviting friends; </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  The number of partners for making purchases from which you can get cryptocurrency is constantly growing - now they are joined by regional and federal companies like X5 Retail Group, McDonalds or KFC.  After the end of ICO, users will have the opportunity to spend ‚Äúpluses‚Äù in a special store - there are goods or services of the partners of the system, and the currency can be freely exchanged on exchanges.  Now users of the system have a total ownership of 16,000,000 PlusCoin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8c2/ffc/759/8c2ffc759b4e4bd88fea96650a92ad7f.jpg"><br><br>  Link to ICO information: <a href="http://pluscoin.io/">pluscoin.io/#services</a> <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://opus-foundation.org/">OPUS</a> : decentralized music platform </h2><br>  The creators of the OPUS project are convinced that the music industry is unfair.  Streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Music take up to 80% of the artists' revenues, and if stars can still come to terms with such conditions, then not so well-known musicians often cannot make money from selling their music online. <br><br>  For music lovers, the situation is also unprofitable: major services compete for exclusive contracts with popular performers - as a result, the work of your favorite artists the Internet user can often legally listen online only on different sites.  The creators of the playlists also do not receive remuneration for this important work - the amount of traffic depends on how well the playlist is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d3a/82c/8ab/d3a82c8abc0a41a3ba700c7a2f1351c8.png"><br><br>  Opus developers have created a four-level decentralized system, which uses the IPFS protocol and the Ethereum blockchain.  Tracks are stored in the decentralized register UMRN (Universal Music Registry Number), and they can be accessed through both the Opus player and the API.  In the future, it is planned to introduce a bounty system for artists' earnings. <br><br>  ICO project is running, <a href="https://opus-foundation.org/index.php/crowdsale/">you can</a> participate <a href="https://opus-foundation.org/index.php/crowdsale/">here</a> .  A total of 1.6 million Opus tokens will be released: <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://socialx.network/">SocialX</a> : blockchain-social network </h2><br>  Popular social networks do not provide people with the ability to control their data and in many ways restrict them.  The creators of the project SocialX are convinced that the centralized architecture of social networks leads to the fact that they are forced to follow the censorship laws of different countries, this is the only way to stay in business and not lose important markets. <br><br>  In turn, SocialX is a decentralized social network, where photos, videos and correspondence are not stored centrally on platforms like Facebook or Instagram, instead they use the blockchain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/653/d7c/7e7/653d7c7e79104acfa2e60fa0970acec5.png"><br><br>  Using the SocialX application, users can communicate in an encrypted messenger, publish photos and videos (including live streams), as well as send payments and smart contracts to each other using the P2P protocol. <br><br>  To date, the project <a href="https://socialx.network/presale/">pre-sale</a> has been completed. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://dmarket.io/">DMarket</a> : a platform for selling and exchanging goods from online games </h2><br>  Currently, there are 2.2 billion people in the world who play games on different platforms and devices every day.  Back in 2016, the volume of the computer games industry reached $ 100 billion - and continues to grow.  However, only about 4,000 professional gamers earn through games.  Up to 94% of all gamers do not participate in the process of making money on games using trading.  The DMarket project seeks to change this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0e9/23f/440/0e923f4400bd4bcaadc6e6aba4b753a6.png"><br><br>  One of the main problems for which the trade in games is underdeveloped is the lack of integration of different game universes.  Players can not exchange goods from different games.  DMarket is a global marketplace based on the Ethereum blockchain. <br><br>  Any developers can connect their games to the decentralized database using the API.  Thus, players get the opportunity to exchange products from different games and sell them.  And previously fully virtual game objects become more similar to real assets. <br><br>  Preliminary sale of tokens is currently open: <a href="https://dmarket.io/">dmarket.io</a> <br><br>  And what interesting ICO do you know?
