  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some startups or search for treasure on the beach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article literally forced me to write a few of my familiar entrepreneurs.  It can be useful for beginning businessmen, as well as people who often have insights and brilliant ideas that promise a high income or a new round of human development, or simply become confused and have lost hope of success.  I also write it for myself in order to streamline the experience of the past few years and current thoughts.  And maybe instead of the next useless "promising" negotiations, I can just give a link to this article. <br><br>  Let's imagine for a while, as if there is only one way to find something valuable - search for a treasure (and this is not so far from the truth).  And consider what strategies there are and where they lead.  As it turned out, much of this is not at all obvious and people spend years on useless actions.  The article was quite long, but I don‚Äôt know how to explain it in short without losing some of the meaning.  In the comments welcome your stories on the topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b45/5f6/db7/b455f6db79a04e57a06ac0b735ccd8f7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      This is somewhat naive and at the same time children's strategy - to search for the Treasure on the beach.  I mean the Treasure, with a capital letter.  Few people are interested in finding something small and easily accessible, searching for shells quickly becomes boring, and everyone has it, the Treasure is interesting, a real treasure, one that distinguishes its owner from thousands, millions and billions of simple shells collectors.  It is often overlooked that this beach is usually public.  But for some reason a person stubbornly continues to believe that here on this very open beach, where every day there are thousands of feet on every square centimeter, it is here that he will find his Treasure.  Here naivety, arrogance, self-confidence, or most often a sense of self-importance may play a role.  He considers himself special, gifted, thousands and millions of people passed by and did not notice the Treasure, but here He, he will find a treasure here.  Unfortunately, this usually turns out to be another shell, or trifle, or life simply ends.  In the worst case, our hero finds some sort of treasure, such as a gold chain or a banknote.  Here it covers ... Here it is, here it is, a piece of the Klad!  You just have to search a little more! <br>  Unfortunately, this only reinforces a non-working strategy and prevents our hero from seeing some things more widely. <br><br>  Many at this stage covers (for the same reasons, self-esteem / naivety) and they begin to look for where it is easier to get around, which is again a variant of the same strategy.  They either see some kind of treasure hunter who, in their opinion, couldn‚Äôt get it all himself and decide that if he could break the rules, then they could be either, or they would replace the search for his Treasure with some kind of surrogates (often harmful to his health and wallet).  The result is usually quick and the same in both cases, reducing life, resources and freedom. <br><br>  Another option with the same strategy is ‚ÄúFast Treasures‚Äù, they are often called the same way, usually they are traps-mirages that actually take your Treasures and sometimes spoil your health.  Some supposedly experienced treasure hunter supposedly shares his experience for free as ‚Äúright here, every day / month / year, find the treasure here.‚Äù  More options "managing your Kladov", "search for treasures for you" and so on.  The first pages of twenty textbooks on logic would not give further listening to this nonsense, but usually at such moments the senses turn on and the brain turns off and even experienced uncles and aunts at a good age from time to time follow these paths.  Only all the organizers of such cases forget to indicate that only they find the Treasures and usually these are the small Treasures of all the other participants. <br><br>  The most intelligent or tired from the fact that for a long time they find nothing on this simple, accessible beach begin to think.  And here begins to appear a thin path to the real Kladov, untold riches.  Some are starting to use more advanced tools.  Having a good shovel is more likely to find something.  And with a metal detector at a good time you can already find micro treasures - catches of chains and coins appear more and more often.  Unfortunately often this is also a trap.  Receiving here reinforcements in the form of these tiny treasures, a person fixates on this and continues to search here.  After all, if I was lucky several times and found it here - I am lucky, I have an instrument that almost nobody has, I will find more.  The likelihood of finding a real treasure tends to zero, but with some tools you find at least something.  Even at this stage, all fears and limiting beliefs can emerge and a person closes on this piece of space, agreeing that this level suits him, for good, until the end of his life. <br><br>  And only a few, it‚Äôs not even 5%, not every fifth out of a hundred, as they usually say, but merely a fraction of a percent, can think even more widely and understand that the problem is not talent, tools or luck, but simply that On these beaches, hundreds of thousands of people like him are marking time.  And no matter how lucky it‚Äôs gifted and prepared, every inch of this beach is simply licked by the eyes and legs of other people.  The chances of finding something worthwhile here are monstrously small.  At this readily accessible level, everything worthy is most likely already found before you.  And here the hero can understand that there is not only this beach, its popular part, but also the little-researched parts around it.  And the farther from this beaten track, the fewer people there have ever been.  And it is there that one can find the rarest artifacts, treasures, lying hundreds and thousands of years intact.  Just because no one has been there ever since, or the units who visited there did not have the patience or care to find them.  Anyway, the likelihood of finding something new is greatly increasing there, at least because before you there was practically no one there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/05d/63c/91105d63cb9943c7b74fb75a900385a4.jpg"><br><br>  Although it is already easier to find something worthwhile, there are still obstacles.  Many are hampered by frequent changes in directions, they do not search for even one new area, throw it in the hope (or despair?) To quickly find something in the next, and not get experience from a detailed search inside this new location.  Others do not know which direction to choose or are afraid to make a choice (mass pressure options, from parents to the environment), although the world has a beach for everyone, would have the strength to find it (or remove restrictions to go this way), never they will enter a truly unexplored territory, where ancient wealth lies and waits for it to be found.  Or both will be rolled up and returned to the usual beach, where from time to time they will have something to do. <br><br>  Some have learned to love something or not at all, some for various reasons find it difficult to find something to love, some lack confidence in themselves and not listen to others and go their own way.  Whatever one may say, the motivation appears only from what you want, only this way you will go far.  Only if you like the process of being in a certain territory, will you get something extraordinary.  It is not known a single case when painfully waiting for the end of the current work, which was not at all joyful, a person would come to something great. <br><br>  A small number of seekers have chosen the road to their liking and are walking along it for years, finding more and more unprecedented rarities.  Often when they find out how he came to what he has, people say that they are not ready to go and dig so much.  This is partly true, they just do not like it, such a way of life or this particular field of inquiry. <br><br>  There will be to the place two quotes from the same book of one famous Treasure-hunter. <br><br><blockquote>  Back in the days of bodybuilding, I realized that everything is determined by the number of repetitions.  The more miles you ski, the better you will go;  the more times you repeat an exercise, the clearer the muscles will appear.  I firmly believe in hard work, in the fact that everything is extracted in the meantime, and I will not stop until the work is done, so I liked this work. <br><br>  I always compare life with the rise of the mountain - not only because there is a struggle in it, but also because the process of recovery itself gives me no less pleasure than being on top. </blockquote><br>  (Arnold Schwarzenegger: ‚ÄúRemembering everything: My incredibly true story‚Äù) <br><br>  And here the hero is waiting for the last trap, which separates those who looked in this direction from those units who found their Treasures, real, with a capital letter.  The trap is that it's a long time, maybe it's a whole life or even a few lives.  Perhaps you will choose this road and you will never see whether the treasure was there or not, maybe only your grandchildren or great-grandchildren will find Him.  To get there should be lucky to choose this particular direction to him.  More precisely, to one of them.  There are still a lot of them, but to get to one of them, you need to understand in which direction you really like to move and have the courage not to turn.  So there is enough strength to go farther and live longer (it's hard to live doing something compelled, under a stick).  Perhaps this is the most difficult, because it is these pitiful fractions of the percent of people that can only answer in which direction they are ready to go for years, which direction their passion really gets.  And only they will sooner or later reach these Treasures. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293314/</a></p>
