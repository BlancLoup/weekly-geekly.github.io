      Now Google has appealed to the Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeal. <a name="habracut"></a>  This court was created to verify the decisions taken by the arbitration courts of the city of Moscow.  The date of the new meeting has not yet been determined. <br><br>  For violation of the law "On Protection of Competition" Google faces a negotiable fine.  The size of the negotiable fine for an American company can range from 1 to 15% of the company's turnover in Russia.  In the case of the case against Google, FAS identified it as a market for pre-installed app stores in Russia, that is, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play">Google Play</a> revenue.  The size of the fine will be determined taking into account "various factors, aggravating circumstances - delaying the process and other things," said FAS head Igor Artemyev in early January. <br><br>  Initially, FAS suggested that the fine could be limited to 1% of Google‚Äôs revenue from an app store in Russia, but after the corporation went to court, Artemyev said that the fine could rise to 7%. <br><blockquote>  Presumably, in 2014 Google Play in Russia earned about $ 40.5 million, in which case the penalty would have been about $ 2.8 million. </blockquote>  FAS, which on Wednesday planned to announce the size of the fine of the Internet company Google, postponed the adoption of this decision, the FAS representative said.  ‚ÄúThe number of stages and the duration of the judicial appeal will not affect the size in any way, only on the date of collection.  The company has already shown that the FAS does not agree with the decision when it went to arbitration, so the penalty will not be increased, but the reduction due to the voluntary elimination of the violation is clearly not foreseen, ‚Äùan RNS source <a href="https://rns.online/internet/Istochnik-v-FaS-apellyatsiya-Google-ne-povliyaet-na-razmer-shtrafa--2016-04-14/">said</a> . <br><br>  "Google did not receive notice of the time and date of the case," explained in the Office of the reason for the transfer, adding that the new deadline was selected on May 11. <br><br>  In the fall of 2015, FAS <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/19964">recognized</a> that Google was violating competition law.  Initially, the case was <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/10660/">initiated</a> on the application of "Yandex" on February 20, 2015, accusing Google of restricting competition and the targeted obstruction of user access to software of other developers.  Google was supposed to comply with the decision of the FAS before November 18, 2015. <br><br>  In the course of the investigation, FAS concluded that the American company only allowed manufacturers to install Google Play on Android devices with only a number of other applications.  At the same time, Google requires that they be placed in priority locations on the screen and prohibits vendors from pre-installing applications from other developers on their devices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300128/</a></p>
