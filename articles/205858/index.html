The future is us!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bef/04f/838/bef04f838fb8eb5de39b67a3a4c344c0.png"><br><br>  In each <b>habrager there</b> lives a small, and maybe a very big man who wants to change the world and help people.  This article is for you. <br>  Do you know a company in which employees work only on those projects that they really like?  Where there is no boss, where the atmosphere of ingenuity, creativity and enterprise prevails, and the field for creativity is not just huge, but elevated to the nlogn degree.  Where everyone works only then, and where he will be comfortable, and as much as he wants.  ‚ÄúFiction, a fairy tale,‚Äù you say. <br>  No, this is a reality, and it is called <b>Opensource 2.0</b> , where the code is the employees and We are already working in it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Preamble</b> </h4><br>  About 500 000 thousand years ago, verbal communication originated.  Later, this ability has become a language of communication.  The creatures that precede us have raised the interaction between them to a fundamentally new level, which was the impetus for the current and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198948/">further development of</a> human intelligence. <br><br>  <b>Habrahabr</b> is a community where tens of thousands of professionals of various specialties work hard at work every day: designers, programmers, investors, managers, lawyers, economists and many others.  We write articles, programs, share knowledge, discuss problems, ideas, and find solutions.  Thanks to the Internet, we grew up initially ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù by sociality.  For this reason, <b>SportHabr</b> and other similar projects have not fired.  Each of us works at our pleasure and only when it is convenient for him.  People thank others for raising karma.  Imagine that karma could pay for goods.  Good bonus?  Would you not have refused if even a stranger could raise it, thanking for solving his problem or just to support you?

On the other hand, many experts would like to work on what they like and not on other people's projects, but <a href="https://toster.ru/q/24957">they do not have</a> their own <a href="https://toster.ru/q/24957">ideas.</a>  For some, the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartmarket/blog/172523/">‚ÄúWhere</a> <a href="https://toster.ru/q/35545">to invest</a> <a href="http://toster.ru/q/7574">money</a> ?‚Äù Is relevant. We write about a multitude of projects that are foreign to other users.  We can be happy for success and regret if ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have that‚Äù, but why?  After all, you can do something, not just talk. <br><br><h4>  <b>Decision</b> </h4><br>  To unite and create a cowork platform, with <s>blackjack</s> communication, bugtracker, version control system and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168939/">rating</a> , where each of us, even if he is not an expert, or he has no money, will be able to offer his own idea.  Being supported by the community, it will find like-minded people and jointly be able to realize all their ideas.  Money for the project can be found with investors or collect <b>crowdfunding</b> . <br>  Other professionals will also want to work in a community where everyone is happy with them, where they will receive deserved recognition from understanding, creative, and ideologically close people.  Here they will be able to work for their own pleasure and their contribution will be known to all.  <s>Snowden and Assandzh will certainly want to work with us.</s>  We are already able to implement any idea, as the first self-organizing and non-taxable <b>p2p</b> company. <br><br>  <b>Pursued goals:</b> <br>  1. That experts find ideas that are ready to implement and make money in a convenient way for them. <br>  2. So that those who have ideas and no opportunity to implement them, could get this opportunity. <br>  3. So that everyone who is interested in the idea could simultaneously be an investor, a salesman, and propose options and ask questions. <br>  4. In order for specialists to exchange experience, including with those who would like to learn how to create projects. <br><br>  Your humble servant thanks users <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/id120/" class="user_link">ID120</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/id120/" class="user_link">sapp</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sapp/" class="user_link">ncix</a> for their contribution and moral support in writing this article and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/volgarastraport/" class="user_link">Volgarastraport</a> for the image. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúTo be who we are and to become what we can become is the only goal of life.‚Äù - <b>Baruch Spinoza</b> </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/285/3db/a16/2853dba16addd1ff90da54d385a9ef81.png"><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Left the main idea in order not to overshadow the importance of its discussion in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205858/</a></p>
