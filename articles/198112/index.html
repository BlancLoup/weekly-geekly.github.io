The original version of the book was published under the Creative Commons license and made publicly available by the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) specialists Abdus Salam in Trieste (Italy) in April 2013.

      The book is located on the <a href="http://sdu.ictp.it/3D/book.html">website of the</a> center: It can be downloaded both in a compact size and in good quality.  There is also a multimedia version for iPad owners (if someone has the opportunity to see what this version is, please write about the impressions, because the promised * .ePub version is ‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù for now).  The authors also uploaded a version of the book to the main library of 3D printers <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:91556">Thingiverse</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The book is currently the most complete, current, detailed and rich source of knowledge about budget / personal 3D printers and 3D printing.  The book tells about the history of 3D printing, the types of printers (and budgetary advantages over industrial ones), printing methods, 3D CAD modeling programs (and the advantages of paid and free programs), gives basic definitions of 3D printing, describes various methods of using personal 3D printers. , describes how recycling plastic waste can improve the environment and create useful things, how to teach 3D printing of children.  I dare say that a representative of any profession with the help of this book will understand and find for itself the advantages of 3D printing and feel all the potential that it contains! <br><br><h4>  Book's contents: </h4><br><ul><li>  1.

Infinite plastic design </li></ul><br><br><h4>  purpose </h4><br>  I really want all this innovative knowledge in our native language to be made available to all who strive to make the world a better place, to everyone who is creative, think outside the box, everyone who sees in the future of our country only a bright and dignified future.  This book is for creators.  The book after the completion of the translation and bringing in a respectable form will be laid out in free general access in accordance with the license and in agreement with the authors of the book.  All participants in the translation will be listed in the appropriate section (agreed with the authors of the book). <br><br><h4>  What is done </h4><br>  At the moment there is a draft translation of the book, partially machine, partially translated by amateurs.  Opening the translation for general uncontrolled access, I hope that everyone who is not indifferent to the subject of 3D printers and 3D printing will correct or suggest his own version of at least one paragraph of the book.  So the translation can be completed in record time. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Since the number of people who responded to a request for help after publishing the topic of translation at the <a href="http://roboforum.ru/forum107/topic11262.html">robot forum</a> (a <a href="http://roboforum.ru/post284443.html">separate topic</a> ), the <a href="http://forum.rep-rap.ru/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D186">rep-rap</a> community and the <a href="http://roboforum.ru/forum107/topic11262.html">VKontakte</a> community of the <a href="http://vk.com/3dmake">same name</a> hardly exceeded 5 people, the author and his closest associate invested their own funds in transfer.  The translation was made by a translator who is not an expert in 3D printing, so you need to reread everything carefully, and the more independent opinions there are, the better the book will turn out.  Information is rapidly losing relevance, it would be a shame if all efforts and resources were spent in vain. <br><br>  I ask all caring who have a little free time to contribute to the translation of this wonderful book.  I also plan to coordinate with the authors and make in the book 21 chapters about the achievements in 3D printer-making and printing in our country, it seems to me that for the Russian localization of the book this will be the way. <br><br>  Section on the translation of the book on the <a href="http://notabenoid.com/book/41907">site</a> notabenoid.  This is where the translation work is in full swing.  The friendly interface of the site and a couple of plug-ins for Chrome (such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4/bagkmcapnndnncpcocmfplbdejejlgig">Yandex.Translate</a> ) create a favorable friendly atmosphere for translators, editors and readers. <br><br>  Any suggestions, suggestions and assistance in the implementation of the project are welcome. <br><br><hr><br>  Update 4/17/14 <br>  Hooray!  The book <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/219705/">saw the</a> light! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198112/</a></p>
