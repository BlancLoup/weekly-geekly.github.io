  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelancer Stereotypes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A little in defense of the profession.  Show it to those who build their opinions on guesswork!  In any kind of activity, there are quite a few stereotypes about workers.  Razveem several common - about freelancers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15a/151/337/15a151337d0349d0b94c588dbbdfc7d8.jpg"><br><br>  Free workers are not deprived of attention, there are even more stereotypes about them than about other people, so what is most often said by ignorance: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Freelancers - loners, then lonely people.</b>  Many people think so associatively.  Perhaps it is on this basis that this stereotype arose, it really exists and is firmly established in the minds of people.  However, this is a false assumption.  Many freelancers have families, couples, and maybe someone will be surprised, even children!  It‚Äôs just that their work can be planned by them so that it doesn‚Äôt take them away from their relatives at all or for some time.  Everything is in time!

      <b>Freelancers - lazy.</b>  Of course - Yes, in most cases ... but - No, No, and again No!  Rather, and - Yes, and - No.  This type of activity is far from being easier than with office workers.  These people combine mental work with creative.  It should also be noted that for work, freelancers often need to get a lot of additional information.  They are always ready to learn new things and to understand what they did not know yet, to be active and inquisitive.  It‚Äôs wrong to consider freelancers lazy, yes, they can always take a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù for themselves, but their work also requires high self-organization. <br><br>  <b>Freelancers are coffee lovers.</b>  Of course, everyone knows that coffee is invigorating.  And novice freelancers have to sleep a little, and they replenish their energy reserves with the help of this drink.  However, those who have more experience, respectively, and plan their working time so that everyone has time - and work, and relax, and sleep.  So they don‚Äôt have to drink a lot of coffee.  And over time, freelancers return to lighter drinks ‚Äî be it juice, teas, or water. <br><br>  <b>Freelancers are like ‚Äúhungry artists.‚Äù</b>  In reality, this is only a stereotype.  Some are engaged in freelancing to have an additional source of income, while having more and the main work.  But many earned a good state only through freelancing.  For example, those who write materials for well-known and popular publications.  But you don‚Äôt need to dwell on writing texts.  Take a wider look at freelancing - translations, design, guides, teaching, tutoring, programming.  Yes, a lot of what you can find yourself.  The main thing is to work hard, patience, and, quite possibly, you will earn your first million with the help of freelancing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/659/dc7/6f2659dc78db4c25872c572d52358955.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Freelancer - is "unemployed."</b>  Many will say: - if a person works remotely, then this is not a job at all.  And again a delusion!  To be considered employed, it‚Äôs not at all necessary that a person leave home in the morning, return in the evening, and bring a salary once a month.  Freelancers, in fact, work no less than others, and sometimes more.  Just their choice - to do it at home, and at a time when it is convenient for them.  And sometimes, in comparison with full-time employees, they earn significantly more. <br><br>  <b>Freelancers are easy to work and live.</b>  This is the question!  In the work of a freelancer a lot of different moments that are not always pleasant.  Nearly all freelancers have close friends who believe that since they are at home working remotely, they can be distracted for any reason.  But after all, it is very easy to knock down the working attitude, and can lead to untimely execution of the task.  Plus - very often the demanding customer, whom everything does not suit, but you tried, and came to work with full responsibility!  Still, such work requires considerable diligence, it is also necessary to constantly replenish the knowledge base, to develop, and it is not uncommon for creativity.  So only at first glance you might think that all this is so simple.  You will not understand the freelancer without having been in his place. <br><br>  <b>Freelancer can be anyone.</b>  Is not a fact.  Even if it is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù to rewrite articles, one must first of all have writing talent.  And in copywriting, translations, guided tours, we are not talking about many other areas - and even more so.  You should have not only knowledge, but also talent, and love for your work, this is not given to everyone.  Only in this case, you will achieve at least some success in the field of freelancing.  So if you, for example, have a good command of the word, know languages ‚Äã‚Äãand translate, try yourself at the <a href="http://2polyglot.com/ur/1781">site for linguists</a> (freelance linguists), which brings together translators, copywriters, tutors, guides, helping them earn money, and those who need them. services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cce/051/439/cce05143947c4f78b0ec3e40e4d3dbde.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> - without having experienced all the features on yourself, you should not deal with condemnations and criticism, or envy the representatives of this profession.  Freelancers should value their reputation, so they should be purposeful and responsible.  Without this, there will be no orders, and without orders there will be no freelancing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291746/</a></p>
