      So what is the difference between art and design?  In this article we will consider and compare some basic principles of each of the directions. <br><br>  This topic is not a definitive guide, but rather a starting point for discussions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  A good work of art is inspiring.  Good design motivates. </h1><br><img src="http://fluxlab.am/habr/dva/1.jpg"><br>  <strong>Perhaps the most fundamental difference between art and design, with which we all agree, is their goal.</strong> <br><br>  As a rule, the process of creating a work of art begins from scratch, with an empty canvas.  The work of art derives from the representations, opinions or sensations of the artist. <br><br>  Artists create a work of art to share their feelings with others, allow viewers to learn from them or to inspire them. <br><br>  The most famous (and successful) works of art today are those that <strong>establish the strongest emotional connections between the artist and his audience</strong> . <br><br>  On the contrary, when a designer is going to create something, he almost always has a starting point, be it a message, an image, an idea, or an action. <br><br>  <strong>The work of the designer is not to invent something new, but to combine something for a specific purpose.</strong> <br><br>  The goal is to motivate the audience to do something: buy a product, use the service, visit a place, get certain information.  The most successful are those designs that effectively convey the ideas of the designer and motivate consumers to perform some task. <br><br><h1>  A good work of art is interpreted.  Good design is understandable. </h1><br><img src="http://fluxlab.am/habr/dva/2.jpg"><br>  Another difference between art and design is <strong>how the meaning of each of them is interpreted by their respective audience</strong> . <br><br>  Although the artist expresses his point of view or emotion, it does not mean that point of view or emotion has one meaning. <br><br>  <strong>A work of art is perceived by people in different ways, because it is interpreted in different ways.</strong> <br><br>  Da Vinci's painting ‚ÄúMona Lisa‚Äù was interpreted and discussed over the years.  Why is she smiling?  According to scientists, this is an illusion created by your peripheral vision.  Romantics say she is in love.  Skeptics say that there is no reason or reason for her smile.  None of them are right. <br><br>  The design has the opposite meaning.  Many will say that if the design can be ‚Äúinterpreted‚Äù in any way, the designer has failed for his own purposes. <br><br>  <strong>The fundamental goal of design is to transfer the designer‚Äôs ideas to the user and his motivation to do something.</strong> <br><br>  If your design conveys an idea different from the one you intended to convey, and your user does some action based on this received idea, then the design failed.  With a good design, the exact ideas of the designer are conveyed to the user. <br><br><h1>  A good work of art is a sign of taste.  Good design is an opinion. </h1><br><img src="http://fluxlab.am/habr/dva/3.jpg"><br>  <strong>A work of art is judged by opinion and taste governs opinion.</strong> <br><br>  For visionary modern art enthusiasts, the work of Tracey Emin ‚ÄúMy Bed‚Äù (My Bed), which was nominated for the ‚ÄúTurner Prize‚Äù in 1999, may seem like the height of artistic expression. <br>  For a follower of more traditional art, this work may be offensive.  This refers to our point of view about interpretation, but taste is more what a certain person likes and does not like, than what message he receives from a work of art. <br><br>  <strong>Design carries an element of taste, but the difference between good and bad design is in many ways a matter of taste.</strong> <br><br>  Good design can still be successful, even if you don‚Äôt like it.  If he fulfills his goal, is understandable and motivates people to do something, then he is good or not, this is a matter of taste. <br><br>  We could discuss this particular issue, but I hope that the principle is clear. <br><br><h1>  A good work of art is talent.  Good design is craftsmanship. </h1><br><img src="http://fluxlab.am/habr/dva/4.jpg"><br>  What about the abilities of the artist and designer? <br><br>  Most often, <strong>the artist has natural abilities</strong> .  Of course, from an early age, the artist grows painting, painting, sculpting and developing his abilities. <br><br>  But the true value of the artist lies in his talent (or innate abilities) with which he was born.  Good artists, of course, have abilities, but artistic skills without talent, perhaps, are useless. <br><br>  <strong>However, design is an ability that is taught and taught</strong> .  You do not need to be a great artist to be a great designer;  you just need to learn good design. <br><br>  Some of the most respected designers in the world are known for their minimalist style.  They do not use a lot of colors or textures, but they pay a lot of attention to size, positioning and the distances between design elements, which can be learned without innate talent. <br><br><h1>  A good piece of art conveys different messages to everyone. <br>  Good design conveys the same message to everyone. </h1><br><img src="http://fluxlab.am/habr/dva/5.jpg"><br>  This falls under the second point of interpretation and understanding.  But if you memorize only one item from this article, then remember this particular item. <br><br>  Many designers consider themselves artists, because they create something visually appealing. <br><br>  But the <strong>visual composition is designed to perform a specific task, to convey a specific message.</strong>  <strong>Regardless of how beautiful the design is, it is not a work of art</strong> .  Design is a form of communication, just a window that contains a message, information. <br><br>  Few artists call themselves designers, as they seem to understand the difference better.  Artists do not create their paintings for the sale of goods or promotion services.  They create it solely for self-expression so that it can be viewed and appreciated by others.  The message, if we can even call it that, is not a fact, but a feeling. <br><br><h1>  What do you think? </h1><br><br>  Depending on how you look at it, the difference between art and design can be clear or hazy.  These two concepts, of course, intersect, but art is more personal, causing a strong reaction in those associated with it. <br><br>  I leave you with this quote from Craig Elimeliah (Craig Elimeliah), who covered this topic in his fantastic article for AIGA, which I discovered in the course of my research for this article. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI do not pretend to be an expert to decide what art is and what art is not, but I know that if we look at the differences between art and design, we will see a very clear dividing line between them. <br><br>  The engineer can create a beautiful website if you give him the exact coordinates to insert different color pixels, or by following specific instructions;  Most of the design projects have detailed instructions and most designs are based on current trends. <br><br>  The artist, on the other hand, can never receive any instructions for creating a new chaotic and unique masterpiece, because his emotions and soul will dictate to his hands the movement. <br><br>  The art director will not shout at the artist due to the fact that he created something absolutely unique, because this makes the artist an artist, not a designer. ‚Äù </blockquote><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70470/</a></p>
