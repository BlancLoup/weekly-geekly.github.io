  <section class="page js-page"><h1>YavGroup - communities of people with the same interests</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While working on our main OneMarkt project, we have always strived to learn more about our industry and meet people with the same professional interests as we have.  However, to find and collect such people was quite problematic.  As a result, we opened our second second social project.  YavGroup - a site where people with the same interests can organize events.  For businesses, this is a great way to use the full power of the Internet and online marketing to interact with customers offline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/97a/787/9f2/97a7879f21639579443db8f3947d93f6.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Where to begin?</b>

      An excellent start will be a survey of their clients about their problems and needs.  How could you help them?  Who would they like to talk about?  If you could pinpoint the problems that your customers want to solve, this would give them an incentive to attend your events. <br><br>  It is worth considering that at your events, customers will not always be happy to talk and listen only about your business.  You can use YavGroup to promote your business indirectly, but to make it interesting for your clients to get together and discuss a pressing issue.  Choose a theme for an event that is not only relevant to your business, but also interesting to your customers. <br>  <b>Holding regular events</b> <br><br>  As soon as you open your interest group at YavGroup, start holding regular events sponsored by your business.  This may be informal meetings, seminars or workshops.  Communities of YavGroup can be both clearly specialized and groups where people gather to drink coffee and discuss business topics.  To build a successful Community, you will need some active audience already.  Try using your customer base to attract first visitors. <br><br>  <b>Why do I need YavGroup, if there is the same function in social networks?</b> <br><br>  This is the first and most popular question that we were asked all the way to create a site.  In fact, we just think that social networks are created for online communication and sharing of photos with friends and colleagues (as well as an excellent music player and movie theater).  Creating your event there, the thing is undoubtedly simple and easy.  But if you are not a large public, then unleash it will be quite problematic.  It will be necessary either to advertise in groups of the city, or in the social network itself.  Moreover, it will be necessary to do daily posts and maintain interest in the event.  And, typing participants, not the fact that half of them will not be bots (fake accounts). <br><br>  YavGroup is intended only for offline events by regular users with the same interests.  Having created your group once, you do not need to re-assemble the participants for each new event.  They will learn about it immediately after creation.  Each new site visitor, visiting the site just like that, may be interested in your meeting and become a regular participant.  In the near future, you will also be able to sell tickets to your meetings, and make your Group profitable. <br><br>  <a href="http://yavgruppe.ru/">Visit our project YavGroup can be on this link.</a> <br><br>  For more information about holding events at YavGroup, you can find out here: <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/19734/">How can thematic events help your business?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20214/">How to conduct professional events with business benefits?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/onemarkt/blog/20434/">Customer Care: From Online to Offlan</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298326/</a></p>
