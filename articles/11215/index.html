  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I loved adobe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started is banal - friends constantly poked me into the fact that I absolutely do not understand anything in the charms and powers of this magic word ‚ÄúPhotoshop‚Äù ... And one fine summer evening I decided!  I remember, then it was Adobe Photoshop 5.0.  I admit honestly, in the beginning it seemed to me that I really would never comprehend the Tao of the art of working with photos ... Yes, I did not have a camera as such‚Ä¶ The only thing that kept me from not closing the window was my strange indulgence to all unknown :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, indeed, the programs of the years gone are no match for those existing today.  Take at least modern CS3.  But this, in principle, is not about that.  I would like to talk about how I really liked the products of the corporation Adobe. <br><br>  So, comprehending Photoshop, I gradually began to be interested in similar software products.  The next work from Adobe, which caught my eye, was the editor (I would even say the studio) Adobe After Effects.  Honestly, at first I didn‚Äôt even understand why this miracle of the collective mind was intended :) Everything comes with experience ... And finally, I had my own digital video camera!  It was a turning point in my relationship with Adobe products.  At this point I also found out about Audition, which the corporation successfully bought right before my acquaintance with it, and Premiere, which, in fact, I still use very often now.  And the result of all the above is the fact that Adobe throughout my ‚Äúcreative‚Äù path safely supplies me with everything I need, and it seems to me that sometimes it even reads my thoughts. <br><br>  So, in order.  I think it‚Äôs not worth explaining what <b>Photoshop is</b> , and how it serves Muses :) If you don‚Äôt talk about all sorts of tools for working with graphics, I really like serious integration with the Web in this product, and even such a nice little thing as the ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù section. "In the list of filters.

      <b>Audition</b> - in a word, lovely :) Most of the time I use it for sound editing to my home movies.  And whatever you say, I have not yet met a better tool for this purpose.  Ability to work with multichannel sound (including 5.1).  A large and expandable collection of filters and effects.  And, as you know, the high-quality voice of the film - 50% of success. <br><br>  <b>Premiere</b> .  "There is nothing better in the world ..." among the semi-professional editors of non-linear video editing for home video.  Here you have both professional color correction, masking in various ways, the ability to create compositions with complex effects, and even work with sound, and rich export possibilities in the most popular formats ... you can‚Äôt list it all ... The only thing today is that I don‚Äôt have the option to smoothly change speed video playback, such as in After Effects or Sony Vegas.  But, I hope, this time too, Adobe will ‚Äúread my thoughts‚Äù :) <br><br>  <b>After Effects</b> - this is where the flight of fantasy is not limited to sets of standard effects and transitions, as it happens in ordinary non-professional editors like Pinnacle Studio.  In general, After Effects allows you to prepare materials for printing, digital photography, digital video and audio, and even 3D animation!  But still, I think that a more appropriate definition for this product is ‚ÄúPhotoshop for dynamic images‚Äù. <br><br>  And in conclusion of this list, I would like to mention my beloved <b>Encore DVD,</b> all from the same Adobe Corporation!  This DVD authoring program plays an important role in the home video creation chain.  Everything related to the final format of the film and its sound tracks, the menu and its logic, splitting into parts and chapters, is solved here.  I admit, sometimes I change the program Encore DVD, and for solving more complex problems using DVD Lab PRO.  This does not in any way make Encore DVD a weak link in the chain, because  he regains his position due to the main principle of all Adobe software products - a high level of "cohesion" and interaction with each other.  At this stage, such interaction is carried out by linking at the level of objects, i.e.  from one application, you can call another to edit any element of the project.  For example, a DVD menu sheet for Encore DVD can be completely drawn in Photoshop, marking the layers as ‚Äúbackground‚Äù, ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù in different states, ‚Äúvideo output location‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  I am sure that this will not end my acquaintance with Adobe products, because there is still a huge amount of them to ‚Äúexpress themselves‚Äù.  For example, Adobe Illustrator.  Well, everyone to capture their memorable events, moreover, to preserve bright memories forever, I advise you to quickly join the circle of fans of Adobe :) and share in the future their impressions and, of course, experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11215/</a></p>
