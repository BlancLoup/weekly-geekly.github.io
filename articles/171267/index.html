That is, if the user has typed "Buy an elephant", then the task of the search engine is to give him sites where you can buy an elephant.  Ideally, this should be a page with information about the elephant and a buy button.

    <h4>  Who love PS </h4><br>  This is the first question you should ask yourself. <br>  Of course, the search engine is interesting constantly evolving site, which adds new and unique content (whether text, pictures or video). <br>  Probably, people (and other sites) will refer to such a site, since  there is a unique and interesting information.  The more such links the site gets, the better.  In the world of SEO, this is called external optimization (but more on that at the very end). <br>  Consider this question ... <br><br><h4>  Search engine algorithm </h4><br>  This is the set of rules that the search engine is guided by when forming its search results.  Simply put: "whom to put first and who last".  If you know this algorithm - you are the God of optimization. <br>  To make life more difficult for optimizers, the algorithm is constantly being improved. <br><br><h4>  How does the search engine learn about new sites? </h4><br>  Each search engine has a bulldog that runs and sniffs websites.  And he runs on all the links on the Internet.  And the more often new information appears on your site, the more often this bulldog runs to you. <br><br><h4>  Update (update, ap) search engine </h4><br>  Yandex search engine as mother-in-law.  It accumulates information for a long time, and then spits it out (updates the information of search results).  Often there is a situation where your site can jump from 50th place to 1-10 every second (and someone has and vice versa ...).  Information about updates can be viewed on many resources, such as <a href="http://seopult.ru/">seopult</a> . <br><br><h2>  Optimizer </h2><br>  This is a person who <s>pokes a finger into the sky</s> trying to guess the search results algorithm.  In the entire history of the war between optimizers and search engines, a set of specific standards has appeared that help the optimizer move the site to the leading positions. <br><br>  Hence the first rule: <br>  <u><i>The most <b>honest SEO</b> is its absence, everything else is speculation.</i></u> <br><br><h2>  Search engine optimization </h2><br>  Search engine optimization (SEO, website promotion) - a set of measures to raise the position of the site in the results of search engines (Yandex, Google, etc.) according to certain user requests. <br><br>  Examples of such requests: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Buy an elephant <br>  ‚Ä¢ Anna Semenovich Breast <br>  ‚Ä¢ Flooring in St. Petersburg <br>  ‚Ä¢ Car buying <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wedding photographer cheap <br>  ‚Ä¢ Other <br><br>  This raises the question: ‚ÄúWhere do these requests come from?‚Äù. <br>  Many optimizers will tell you "there are special services" or "look at competitors".  <u><b>Yes, BUT !!!</b></u> <br><br>  Remember why you are doing site optimization?  What is your main goal? <br>  I don‚Äôt think that it is ‚ÄúI want to be in Yandex in the first place‚Äù, most likely it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI want to increase my sales‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to attract more customers to my service‚Äù or ‚Äúfew people know about my services, and they were would be interesting to society. " <br><br>  Feel the difference?  Most optimizers select queries: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Which people type in search <br>  ‚Ä¢ Which are easy to promote <br>  ‚Ä¢ Religious considerations <br>  ‚Ä¢ <u><b>Seem to be</b></u> really effective. <br><br>  The only correct choice: <br>  1. Require from the customer areas of activity that bring him profit <br>  2. Demand from the customer the areas of activity in which he would like to develop (but he must be ready to provide the product / service to the customer 100%) <br>  3. Require a customer to take a photograph of his main client (age, gender, habitat, breast size) <br>  4. Additional information that will help you attract potential customers and really targeted (efficient) traffic <br><br>  Hence the second rule: <br>  <u><i>Learn the maximum of useful information before starting optimization (it is advisable to communicate directly with marketers or management)</i></u> <br><br>  And only after that it is worth referring to spec  Services. <br><br><h2>  Keyword Services </h2><br>  The main purpose of accessing such services is to find out how many people a month have typed in a certain key phrase.  For example, we want to add the query ‚Äúbuy a strawberry‚Äù and don‚Äôt know whether it will bring traffic.  Turning to the spec.  The service, we find out how many people per month recruited the query "buy a strawberry." <br><br><h4>  Frequency </h4><br>  The frequency of the request refers to the number of search queries applied to specific phrases or words given by users during a certain time ‚Äî most often within a month.  ( <a href="http://seowikipedia.su/">stolen</a> ) <br><br>  There are 3 types of frequency: <br>  1. Basic <br>  2. Accurate <br>  3. "Super accurate (takes into account the end)" <br><br>  Let's look at some of the services and look at the difference between the types of frequency. <br><br><h4>  wordstat.yandex.ru </h4><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c6/361/847/3c63618476f976df22c213a75d5332bd.jpg"><br><br>  To get started, we need to set the desired region: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/daf/064/78bdaf064ac4828e5a5d2173da1d8d90.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e66/763/c7a/e66763c7a89742555189c8af2b210711.jpg"><br><br>  Be careful, some companies work in the Leningrad region, and some only in St. Petersburg.  It mainly depends on the active company and of course the stage of development. <br><br><h4>  Base frequency </h4><br>  If we enter a key phrase in the search box, we will get the base frequency. <br>  In the column "impressions per month" (located on against each keyword or phrase) is a mysterious figure.  <b>This figure shows how many times users typed our key phrase in the Yandex string (separately or as part of other key phrases).</b>  If the phrase has a word form, it is also taken into account.  That is, ‚Äúteacher‚Äù and ‚Äúteachers‚Äù for Yandex is one word (in the base frequency). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc3/f90/4ff/bc3f904ffc3f9318fe5979706665eaa4.jpg"><br><br>  In the left column we see "what else were you looking for with this key phrase". <br>  In the right-hand column ‚ÄúWhat else were people looking for [our keyword]‚Äù <br>  Both columns tell us which words can be added to our project, and whether to add them is up to you. <br><br><h4>  Exact frequency </h4><br>  The exact frequency shows how many times users typed in our Yandex line our key phrase and its word forms.  The key phrase must be entered in double quotes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a44/0fa/941/a440fa9417f2a89efc555f93f3d0138c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/933/891/d01/933891d018319dc96cb62e99e6c82b33.jpg"><br><br>  As you see the word form (take the light) received as many hits as our ‚Äútrue phrase‚Äù (take the light). <br><br><h4>  "Ultra-precise frequency" </h4><br>  Probably, you have already guessed that this frequency shows how many times users typed in our Yandex line our key phrase and does not take into account its word forms.  The key phrase needs to be entered ‚ÄúDouble quotation mark, exclamation mark, key phrase, double quotation mark‚Äù (as in the picture). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/938/110/f48/938110f48345576a89fd3b42b8e962fb.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e13/6c9/c4c/e136c9c4c6207bc29fb5cac0b1930d8c.jpg"><br><br>  I think that the conclusions you make yourself. <br>  To automatically collect the frequency of key phrases, use the program <b><u><a href="http://www.key-collector.ru/">KeyCollector</a></u></b> and its <a href="http://seom.info/2012/05/04/slovoeb-2-0/">free equivalent (18+)</a> . <br><br>  On the Internet there are many more similar services, use the one that is more convenient for you. <br><br><h2>  Low Frequency (LF), Mid-Frequency (MF) and High Frequency (HF) Requests </h2><br>  When they make up the semantic core (the requests by which we will promote the site), the key phrases are divided into groups, taking into account the frequency and with the help of logical thinking given to us from above. <br><br>  <b>Low Frequency Requests (LF)</b> - Requests that are rarely dialed.  Consequently, it is easier (and most importantly, faster) to bring them into the TOP10 (first 10 positions of search results).  They have the smallest competition. <br><br>  <b>Medium Frequency Queries (MF)</b> - queries that refer to the "golden mean".  They are recruited more often than LF, but less often than HF (see further). <br><br>  <b>High Frequency Requests (RF)</b> - Requests that are typed most often.  According to them, the strongest competition and the most difficult to bring them into the TOP10 (not to mention the battle for the TOP3). <br><br>  For each field of activity, there are always numbers of frequencies, so no one will tell you the exact number for all areas. <br><br>  To make it clearer, consider <b><u>an example:</u></b> <br>  I highlighted the key phrases that we will use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91f/e2a/837/91fe2a8376f6fefc0553547ac11efe06.jpg"><br><br>  Let's look at their frequency (use the program <b>KeyCollector</b> , if you do not have it, you can manually drive in all the key phrases in <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02b/3fb/70c/02b3fb70cf89407690d00e5fdb739198.jpg"><br><br>  I noticed that the difference in the "exact" and "and even more precisely" frequencies is very large in the request " <b>wedding photographer prices</b> ."  In such cases, you need to pick up similar queries and search for the largest number by the last frequency.  What was done (the keyword " <b>prices wedding photographer</b> "). <br><br>  Here is how we distribute the requests (in the latter frequency): <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>RF&gt; 600</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>SC 80 - 600</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>LF &lt;80</b> <br>  (each distributes as he likes, based on their own practice). <br><br>  Our group of key requests to the wedding photographer page: <br>  <b>Wedding Photographer (HF)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Wedding photographer SPB (SC)</b> <b><br></b>  <b><font color="green">Prices wedding photographer (MF)</font></b> <b><br></b>  <b>Wedding photographer Petersburg (LF)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Best Wedding Photographer (LF)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Wedding photographer cheap (LF)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The best wedding photographers SPB (LF)</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  Basically in a group of requests there should be something like this: <br>  <b>HF - 1/5</b> <b><br></b>  <b>SC - 2/5</b> <b><br></b>  <b>LF - 3/5</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  (You can do it completely differently, there are no strict rules ... practice, only practice) <br><br>  Please note that we completely excluded the request ‚Äú <b>Wedding photographer professionally</b> ‚Äù, because of the latter frequency it has zero result. <br><br><h2>  SEO texts and what they eat </h2><br>  Remember, I spoke at the very beginning about the search results algorithm?  Not?  Read again! <br>  The search engine looks at many things on your site; texts are one of those things. <br>  <b>SEO text</b> is the most common text, but it contains key phrases. <br><br>  The text is one of the most important ‚Äúthings‚Äù and should be taken very seriously.  Only experiments will help here. <br><br>  SEO Text Features: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not overdo it with key phrases (make it worse) <br>  ‚Ä¢ It should be user readable.  It is important! <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is advisable to use subheadings, lists (like this one), tables <br>  ‚Ä¢ The uniqueness of the text should be 100% (you can use special services to determine the uniqueness, for example: text.ru) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keywords should be evenly distributed throughout the text. <br><br><h2>  Meta tags </h2><br>  There are 2 very important meta tags: <b>title and description</b> , besides this there are <b>keywords</b> (every day it loses its significance). <br><br><h4>  TITLE </h4><br>  <b><u>Title</u></b> - the title of the current page's web browser. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41f/7f7/e99/41f7f7e99984fef4bdade0168bee2c5c.jpg"><br><br>  The search engine uses it for the title when ranking the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ddc/2a0/a67/ddc2a0a6772012796c826e5eb0b44c46.jpg"><br>  Try to create a title that is <b>interesting to the user</b> , but at the same time <b>diluted with keywords.</b> <br>  Do not make long headers, use a <b>maximum of 60 characters.</b> <br><br>  Creating such a header is very simple: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7f/dfb/090/c7fdfb090f277008812b0ab689c24a09.jpg"><br><br>  In the "header" () of your document, create a tag and include a title in it. <br>  In many site management systems, such headers are rendered separately and are edited with the page. <br><br><h4>  Description </h4><br>  This is a description of your site (or rather a specific page of your site) in search engines. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fe/90c/450/3fe90c4500b6037d4f967d16b892c0c9.jpg"><br><br>  The rules are the same as with the <b>title</b> tag. <br>  Try to make it for <b><u>people</u></b> , but at the same time <b>dilute with key phrases.</b> <br>  This tag is also very important and the search engine takes it into account. <br><br>  It is created as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/274/d6d/b90/274d6db90390285dfa5b92756101c470.jpg"><br><br>  <i><b>Some search engines (for example, Yandex) ignore this tag and take a description from the site page (from the text).</b></i> <br><br><h4>  Keywords </h4><br>  The <b>keywords</b> tag was created to list keywords on the page.  Does not play a special role in the ranking of sites, but we recommend to fill. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/178/e18/1f7/178e181f7214546b490d527f171e4beb.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Site Title (h1) </h2><br>  The headings on the site page also play an <b>important role</b> , in particular the <b><u>main heading - H1.</u></b> <br><br>  Each optimizer acts differently: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Someone writes comma-separated half of the keywords in the header (not recommended) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Someone writes HF (my version) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Someone writes midrange and woofer <br>  The decision is yours.  Practice and experiment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/22a/572/f96/22a572f9648496930e5e6d9c14f33dc7.jpg"><br><br>  Fundamental rules: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Title should be visually above text. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Title should be in the code above the text. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The title should be one per page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Title should be large <br><br>  <u><b>The use of subtitles (h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) is also welcome.</b></u> <br><br><h2>  General technical task </h2><br>  In order not to forget anything (and also for convenience) I write a general technical task, which looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e44/9f8/a5b/e449f8a5bc16209e5bcb36181012cff6.jpg"><br><br>  Before you is a technical assignment for a copywriter, compiled by a seo-optimizer (some data are not needed by the copywriter, you can delete it). <br><br>  <i><b>According to this technical assignment, a copywriter will write an article on the topic ‚Äúwedding photographer‚Äù.</b></i> <br><br>  <u><b>Exact / word forms</b></u> - the number of occurrences of a keyword in the text.  <b>Exact</b> - the phrase is written "as it is."  <b>Word forms</b> - the phrase may change in case and number. <br><br>  <u><b>Number of characters</b></u> - the number of characters of the article. <br><br>  A copywriter needs the following data: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keywords <br>  ‚Ä¢ Exact / word forms <br>  ‚Ä¢ Characters <br><br>  The rest of the information is recorded by the optimizer for your loved one: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Frequency <br>  ‚Ä¢ Title <br>  ‚Ä¢ Description <br>  ‚Ä¢ H1 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keywords (preferably put in keywords) <br><br><h2>  Promoted pages (login pages) </h2><br>  <b>Promoted pages</b> - pages that you optimized for search engines.  Users will go to your site, and get exactly on these pages - <b>login page.</b> <br><br>  <b><u>Your main task</u></b> will be to ensure that the information located on these pages does not scare the user away, but interests him as much as possible. <br><br>  This contributes to: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Literate text structure <br>  ‚Ä¢ Text should be on topic. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pictures <br>  ‚Ä¢ Video <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lists, subheadings, tables <br><br>  If you are promoting an online store on request ‚Äúbuy a goat‚Äù and you have a catalog of products (of course, it is, otherwise what kind of online store is this), then the entry page for the query ‚Äúbuy a goat‚Äù should be a page with the product, and not a huge article 5000 characters on the theme "the circulation of the goat in nature" as is usually the case. <br>  In this case, you will achieve good sales. <br><br><h2>  Internal relink </h2><br>  Competent internal linking (proper location of links to the internal pages of the site) will give you an advantage over your competitors.  There are so many standard linking schemes that you can read about on the Internet.  I will only give some tips: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Try to have a link from the main page to the promotion pages (this could be a menu item, a banner or just a link from the text) <br>  ‚Ä¢ If you are doing an online store - make related products (first, users will say thank you to you, and second, the search engine will also like it) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not forget about bread crumbs (Main / catalog / furniture / sofas / ‚Ññ573) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Write articles (the more unique text on the site - the better) and refer to the advanced pages.  This will allow you to reach more traffic and pick up truly targeted customers.  Articles promote low-frequency queries. <br><br><h2>  Sitemap </h2><br>  <b>A Sitemap file</b> is a file located on a site with additional information about the pages of the site to be indexed.  Using the Sitemap file, you can tell the search engine which pages of your website you need to index, how often the information on the pages is updated, and which pages are the most important to index (Yandex). <br>  <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D1007070">In more detail</a> . <br><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc2/e0a/7cf/fc2e0a7cffd26b1da77619093d4ceea9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Robots.txt </h2><br>  <b><u>In the robots.txt file,</u></b> you can close the pages from the search engine bulldog, and the search engine will not know about such a page (for example, if you have Not Unique text or admin panel there). <br>  <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D996567">In details</a> <br><br>  Appearance: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37c/6f5/89b/37c6f589b3b6ed423c9f6a88cf57274c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  External optimization </h2><br>  <b>External optimization</b> implies a collection of links to your site from any other resources. <br>  There is a huge amount of resources where you can <b>buy a</b> link ( <b>or better article</b> ) to your site. <br>  There are even systems that do this automatically (although I do not trust them). <br><br>  <u><b>The number and quality of</b></u> external links to your site is one of the most significant indicators to date. <br><br>  I will not focus on external optimization, just give a few tips: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Better buy <b>articles</b> , not links.  The search engine looks at the information around the link. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>The subject of the resource</b> (from which the link comes) must coincide with your subject, otherwise this will have very little use <br>  ‚Ä¢ Focus on the indicators of <b>TIC and PR</b> (the higher - the better) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <u><b>It‚Äôs great</b></u> if the site referring to you is in: Yandex directory, DMOZ'e, Yandex News <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 quality link = 10,000 substandard <br>  ‚Ä¢ Poor quality links can only make things worse. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the first 3 months of the site‚Äôs life, do not buy links at all <br><br>  <i><b>And another very important point.</b></i>  <i><b>You can not aggressively buy links / articles, increase the link mass gradually.</b></i>  <i><b>One - three links per week will be more than enough.</b></i> <br><br><h2>  Yandex directory and DMOZ.  Try your luck </h2><br>  <b><a href="http://www.dmoz.org/">DMOZ (Open Directory)</a></b> - the largest to date multilingual free directory of links to sites from all over the Internet, supported by a virtual community of voluntary volunteer editors. <br>  You can get there only free of charge (or at gunpoint). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://yaca.yandex.ru/">Yandex directory</a></b> - a catalog of your favorite Yandex sites.  You can get there for money or for free.  The link from such a directory is also valued, but not as much as with DMOZ. <br><br><h2>  TIC and PR </h2><br>  A lot of information, be sure to read.
