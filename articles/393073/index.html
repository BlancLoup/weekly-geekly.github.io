For more than ten years, millions of dust particles, mainly from the volcanoes of the geologically active satellite Enceladus, have passed through the scientific instrument Cosmic Dust Analyzer. <br><br>  But among the millions of particles there were a few special ones - 36 pieces that stand out among the general crowd.  These motes came to us from interstellar space.  Although we can say that we flew to them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The appearance of interstellar dust in the solar system did not come as a surprise.  In the 90s, the ESA / NASA Ulysses first observed this substance, which was later confirmed by the Galileo apparatus.  Dust comes from the local interstellar cloud, through which the Solar System is now flying through with constant direction and speed.

      Since the speed and direction of flight of the interstellar dust are known, an idea emerged to trap it in the Cassini spacecraft.  ‚ÄúWe knew that if we turned in the right direction, we had to find them,‚Äù <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/saturn-spacecraft-samples-interstellar-dust">said</a> Nicolas Altobelli, a Cassini project researcher at the European Space Agency and lead author of a scientific paper <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/312">published</a> today in the journal <i>Science</i> . <br><br>  They decided to set such a task for Cassini for the reason that the station should be at almost one point for many years.  This provides a unique opportunity for a long-term experiment. <br><br>  Unlike Ulysses and Galileo, the Cassini spectrograph made a chemical analysis of interstellar dust and showed that there is not ice, but a very specific mixture of minerals.  Dust consists of basic rock-forming elements, such as magnesium, silicon, iron, and calcium, in normal proportions for space.  But more reactive sulfur and carbon are found in quantities less than the average for space. <br><br>  The chemical composition of interstellar dust is shown in the diagrams.  It should be noted that interstellar dust crashes into the vehicle (or the vehicle crashes into dust, which is not important) at a speed of more than 20 km / s, therefore it completely evaporates from the impact.  This explains that the spectrograph records the ions of the elements, and not the molecules.  Rhodium and a significant portion of carbon are trap material, which also partially evaporates from a collision.  By the way, it is high speed that allows you to avoid the gravitational trap of the solar system, which dust flies through. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e4/2bb/d19/5e42bbd19d9742ceb61a7c7748f1b834.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are delighted that Cassini was able to make this discovery, given that our tools are designed to evaluate dust specifically in the Saturn system, like all the other systems of the apparatus,‚Äù said Marcia Burton, a particle analyst from the Jet Laboratory. NASA movement in Pasadena, co-author of scientific work. <br><br>  All 36 particles were surprisingly almost identical in chemical composition.  "Space dust remains after the death of stars, but given the large variety of stars in the Universe, we naturally expected a huge variety of dust types for a long time of our research," commented the results of the University of Heidelberg, co-author of a scientific article. <br><br>  For example, interstellar dust from meteorites was very diverse in composition.  "Cassini" also collected only filtered compilation.  Scientists are pushing versions of how such filtering could be done in interstellar space.  It is possible that a cloud of dust was subjected to repeated impact by passing shock waves from stellar explosions. <br><br>  The scientific work was <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/312">published</a> on April 15, 2016 in the journal <i>Science</i> (doi: 10.1126 / science.aac6397). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393073/</a></p>
