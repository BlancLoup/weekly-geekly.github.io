  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reduce the size of tables in the SAP system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently he quit the SAP Center of Examination, a great company.  He was mainly engaged in archiving and installing the Solution Manager. <br>  I will write a couple of introductory words about what is archiving in the SAP system.  I do not give out any secret information, everything that I wrote can be found on two main resources that can answer almost any question on the SAP system help.sap.com and sdn.sap.com, and also refrain from evaluating the characteristics of the functionality. <br><br>  <b>Let's start with the main approaches to managing the size of the Database (DB) in SAP systems.</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>You can take care of the size of the database in several ways:</i> <br>  1. Reduce the amount of data written to the database.  Those.  either to summarize data that is not needed for a business in such a degree of detailing, or not to write it at all in the database, if this data is superfluous and is not used now, and will not be used later. <br>  2. Reduce the amount of data already recorded in the system.  This can be done either by archiving some of this data with the help of special archiving objects, or simply by deleting them with special programs or in some cases deleting the table and creating it again in the database. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      <b>The main differences:</b> <br>  In the first case, the effect is achieved by customization of the system, in the second - by specific measures. <br>  In the first case - the effect extends only to new data that is written to the system, in the second - only to data that is already in the database. <br><br>  <b>How to understand, is it time to do something with the data or is it not time?</b> <br>  If you think about it, then there are several reasons for the company to think about reducing the database: <br>  1. The company has free resources in the form of consultants, money or enthusiasm to take care of the growth of the database. <br>  2. The execution time of key transactions has increased, or the database has reached an impressive size, and therefore the company is seeking resources to solve the arisen task. <br>  3. The company approached the implementation of SAP thoroughly, and thinks about the growth of the database at the design stage. <br><br>  <i>What is advantageous to develop a strategy for managing the size of the database at the design stage:</i> <br>  1. If from the very beginning you decide what data is needed in the system, and what data is not, and what data can be archived or periodically deleted by planned jobs at the design stage, in many cases the database will grow much slower. <br>  2. Really save on disk space for storing the database. <br>  3. Save time on deleting or archiving unnecessary information that will already be recorded in the database after a productive start. <br>  4. The moment when you will need to invest in more powerful processors for the database will be postponed for some time thanks to the reduced volume of processed data. <br><br>  As I mentioned earlier, much can be done with the data, depending on the available functionality: delete, archive, summarize, or not write to the database at all.  In more detail I will stop on archiving, since  There are many legends about her. <br><br>  <b>What is the archiving in the SAP system?</b> <br>  Archiving is inextricably linked with the archiving object - a logical unit that combines the available programs and the logic of data archiving.  He will ensure that the data after archiving in the system remains consistent and. <br><br>  <i>The archiving process consists of 2 steps:</i> <br>  <u>Step 1</u> - Start the recording program.  An archive file is created and information from the database is written to it.  At this step, nothing is removed from the base!  Records are created that duplicate the information stored in the database that we are going to archive. <br>  <u>Step 2</u> - Run the uninstall program.  The program reads the data in the archive file, verifies this data with the data in the database, and then, if it coincides, deletes the data in the database. <br><br>  <b>What you need to know about the data in archive files:</b> <br>  1. Access to data in the archive file is possible!  For some modules (such as FI and CO), with proper configuration when accessing documents, you may not notice at all that the data is archived.  Those.  these data are not erased from the face of the earth, they can be accessed! <br>  2. Back loading into the database of data from the archive file is not recommended and in some cases is impossible. <br>  3. Data is read only, not editable. <br>  The main transaction for working with archiving objects is SARA.  Practically all the functionality for working with the archiving object, with the exception of some settings, is available in this transaction.  Archiving is performed here.  In more detail about archiving, other related functionality and principles I will tell in the following parts, if I see an interest in this subject on the resource. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91725/</a></p>
