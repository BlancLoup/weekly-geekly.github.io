That is why online stores have begun to pay more attention to an effective form of subscription, thinking through marketing campaigns, and in general the development of such a channel as email marketing. <br>  Email newsletter is useful and effective just as much as it is interesting to its readers.  So, to achieve the effect you need to use the maximum capacity. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Subscription subscribers. </h3><br>  It is necessary to structure not only successful customers and loyal customers, but also just news subscribers.  There is nothing better and more expensive than a well-structured database.  Mass mailing of one text across the entire subscriber base remains the lot of small online stores, but soon they are crowded out by more competent and advanced competitors who clearly target their letters. <br>  The most effective criteria for sorting subscribers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/ffb/7f1/9caffb7f117e42abba10647d352a2fa9.png">

    <h3>  Letter chains </h3><br>  Chains of letters is the method of working with the contact you receive, which is most effective if you provide separate chains for each of the strategically important segments of your base.  Set up an automatic message chain for each segment based on the level of interest and loyalty of a given subscriber to you. <br><br><h3>  Purchase history </h3><br>  An extremely useful tool for the segmentation of your base can serve as a mechanism for tracking the history of purchases.  Having such information about your lead, you can offer him products from the same category, offer to buy a new product from the new collection, as well as offer provision for the purchased product or ‚Äúexchange‚Äù the old model for a new one. <br><br><h3>  The frequency of sending letters </h3><br>  The best option is 1 letter per week.  If you do it less often, the effect of email marketing is reduced, and if it is too often, then this can annoy subscribers and they will begin to unsubscribe. <br><br><h3>  Customization of news topics, articles and all content </h3><br>  Standard themes are less interesting than individual topics for each group of subscribers.  Using an individual topic, you will build a dialogue with a specific person from a particular group, which will entail his interest and agreement to join the ‚Äúconversation‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  High-quality, useful and relevant content. </h3><br>  No need to stand still and use jaded content.  Do not skimp on good copywriters.  You must have a targeted, unique, original, interesting and useful material.  A good copywriter for an online store - almost like a marketer - he should know what to offer to whom and in what form.  Remember the main rule - on the Internet, the text first sells the goods, and then you. <br><br><h3>  Selling is not the main goal. </h3><br>  If you in the first letter offer the subscriber to purchase something, he will most likely unsubscribe from the mailing list.  It is better to give the subscriber the opportunity to get used to an interesting and high-quality material, to enter his zone of trust, to arouse interest, which arise already in the second or third interesting letter.  And only after that you can offer to buy goods. <br><br><h1>  The main formats for e-commerce newsletters: </h1><br><ul><li>  <b>Transactional letters</b> .  Configured automatically and sent to the user in response to registration or placing an order; </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29f/3ba/d75/29f3bad75e3040c3b33c441bb803024d.png"><br><ul><li>  <b>Promotional</b> .  Letters with news or a message about an upcoming event.  For example, information about the upcoming sale or stock announcements; </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/101/e32/f46101e32d1a4d3e9ce3ac246638c5b5.png"><br><ul><li>  <b>Content distribution.</b>  This message contains interesting and useful information for the user. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c8/498/321/3c849832199d4faca4d885297c5f9f8b.jpg"><br><br>  Every online store wants to attract the attention of customers to their letters.  And the basis of the letter is the text.  Here are some <b>tips on writing text for e-mailing lists</b> : <br><ul><li>  Refer to the subscriber by name, it is always nice. </li><li>  The title should be short and succinct, or contain more than 70 characters and reflect the essence of the sentence. </li><li>  Headings should be clear and truthful.  For example, if it says ‚Äúgift to you!‚Äù, Then the letter should also contain relevant information (for example, a discount coupon). </li><li>  Make your letter intriguing so that the reader will certainly go to the site and learn about the products or services that you offer. </li><li>  Most importantly, visually highlight (using a large font or highlighting it in color). </li><li>  When selling via e-mail, bonuses and discounts work fine, but it is worth pointing out that such privileges are granted only to subscribers. </li><li>  And the main thing is always to write in human language, without the use of scientific terms. </li></ul><br>  Experiment with newsletters, test various options and make them more attractive and interesting with each new letter.  Email marketing is easy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/7b6/80b/2f67b680b6bf4a6c846de807bf079f79.jpg">  Irina <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/">Chugay, SendPulse</a> mailing list <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/">marketing</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297166/</a></p>
