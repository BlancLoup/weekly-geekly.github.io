Transferred to the "History of IT."  Since I can not create a separate railway pro <br>  Let's start. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In February 1967, a laboratory appeared, which gave impetus to the development of information technology for bzhd.  And since July 1971, it grew into a road computing center. <br><img src="http://s15.radikal.ru/i188/0907/a1/e645150758ac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From left to right: V.E.  Sivak, V.K.  Romanenok, OI  Pustohod, Yu.V.  Bylinsky <br>  The first computer, which entered the Belarusian Railways in 1969, was called the Minsk-22 computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad9/f26/3f7/ad9f263f7d15ab97d23ba6c164bc93e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Random access memory (RAM), made on matrices with ferrite cores, was about 32 thousand bytes (32 kb) with a central processor (CPU) performance of 5-6 thousand operations / sec.  This computer was equipped with magnetic tape drives (NML) with a capacity of up to 5 million machine words and external devices with paper-based data carriers (punched tapes, punched cards).  The Minsk-22 computer for that time was a complex intellectual device, on which it was necessary to begin the technical, technological and software development of the ideas of a team of enthusiasts, which later formed the basis of the future CC.  Serve the entire range of technical equipment of the computer electronics department.  I had to organize a base for repairing cells and power supplies, and most importantly, study technical documentation and learn how to work on this computer.  The reliability of work &lt;Minsk-22&gt; without proper operating conditions left much to be desired, the diagnostic capabilities were small and far from perfect, therefore, it was possible to rely on finding and correcting faults and failures relying mainly on knowledge and professional intuition.  The team of the department, however, coped with this task.  At that time, many rationalization proposals were submitted and implemented.  On this computer, the first programs related to the transportation process were launched and processed, and the electronics department received a good school of computer operation as a whole and its individual devices.  The machine &lt;Minsk-22&gt; worked at the EC until 1975. <br>  In 1971, the first Minsk-32 computer arrived at the EC, the creation of which was a major step forward compared to the Minsk-22.  By the way, the Minsk-32 computer became the most massive computer, and accounted for almost 70% of all computers in the USSR, was awarded the quality mark and recognized as the base for the creation of automated control systems in the CMEA countries.

    <img src="http://s12.radikal.ru/i185/0907/70/a0001a15538f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From 1971 to 1975, four Minsk-32 computers arrived at the EC.  This computer had two racks OP on ferrite cores with a total capacity of about 128 kb with a capacity of 66 thousand operations / sec.  The memory capacity on the ML was up to 16 million machine words.  Initially, the computer was equipped with an exchange device having two channels (multiplex - slow and selector - fast).  Later, the Minsk-32 computer began to be equipped with a 3-channel interface device (TUS), which had one multiplex and two selector channels, which made it possible in the future to connect to the computer via the adapter devices of the EU series (magnetic disk drives, drums), and this has already made it possible to create machine complexes on a common memory field on a MD or ML.  In 1977, for the first time on the railway network, in our Minsk-32 computer-system, the EC-5052 magnetic disk drives were connected to a 7-MB package, and in the next 1978, the Minsk-32 computer was merged in two 2-machine computing complex on a common field of memory on magnetic disks EC-5052, which allowed technologists and mathematicians to realize many complex tasks that can be solved in real time.  The use of multiplexers (also for the first time) "Minsk-1560" made it possible to abandon the use of a significant amount of punched tape. <br>  The main features of the Minsk-22 and Minsk-32 computers were their compatibility, the use of semiconductor technology, RAM on ferrite cores with a small, by today's standards, memory capacity, a complete set of basic external devices on punched tape and punched cards, poor diagnostics.  The dialogue mode with the computer was carried out by means of the ‚ÄúConsul-254‚Äù typewriter, which had a mechanical keyboard, and as a result of intensive work often broke down.  Specialists of the department implemented a lot of rationalization proposals aimed at improving the reliability of this computer. <br>  In the 70s, the countries that are members of the CMEA, have embarked on the creation of a unified system of EU computers and peripheral devices that are technically and software compatible with each other. <br>  In 1977, the first electronic computer of the EU series, namely the ‚ÄúEU-1022‚Äù, arrived at the EC.  The performance of this computer was about 80 thousand operations / sec.  with an OD capacity of 512 kb.  The central processor and main memory were made on integrated circuits and ferrite cores.  She had one multiplex and two selector channels.  However, a very small difference between this computer and Minsk-32 in terms of its main technical characteristics did not find further wide application of this computer at the EC. <br><br><img src="http://s11.radikal.ru/i183/0907/fc/76ab903601a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://i067.radikal.ru/0907/ce/341c530a42dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As time went on, more powerful and productive domestic computers were produced.  Since 1986, the EC-1061 first computers began to arrive at the EC, which absorbed all the most advanced functions implemented in previous models demanded by the user and time.  The performance of the EC-1061 was up to 2 million operations / sec.  with an OP capacity of 8 MB, it had two byte-multiplex and four block-multiplex channels.  Computing complexes were built on a common field of memory on magnetic disks with a capacity of a package of 100 MB, and 200 MB. <br><br><img src="http://s15.radikal.ru/i188/0907/ab/84a0c5b2d170.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1991, the computer was acquired EC-1130, which is attributed to the computer series, with a capacity of 2 million operations / sec.  and an OP capacity of 8 MB, with the possibility of increasing to 16 MB, had relatively small dimensions, which was caused by the use of large integrated circuits (LSI) in the CPU and OP.  The onset of the perestroika period did not allow for the complete refinement of this promising computer in factory conditions.  In fact, one of the first versions of this computer that came to us was flawed and not the highest reliability.  With a sharp reduction in plant financing during these years, the production of the Series-4 computer ceased, as was the case with other EU computers. <br><br>  Creative personalities of the enterprise had an excellent opportunity to express themselves in contests and competitions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/194/67c/e29/19467ce2979f8fe231bb698c3459e089.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://s19.radikal.ru/i192/0907/2b/15b9b37d367a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ( <b>local beatles</b> ) <br><br>  What production facilities are installed now - a mystery covered in gloom;) <br>  The only thing I can say is that currently active work is being done on the automation and informatization of the most important technological processes. <br>  Maybe what else I find, so I will add after ...;) <br><br>  upd2. <br>  I give up and open today's iron;) <br>  For a huge amount of data every minute coming from different parts of the road, a large amount of memory is needed, which is implemented on the IBM ESS 2105-800 and Total Storage DS8100 disk subsystems.  An important element here is RAID storage technology. <br>  upd3. <br>  As I suggest here, Bel Bell.  railway  brought up good shots.  Electrician <b>Michael Friedman</b> - Ch.  Ing.
