    <a name="habracut"></a>  Quick dating is a form of dating in which the user gets a quick response from the person he has noticed.  It's like in the subway or on the street.  Misha walks along the New Arbat and sees a pretty girl, walks up to her and tries to meet.  After a few moments, the girl will say that she does not like Misha and will slip away from the crowd or smile and say: ‚ÄúAnd my name is Katya!‚Äù And will begin to communicate with him.  But everyone has his own business - Misha is in a hurry to meet her friends at Eat &amp; Talk, and Katya is at the Moscow House of Books, she has her coursework in a week and there are not enough materials.  After three minutes of conversation, they will part, but perhaps, if Misha was cheerful and witty, then Kati's number will be added to his phone book.  Then they will call each other, they will meet and begin another story of human relations. <br><br><h4>  How it looks in the browser </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/66c7278c/19f80a87/d09e1304/47f3fbba.jpg"></div><br><br>  <i><font color="#959595">Screenshot of the new version of the service.</font></i>  <i><font color="#959595">Matrix of persons.</font></i>  <i><font color="#959595">Introductory information before starting a new acquaintance.</font></i> <br><br>  Approximately in this way our service is built.  You will see a stream of people and be able to call anyone.  At the same moment, the potential interlocutor will see your call and agree to the communication or reject it.  If the answer is positive, the system will leave you alone for 3 minutes and will not be disturbed by new acquaintances.  Try not to make boring conversations about "how are you?" Or "let's get acquainted."  You will not get a second chance.  As soon as the 3 minutes are over, Wannafun will ask everyone ‚ÄúDid you like the other person?‚Äù With a positive response from two, you will be added to each other‚Äôs contact lists and further communication can be continued in a more relaxed way anytime.  If at least one of them is disappointed with these three minutes and clicks "did not like", then this means that Katya did not give her number to Misha and left - Wannafun will never show you to each other on the site again. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9e5ae37f/467fa010/1509c30c/15b7e38c.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#959595"><i>Screenshot of the new version of the service.</i></font>  <font color="#959595"><i>An instant before the first virtual date.</i></font> <br><br>  Like on the street, on Misha Wannafun, one cannot get to know Katya, Nastya and Sveta at the same time.  You can choose only one of the rushing stream of people. <br><br>  As an ideologist of the resource, I have a firm conviction that Misha on Novy Arbat at that second when he saw Kate completely indifferent where her piercing was and how many points she scored in the test "How goal-oriented you are."  It is important for Misha that Katya should pay attention to him and talk to him in the middle of a huge street for at least three minutes without shouting ‚ÄúLet's meet‚Äù from passing guys. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fdd05150/d67b9c52/e4d11b1d/d88fc0cb.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#959595"><i>Screenshot of the new version of the service.</i></font>  <font color="#959595"><i>Work with contacts.</i></font> <br><br>  Understanding the device of modern resources and knowing in what Parade of human vices any popular dating site turns in the evening, we introduce the function ‚ÄúThis person is immoral for me!‚Äù, Which will allow influencing the karma of other users.  Karma is a special metric for everyone on Wannafun, but we don‚Äôt show it to anyone.  The system itself decides on the basis of karma to which user whom to show.  Such a metric will help to select for each interesting interlocutors, and not too immoral to confront with chaste.  As a result, only those who have downloaded the camel picture instead of their photo will have to be banned, and the perverts themselves will fall to the bottom of the social well and will see and be able to get acquainted only with themselves.  Do not be afraid to click on the ‚ÄúGet Acquainted‚Äù button on Wannafun - most likely, this user will not be rude to you and will not be able to use the first phrase. <br><br>  The new version of the service is in development and we inform readers about the launch additionally.  At the moment, Wannafun is available for use in a different design and with limited functionality - inviting for dates and bringing in contacts is possible. <br><br><h4>  mobile version </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b1b379dd/6323ecc9/aabe8bbe/03024002.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#959595"><i>Screenshot of running version 1.0 for iPhone.</i></font> <br><br>  With joy and excitement, we launched <a href="http://wannafun.ru/apps/iphone">the Wannafun application</a> in the AppStore directory.  Our application from the first time passed in the AppStore in the category of 17+, which means that even the first pancake was not lumpy, but quite edible. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dec558e2/add397ab/9c8ba351/973cae66.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#959595"><i>Profile Settings</i></font>  <font color="#959595"><i>Creating an avatar.</i></font> <br><br>  The developer of the iPhone version was <a href="http://www.hintsolutions.ru/wannafun/">HintSolutions</a> .
