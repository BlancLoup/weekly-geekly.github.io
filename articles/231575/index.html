Tips for promoting children's apps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef8/524/e82/ef8524e822132ce127f456dd571b10c6.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, I talked about the recommendations of the speakers of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231351/">‚ÄúThe Kids Want Mobile!‚Äù</a> Conference <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231351/">(Berlin, 2014) regarding the development of children's applications</a> for mobile devices.  This article can be called "10 notes on the promotion of applications." <br><br>  Further on the points about the complex involvement of the audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Meet on clothes!</b>  All buyers sooner or later go to the supermarket page, where they buy your application.  Therefore, the "outfit" must be chosen carefully. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The application icon is the first thing that the user sees in the search results on the supermarket showcase.  To be noticed among many others, it must be as attractive as possible.  Do not save on the work of the designer in this case, this icon will become the main face of your application on the review sites. <br><br>  Make a good video review of the game, many users no longer read descriptive texts, pictures are flipped through, but they watch videos with pleasure.  So, this is a tuxedo of your "outfit". <br><br>  For the application page, make a good overview of the pictures, giving a clear understanding of the gameplay.  You should not use advertising posters as illustrations, the user wants to look into the box: see what he is going to buy. <br><br>  Buyers trust proven brands, so be sure to reflect the affiliation and associativity of the game with the brand of the developer company.  By purchasing one good application from you, users will start to trust you.  It will take less time to make the next decision. <br>  The name of the application should be easily remembered.  This will be an important advantage in all your ad campaigns. <br><br>  Description of the game keep it short and concise.  Tell us about the goals and features of the application, what's new in the updated version (the most important pieces).  In the description, use the keywords for which the application is planned to be detected by supermarket and Internet search engines. <br><br>  <b>2. Be sure to try the app for free.</b>  This may be a simplified version of the application, a demo version or a full-fledged application from the series. <br><br><h4>  Trust is earned by offering a high quality product for free </h4><br>  <b>3. Campaign users to rate and review.</b>  Their number raises your application in the search results with filters by rating and number of reviews.  A large number of reviews and recommendations gives the impression of popularity and has confidence.  But do not overdo it with reminders.  They should be regular, but not intrusive.  Once a month is enough.  Reminders should stop after leaving a review or rating. <br><br>  <b>4. For maximum audience coverage, the application should be available on all tablet platforms, as well as on mobile phones.</b>  Parents often have moments when they need to have a child.  For example, when you are driving a car.  And if the tablet is not at hand, the phone is now at all, always and everywhere. <br><br>  <b>5. Pay attention to brand promotion and building a campaign portfolio</b> .  In your portfolio, focus not so much on the uniqueness of the applications, but on their focus.  For example, early development.  In diversity, the consumer emphasizes quality as the main priority, which is supported by specialization and profile. <br><br>  <b>6. Find "friends" with a huge audience</b> (television, the most popular review sites) and find opportunities for cooperation or mutual promotion. <br><br>  <b>7. Advertising promotion should be organized in different directions, constant and simultaneous:</b> promotion in social networks, classical methods of advertising, promotional campaigns, promotion in the media, etc. <br><br>  <b>8. Be sure to use cross advertising applications</b> one inside the other.  It is easier to sell something to an existing buyer than to find a new one.  Cross-advertising tools are ‚Äúmore applications‚Äù and product placement blocks. <br><br>  <b>9. Even when developing an application, plan further marketing promotion of application elements</b> (characters, ways of presenting information) in the form of material objects (books, toys).  The highest degree of implementation in life is achieved by hybrid games.  For example, Furby, whose capabilities are expanded by interacting with applications for the iPad iPhone.  Or material game characters, which by means of installation on special stands appear in a computer game. <br><br>  <b>10. Remind yourself.</b>  Announce updates, release of new applications, share the purchase of applications for "premium" and "super" prices. <br><br>  All of the above will work most effectively if you took into account the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/231351/">recommendations of the developer</a> from the previous article, and you got a good useful application.  And the user who bought the product in the bright cover will be satisfied. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231575/</a></p>
