  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do people buy security</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  People are constantly trying to get away from risk when it comes to income and vice versa trying to take risks to get away from losses.  If you give people the following choice: ‚ÄúGet guaranteed $ 500 or toss a coin to get $ 1,000 ‚Ä≥.  About 75% will choose guaranteed profit.  And now consider the opposite situation: ‚ÄúTo lose is guaranteed $ 500 or risk $ 1,000.‚Äù  Here is the opposite trend, 75% will take the risk. <br><br>  People in their heads lack a standardized risk assessment model.  The computer does not see the differences between the 2 situations above - this is just a degree of how much you are risk-averse, but people see.  This fact should not be considered as a kind of conspiracy.  When he was first voiced, he turned over economic theory.  This fact is called the ‚Äútheory of perspectives‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The theory was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Building on empirical observations and evidence, she describes how individuals assess losses and gains.  In the original formulation, the term "perspective" referred to the lottery.

      From the point of view of evolution, it makes sense - a survival strategy.  Better a bird in the hands than a crane in the sky on the one hand and risk not to lose anything at all on the other.  All this can be traced in nature.  Lions, for example, pursue young and injured antelopes, because the risk is minimal.  An adult and healthy individual will be more nutritious, but there is a risk of losing breakfast / lunch / dinner altogether.  Animals constantly struggle for survival and try to reduce all possible risks.  All this has been repeatedly demonstrated by various researchers. <br><br>  Perspective theory explains one of the current problems - the ‚Äúsale‚Äù of security: no one wants to invest in information security.  Sales managers have long realized that there are only 2 motivations for people to buy safety products: fear and greed. <br><br>  Security sales are generally based on fear.  This is a choice between guaranteed losses (the cost of security products) and big risks ‚Äî potential network attacks.  It should be noted that the purchase of security systems does not guarantee 100% exemption from risks, but only reduces it.  Of course, for sale you need something more.  Buyers need to be sure that the product is working correctly and buyers need to be aware of what might happen if a successful network attack occurs.  But still, many prefer to tempt fate rather than defend themselves. <br>  Vendors understand this well and try to entice buyers with slogans like ‚ÄúWe care about your safety, you can focus on business‚Äù or build demonstration models that show how useful their products can be. <br><br>  Another thing - to put pressure on fear.  Our brain prefers to risk than to spend guaranteed money, but fear changes everything.  When we are afraid, everything happens the other way around.  In the computer security industry, this is called FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) - fear, uncertainty and doubt. <br>  The best way is not to sell security separately, but as part of a more general product or service.  You buy a car with an integrated security system.  Why not do the same with computers and networks?  Manufacturers should build solutions directly into products and services. <br><br>  Created by <a href="http://confido.ru/">Confido Security Blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76954/</a></p>
