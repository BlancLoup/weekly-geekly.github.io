It would seem much further: all the lamps are replaced with economical ones (thanks to lamptest!), The only glow bulb is tied to the motion sensor, we defrost the meat in the refrigerator, we cook two dishes at once in the oven ... well, plenty and good air. <br>  ‚ÄúBut there is no limit to perfection,‚Äù I thought, once again looking at the banner from the Mosenergosbyt website, offering to switch to multi-tariff accounting ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is interesting is that for switching to dual or even three-tariff electricity metering, I personally do not need to change the meter.  The last installed model ‚Äúcan‚Äù count separately.  It seems to be enough to write an application to Mosenergosbyt, pay for the counter-flashing (a symbolic amount), wait for changes in the personal account and enjoy life.  Those who have an old counter, all the music will cost more - about 4000. But they promise 25% savings! <br><br>  Here I turned on my inner Rabinovich and came to very curious conclusions.  IMPORTANT!  All of the following is related to my habits and lifestyle.  If you weld rebar at night or you smelt aluminum at home, everything is likely to be different. <br><br>  For starters, I looked at the rates.  For a Moscow resident, cooking soup / borscht on an electric stove, a kilowatt hour for one-rate accounting costs 3.52 rubles.  If we take two tariff accounting - a kilowatt hour at night (from 11 pm to 7 am) costs only <b>one ruble</b> .  It would seem that here it is a freebie - take it and use it.  But having read the tariffs to the end, I was no longer so happy.  The fact is that a kilowatt hour in the daytime (with two tariff accounting) is more expensive than a single tariff - 3.90 rubles versus 3.52.

      <br>
      Down with the emotions, let's count. <br>  For simplicity, let's set the consumption of constantly working consumers (refrigerator, freezer, router, home server ...) unchanged for 24 hours. <br>  I try to go to bed at 23-00.  Moreover, persons with a sensitive sleep, to which I belong, do not like to sleep with the accompaniment of a washer and dishwasher.  Even if they are in the kitchen, and I am in the bedroom.  Well, God bless him, we believe that at 23-01 we cut in all the available equipment with a delayed shutdown, set a chicken to roast, bake bread and happily went to bed.  In the meantime, I note that all automatic programs will be completed no later than <b>two hours later</b> .  Even the longest with soaking, etc. Thus, of the eight hours of the valuable night fare, we use only a quarter. <br><br>  Suppose we spent X kilowatt hours per month on these manipulations after 23-00.  The rest is consumption (daily), let it be Y. Regular consumers (refrigerators / routers) - Z. <br>  For the month under the two tariff system of accounting, we will pay: X * 1 + Y * 3.9 + Z * 0.33 * 1 + Z * 0.66 * 3.9 (rubles) <br>  The same consumption at one rate: (X + Y + Z) * ‚Äã‚Äã3.52 (rubles). <br>  We are interested in what ratio of X to Y the scale of scales will bow in our favor.  According to the mind, Z should also be tied up here, but the calculations are too complicated.  Therefore, by a strong-willed decision we accept that my refrigerator, freezer and router with the server consume ... well, let's say 40 kilowatt hours per month. <br>  Thus, the task is reduced to the comparison of two functions: <br>  F = X + 3.9Y + 116.16 and F '= 3.52X + 3.52Y + 140.8 <br>  Start favorite Excel and get (the table shows the ratio of F to F ', that is, the two tariff system to one tariff. Accordingly, where the value is greater than one - there the two tariff is more expensive, where less than one - there is cheaper): <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Picture.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Sorry, Markdown has not yet mastered.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1be/63c/cbc/1be63ccbc4ff4ca88300bfa73d9d400a.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  Explanations for the picture: in the left column - the ratio of night-to-day consumption (as a percentage).  Above - the size of daily consumption (affects rather weakly, but once introduced into the table, then God bless him). <br><br>  What is the bottom line?  With reference to my realities, it only makes sense to switch to two tariff accounting if in the evening / at night I get 10-15% or more of the daily electricity consumption. <br>  It seems to me unrealistic.  In the month I ‚Äúeat‚Äù about 600 kilowatt hours.  At night, you can move unless washing (1 kilowatt an hour per cycle, every three days = 10 kilowatt hours) and washing dishes (daily, one and a half kilowatt hours per cycle = 45 kilowatt hours).  Total we have 55 "evening" kilowatt hours, that is less than 10% of the monthly consumption. <br>  That is, I am near the break-even point, and if we add the cooking of the morning oatmeal in the slow cooker, I can even get a benefit.  But, as I have already said, the washer-dryer with the dishwasher keeps me from sleeping, and then Mosenergosbyt has to pay ... In general, well, his nafig. <br><br>  Yes, the main purpose of the post is to express surprise about the fact that the daily rate in the two tariff system is higher than the one tariff.  Of course, it is understandable - the economy, profitability, everything is all right ... But somehow, all the same, weird ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390407/</a></p>
