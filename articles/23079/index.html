I issued, paid for and told me about it for the new year, and we began to wait for my gift, which was supposed to come as early as January 14-17. <br><br>  I went to the post office (the log was delivered to the post-demand mail) of the 20th, but I did not find anything there.  After that, I went to the post office every week and now on February 14, and I also received my journal. <br><br>  Here we began to write letters in support, to find out how to be, to which we were constantly told (by the way, answering only every 5 letters !!!) that the magazine is going on, that we simply live far away (Ulyanovsk) and that is why everything was so long ...

      It was already March 24 in the yard, and I looked in the mail again to pick up my THREE !!!  magazine, but there was nothing there.  Here my patience is exhausted and I decided to engage in communication with the service myself (until that moment my girlfriend communicated with them in a businesslike tone). <br><br>  In the "state of passion", I dropped to rudeness and threats, but still give my correspondence with a certain yvvaprol (???), <a href="http://mega-press.ru/">megapress</a> customer service <a href="http://mega-press.ru/">representative</a> . <br><br>  My letter (I am not friends with spelling, especially in the ‚Äústate of affetus‚Äù :)) <br><blockquote>  I do not know where to write!  I haven't received your magazine for three months!  Call me!  Solve this question, I'm shocked by your service, vyzhe online store !!!  After all, your reputation is dear to you, I am on the verge of EVERYWHERE where the current can describe your service, or return money, what to do ?????  Call me, kidalovo: ( </blockquote><br><br>  To which I was immediately (usually the answer came to the 5th or 7th letter, although this time I wrote this text to all the contacts I just found on the site) I received the following answer: <br><blockquote>  Eugene, good afternoon! <br><br>  Three logs were sent to you, the date of shipment <br><br>  No. 1 was sent 25 01, No. 2 09.03 No. 3 20, 03. </blockquote><br><br>  then we have such a dialogue: <br>  I: <blockquote>  And what do you want a fairy tale ??  nothing came to me, money was sent to you, but the magazines did not come to me, they said at the post office that there was no, I was tormented to go there, now you call them and find out! </blockquote><br><br>  yachvaprol: <br><blockquote>  Here are the logs sent to this address.     BEFORE DEMANDING to us they did not return back respectively to you in your mail. <br><br>  We will not call where we will, as we are not responsible for the delivery of third parties. <br><br>  This is written in our agreement of the offer, which you probably got acquainted with. </blockquote><br>  I: <blockquote>  Yes, you have a good service, it remains only to send me, how do I know that they are delivered?  you may not even have tried to send them, where are the photocopy documents?  I signed a contract with you and not with the mail, but you have to call because, for the time being, I have to run and find out and spend my time and money because of you, I am very dissatisfied with your service, you cannot work, you do not need to offer work-related services with customers, give me back my money, I don‚Äôt want to have more business with you. </blockquote><br><br>  I thought then, maybe they are right?  Can it be written in the contract?  I decided to read the <a href="http://www.mega-press.ru/offer">contract</a> . <br><br>  And that's what I found there: <br>  "5.6.  After receiving the claim, the Company takes measures to establish at what stage and by whose fault the fact of violation occurred. <br><br>  5.7.  In the event of a claim related to non-delivery or irregular delivery of Edition numbers, the Customer and the Company accept the following documents as proof of the fact that the Company fulfills its delivery obligations: postal receipts issued by the Russian Post Office as confirmation of dispatch;  invoices and invoices issued to the company by forwarding enterprises.  The date of fulfillment of the Company's obligations to the Customer is the date of the document confirming the shipment. " <br><br>  After reading these points, I wrote the following letter with an excerpt from the contract, the answer to which was never received: <br><blockquote>  Where is everyone?  You will not call?  All of you will do, shame, they put in a support, give me the soap of a normal person, competent, or your manager, I have no desire to talk to you at all, a shame of the company. </blockquote><br><br>  We didn‚Äôt communicate with Comrade Yachvaprol.  But the next day I received a letter from Ekaterina Krotova: <br><blockquote>  Good afternoon, Eugene! <br>  Today one of your orders has returned.  Magazine Motro 12-01.  The envelope indicates that the storage period has expired.  Please pay for re-sending, because  You did not take the magazine from the post office.  He will be sent again after your additional payment. <br>  And please check can in the mail and the next number lies. <br>  Sincerely, Catherine. <br>  Megapress. <br></blockquote><br><br>  I will not publish my reply to this letter;), but no one has contacted me to this day anymore.  Here is a story.  I consider it impossible to work with clients this way, I do not advise anyone to use the services of this store, once I bought a phone through telephon.ru, they behaved wrong with me there, thanks to them, but this is probably a topic for the next post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23079/</a></p>
