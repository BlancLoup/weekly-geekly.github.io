  <section class="page js-page"><h1>But so it is ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Fokla turned off the computer, put on her jacket, left the apartment and almost stretched out, tripping over a huge bag of trash. <br>  “Damn these neighbors,” Thecla said loudly.  - What kind of pig? <br>  The door of the fifteenth apartment opened slightly, and in the doorway the swollen face of the neighbor appeared. <br>  “You have to look under your feet, mare,” she said bitterly. <br>  “Dissolve, you drunkard,” Thekla snapped, “until I put your bag on your head.” <br>  - Hamlo!  - Shouted a neighbor and immediately slammed the door. <br>  - Old fool!  - answered Thekla, kicked the garbage bag with her foot, turned the key in the keyhole and headed for the elevator. <br><br>  The elevator happily opened its doors to her.  Thekla gathered, went inside, and immediately changed her mind: there was a fresh pile of dog on the cab floor. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Freaks, damn it!  - spat Thekla.  - To shoot this fucking Rottweiler with his master. <br>  - You on someone there blathering, sryvka?  - Immediately came the voice of the owner of the dog. <br>  “On you, you jerk,” cried Thecla.  - Teach your idiotic dog to shit on the street.

      The owner of the dog leaned over the railing and, throwing a cigarette butt into the flight of stairs, asked: <br>  - And where did you get that this is my dog ​​shat?  Is her autograph there? <br>  “No one else,” answered Thekla.  - In our house there are two seruna: you, yes your scrawny half-wit. <br>  - Yes, you went to ***, - cried the owner of the dog. <br>  “I'd go,” said Thekla, “but you probably already piled up a lot there.” <br><br>  Out on the street, Thekla went to her car and sighed.  A new red Toyota was parked in front, close to its “Zhiguli”, and a huge black jeep was pressing it behind just as tightly. <br>  - Well, what a punishment?  - said Thekla, putting the keys in her purse and turning in the direction of the bus stop. <br><br>  The bus was stuffy and cramped.  Thekla hardly squeezed into the middle of the cabin, paid for the ride and reached into her purse for a book, accidentally touching the fair-haired girl standing next to her with her elbow. <br>  “Sorry,” Thekla smiled at the girl. <br>  “Be careful, cow,” the girl snapped back. <br>  “Survive, scarecrow,” Theclaus reassured her.  - Not so much I caught you. <br>  “Cozza,” said the girl through her teeth, and pointedly turned away. <br><br>  Coming out of the bus, she intentionally stepped on Thekle on the leg, while sending her a malicious scornful little smile. <br>  Upon reaching the necessary stop, Thekla jumped out of the stuffy cabin and inhaled fresh autumn air with pleasure.  Slowly, she walked a few meters and opened the door with the words "Dentistry". <br><br>  - Hello, - the benevolent girl at the reception smiled at her in a friendly manner, flashing flawlessly white teeth.  - Do you have an appointment or do you want to register with a doctor? <br>  “Good afternoon,” Thekla smiled back.  - I recorded for fifteen hours to Ivanova. <br>  “I am very sorry, but Dr. Ivanova became ill and there will be no reception today,” the girl looked at Thekla with obvious sympathy. <br>  - How so?  - powerlessly lowered hands Thekla.  “You do have my phone number ... Why didn't you warn me?” <br>  “I’m sure we called you,” the girl said. <br><br>  Thekla took the phone out of her purse and began to nervously press the buttons.  There were no incoming calls from the clinic. <br>  - Listen to what is a lie?  - she flared up.  “You ruined my day, because of you, I lost time, I came here from another district ... Why don't you just admit your mistake and apologize to me?” <br>  The girl, without ceasing to sparkle with a pearly smile, clicked the computer mouse and said: <br>  - I already apologized to you on the phone.  Here, I have everything noted ... <br>  - What the hell!  - cried Thekla and struck the rack with her palm with such force that two old women sitting on the couch near the window jumped up and stared at her with dismay. <br>  “Do not be so nervous,” said the girl, without removing the professional smile from her face.  - I will write you down for the beginning of the next week. <br>  “Don't bother yourself,” Thekla snapped.  - I'll look for a clinic where the secretaries do not suffer memory loss.  Fortunately, your competitors are full and <br>  Some of them do business during work hours, and do not play solitaires. <br>  She turned sharply on her heels and left the room with a quick step, finally slamming the door loudly. <br>  “A brainless creature,” she muttered under her breath, stepping outside. <br><br>  White-toothed girl from reception looked at frightened old women and said: <br>  “Now everyone is so nervous ...” <br>  The old women nodded their heads. <br>  Disgruntled Thekla headed toward the subway.  There were few people in the car, but there were no empty seats.  Near the door stood older women with bags and talking quietly about something. <br>  The men sitting on the benches diligently depicted deep sleep. <br>  Thekla leaned her back against the rail and began gouging them with a scornful look.  The guy in shabby jeans and a leather jacket opened one eye, looked at Föklu, and winked at her defiantly.  Thekla turned away in disgust. <br>  “Smelly skunks,” she thought.  “A pack of nasty smelly skunks who can't give way to older women.”  I hope that somewhere right now their mothers are exactly the same, bending under the weight of their bags and looking at the same freaks pretending to be asleep. <br>  A young brunette bustled around a brand new red toyota. <br>  - Girl, how much is now a driver's license?  - turned to her Thekla. <br>  - What's the matter?  - with a call she asked. <br>  - Learn to park, that's what's the matter.  I did not drive off because of you, you got up very tightly. <br>  The young brunette looked at the old Fyoklin “Zhiguli” and said with a grin: <br>  - Yes, than to ride such a bucket, it's better to walk on foot.  You still have to thank me for saving you from another shame. <br>  With these words, the young brunette sat in her Toyota, turned on the radio and drove off the parking lot, putting her left hand out the window with a bulging middle finger, which was decorated with a pretty pink acrylic nail. <br><br>  Thekla trudged to the house. <br><br>  Near the entrance sat a rottweiler and shit right on the asphalt. <br>  At the door of her apartment was still littered with a garbage bag. <br>  Thekla went into the apartment, took off her jacket, put the teapot on the stove and turned on the computer. <br>  Going to LiveJournal, she wrote a post on her page: “You know, today is clearly not Beckham’s day.  I was not hammered only by a crow on a branch.  And where in people so much malice ... ". <br>  A neighbor from the fifteenth apartment watched the next series of the favorite series, set aside the bowl with the chips, went to the computer and opened the friendly tape. <br>  “Honey, don't be nervous,” she wrote.  “Believe me, there are more good, decent people in the world.” <br>  The owner of the Rottweiler, walking his pet, returned home, turned on the computer and began to read the friend's tape. <br>  "Do not pay attention to the freaks," - he left a comment.  And, after some thought, he wrote another one: “You are the coolest”. <br>  The fair-haired girl, after reading the post of her beloved frendess, was upset and decided to console her. <br>  “Do not despair ...” she wrote.  “Some cow has come to me today, too.”  Apparently, boors autumn aggravation.  Spit and rub, you're the best! ” <br>  People in the dental clinic was not.  The phone was silent, the bosses went home. <br>  White-toothed girl with the reception refreshed lipstick on her lips, straightened her hair and clicked with a computer mouse. <br>  After reading the post, she sighed and replied: “Now everyone is so nervous ... Hold the tail with a gun!  We are with you and we love you. ” <br>  And flashed her pearly smile, believing that on the other side of the monitor will feel its warmth and tenderness. <br>  A guy in shabby jeans and a leather jacket was sitting in a cafe, drinking black coffee and tapping a cigarette on a glass ashtray.  He opened the laptop and went to her journal.  Sad post  She was cheated.  Her!  He was ready to tear these noobs to shreds.  How, how can you be rude to such a girl?  She is special, she is extraordinary, she ... She is not at all the same as, for example, that pretentious girl in the metro, who measured him with a contemptuous look today. <br><br>  She is… <br><br>  He took courage, took a deep breath and wrote to her: “How I would like to meet you in real life!  You are the most amazing girl in the world. " <br>  And, closing his eyes, he pressed the "add a comment" button, while the courage had not left him. <br><br>  A young brunette parked her brand new red toyota near the house, went up to the apartment and went to the computer.  Having opened a friend tape, she read the post and was surprised: “Wow, even hers are rude!  To her, so caustic, so ironic, able to send virtual insolent people into three letters so easily and gracefully that they get lost and fall silent.  What then to talk about me ... " <br>  She settled down in a chair more comfortably and pink acrylic nails pounded on the keyboard: “As I understand you ( , these people are just a banal loss, and we can only feel sorry for them)) ”Thekla read the comments left by friends to her notes. <br>  - What kind of nice guys are going to learn, - she thought, pulling on a cigarette.  - Understanding, tactful, always ready to support ... <br><br>  <b>And why do they never meet me in real life?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79140/</a></p>
