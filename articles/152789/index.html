I would like to slightly change this situation with this post. <br><br>  On September 26, the final decision was made at Ivideon to deploy our CDN site in Kazakhstan.  September 28, we put it into operation.  We were so amazed at the speed of work of our colleagues from Kazakhstan, who made the setting and installation of equipment, that we decided to write about this small post. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Why do Ivideon need to be in Kazakhstan? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/863/275/b8f/863275b8f966b408feba41883eceee08.png" align="left">  I would not like to understand why this happened, someone blames Russian providers for this, and someone KazakhTelecom, but for users of the so-called unlimited Internet tariffs in Kazakhstan a hard limit is imposed on the amount of traffic received from external resources.  That is, if it is simpler, how much data can be downloaded per month outside of Kazakhstan.  For example, from Runet.  At one of the most expensive tariffs from Megaline, costing about 1,000 rubles per month, no more than 80 GB of external incoming traffic is available at a speed of 8 Mbit / s.  After this threshold is exceeded, the speed is automatically lowered to 256 Kbps. <br><br>  In order for users from Kazakhstan to watch the video through the Ivideon service not be considered external traffic, as well as to improve the quality of service, we also thought about placing our site on Kazakhtelecom.  At first it was just an idea.  Since there were not so many users from there.  But on the other hand, where will they get there, if access to the Ivideon service from the territory of Kazakhstan is not cheap? <br><br><h4>  Two days from decision to launch thanks to GOHost.kz </h4><br>  Honestly, the idea that we need servers in Kazakhstan appeared in July.  Then we decided to explore the market of hosting providers and find out the approximate prices.  Found about 7 companies that provide server equipment rental service and sent them requests.  Through feedback forms, by e-mail and by phone. <br>  The first provider responded after 5 days and wrote that the requested servers are not available, but we can independently purchase the RAM to the existing servers, they will install it and we will get the required solution.  The funny thing is that at the same time they told us that the rental cost will increase, as the server will have more RAM.  Its cost, they will be credited only in the first month of rent. <br><br>  The rest of the providers reported that they also either do not have the equipment, or the cost indicated on the website does not correspond to reality, or there is no possibility of connecting to the 1 Gbit / s channel. <br>  After this unsuccessful attempt to settle in Kazakhstan, we decided to postpone work in this direction for a while. <br><br>  And on September 26, after another conversation with our partners in Kazakhstan and representatives of <a href="http://">Microdigital</a> (they sell cameras with Ivideon service on board, so a computer is not required for their work with our cloud) we decided it was really time to do something with the problem our placement in the network of Kazakhtelecom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee5/581/ac8/ee5581ac82d27114252c6292d8426aea.png" align="left">  It was about 16.00 Moscow time when I started looking for hosting providers in Kazakhstan, to which we have not yet addressed.  Most of all I was attracted by the offer from <a href="http://gohost.kz/">GOHost.kz</a> , so that I did not even make a request, but I immediately registered and made an order for the configuration of interest to us online. <br><br>  Almost immediately I received a letter of registration and an invoice.  But it was stated that the connection is carried out over a 100 Mbit / s channel.  We needed 1 Gbps and I asked in a return letter how to increase the channel and how much it will cost.  They sent me a new account and asked what operating system we need to install and how best to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù the disks.  Even before we paid the bill, they began the installation work. <br><br>  Payment took place the next day on September 27.  And on the morning of September 28, we were informed that everything was ready and in the evening we launched our new CDN node in Kazakhstan. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/">Ivideon</a> servers are located on virtually all continents.  We have experience with sites in Ukraine, Germany, the Netherlands, USA, Korea, Brazil, etc.  Based on this experience, we can say that colleagues from <a href="http://gohost.kz/">GOHost.kz</a> worked incredibly quickly.  We just could not tell about it.  Perhaps this day we were just lucky.  But I would like to hope that this was not an exception, but a really high standard of quality and speed of customer service. <br>  Somewhere in six months, if it is interesting to Habra, we will write a detailed report on the work of our service at the site GOHost.kz.  In the meantime, based on what we have already seen, we recommend using this particular hosting provider to host our projects in Kazakhstan.  Thanks for the great job! <br><br>  Maybe with the withdrawal of offtopic "I resent", should I start a new one, but just the opposite?  It remains only to come up with a name for it and to be approved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152789/</a></p>
