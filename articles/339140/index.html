All who are interested in this news, we invite under the cat. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/339140/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/1c/59d21cace2f43496752042.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photos of ITMO University</font></i> <br><br><h2>  World Robot Olympiad </h2><br>  The World Robot Olympiad has been held since 2004.  Teams of schoolchildren from the age of 10 take part in the competition, gathering in accordance with the rules of the Olympiad of robots based on LEGO Mindstorm.  Participants can compete in one of three categories:

      <br>
    <ul><li>  Main category (you need to assemble a small robot and program it to perform a specific task) </li><li>  Creative category </li><li>  Football robots </li></ul><br>  Participants of the main and creative categories are also divided by age groups into younger, middle and older ones.  The tasks in the main and creative categories are usually united by a common theme - in 2017 it became the theme of the sustainable development of the planet in general and Costa Rica (which is hosting the Olympics this year) in particular. <br><br>  The differences between the main and creative categories are that the participants of the main category get a very specific task (for example, this year the team robot from the older group <a href="http://www.wro2017.org/Regular_Category/Senior_High/WRO-2017-Regular-Category-Senior.pdf">must</a> ‚Äúbuild three wind generators‚Äù from the given elements), while in the creative category the teams come up with imagine a task under a common theme. <br><br>  By the way, one of the major differences of this year‚Äôs Olympiad is the fact that in the older group, participants can use any programming language of their choice. <br><br><h2>  Project Forester </h2><br>  The ITMO University School Robotics Team competes with other participants in the creative competition in the older age group.  The project, which was presented by the team, the Forester robot-forestologist.  The robot moves across the terrain (and drives, and walks), determines using sensors where the tree is, uses neural networks to determine the type and condition of the tree (healthy / subject to sanitary cutting), and at the expense of the camera and additional algorithms it records how far it has come from start of the route. <br><br>  The team has been working on creating a robot since February 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/1d/59d21d174cab3738099050.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9">The project "robot-forestologist"</font> <br><br><h2>  Team </h2><br>  The project team has three schoolchildren from St. Petersburg - Gleb Zagarskikh, Daniil Nechaev and Maxim Mikhailov.  The team is trained by Igor Lositsky, an employee of the ITMO University Management Systems and Computer Science Department and the coach of the ITMO University school teams. <br><br>  As Igor Lositsky emphasizes, the coach in this project only helps with advice and guides the team - the students do all the work on creating a robot and programming algorithms on their own. <br><br><h2>  Competitive selection </h2><br>  In order to get to the Olympics, it is not enough just to make a good project.  It is necessary to pass a competitive selection in the country (to show a high result at the All-Russian Robotic Olympiad).  Its final stage took place in Innopolis on June 23-25.  Based on its results, leaders were determined to participate in the further selection (the ITMO University team became the winner in the senior creative category). <br><br>  The best teams participating in the All-Russian stage then took part in the remote selection for the international stage - for this it was necessary to provide a description of the project and a video of its protection in Russian and English (tell about the work of the robot and demonstrate its functions).  The materials <a href="http://robolymp.ru/season-2017/wro/team-russia/the-results-of-the-remote-selection-in-the-creative-category/">were evaluated by a</a> team of expert trainers - as a result, the ITMO University project was among the four recommended for participation from Russia in the creative category at the international stage of the WRO-2017. <br><br><h2>  What was a year ago </h2><br>  <a href="http://robolymp.ru/season-2016/wro/the-results-of-the-performance-of-the-russian-national-team-at-the-wro-2016/">Last year</a> (the final was held in New Delhi) Russia took the third place in the unofficial team competition (the first two places went to Malaysia and Taiwan).  In the creative category among the older age group, the school team of robotics at ITMO University (also under the guidance of Igor Lositsky) then won silver.  And a little more than a month is left before the final of this year - it will take place from November 10-12 already. <br><br>  What else do we write on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/338872/">Startups from Russia: ITMO University Digest</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/338714/">How to get to ITMO University Technopark</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339140/</a></p>
