      The control of the work process by the management is aimed at the timely and high-quality execution of the task assigned to the department and each employee in particular. <br>  That is, a coder should typeset websites, a copywriter should write texts. <br>  No matter what. <br><br>  For employees who are autistic natures, these may be ideal conditions. <br>  For all others - the opposite. <br><br>  If, say, the same designer, suddenly became interested in marketing and felt that the potential for this activity he is more than present, the real work loses its primacy.  As a result, there are non-target sites that are visited in order to fill in the gaps in knowledge, interest in the areas of the company's activities, which, if you follow the job description, do not concern it at all. <br>  The result is a tightening of control over the work of this employee, depremation and other disciplinary actions. <br><br>  In the event that a company is large enough, an employee may reasonably consider the possibility of self-realization in a new path without changing the physical place of work. <br><br>  In most cases, this stage is final. <br>  As an option - the lack of interest in the leadership of the proposal of an amateur to send it to specialized courses, and then transfer the trainee to the advertising department. <br>  Even with an established relationship with the management, such a proposal may be <br>  Totally ignored. <br>  As a rule, an employee believes (and rightly so) that in a company where he has been working for a long time and with a system he is well acquainted with, he has incomparably more chances to develop in other aspects than in a new workplace. <br>  As a result, the options for the development of this situation may be as follows: <br>  A) The company loses the typesetter, who, being very ambitious, goes in search of a new job. <br>  B) The company is losing perhaps an excellent marketer, for realizing the potential of which it would have been necessary to use some resources compensated in the near future by the quality work of the employee, inspired by the attention of the management to his own person and wanting to know as much as possible in the new field. <br>  In this case, the layout designer is aware of his own impersonality in the eyes of the management and, therefore, practically disloyal to the company. <br><br>  There are, of course, cases when such nuggets manage to get their way, being within the walls of their native offices, but there are only a few of them. <br><br>  Is it possible to identify people with a huge untapped potential in a team of more than fifty people? <br>  Does it make sense to professionally orient employees in which this potential is seen? <br>  I would appreciate any comments and suggestions. <br>  I apologize for some narrative komkannost. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21904/</a></p>
