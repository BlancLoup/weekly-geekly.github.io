  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does coworker work actually look like?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My name is Leonid, I am 26 years old.  I have been working on the Internet for 4 years.  I started with simple business cards for friends, then I made my own content sites, in general, anything, just to have money for lunch and gain experience.  He recently quit his job and started looking for coworking.  The result of this search I want to share with you.  Immediately, I note that I will not say which coworking I finally chose so that there would be no advertising.  So decide for yourself, and I will give you food for thought.  I searched both in St. Petersburg and in Moscow, as I live in both cities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with Moscow.  First of all, I went to the Flacon Design Factory.  This is a trendy place on the basis of the former factory.  From the subway to go somewhere 5-7 minutes.  There are a lot of tenants - and some vegan cafes, and street fashion stores, baubles, vinyl, glasses, etc.  In a word, this is a mini town of hipsters.  I have never seen such a cluster of hipsters anywhere else.  If someone likes such an environment, then this is the place for you.  By the way, there are several coworkings in this place, but I went to the largest and most famous - Start Hub.  The first impression is a cafe.  I thought at first that I was mistaken by the door.  Seating inside clean as in a restaurant.  There is a bar, there are sofas in the corners with coffee tables.  Noisy.  It is not clear what people are doing.  It seemed to me that graduates of the ‚ÄúBusiness of Youth‚Äù were sitting around me and sending something to someone.  Sitting in principle is not convenient, because there is no elementary normal table and chair, there are sofas with a coffee table, or a bar counter with high chairs.  There are normal office desks and chairs at the top for permanent tenants, but prices are higher there too.  Another funny moment - coworkers at 20:00 just kicked out.  The administrator literally gets up at about 7:50 pm and says: that's it, we roll up.  This does not apply to permanent tenants who sit at the top. <br><br>  Then I went to the ‚ÄúWorkstation‚Äù.  This is an amazing place.  Judging by external factors, this is probably the best place I've ever met.  The co-working itself is a detached one-story building right inside the park.  When I was sitting there, there was an interesting moment.  I enthusiastically worked on a topic, and looked at the laptop for several hours.  At some point, I even forgot where I was, and when I looked up from the laptop, I seemed to be in a forest somewhere in a very remote and comfortable place.  The fact is that right in front of me was a glass wall, and behind it was a park with green trees at that time, and this was the first thing I saw.  In general, it was nice.  Inside, everything is very beautiful and neat.  Excellent comfortable office chairs and tables.  The only thing I did not like was that there was nowhere to eat.  Coworking is a bit removed from the main highways.  Directly behind the next door with a coworking there is a cafe, but it is expensive, and the menu there is not particularly wide.  In addition, I want to have a choice of places, so the location in the park is both a plus and a minus.  And one more thing, but, probably, it applies to all coworking (almost all) - the feeling of public space does not leave everywhere.  It feels like you are sitting in a computer club.  I do not even know what to do if you want to sit together or three together with one team.  I myself have this problem.  In general, the ‚ÄúWorkstation‚Äù is a very steep coworking, for good reason it is the most expensive.  Fixed place - 15,000 rubles.  It is expensive.  They opened another co-working in Artplay, but I have not been there yet.  From the pictures, everything looks very beautiful.  I think it was also great. <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, the first thing I did was go to the ‚ÄúAction Zone‚Äù.  Heard a lot about him.  Once on the Internet there was a review of all coworkings in Russia, and it was put in the first place.  It surprised me (usually the first places in Moscow), and I have since wanted to go there.  Coworking is located in the city center right on one of the main avenues, Ligovsky.  The place is very reminiscent of the Flacon, only in a smaller version.  Also some kind of former factory that the hipsters lived in.  While I found the right door, I went around several shops of some consumer goods, cafes, and even a bar, which is adjacent to coworking.  In my opinion it was called ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù.  An interesting decision, after work, to overturn a couple of shots without moving far.  Inside, co-working is more like a warehouse, the walls and ceiling are slightly retouched, but overall the absolute feeling of a factory or factory.  Places are scattered in space in random order.  Chairs are different, mostly some kind of wooden, like a grandmother.  The tables are also some kind of ‚Äúcreative‚Äù, the feeling that everyone brought from the flea market.  Upset that there is no negotiation.  No, in fact, it is, but it's just two sofas in the corner and a small table between them.  Without any fences, in plain sight.  All the people mostly hang out in the kitchen.  There's a big table where you can sit down with a laptop.

      Also in St. Petersburg, I went to a new place - 404 Hub.  Interesting coworking, not like the others.  Location, to be honest, so-so.  It seems to be not far from the center, but still it is not the center.  The building itself is not far from Bolshoi Prospekt, where there is a lot of things, but before it is 1 kilometer.  Outside the building and surroundings are not very attractive, but inside the picture is completely different.  I first got into coworking, which is located in the business center.  I admit, it pleased me, because I was tired of all this hipstation.  The co-working itself is the following picture: a large two-story office, where the first floor is an Internet company, and the second is co-working.  It looks like the company just freed up the top floor under coworking.  At the same time, the second floor is located on the mezzanine, so it is clear that people are sitting under you.  In general, the feeling that this is a regular office, with the appropriate attributes in the form of marker boards and partitions.  Here, everyone should decide whether you need a trendy place, with incomprehensible people, or you need a quiet, boring office in which to work comfortably.  There is a convenient dedicated meeting room with a projector, which I did not see in the rest of the co-working.  One more thing, you can not shoot a coworking for rent or for a week.  Only for a month, according to administrators, with this restriction they want to avoid the turnover of people and create a friendly environment where people know each other.  Well, the goal is good. <br><br>  Summing up, I want to say that, in principle, coworkings are all the same.  After all, in the end it's just a workplace and the Internet.  All the difference is in the details, and here begins the rant for spoiled consumers with a large choice, i.e.  me with you  If you need a cool beautiful place, and there are no restrictions on the budget, then it is better to choose the "Workstation".  If you are hanging out more than working and hipsters are your friends, then Start Hub or ‚ÄúAction Zone‚Äù will help you.  If you need a simple neat office in the original meaning of the word, then you will like the 404 Hub more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240505/</a></p>
