  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microblogs - Twitter Mechanics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now microblogs have become extremely popular.  I am talking primarily about <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> .  What is the reason, and why are these blogs really? <br>  Many famous people, studios and companies have Twitter accounts.  Often social networks or sites broadcast updates to twitter (like Habr and temporarily. No). <br>  So, in order. <a name="habracut"></a>  Twitter is very simple.  140 characters per message (which, according to the creators of the site, should answer the question ‚ÄúWhat are you doing now?‚Äù), A simple system of circulation (we add @ in front of the name and the parser automatically makes it a reference to the profile of the interlocutor) and most importantly, amazing internal mechanics that make twitter it is a blog system, and not just a tape of messages from different people. <br>  On Twitter, you can be friends, or rather follow (follow).  This process is not mutual, but its essence is that all messages (or, as they are called, statuses, updates) of the person you follow will be automatically sucked into your page. <br>  On Twitter for each person there are three numbers - how many follow him, how many follow him and how many messages he has. <br>  There is a system of personal correspondence (direct messages), that is, you can simply write to a person so that no one will see it, in case this is a secret or you do not want to clutter the tape. <br>  And why 140 characters in the message?  It's simple, this is the length of one SMS.  That is, you can write on Twitter not only through the site, but also through ordinary text messages.  And through the mobile interface, third-party sites that use the API, and numerous clients for various platforms ( <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">twiitterific</a> , <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">twhirl</a> , <a href="http://www.fring.com/">fring</a> , etc.).  There is also the opportunity to subscribe to updates via mobile, and they will come to you in the form of SMS. <br>  Also, on Twitter, all references to you are automatically collected (that is, messages in the text of which your nickname, preceded by @ is present), these messages are usually either a way to point to the user (for example, ‚ÄúI'm sitting on a pair with @ <a href="http://twitter.com/KELiON">KELiON</a> ‚Äù) or replay (in reply) to some kind of your message (‚Äú@ <a href="http://twitter.com/yaroslavpat">yaroslavpat</a> , yes, very juicy design‚Äù) ‚Äù).  This way, you can see who reads you and often answers you (from those to whom you are not subscribed), who quotes you and who just mentioned you.  By the way, friends replai, not addressed to you, do not come to your tape.  This is very correct, because it was not written to you.  Plus, there is a sacred meaning in it, which you will understand later. <br>  Of course, you can also read the general message feed of the entire twitter, as well as have the opportunity to love some kind of tweet.  And the basic settings, blocking the user and change the design.  But this is all the external side, and so far, in our understanding, it all looks like a chat. <br>  But it‚Äôs the answer mechanics that make twitter a blog.  What is a blog?  First of all, these are posts and comments.  And where are they on Twitter?  Every time when you do not just write a message, but click on the "reply" button under some other (alien or your own) message, a link to this message is added to the end of your (in the form of "in reply to% username%").  This creates a linked status chain, similar to a comment thread.  That is, when you write a message, it is a post, and when a replay is a comment.  Yes, they are not displayed in the globular tree form, but it is very easy to follow, because you remember what it is about.  And if you do not remember - you can look at the link.  A replay that was not created by pressing a button is more likely comparable to a wall in a contact - this is a message without a topic and put on display. <br>  Until this understanding is achieved, Twitter will remain confused in your mind, and you will write answers to interesting messages not after pressing a button (which will create a semblance of a comment thread), but simply starting with the @ name scream into the void, it is not known what the answer is.  Having understood the essence of Twitter and the fact that this is really a blog, you may be imbued with the idea. <br>  That's what matters most on Twitter.  Well, at the end of the curtain you can add lengthy arguments about the moral component and responsibility, about the compressed framework of the message, motivating you to clearly and emphatically express thoughts, about the heap of services that collect interesting statistics of your twitter, about bots on Twitter, about the API and other research that is so complete the Internet.  but the purpose of my post was to explain what twitter is, how attractive and interesting it is.  And yet the best way to understand is to try.  Thank you for reading.  Sign up, read other entries and <a href="http://twitter.com/yaroslavpat">follow me on Twiiter</a> . </div>
