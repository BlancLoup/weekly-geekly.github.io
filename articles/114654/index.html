  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we began to live better with Google Apps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Foreword </h3><br>  Back in 2005, we decided to start our own business (what our company does - it does not matter much for our story).  Then we did everything hastily and solved the IT infrastructure issue spontaneously.  By the end of 2007, we had 30+ employees in two cities and the following service option, organized by our admins: <br><br><ul><li>  Single network - remote employees connected via openvpn </li><li>  Mail - SquirrelMail / IMAP </li><li>  SQUID as a proxy </li><li>  File / Print server on linux </li><li>  At the same time, the staff worked at the zoo of systems / operating systems (up to ‚Äúbring your own PC‚Äù or PC work provided by the client). <br></li><li>  SVN (version control system) for documents (an important nuance of our business is versioning and working together on documents). </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What did not suit us: </h3><br><ul><li>  File exchange only by mail or SVN: <br><ul><li>  Mail caused the reproduction of versions of documents, but was the only way to communicate with customers. </li><li>  SVN - required a) installation and connection via open vpn b) availability of an SVN client - both are not always possible when working from a computer issued by a client (restriction of rights, policies, and so on). </li></ul></li><li>  Difficulties and inconveniences for remote employees (some of them have never been to the company's office).  Install openvpn mail client setup, etc. </li><li>  The lack of calendars and the ability to give access to them (when working remotely, this is almost mandatory). </li><li>  It required at least 3 physical servers to support the entire infrastructure. </li><li>  Everything worked quite unstable: either the mail or the squid was overwhelming (there was little money, saved on servers and components), so they were left without a connection once a day for a quarter. </li><li>  Filled with spam - 30-40 messages per day. </li><li>  A headache with a corporate directory ‚Äî you had to do 3 operations to select a person from a directory (or quietly drag everyone to your personal address book).  Especially strained when new employees came. </li><li>  In addition, we had as many as 2 administrators (and 10% of their time they were dealing with mail and what is connected with it). </li></ul><br><br><h3>  What we wanted: </h3><br><ul><li>  What would all work (especially mail) </li><li>  Minimum spam (and better to not have at all) </li><li>  So that employees can just work (do not blow up the brain to new employees - not everyone wants to deal with IT gadgets, distracting from the main work) </li><li>  Calendars </li><li>  Availability of a company resource management system </li><li>  Simple exchange of documents and preferably joint work on them and versioning, with the ability to control access </li></ul>

    <h3>  What started with: </h3><br><br>  We tried to put a platform (the most common IMHO) of a well-known company on the server instead of SquirrelMail. <br><ul><li>  Calendars have appeared </li><li>  A normal contact list has appeared. </li></ul><br>  All other problems remained - and even fell more often.  Two months later, they decided that it could not continue this way - a FINAL DECISION was needed. <br><br><br><h3>  Light at the end of the tunnel: </h3><br><br>  One of the partners drew attention to the Google Apps service - by that time most of the employees had an account on gmail as an alternative working mailbox, especially those who were talented simply redirected mail there.  After an hour of analysis - what kind of ‚Äúbeast‚Äù is this, we realized that we were always looking for this particular set of solutions.  Cheerfully a free account on google apps was organized and for 2 days we tested this miracle.  Then the limitations of the free account, as I recall, were harder (25 accounts maximum, now - 50).  But it didn‚Äôt bother us and we decided to go directly to the premium (then it was possible to buy only in packages - it seems at 25).  We immediately bought 50 accounts (by that time the staff had grown to 40 employees) and paid 2500 USD for the first year of use. <br><br><br><h3>  Expensive?  Come on! </h3><br><br>  It may seem expensive to someone, and we think that we saved and that is why: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9a/9d/9a9df57d9f8ecbd701599e7c273f6254.png"><br><br>  It turned out that Google Apps is almost 4 times cheaper. <br><br>  * The fact is that payment (then) is possible only through Google Checkout - now there are more convenient options for Russian users. <br><br><h3>  What is the result: </h3><br><br>  Within one week, our admins managed to transfer 3-year correspondence to Google Apps accounts and happiness came.  Over 3 years of use, it only failed once for 2 hours (if you remember, last year).  And yet - a great spam cutter, a great opportunity to work together with documents (now there are more formats than when we started), tables, forms (Cloud Connect was recently announced - this is something with something), custom applications, installation of solutions from Google Marketplace, Google Sites is a great solution for internal portals, and with a certain imagination for external sites and much more. <br><h4>  What else would like to tell: </h4><br><ul><li>  How and what do we use in Google Apps?  What is new? </li><li>  What all these beautiful phrases mean in the description of Google Apps Premium, as well as when and why it makes sense to go to it.  Recently I explained to the client - it turns out that everything is not so easy to reduce to one denominator. </li><li>  Comparing alternatives to Google Apps (recently conducted) is very interesting. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114654/</a></p>
