  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung salons close in Russia: second echelon coming?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Last week, information was published on bankruptcy (more precisely, the application for such) of the retailer "White Wind Digital", which ranks 16th in the top Russian consumer electronics retailers.  Among the more than fifty repayment claims, Apple stood out in particular with the desire to return the most - 456.9 million rubles (~ $ 12.3 million).  Today there was a curious infopovod directly related to the cited bankruptcy.  The mono-brand Samsung retail chain began to shrink, 35 stores were discontinued.  Why?  The answer is simple - White Wind was in charge of managing these salons.  It clarifies the "Kommersant", just from the beginning of the year, Samsung has suspended the work of about 20% of branded stores throughout Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53d/a84/968/53da84968f0d466e80aac36dea3b99e7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This is not the first case of ‚Äúdeactivation‚Äù of Samsung stores, earlier this year up to ten stores (of the 66 points currently active) closed Inventive Retail Group.  On the one hand, the growth of Samsung retail network in 2012 is too fast as the reason for such a move by the company's general director Tikhon Smykov.  On the other hand, ‚Äúa radical change in the structure of the smartphone and tablet market, the growth in the share of second and third tier brands, and a reduction in consumer interest in the products of market leaders, including Samsung and Apple.

      All the same "Kommersant" referring to a certain employee of a "large retail network" claims that sales of the Samsung Galaxy S5 are almost twice as inferior to the flagship predecessor.  In principle, Samsung itself hardly expected mega-records.  A little abstracting from Russia - in Ukraine, initially, there was an action with a completely ‚Äúfree‚Äù Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 in addition to the purchase of a top-end smartphone.  About this, my colleague <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">alexeystar</a> told <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/220533/">back in April</a> .  An analogue of such a proposal reached Russia at the end of July, but with a less interesting ‚Äúpill‚Äù.  Master PC stores sold for $ 31,000 a pair of Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 Lite.  Individually, the models cost almost 30,000 and 6,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c96/edd/182/c96edd182b304cf1a66b92f8c0a2097f.jpg"><br><br>  Emerging news - more proof of the harsh realities that are not the first month in the mobile market.  Let me quote the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">alexeystar</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/222471/">note in</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">May</a> : ‚ÄúThe process of‚Äú eating away ‚Äùmarket share with local brands of A-brands is pretty bored, and the mastodons of the market cannot oppose small, but daring companies.  That is, for example, LG has gathered to develop a smartphone for 100 bucks.  She will invest a lot of money in software, develop a unique design, select the correct case materials, ensure the absence of serious glitches even in the first firmware.  And then it turns out that the budget is spent by two thirds, and this device will have to put a frail processor, a 3-inch screen with low resolution and 512 MB of RAM.  The counterpart from the Russian brand / Chinese manufacturer will have glitches and materials less wear-resistant, and the camera is worse, but the display is 5-inch and RAM is gigabytes.  As a result, customers increasingly prefer "Russian Chinese." <br><br>  As a result, in May, ABI Research announced the forecast that by 2019 two thirds of smartphones will be based on reference designs of chipset developers.  23 percent of such devices will cost in retail more expensive than $ 200, the rest - cheaper.  But at the same time, the flagships will remain in the sole management of the A-brands, no one here intends to give up the slack. <br><br>  It is unlikely that Samsung will ultimately repeat the fate of Nokia, which in 2012 closed absolutely all its stores in Russia.  Although at one time such a future Nokia was also hardly predictable.  This is consistent with the IDC results for Russia in the second quarter, shipments of Samsung tablets alone were reduced by 48.3%.  Apple is not far away - 48.3% with a minus sign. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/543/c3b/c41/543c3bc4193a4c30a1ce63e0940e463f.jpg"><br><br>  And again, the remarkable achievements of the second echelon are recalled.  A couple of weeks ago the report of Svyaznoy was published, in July for the first six weeks in Russia, the domestic B-brand took the first place in sales and walked around the A-brand represented by Samsung.  On tablet phones, the same Svyaznoy was announced in the first quarter of 2014: B-brands accounted for 40% of all sales. <br><br>  What about smartphones?  ‚ÄúSvyaznoy‚Äù, the same period: ‚ÄúThe role of B-brands in the market has significantly increased, especially in the segment of smartphones worth up to 5 thousand rubles.  According to the results of 3 months of 2014, this segment has already occupied 42% of the market in physical terms, which is 20 pp.  more than in the same period last year.  The share of B-brand devices in this price category is about 60% both in units and in money terms. ‚Äù <br><br>  Out of curiosity, I was not lazy, but I looked at it in a very banal way - how are things with the population showing interest in different brands?  We look at A-brands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/612/418/e6d/612418e6dacd4ad98b1061e7da65c16f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/091/8b3/6330918b30624bb59d554dcf53974fe8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37b/9e0/e70/37b9e0e708b0406e8eea76db4d82ae96.jpg"><br><br>  The picture is identical, the apparent decline is almost exactly since the beginning of 2014, with much earlier premises.  Only the seasonal New Year and Christmas peak helped, which only improved the situation for a short time. <br><br>  And what about B-brands?  Explay, Fly and Highscreen - only up, stable growth with a small corridor of fluctuations.  Yandex demonstrates unanimity with retail sales statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/422/82a/2ee/42282a2ee24945a0ac84e6d4ad3ce489.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/0e3/f9f/2f60e3f9f4c4416abaff33a25c59bae6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f6/120/e14/8f6120e14eae45aa9530b67d19857228.jpg"><br><br>  Spontaneous such a result can not be called.  Moreover, the request to ‚Äúbuy a smartphone‚Äù is only gaining popularity.  That is, the demand in the smartphone market is constantly growing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/44d/f3e/83f44df3e70a4c7ca9d08bc86bead51d.jpg"><br><br>  And after this starting point, people already purposefully prefer to look at what second-tier brands offer there.  What do you think, is it worth waiting for fundamental changes in the emerging trend in the long term?  Or is it the mastodons of the smartphone market - A-brands will be able to turn the tide? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235557/</a></p>
