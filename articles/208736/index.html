  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why subscribers leave you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know why your newsletter subscribers stopped reading you?  Then in this habratopic we will talk about what to do so that your letters continue to read and do not even think about the unsubscribe button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2e/de0/c2d/e2ede0c2d7d18b72277438c8d93221b6.png" alt="Reasons for unsubscribing"><br>  At KDPV, the well-known infographics tells us why people unsubscribe from the letters they agreed to receive. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>There are a few words before we start discussing ways to avoid unsubscribing:</b> <br><ol><li>  We are talking about the letters to which people agreed (subscription, a check mark when placing an order and the like).  If you send letters without permission, people unsubscribe because they hate spam. </li><li>  Other people's research is good, but you can find your own rake only in your statistics.  Therefore, do not forget that after the unsubscribe link, there is also life, that is, the unsubscribe page. <br>  On this page you can always unobtrusively ask what happened.  Let infographics be a hint what to ask. </li><li>  3. In the article we will discuss how to prevent such a turn of events.  If a person has already unsubscribed, and you start to disturb him and find out why, he will click on the "This is spam" button. </li></ol><br>  So let's get started: <br><br><h2>  Letters come too often </h2><br>  This is one of the myths of email marketing.  The fact that the frequency affects the attitude to the list. <br>  Shopping clubs send 5 letters a day and earn money.  There are companies that send one letter in 3 months, but receive a wave of negativity, because the New Year is all sent :). <br>  It's all about the information and its presentation. <br>  <b>They use useless information</b> , but wait for useful information.  How many letters a day would you like to receive with tips on how to do exactly your job better and easier?  And how much about the sale of small-sized combines in Makhachkala? <br>  In the same way, your subscribers, when they first look at the letter, determine what is interesting and what combines.  And click on the unsubscribe or "This is spam." <br><br><h4>  What do we have to do: </h4><br><ol><li>  <b>Maximum segmentation</b> - divide your subscribers into groups and send letters that are interesting to this particular group.  Feel free to write to the person in which group he is: <br>  - For the online store ‚Äú <i>I am writing to you because you bought an iPhone from us, and here are some useful iPhone applications you need</i> .‚Äù <br>  - For the training center ‚Äú <i>You listened to the training * of mega-awareness * about the organization of working time.</i>  <i>Now there comes * another megaznality * with the course "How to make work not only yourself, but also subordinates" ...</i> " <br>  - For tourism: ‚Äú <i>You flew with us to Delhi last summer, again this summer to India?‚Äù</i>  " </li><li>  <b>Do not repeat the content</b> (about this in the next paragraph). </li><li>  <b>Link letters to the story</b> .  If a person receives several letters with one ‚Äúplot‚Äù, then this is already perceived as a kind of series.  It is quite difficult to do, but UniSender recommends making stocks in series (the last example of a campaign with 8 letters showed that the increase in the number of formal replies is too small compared to the increase in income). </li><li>  <b>Check automatic letters</b> .  You have set up automatic letters from CRM - you are well done.  Then open the sending history to the person and see that 6 different letters from you have come to him today.  Trouble and sadness. </li><li>  <b>Suggest choosing a regularity</b> : <br>  - At a certain stage of "communication".  For example, after 4 letters, or 3 unread.  Or if the person did not order anything, but did not unsubscribe. <br>  - During unsubscribe.  Offer to choose the regularity of letters.  For example, a person does not fit daily letters - ‚Äú <i>do you want a weekly digest?</i>  "Or" with <i>vodka for the month</i> . " <br></li></ol><br><h2>  Content repeats over time or becomes boring. </h2><br>  There are special cases when a client sends the same letter once every 15 days.  What would you do if you received such letters? <br>  Often, the companies that conduct the mailing lists do not particularly diversify their content.  This is especially clearly seen in online stores that send stock.  Yes, they sometimes make another ‚Äúfestive‚Äù design, but that‚Äôs all. <br>  The man already knows what you sent him.  If you simply remind yourself of letters and hope that the person will remember you when the time comes, then you are probably a marketer of a very large hypermarket.

    <h4>  What we do: </h4><br><ol><li>  Never send the same letter to the same person.  If you do not know what to write - welcome to us at the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/app/">Academy of the Selling Letters</a> . </li><li>  We mix: <br>  - Useful content and marketing (4 to 1). <br>  - Different forms of content - article, infographics, brochure, video, review in different forms, sale and praising of one product, sale, thematic sale.  You can add cats if the audience allows it. <br>  - Text letters and letters with pictures. </li><li>  Periodically distribute something valuable.  Info-businessmen write letters ‚Äú <i>My coolest training with a 90% discount for one hour,</i> ‚Äù an online store can offer, for example, a film, a case and an add-on to any phone.  guarantee, but only today.  Also do not forget about contests. <br>  The point is to show that there is a ‚Äúmovement‚Äù and great offers in the newsletter. <br></li></ol><br><h2>  I receive too many emails and want to unsubscribe from some companies </h2><br>  Translation into ordinary language: "I do not need your information."  Here either point 1 or the next point. <br><br><h2>  Information is uninteresting from the start. </h2><br>  Here we sit down and think hard. <br>  If a person from the very beginning agreed to receive information from us, but she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúimpress‚Äù him, then he signed for the sake of one offer or you didn‚Äôt guess the segment. <br><br><h4>  What we do: </h4><br><ol><li>  We are looking for a <b>letter that creates a formal reply.</b>  Such also happens.  We look at the statistics, which caused a surge in negativity. </li><li>  <b>We communicate with our audience.</b>  Perhaps you represent your client as a 23-year-old hipster from Moscow who lives at the expense of his parents, and in fact he is a 34-year-old St. Petersburg entrepreneur who has two children and a programmer wife. <br>  Depending on the information received, we segment and modify the mailing offers.  To sell everything and everyone is much harder than a specific audience. <br></li></ol><br><h2>  I prefer to search for information on my own.  I don‚Äôt want companies to remind me of something </h2><br>  The problem is that a person can find this information from you, but in a different place.  For example, on the site.  That is, you yourself destroy the value of your mailing list. <br>  So do online stores in their promotions - you can go to the site and find the action that is offered in the mailing list.  With the same discounts and conditions.  And now the question for connoisseurs: ‚Äú <b>Why read the newsletter, which does not carry anything new?</b>  ". <br>  A person sees a letter, thinks ‚ÄúAnother letter with shares‚Äù and does not open it.  The option is only suitable for those who wait by the river until the current brings them a client. <br><h4>  What we do: </h4><br><ol><li>  Creating a value mailing - in the newsletter should always be something that can not be obtained otherwise.  For example, a promotional code comes in the mail. <br>  Or in the letter itself there is information that is not repeated on the site.  Some info-businessmen do this - articles in letters, and links to courses and trainings. </li><li>  We give the choice of what messages to receive.  We do it: <br>  - In the form of a subscription. <br>  - In the form of a formal reply through segmentation or different lists.  For example, if a person receives promotions and your newsletter, then he can unsubscribe from some lists - the main thing to correctly formulate. <br>  For example, this is how the author of this article looks at the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/help/unsubscribe/">UniSender mailing lists</a> . <br></li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/0e8/c59/37a0e8c59bffda9ad9b72496ded3cba4.png" alt="Post UniSender"><br><h2>  I signed up to get what was offered for a subscription (one-time offer) </h2><br>  It happens.  You promised a book (pamphlet, whitepaper), got the lead and decided to start sending news of your company or pictures of your cat to these people. <br><h4>  What we do: </h4><br><ol><li>  <b>We offer something that will help segment</b> .  The white paper ‚Äú10 tricks of world famous copywriters‚Äù pulls you all who knows the word copywriter, and the white book ‚ÄúHow to write headlines for an automatic series in an e-mail newsletter‚Äù gives you an advanced level e-mail marketing specialists. </li><li>  <b>If ‚Äúcaught for free‚Äù</b> , then we promise that the freebie will continue in the letters.  Periodically give freebies.  This is the specificity of the audience that buys shares - they will run to where it is cheaper, but they can cause a surge in sales as soon as they see the% sign. </li><li>  <b>We write a welcome letter</b> (sent immediately after the subscription), in which we describe in detail what will be on the mailing list, when and what a person receives.  Do not delay with this. <br></li></ol><br><h2>  I've changed everything </h2><br>  It is necessary to reconcile.  If you are in Kiev, and the man moved to Cheboksary, then nothing will change.  Or married, which sometimes equates to moving. <br>  On the other hand, people often hide under this that information is not interesting.  We return to step 1 and remember that people lie.  With this, too, need to accept. <br><br><h2>  I read another company's newsletter </h2><br>  If to translate literally - I use the services of another company that provides the best information.  Infographics is clearly related to infobusiness. <br>  If a lot of your customers say that your competitor has a better list, then we begin to analyze. <br><h4>  What to do: </h4><br>  Two options: <br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúTighten‚Äù your newsletter to the level of a competitor (hire a good copywriter, do segmentation and automation, add design); </li><li>  Do what your competitor does not do (convert the newsletter, more unique offers). <br><br></li></ol><br><h2>  I found out that I can get information not from the newsletter (blog, facebook and so on) </h2><br>  How does this option differ from the version of an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù reader?  The latter does not want you to write to him, he has some negative feelings towards you and your remind.  Possibly predisposed that e-mail is exactly spam. <br>  In our case (if it is not polite refusal) it is inconvenient for a person to receive letters. <br>  We do everything the same as in the paragraph with an independent reader.  In addition, we add links on the website and in the letter template to how you can receive your information in a different way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208736/</a></p>
