      Our taxi will always be with you in your mobile phone.  Everywhere, everywhere, meekly fulfill your order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do you often travel to several cities?  This is also not a problem!  Our taxi opens in the twenty of the largest cities in Russia, as well as in many small towns.  Now you can use the same taxi service, which has already become familiar. <br><br>  We built technology so that there are no more dispatchers in a taxi, and there never will be. <br>  You apply through the application in the mobile, and it goes to all drivers in the specified area.  Further interaction with the driver is built very conveniently and does not require the participation of the dispatcher.  You can also choose the car you like based on cost, waiting time and brand of car. <br><br>  The goal of the project is to create a new generation of taxis, which, on the one hand, will solve many problems and inconveniences, and on the other hand, will give its customers a much more convenient, high-quality, profitable and infinitely expandable service. <br><br>  As the project progresses, we will acquire more and more new services in the field of transportation and delivery. <br><br>  <b>Here are the obvious advantages that we have already decided to solve in the field of taxi services.</b> <br><ul><li>  There are no costs for cellular communication. </li><li>  No need to remember the taxi numbers and constantly carry their cards. </li><li>  No need to wait for a call back dispatcher. </li><li>  You do not need to remember the brand and number of the car, they will be listed in the application. </li><li>  You can choose the car among those who want to take your application. </li><li>  You can call a taxi from noisy places, for example from the club. </li><li>  You can see the amount of the trip in advance and you can choose the cheapest option. </li><li>  When the car has already arrived, the application immediately notifies you of this. </li><li>  You can ride for free by becoming a taxi partner. </li></ul><br>  And this is just the beginning, many more interesting innovations are planned, allowing to make the service even more convenient, practical and economical.  For example, we plan to introduce a rating of drivers in order to eventually form a base of real professionals in their field - drivers worthy of their clients. <br><br>  The results of open testing in the regional city (population of about 700 thousand people) confirmed all our assumptions and justified the idea.  But in order to open up in full force, we need to collect a preliminary database of customers / drivers.  Only by typing the necessary minimum, you can ensure smooth operation and quick execution of applications at the best prices.  At the moment, a taxi is gaining its minimum for opening in the largest cities of Russia. <br><br>  <b>Comparison of our application with modern methods of calling a taxi.</b> <br><br>  <i>SMS call.</i> <br><ul><li>  You need to know the number (remember the number) of a taxi. </li><li>  There is no autocomplete, so all the addresses need to be re-entered each time. </li><li>  No car selection.  It is not known what car you will be given. </li></ul><br>  <i>ICQ call.</i> <br><ul><li>  There is no autocomplete, so all the addresses need to be re-entered each time. </li><li>  No car selection.  It is not known what car you will be given. </li><li>  This is convenient for the "ardent" users of ICQ.  Not everyone already uses ICQ. </li></ul><br>  <i>Order form on the site.</i> <br><ul><li>  Need to remember the site address.  Addresses are different and sometimes more complicated phone numbers. </li><li>  Again, no choice of car. </li><li>  No autocomplete.  (Although it is easy to implement, it is not available at the moment). </li><li>  Not all such forms are optimized for mobile browsers. </li></ul><br>  <i>All these methods cannot be used in different cities.</i>  <i>As a rule in each city will have to look for something new.</i>  <i>Also, these methods do not exclude the work of the dispatcher, and accordingly you will have to communicate with them as always.</i> <br><br>  You can get acquainted with our technology in detail from a special review, which will soon be written in the ‚ÄúStartups‚Äù blog. <br><br>  This topic will be updated as a new part of the technology review. <br>  All links will be here: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/88693/">Taxi in mobile or automation of popular business.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/88693/">(part 1)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/89217/">Taxi in the mobile - the driver's side.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/89217/">(part 2)</a> </li><li>  Taxi in the mobile - our success is the success of our partners.  (part 3) </li></ul><br>  PS Topic posted at the request of the author of the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88678/</a></p>
