It is necessary to register. <br><br>  To avoid future issues, you need to know: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>G Suite account on 2017-12-14</b> . </li><li>  <b>You can still save</b> it.  You must <a href="https://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFvIGUfsQ_tFrFH5BDWMOr2UFUH8YjF_v3DOKvHP_1RSQ6WL_9Y6Ee5TS_KgcANMZ76-tTtVGcJLL4I2G8vwGEHn7iv2cCz-sMZxBGcKSA">migrate your data</a> <b>no later than 2017-12-10</b> or it will be deleted. </li><li>  If you‚Äôre <a href="http://www.google.com/appserve/mkt/p/AFvIGUf2HGoWJFkC14z8IdAbL0Uuxtyg3lGVjBy5IU46bD1gqgYSoRFf8r1YKe3A6RSuuOmLi00">registering for a</a> subscription.  If you have your account? </li></ul><br>  We apologize for any inconvenience. <br>  Sincerely <br>  The g suite team </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Since Legacy accounts do not have priority support, they are all sent to a forum where a very poor explanation is given - <b>you purchased your account from an unauthorized reseller and therefore your domain violates the terms of use and will be disabled</b> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#2e74b5">A bit of history</font> </h3><br>  Back in 2006, Google <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ru/2006/08/get-your-people-talking.html">released</a> Google Apps for Your Domain and offered to use their service to companies of any size <b>for free</b> .  A little later, in February 2007, Google <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.ru/2007/02/google-apps-grows-up.html">announced the</a> version of Google Apps Premier Edition with priority support for $ 50 (by the way, the price has not changed in 11 years! In dollars, of course, but still not many vendors can boast such consistency).  In the same 2007, Softline signed a partnership agreement with Google. <br><br>  Later, Google limited the number of free accounts to 100, then to 50, to 10, and in December 2012 completely <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2855120%3Fhl%3Den">canceled</a> free accounts for new domains.  But previously connected accounts continued to work. <br><br>  So there was a black market for used domains with Google Apps connected.  I will not give references.  The scheme is simple - the buyer receives a previously created domain with the transfer of rights from the registrar, and in the Google Admin console changes the primary domain to its primary one.  Or, if a second-level domain was purchased, add your desired domain as Alias ‚Äã‚Äãto the free legacy subscription. <br><br>  Let us return to the problem of disconnecting! <br><br><h3>  <font color="#2e74b5">Possible reasons for shutdown (who is at risk)</font> </h3><br>  While there is no clear understanding of how Google caught offenders, but here are a few options, who are at risk: <br><br><ul><li>  There was a change of the main domain to Legacy Google Apps (G Suite) </li><li>  One domain has dozens of third-level domains with subscriptions connected to Legacy, especially if each has aliases. </li><li>  Some supplier gave you a free subscription to the Legacy G Suite along with its service (see option number 1). </li><li>  Domain is connected to G Suite for Education, but domain does not belong to educational institution </li><li>  Google also provided access to the G Suite for developers (not for everyday use) </li></ul><br>  * If there are more options - write in the comments - add. <br><br>  The main document regulating the actions of users - <b>Acceptable Use Policy</b> can be studied <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/use_policy.html">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#2e74b5">What to do if I was turned off?</font> </h3><br>  If you have already been turned off without warning, and the data needs to be saved - your task is to contact Premier support at any cost and ask them to turn on your subscription for several days - you can try to contact either through another domain with a paid subscription, or through a reseller, for example, Softline - we We will be happy to help.  Email us at google@softline.ru <br><br><h3>  <font color="#2e74b5">Instructions for transferring data and maintaining the primary domain</font> </h3><br>  According to Google's instructions, you must back up your data outside the G Suite before disconnecting, then <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1257646%3Fhl%3Dru">delete your subscription</a> .  Next, you need to buy a paid subscription to the same domain and migrate the data back to the G Suite. <br><br>  However, as it turned out, it is possible to get by with a simpler procedure - we connected the Legacy client to G Suite via the Softline console and requested support not to disconnect the domain, the request passed a certain negotiation stage and the client was allowed not to delete the subscription.  In this case, the support stipulates that each case is unique and undergoes a separate agreement. <br><br>  If you do not agree on a simple option - it remains only to migrate data.  Here is a detailed instruction: <br><br><ol><li>  We register a new subscription to G Suite, for example new.domain.ru (it is possible through us) </li><li>  We create the same users on the new domain </li><li>  We start the data transfer of mail <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169">data migration tools from Google</a> </li><li>  We transfer user files <br>  - Through the provision of access and script <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/drive-migrator/nakklajdcijlkfagghhcdofbgbhddoed%3Fhl%3Dru">Drive Migrator</a> (allows you to create copies of files and subfolders from the user).  File permissions will need to be manually re-written. <br>  - Or using the paid service <a href="https://www.thecloudmigrator.com/migration/file/google-drive-to-google-drive/">Cloud Migrator</a> - full data transfer with access rights to all files. </li><li>  Delete the old subscription in the console - follow the <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/1257646%3Fhl%3Dru">instructions</a> </li><li>  Within 24 hours, the old domain will be available and in the new console new.domain.ru, you need to change the main domain to the old domain.ru name </li></ol><br>  There is another way without deleting the account and transferring data. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#2e74b5">If you do not want to tempt fate!</font> </h3><br>  If disabling G Suite promises losses for a business - we recommend switching to a paid version - none of our clients who previously received a legacy received such a letter, to paid accounts served through an authorized Premier reseller, there can be no complaints. <br><br>  <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6043385%3Fhl%3Dru">Here</a> you can read about the differences between the paid versions of G Suite. <br><br>  For all questions please contact us at google@softline.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346360/</a></p>
