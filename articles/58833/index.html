  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About losers and the phenomenon of lousy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a breed of people, the <strong>meaning of their existence is to prevent others from achieving something</strong> . <br><br>  This breed has long been bred in schools and in labor collectives.  Corroded ability to ask questions, question the words of authorities, defend their point of view, show initiative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The professional hierarchy was replaced by the age-old, sociable, clan.  Someone who is older, someone whose child, someone with someone in the smoking room pushes or drinks in the sauna. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>- Sit down, upstart!</em>  <em>Let others answer.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>‚ÄúEr, this is it, here I am, yes, now if ...</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- What is the smartest found?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Who are you?</em>  <em>Yes, I've been working here for 10 years!</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Do not talk with adults.</em> </blockquote><br>  And as the teams sabotage the work of talented beginners!  Especially if it is a manager who is younger than his subordinates.

      "What if he gets it?"  And I, it turns out, could not?  It turns out that I, so clever, yield to this upstart? ‚Äù <br><br>  Loser, perhaps, understands that in his years he was at such a place because of his own laziness, pofigizmu, weakness or lack of professionalism. <br><br>  Understands, but is afraid to admit it even to himself.  The loser is also dependent on the assessment of others (real or apparent), and therefore the success of others is doubly painful for him, because he clearly demonstrates why this happened. <br><br><h3>  <strong><em>Comfortable for him a picture of the world - "they are lucky, honest ways not to earn this."</em></strong>  <strong><em>And this picture collapses when a more talented, capable, active person appears.</em></strong> </h3><br>  Loss is a stable pathological condition.  Instead of somehow changing themselves, the loser will seek to restore a comfortable picture of the world. <br><br>  The easiest way is to sabotage or tarnish a person‚Äôs activity, the success of which can show what a loser really is. <br><br>  A little worm of envy, jealousy of others' achievements sits deeply in people.  He is in almost all of us, not excluding the author of these lines. <br><br>  But losers allow this worm to significantly influence their actions. <br><br>  These people themselves have created little, and most of them are a walking bundle of complexes.  And because they do not miss the opportunity to "confirm" the vainness of their existence in an accessible way. <br><br><h2>  Common script </h2><br>  For example, the person decided to honestly make money with his mind.  I wrote the program and began to sell it.  To sell something, you first need to tell people about it. <br><br>  The man took, but wrote about his program, say, on some forum or on the "Habr√©".  And openly, rather than engaging in ‚Äúhidden marketing‚Äù. <br><br>  And here stinky looniera comes up: <br><br><blockquote>  <em>- This is a boost!</em>  <em>(The loser does not even suspect that PR is public relations, he simply heard this word in a negative context from another loser).</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Fuu, I thought it was free.</em>  <em>Yes, in my life I will not put this shit on myself (and immediately goes to look for a crack, yeah).</em> </blockquote><br><br>  In order to be higher than others, there are two ways.  You can rise yourself, and you can humiliate the other. <br><br>  The first path involves work, creation, overcoming obstacles.  Including howls, sabotage and the "minuses" of the loser. <br><br>  The second is a cheap way to feel ‚Äúno worse‚Äù than someone.  To humiliate a dugi person, to shit a little is the only opportunity available for a loser to assert himself. <br><br><h2>  Why is a loser not a loser </h2><br>  <em>Chances are good that luzerki will comment too.</em>  <em>As usual, until the end they do not finish reading - they rush to make their epic vyser as soon as possible.</em>  <em>Let's see how much will be perturbed by the word "loser".</em> <br><br>  By the way, I also do not like ‚ÄúAmericanism‚Äù, but there is no adequate replacement for the word ‚Äúloser‚Äù in Russian.  The word "loser" does not fit - luster has nothing to do with luck. <br><br>  Except for the main failure in their lives.  They are not lucky with those who brought them up. <br><br><h3>  <em><strong>Failures and mistakes haunt the creators even more - they accompany any practical activity.</strong></em> </h3><br>  Losers step over.  Put in place.  If you are an employer, do not let them stray into the herds and slay more active employees. <br><br>  <em>In fairness, the opposite should be noted.</em>  <em>Quite a few thugs from the 90s who decided to compete with a pistol, later explained their claims to them ‚Äúwith envy of a successful person.‚Äù</em>  <em>Especially a lot of these in the commodity and construction sector.</em> <br><br>  A very good link to the topic surfaced in the comments: <a href="http://www.kulichki.com/vv/pesni/sideli-pili-vraznoboj-maderu.html">www.kulichki.com/vv/pesni/sideli-pili-vraznoboj-maderu.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58833/</a></p>
