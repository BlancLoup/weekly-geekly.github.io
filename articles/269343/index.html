  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the road with clouds: the reality of data centers and the role of SPLA in it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Go to the sites of data centers that provide virtual machines and servers, you will notice that there are more and more offers of renting infrastructure with pre-installed software.  And there are a variety of configurations: from operating system images to database servers and CRM / ERP.  The market dictates its own conditions - and providers, data centers, and just the owners of facilities go to meet the client and are ready to help in the deployment of almost any infrastructure.  But is everything cloudless in these clouds? <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/269343/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acb/5f9/286/acb5f928601c46569ebdcfd20a8eeb39.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Often there are issues related to the licensing of software, which is placed on the leased infrastructure element.  Simply put, not everyone knows that there are a number of licensing restrictions for installing software on virtual machines of data centers.  Let's try to understand more in this matter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">SPLA solves data center problems</font> </h2><br>  Indeed, today data centers offer many options for renting virtual capacity.  At the same time, customers often request virtual machines with Microsoft preinstalled software, or they want to install their own set of Microsoft software and applications.  But installing such applications is not always legitimate in terms of licensing.  For example, you can transfer corporate software licenses to common servers of third parties only if the data center has an SPLA (Service Provider License Agreement) agreement.

      We suggest reviewing several cases in order to understand how typical data center services and SPLA licensing compare. <br><br>  The diagram shows the main types of services that provide data clients to their customers and that are closely linked to licensing under the SPLA program if Microsoft software or software based on its use is supplied with virtual capacity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/f9e/4b7/453f9e4b78ef4f62a6a131027d4b723c.png"><br><br>  In the case of <b>Colocation</b> and <b>dedicated infrastructure</b> , the data center client is free to install its own Microsoft software, regardless of the participation of the data center in the SPLA program.  Nevertheless, the availability of SPLA will allow the data center to quickly close the client‚Äôs need for a new or missing Microsoft software by incorporating this software into the service, which can be very convenient for the client and profitable for the data center. <br><br>  When providing <b>IaaS</b> and <b>SaaS</b> services, participation in the SPLA program will allow the data center to directly or indirectly use a wide range of Microsoft software products in its services: Windows Server, MS SQL, Dynamics CRM and many others. <br><br>  If clients are granted access to <b>virtual machines located on a common infrastructure</b> , unless the data center has a signed SPLA agreement, clients will not have the right to use Microsoft products in virtual machines on shared servers. <br><br>  Many companies do not even suspect that if the data center does not provide the client with a separate infrastructure / hardware, but only virtual machines (both individual and part of a multi-machine), then the customer does not have the right to install on them Microsoft products independently acquired by him under one of the corporate licensing programs (OLP, OV / S, EA / S ...) without a SA (Software Assurance) subscription and the status of the SPLA licensing program member at the data center. <br><br>  Moreover, even if there is a valid SA subscription, such a right (it gives one of the advantages of SA - License Mobility) appears in a limited list of products (for example, you cannot transfer Windows Server and user applications Office, Visio, Project, etc. ... ).  Obviously, in this case, to enable the customer to transfer their own licenses, the data center will have to provide access to the finished virtual infrastructure running Windows Server as a service using the SPLA licensing program ... <br><br>  Thus, if the provider wants to provide access to the necessary Microsoft products as a service (for example, to a Windows Server as an IaaS service), and also allow customers to use their own licenses on virtual machines - participation of the data center in the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/265177/">SPLA</a> (Services Provider)</b> licensing program. <b>License Agreement)</b> required. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/406/634/ae3/406634ae3fc24decb341a1ce47113b62.png" align="left" height="295">  If the data center or the owner of the leased equipment is a member of the SPLA, it receives a number of significant benefits. <br><br><ul><li>  No legal issues related to licensing Microsoft.  The SPLA program provides for full-fledged licensing consulting by the <b><a href="http://cloud.softline.ru/spla">SPLA-Reseller</a></b> . <br><br></li><li>  Microsoft software allows you to deliver software that covers all business needs: MS Office, MS Dynamics CRM, SharePoint, MS Project, and more ... Installing software on demand or as part of a virtual machine configuration allows an SPLA member to receive additional revenue from selling software access services and further technical support. <br><br></li><li>  Microsoft Windows Server and Microsoft SQL quite often serve as the basis for deploying business-critical applications (CRM, ERP, corporate e-mail, etc.).  Providing them on leased servers opens up new customer retention options. <br><br></li><li>  Flexible program terms allow the data center to include in its line of SaaS and IaaS solutions based on Microsoft software without any risks or financial costs: SPLA does not require advance payments and does not contain an obligation to increase the number of licenses used from month to month. all license deductions are made after the fact. <br><br></li><li>  SPLA allows you to create any combination of Microsoft software deliveries, which means that a program participant will be able to respond quickly to customer business changes and retain the customer guaranteed. <br><br></li><li>  The data center can initially create and offer configurations with pre-installed software.  This way you can reach a segment of customers who want to rent a virtual machine with software. </li></ul><br>  As you know, ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If the data center, not being a member of SPLA, out of ignorance provides its software to Microsoft, the blame will be on it.  If a client places a software on a rented machine, then, accordingly, these are customer problems, but the reputation of the data center can also be compromised.  In any case, such actions can lead to unpleasant consequences on the part of Microsoft and a temporary halt of a part of the company's activities - until the moment all issues with licensing are resolved. <br><br>  Therefore, it is better to foresee everything in advance and avoid this very unjustified risk.  Moreover, the demand for services will grow. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">IaaS - why do companies need cloud infrastructure?</font> </h2><br>  In Russia, the services of providing infrastructure in the cloud (IaaS) were initially in demand because of obvious advantages.  However, today there are prerequisites for even more intensive development, and the growth drivers are largely due to the not very favorable general economic background: companies save on equipment purchases, derive software from capital costs, and are increasingly inclined to implement cloud technologies.  You can not discount the law that entered into force on September 1, 2015 on storing users' personal data on Russian servers. <br><br>  IaaS enjoys the most popularity among retailer companies with many distributed branches, online stores, banks, IT companies (developers and integrators), insurance companies and even the media.  Typically, the IaaS model provides the infrastructure elements of a data center (DPC) and associated network resources (for example, VPN).  At the same time, the data center guarantees accessibility, security and performance, which is standard for the enterprise class.  However, a "clean" lease is not the only form of relationship between the data center and its client.  There are several other types of relationships, among which configuration is possible, which combines the solutions of the client's local network and the cloud-based data center platform.  This approach not only quickly develops and scales easily, but also allows you to save well on IT: the customer does not invest in modernization or in support - only the resources used are paid. <br><br>  The combination of virtual capacities and Microsoft software products (Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft SQL, Microsoft System Center) help to create fault-tolerant and easily scalable solutions for the implementation of the implementation of corporate software.  It can be both accounting systems and high-load projects related to big data or media content.  However, providing virtual facilities with installed Microsoft software without licensing <a href="http://cloud.softline.ru/spla">SPLA is</a> impossible and can lead to problems that will affect both the data center and customers. <br><br>  Obviously, in the conditions of intensive development of IaaS, data centers will begin to experience growth, a lot of players will appear on the market who will strive to develop their segments and niches.  In turn, this will stimulate the development of SaaS, as the trend to deliver software with data center services is growing.  Of course, not everything is as perfect as it seems at first glance, and there are technical limitations that small and medium data centers may face, as well as their customers.  It can be difficult to deploy in the cloud ultra complex corporate information systems, ERP, billing, bank processing.  These restrictions are associated not only with the exorbitant level of security, but also with the restrictions that are dictated at the technological level, for example, the complexity of deploying some DBMS or the binding of software logic to the hardware parameters (equipment serial number). <br><br>  However, the IaaS sector will grow and data centers should consider the need for end-user software supplied on leased servers and virtual machines.  And above all, it should concern the issues of pre-installation and installation of on-demand versions of software from Microsoft, which is unchallenged in most business areas.  In addition, the delivery of virtual machines with preinstalled Microsoft software is a source of additional income for the data center, which can earn money both from the cost of licenses and from technical support for users.  To realize this opportunity, it is impossible to do without participating in SPLA as a universal and most suitable licensing model for data centers providing virtual capacity for rent. <br><br>  Flexible licensing policy, lack of initial investments in software, availability of the latest, most modern and current software versions are an important part of the benefits of the <a href="http://cloud.softline.ru/spla">SPLA</a> licensing program.  However, from the point of view of data centers and companies that leased capacity, the participation of SPLA is the diversification of business and the expansion of the portfolio of services capable of covering customer needs.  And this is an opportunity to navigate in the competitive space in time and have time to cut off a part of the pie of the growing IaaS sphere.  He promises to be delicious. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269343/</a></p>
