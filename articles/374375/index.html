Sending into space is postponed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e33/397/e2c/e33397e2cff9623089beaf9eae4c3dd3.jpg"><br><br>  NASA got into trouble with the James Webb telescope.  Earlier on Geektimes it was already reported about one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/analysis-finds-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-likely-to-slip-again/"></a>  <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/nasas-james-webb-telescope-delayed-to-2020-likely-to-exceed-cost-cap/">problems, another has now been discovered</a> , which is likely to delay the launch of the system into space indefinitely.  The project itself began to be implemented long ago.  The first design elements were prepared in 1996.  At about the same time, NASA announced that the launch of one of the most advanced space telescopes was scheduled for 2007.  The project cost amounted to about $ 500 million. <br><br>  But then, after the 96th, the deferments began.  Recently, the agency said that the telescope would fly into space no earlier than in 2020, in May.  Moreover, NASA has no guarantee that the US Congress will continue to allocate money for the project.  The budget has increased many times, now it is $ 8 billion - this is how much the government has allocated for the creation, testing and output of the telescope into space. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the team of "James Webb" began a series of troubles, which led to a delay in the launch of the system.  But the delay means additional costs, and this is precisely what NASA cannot afford, since the organization is unlikely to receive more than the allocated $ 8 billion.  The only option to complete the project successfully is to solve all the problems that have arisen and still send Webb to cold blackness.  The problem is that if problems arise, repair the telescope will not work - it will be located far from the Earth.

      The telescope team has only one chance for a successful launch of the system, this chance must be used 100%, no more opportunities will be presented.  "Now we have problems that need to be solved before we cross the finish line," a NASA representative said. <br><br>  Actually, all hardware systems are ready and assembled.  The telescope is not yet a whole, it is divided into two parts, which will be connected by experts before being sent to space.  One of two parts is a system of mirrors.  Each mirror was prepared separately, then tested, and then combined with others.  The second part of the telescope is a spacecraft and power plants, including a solar panel that protects the cameras of the system from the ingress of sunlight. <br><br>  Most of the problems happened on the approach to the finish line when NASA contractor Northrop Grumman began testing a telescope at its facility in California.  Now it became known about the additional problems of the telescope, although earlier only one was announced - the problematic valves in the engine system of the device, which are responsible for putting the system into orbit and for keeping the solar panel always in the correct position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c9/26e/619/0c926e619f52036dad45a070a66eda17.jpg"><br><br>  The shield at launch is folded in five layers.  In order for the telescope to work, the shield must be turned around.  NASA and Northrop Grumman drew up a plan to eliminate problem valves and replace them with working ones.  But it will take weeks, if not months, so the start of the telescope will have to be postponed. <br><br>  And the problem is that the agency spent about $ 7.3 billion of the $ 8 allocated by Congress.  In the summer, NASA will meet to prepare a new application for funds, as well as to explain to Washington the causes of the mistakes that led to the loss of several satellites.  While the telescope was doing well, the state paid him quite a lot of attention.  Now there are obvious problems, so that if the budget increases to $ 8 billion, Congress will have to approve the project again. <br><br>  Many scientists believe that this will happen, although NASA has doubts about this.  Perhaps quite fair, since Lamar Smith, a spokesman for the US government, said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement of problems with James Webb implies postponing the start of the telescope.  It also means that the budget allocated for the telescope leaves 8 billion. <br><br>  Anyway, the government has already announced that they will keep the promises made to taxpayers.  If 8 billion is spent, but the reaction is not followed or the telescope cannot work, the project will be recognized as unsuccessful, and the money will most likely cease to be allocated. <br><br>  Anyway, NASA hopes to speed up the testing process for both the system and its parts.  For this agency is constantly in touch with Northrop Grumman.  Employees of the latter are trying to solve the problem in order to save both face and funding.  In general, what will happen to the telescope and when it will be launched into space is not yet known. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374375/</a></p>
