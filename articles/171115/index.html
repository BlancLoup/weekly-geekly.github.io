The success of a business depends largely on the experience and knowledge of each team member, so we developed <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/business">Evernote Business</a> , a solution that allows Evernote to be optimized for corporate information sharing tasks and opens up employees with quick access to a common knowledge base. <br><br>  Since the announcement in December 2012, more than 3,000 companies and teams in the United States, Japan and other countries began using the product, and today we are pleased to announce the arrival of Evernote Business in Russia.

      <b><a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/business">Transfer to business class ¬ª</a></b> <br><br>  Evernote Business is based on a set of features that <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/premium/">Evernote Premium Subscriptions</a> can offer, and is complemented by a number of new features designed to meet the needs of small and medium businesses, as well as workgroups for large companies.  Now users will be able to add new information to their colleagues and quickly find out what other employees know about topics of interest without any delays and hindrances for disseminating information within the company. <br><br>  Read more about new features below. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Corporate Knowledge Base </h3><br>  Every day in the course of work we are faced with a large amount of information that needs to be remembered: schedules, notes from meetings, lists of tasks, studies, presentations and much more.  Evernote is convenient because you can save all the important information in it and instantly find it when you need it.  In order to provide business users with enough space for corporate data, we offer 2 gigabytes of monthly downloads to personal notebooks, which is twice as large as the premium subscribers.  The company also receives 2 gigabytes per month for each user, which are distributed among all business notebooks. <br><br><h3>  Business notebooks </h3><br>  Having connected to Evernote Business, users will be able to create business notebooks and place in them working documents, projects, studies and any other information on the work.  Each such notebook or note contained in it can be shared with colleagues by sharing several users or publishing a notebook in the business library where all company employees can view it. <br><br><h3>  Personal notebooks </h3><br>  Evernote Business users can also create personal notebooks.  They are inaccessible neither to other employees, nor to the administrator of the company and are controlled by the user.  If at the time of connecting to a business account the user already had an account in Evernote, and he did not want to create another one, all personal notes and notebooks he has will be visible only to him and will remain intact in case of disconnection from Evernote Business.  Personal and business notebooks can be distinguished visually.  Business notebooks belong to the company and are controlled by the administrator appointed by the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a97/d2e/190/a97d2e190b571c42cc3d7a497811c316.png"><br><br><h3>  Business library </h3><br>  If business notebooks are the first step towards increasing productivity, the second step is to use the information stored by individual employees for the benefit of the company as a whole.  A business library is a single platform where employees can publish their business notebooks, and administrators can place important corporate information.  As the company grows, such a knowledge base becomes a useful resource for both new and existing employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b09/676/f24/b09676f24d450ae775f80eb17214b750.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Exchange and search for information </h3><br>  Business notebooks and a library allow us to make corporate information accessible to each employee, but we went further and implemented several solutions that allow business users to constantly be aware of the knowledge of the whole team. <br><br>  <b>Improved sharing capabilities</b> <br>  Evernote Business allows employees to share important information not only with their team, department or the entire company, but also with users from outside (for example, customers).  Thanks to the flexible access settings, the company's information will be safe, and if an employee leaves the company, he will only have access to personal records, and his business notes will be saved in the corporate knowledge base. <br><br>  <b>Search</b> <br>  The easiest way to find the right information in a business account is to look at it in the business library.  Each new employee who connects to a business account can look at a set of recommended business notebooks - this will help to get into work from day one. <br><br>  In addition, each time a user searches for information in his personal account, Evernote Business offers relevant results from his collaborative business notebooks.  This is another convenient way to be aware of what others know about the subject. <br><br>  We also updated <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/webclipper/">Evernote Web Clipper</a> and <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/clearly/">Clearly</a> for Chrome so that members of a business account can search for information on the Internet (on Google, Bing, Yahoo! and other search engines) and immediately see similar results from their personal as well as from business -account <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/6f5/ce5/ff06f5ce557e1d9ad9b49654951038e2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Related Notes</b> <br>  A new feature related notes shows the relevant entries from the company's collective knowledge base, allowing you to pay attention to valuable information at the right time.  When viewing, searching or creating a new note, the user will see similar records from both his account and from the connected business notebooks, as well as from the company library.  Thus, he will be aware of all the information on the desired topic, which his colleagues have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/4d0/c6a/7454d0c6a61c9d95abbc5bdcac3f4bb6.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Administration and Cost </h3><br>  The cost of Evernote Business is 300 rubles per month per user. <br><br>  The central administration panel allows you to easily increase the number of workplaces, as well as view and control the access rights of the accounts of all employees.  You can pay for employees with a credit card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/499/794/4ab/4997944ab10e5ece5d223742d65b4670.jpg"><br><br>  Evernote Business support is implemented in Evernote for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android.  Related notes can already be viewed in the application for Mac, Evernote Clearly for Chrome and Firefox, as well as in Evernote Web Clipper for Chrome. <br><br>  More information about how to connect Evernote Business, you can get on <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/business">the Evernote Business website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171115/</a></p>
