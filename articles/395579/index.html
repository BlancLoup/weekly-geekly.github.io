Becoming the ‚Äúe-citizen‚Äù of Estonia, any foreigner receives a large number of opportunities to conduct business not only in this country, but throughout the world.  Among them - opening an account in an Estonian bank, registering a company, obtaining an electronic signature to verify your documents anywhere in the world.

      Registering a company on a public online service takes only a couple of hours (the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276072/">record is 18 minutes</a> ).  In order to fill out an application, you must upload your photo and briefly describe the reasons that encourage a person to request a new status.  After submitting the application, this electronic form is checked by the law enforcement authorities of Estonia.  If everything is good, the candidate is invited to meet with representatives of the consulate (the meeting can take place in any city in any country where there is an Estonian consulate).  And then, if the meeting passed without problems (as it usually happens), in a month the candidate for the ‚Äúe-citizen‚Äù receives his documents. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main document is an Estonian ID card with an electronic chip replacing the usual signature.  Now these cards <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276072/">have already received 10,000 people</a> .  And by 2025, the country hopes to increase the number of "electronic citizens" to 10 million. <br><br>  The authors of this program call Estonia ‚Äúcountry as a service‚Äù.  Estonia is now the first in the world to digitize government and government agencies.  And it attracts both entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens.  Of course, millions of people strive to get to such countries as the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.  These countries owe much to migrant workers.  The competition among these countries for skilled workers, researchers is quite large. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/251/a06/1ed/251a061edb16d8fd0ed579d08519d1bd.png" width="800"><br><br>  There are now 1.3 million citizens in Estonia.  The climate here is far from perfect: the country is located at the same latitude as Alaska.  And since Estonia is a member of the European Union, its citizens often go abroad in search of a better life.  As a result, the population is declining.  A few years ago, the government began to think about how in such conditions to ensure for themselves and their citizens, if not prosperity, then a dignified existence.  How do you attract the attention of a small country where there are almost no natural resources, and the demographic situation leaves much to be desired?  This path has been found.  This is a ‚Äúfigure.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  National Digital Infrastructure </h3><br>  25 years after independence, Estonia has developed the most advanced digital infrastructure in the world.  Signature - digital, pay tax via the Internet?  A couple of minutes, no longer required.  Online voting?  You are welcome.  No ballot boxes, booths in schools and other election details.  All you need is a computer or phone.  No, of course, you can personally vote, but many Estonians still prefer the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù. <br><br>  The first digital elections were held in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25AD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_(2007)">Estonia in March 2007</a> .  Then, only 3.4% of voters voted online.  Now this figure has increased many times.  To use the e-voting system, you must use your personal identification smart card.  Also need a digital signature and a card reader. <br><br>  The e-voting interface is simpler than paper bulletins with their small text.  The data entered by the voter in the online form is encrypted and sent to the voting server.  All this data is decrypted on the voting day at a certain time.  No " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_(%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">carousel</a> " and other tricks - every voice can be identified. <br><br>  Citizens of the country began issuing ID cards in 2002.  Getting them has become mandatory for every citizen.  The card allowed to confirm banking transactions and sign documents with a digital signature.  This type of verification of identity has become the standard throughout the European Union since 1999. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bca/e8d/f05/bcae8df053fa276c788fb55176e19ddd.jpg"><br>  <i>E-Citizen Card and Card Reader</i> <br><br>  With the introduction of such a system, Estonia was able to provide the necessary resources and opportunities not only to citizens living in the territory of the state, but also to representatives of diasporas.  As soon as the government was convinced of the effectiveness of such a model of work, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing ‚Äúe-citizenship‚Äù appeared. <br><br>  In order to involve all citizens of the state in the process of transition to the figure, the Estonian government is making significant efforts.  In particular, the level of computer literacy of the population is constantly increasing.  By the end of the 1990s, all Estonian schools had access to the Internet.  Estonian schools also teach programming.  The national eKool system stores all grades, homework, information on children's attendance.  Parents can view data on their child at any time. <br><br>  Trying to translate into digital and older generation.  So, in 2009, a program was implemented for pensioners - as part of this project, computer science classes were held for this category of the population, and PC purchases were also subsidized.  For two years, 40 thousand people took part in the program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63e/8a7/e64/63e8a7e644825648533fcbd7ee84b871.jpg"><br>  <i>Estonia seems very old-fashioned.</i>  <i>But this concerns only the architecture of historical centers, and not the principles of the functioning of the modern state.</i> <br><br>  Now about 99% of all public services are available online.  For example, through a single portal of public services you can get a driver's license, register the birth of a child, apply for social benefits.  In addition, 95% of tax returns in the country are also submitted online. <br><br><h3>  What does ‚Äúcountry as a service‚Äù mean? </h3><br>  With the advent of the Global Network, many of its users began to work in foreign companies, physically being in their native country.  Entrepreneurs have the opportunity to offer their services and products abroad. <br><br>  More and more people began to look for an opportunity to legally conduct business abroad, with the most simplified system for registering such a business and security guarantees.  Someone just wanted to get international status, and someone put obstacles put by the government of their own country. <br><br>  And Estonia decided to give everyone the opportunity to register their business with themselves.  Gradually, Estonia has become a digital environment that allows entrepreneurs to conduct their international business. <br><br><h3>  Where does ‚Äúe-citizen‚Äù have to pay taxes? </h3><br>  According to the rules of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), "taxes must be paid where the production facilities are located and the main income is created."  This means that an independent entrepreneur who has established a company in Estonia and lives in the USA, France or Singapore must pay taxes in this country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34a/5c5/1ca/34a5c51ca367a8aaf7021fcec6ce59c8.png" height="450" width="800"><br><br><h3>  What does Estonia get? </h3><br>  The more people and companies become ‚Äúe-citizens‚Äù and register their business in this country, the more clients appear in Estonian companies. <br><br>  When an ‚Äúe-citizen‚Äù goes through the process of registering his business, he will most likely have to contact Estonian companies for help (creating a bank account, signing a contract with a payment provider, working with accountants, lawyers and auditors. All this helps develop the economy of Estonia. <br><br>  It is also worth highlighting the fact that Estonia, in the process of implementing its program of creating a digital state infrastructure, does not seek help from international corporations and does not pay for licenses.  Instead, domestic specialists are working on the project - for example, Nortal. <br><br><h3>  "Electronic citizens" may be more than ordinary </h3><br>  ‚ÄúCountry as a service‚Äù is quite an attractive opportunity for everyone.  And this opportunity attracts more people and companies.  Now the Estonian government expects an avalanche-like growth in the number of applications for obtaining e-citizenship. <br><br>  The main thing for the country now is to provide reliable support for various types of businesses of its clients.  The emphasis is placed on supporting micro business and small business - these are the most vulnerable business entities in any country, which is why Estonia is making every effort to protect them. <br><br>  The government hopes that by 2025 there will be already 10 million "e-citizens".  This is ten times more than the current population of the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395579/</a></p>
