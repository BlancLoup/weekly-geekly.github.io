Their solution of the problem, argumentation, the formation of quantitative estimates, the processing of the latter by formal methods are called the method of expert assessments. </blockquote><br>  There are <b>two groups of expert assessments:</b> <br><ol><li>  Individual assessments are based on using the opinions of individual experts, independent of each other. </li><li>  Collective assessments are based on the use of collective expert opinion. </li></ol><br>  <i>Roughly speaking, the first group includes the evaluation of articles on the site, voting in polls, etc., when each expert makes a decision independently.</i>  <i>Selection of experts is done by means of karma.</i>  <i>It is the first group that prevails on the Internet 2 due to the possibility of reaching a larger number of experts.</i> <br><br>  <b>Methods for measuring objects</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Ranking</b> is the arrangement of objects in ascending or descending order of any inherent property.

Pair comparison can be carried out with a large number of objects, as well as in cases where the difference between objects is so insignificant that their ranking is almost impossible. <br>  When using the method, a matrix of the size n <sub>x</sub> n is often compiled, where n is the number of objects to be compared. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/a63/92d/797a6392dd54cca3f5ef303b1ae4340d.png"><br>  When comparing objects, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãfilled with elements a <sub>ij</sub> as follows (another filling scheme can be proposed): <br><ul><li>  2, if object i is preferable to object j (i&gt; j), </li><li>  1, if equality of objects is established (i = j), </li><li>  0 if object j is preferable to object i (i &lt;j). </li></ul><br>  <u>Direct assessment</u> .

In this case, they say that it is necessary to determine the weight of each factor.

Alternatively, read the consistency index.  Something is supposedly the number of contradictory closed chains of expert opinions (the first believes that A is better than B, the second that B is better than C, and the third that C is better than A) to the number of all such chains. <br><br>  Ratings are usually based on a probabilistic model, so you need to carefully consider the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir possible application. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  The article does not pretend to a complete multi-stage analysis of methods and estimation algorithms, only a superficial description of them.
