But in life there are moments when the mood does not have to kavaynosti: the code is not rushing, the bug is not caught, the algorithm works crookedly, the team leader inserted for the deadline.  And then you want to see something harsh, brutal, masculine.  Well, the world of anime is very diverse and can offer works for every taste. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what can be offered to those who proudly reject for themselves the possibility of watching the next series about <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580_%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD">fairy girls</a> or cute <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25C2%25AB%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25C2%25BB">fictional creatures with supernormal abilities</a> ? <br><br><h1>  Basilisk (Basilisk) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/395/5c3/8b0/3955c38b086f430cb10ea6da3365eb01.jpg"><br><br>  The series " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0)">Basilisk</a> " tells the story of the war of two clans of ninjas in ancient times.  An implacable enmity has been going on for many years, and the degree of mutual hatred soared to the skies when it came time to choose a new shogun from two candidates: the grandson of the head of the clan Koga and the granddaughter of the head of the clan Iga.  All anything, but the situation is complicated by the fact that the heirs of two warring families love each other.  And for 24 episodes, real drama unfolds before us, when two people are torn between love and devotion to their clan.  Where is the brutality, you ask?  I remind you: these are two ninja clans, and even yard animals are able to kill there.  They die there with enviable regularity and very cruel.  Until the very end, it is unclear which clan will triumph, the scale pan swings one way or the other.  In this case, fights are staged and shown very exciting.  Decent graphics (especially by the standards of 2003), a good portion of the mystical abilities of high-class murderers, bloodshed and dismemberment will delight notorious misanthropes and will not let everyone else get bored.

Ordinary peyzane, like ordinary infantry, is unable to cope with them and turn into a snack.  Therefore, the fight against the creatures is conducted by the medieval female special forces of the half-bloods - mestizos of people and em.  The squad is called "Claymore", because they fight with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">same name swords</a> , which are much larger than real claymores.  At first, the series may seem somewhat drawn out and tedious, but do not rush - literally in a few episodes, the story will start at a gallop.  This is a dark, but interesting story of the struggle with bloodthirsty and very dangerous creatures, their demons from the past, the history of combat brotherhood (or sisterhood) and the formation of warriors on the battlefield.  Blood here too poured a lot. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_9ZUV8BnDM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/760664_kait_devochka_ubiitsa/">Kite (Kite)</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0c/4a7/9e0/d0c4a79e024549d3ade17df162438ee4.jpg"><br><br>  Old (1998), but well-drawn full-length movie about a girl who was brainwashed and turned into a high-class assassin.  Four years after her parents were killed in front of her, she falls in love with her partner and becomes a victim of the betrayal of her patron, a sadistic cop.  The plot is grim, with a bunch of violence and - attention - adult scenes (in an uncensored version). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQcN9Xay9rM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, a couple of years ago, based on Kite in Hollywood shot the <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/789065_kait/">same film</a> . <br><br><h1>  Black Lagoon ( <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_774521_pirati_chernoi_laguni/">Black Lagoon</a> , <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_774521_pirati_chernoi_laguni/seasons_2/">Black Lagoon 2</a> and <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_774521_pirati_chernoi_laguni/seasons_3/">Black Lagoon 3</a> ) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/68c/ce8/24168cce8cd74b7c9fd6d8da2aef6dcf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/add/dce/08d/adddce08d23b41a1bf728ff27087eb00.jpg"><br><br>  Vigorous adventure series about the difficult everyday life of the team of modern mercenaries, soldiers of fortune.  The protagonist is a typical ‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù, by chance falling into the company of pirates-mercenaries.  I was lucky that they did not shoot me, the painfully harsh lady commanded this team.  But despite the bad "male" character, the lady looks like it should.  In the "Black Lagoon" you are waiting for a shootout, a lot of explosions, chases, assassins, and walking the main character around the headboard. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uyw9767xzO0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_794374_shkola_mertvetsov/">School of the Dead</a> (Gakuen mokushiroku) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/653/cbf/af8/653cbfaf83464be7b239406e505ba841.jpg"><br><br>  The fashion for zombies is not spared and anime.  The plot of the "School of the Dead" is simple: the epidemic of the disease, all turned into zombies, who attacked the school grounds and began to eat the kids.  A group of high school students trying to survive in the next apocalypse.  A lot of zombies, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D1%2583">panca</a> , nice rounds and blood. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAbr-FHHC0Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_788443_berserk/">Berserk</a> (Berserk) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f9/a4b/533/1f9a4b533a5446c9b20de0e127576c6d.jpg"><br><br>  Series in 1997 about the warrior Gats, who became almost the best swordsman.  Almost - because he was surpassed by the commander of the squad of mercenaries, where Guts then entered.  The sword of the main character is a couple of ironing boards, and the width is not much inferior.  His ‚Äúfield commander‚Äù is a very complicated person, he wears a mysterious magic amulet on his chest.  Moreover, his ambitions reach the stars, and he dreams of getting out of the mud not into princes, but into kings.  And Guts, with all his heart devoted to his commander, increasingly asks himself the question, what is he ready to go for his sake.  Separate intrigue is associated with rare encounters with a demon who has lived in the world for many years under different guises. <br><br>  In addition to the original work of the series, there are several full-lengths and a remake of the series with stylized computer graphics. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVPzv9qwKl0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_774376_demon_protiv_demonov/">Demon against demons</a> (Devil may cry) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5a/684/767/b5a6847679cf40a9919af245ed9f8c04.jpg"><br><br>  This anime series was filmed on the same-name console game.  This dark mystical thriller tells about the hard work of a certain Dante, who earns bread with caviar and hunts for demons.

A senior pupil finds a magical object, a notebook of death.  If you write in her the name of a person and the cause of his death, then soon he dies.  The lad turned the head around this opportunity, and he began to do justice to the right and the left.  But the power spoils, and the young man went too far.  Interpol, and in particular one of its employees, a genius analyst, became interested in strange deaths.  However, our schoolchild is also a genius, the best student of Japan.  Thus began the detective confrontation between two powerful minds: one tries to catch the criminal, the other resists in this way and tries to figure out in response who catches him in order to scribble a few words in the notebook. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qQ3McDcHi_0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Party of the Dead: Corpse Party: Tortured Souls </h1><br>  You in the pioneer camp called the dwarfs?  Do not know what a "pioneer camp"?  Hmm.  Well, at least caught a freebie at the institute?  This is what I mean: flirting with supernatural forces may not bring to good.  For example, in the 4-episode OVAshka ‚ÄúParty of the Dead‚Äù several schoolchildren decided to bond their friendship, for the sake of which they performed a ritual that opened the door to hell and threw them into another dimension, in which the restless souls of children killed in the old school wander. standing in this place.
