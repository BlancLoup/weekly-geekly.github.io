Industry Certification Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The Cisco Certification Program has been around for 26 years (was founded in 1993).  Many well-known engineering line of certifications CCNA, CCNP, CCIE.  This year, the program has also been supplemented with certifications for developers, namely DevNet Associate, DevNet Specialist, DevNet Professional, DevNet Expert. </p><br><p>  The DevNet program itself exists in the company for more than five years.  Details about the program Cisco DevNet has already been written on Habr√© in <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/cisco/blog/435330/">this article</a> . </p><br><p>  And so what we have about new certifications: </p><br><ol><li>  As for engineering certifications, there are four levels of DevNet certifications - Associate, Specialist, Professional, Expert. </li><li>  Engineering certifications are supplemented with modules in the direction of automation / programming. </li><li>  In certifications for developers there is a module related to the basics of network programmability. </li></ol><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/ee/zh/nweezhnd0av3dgzp_hmf6l9_na8.png"></p><br><p>  Let's look at each of the certifications, including the content and who is targeted. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3 id="cisco-devnet-associate">  Cisco DevNet Associate </h3><br><p>  To whom is targeted: <br>  For young professionals, namely, junior specialists in positions from programmers and SRE / DevOps to testers and automation engineers. </p><br><p>  The <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-associate/">DEVASC 200-901 exam</a> will include both application development fundamentals (git knowledge, python basics) and knowledge and skills using the Cisco equipment / solutions API. <br>  As previously written, certification also includes a module on network programming fundamentals (15% of the total). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/l0/y9/jul0y9bt_7941kxuw24_ushiovs.png"></p><br><h3 id="cisco-devnet-specialist">  Cisco DevNet Specialist </h3><br><p>  To whom is targeted: <br>  Experts with experience in one of the directions, from 3 to 5 years. <br>  Developers with practical experience in developing and supporting applications built on Cisco platforms. </p><br><p>  In this certification, you can choose one or more of the following specializations, for each specialization, an appropriate exam is provided. <br>  For programmers: </p><br><ul><li>  Core <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-professional/">(DEVCOR 300-901)</a> </li><li>  DevOps <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-devops/">(DEVOPS 300-910)</a> </li><li>  IoT <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-iot/">(DEVIOT 300-915)</a> </li><li>  Webex <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-webex/">(DEVWBX 300-920)</a> </li></ul><br><p>  For automation specialists: </p><br><ul><li>  Collaboration Automation <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-collab-auto/">(CLAUTO 300-835)</a> </li><li>  Data Center Automation <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-dc-auto/">(DCAUTO 300-635)</a> </li><li>  Enterprise Automation <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-en-auto/">(ENAUTO 300-435)</a> </li><li>  Security Automation <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-security/">(SAUTO 300-735)</a> </li><li>  Service Provider Automation <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-sp-auto/">(SPAUTO 300-535)</a> </li></ul><br><p>  For Core specializations, DevOps will be modules for testing knowledge on topics CI / CD, Docker, principles of "12-factor app", OWASP threats. </p><br><p>  The Webex specialization is related to Cisco Webex devices and solutions.
