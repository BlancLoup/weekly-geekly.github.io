Therefore, today we will not claim to have invented 10G, turned on a Wi-Fi access point for king penguins from Tierra del Fuego, or opened a downshifting "department" in India.  Today you are waiting for stories, which are difficult to believe in reality, but each of them is not a fiction. <br><br>  There are many unusual professions in the world, some of which may seem very fun.  What is worth only one <a href="http://www.1tv.ru/news/other/84756">penguin inverter</a> !  However, in the high-tech environment and high-speed data transmission channels, something really funny is rare.  What could be further from humor than front-end development?  Nevertheless, even an indirect attitude to the Internet to a large extent contributes to the emergence of funny precedents.  We describe how access to the network changes the profession of ordinary people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Streamers and video bloggers </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/673/0b0/7906730b0fbd46819be1134db1d1f981.jpg">

      Practically, the ‚Äústandard‚Äù of new-fashioned ‚Äúprofessions‚Äù has become young people playing 24 hours a day, some very successfully monetize their skills.  Combo-option occurs when a pretty girl leads the stream for DotA or minecraft, attracting even more students to view.  However, neither streaming nor video blogging now is particularly surprising anyone, let alone five or seven years ago. <br>  But the concierge - it would seem an ordinary profession.  It was as long as someone did not guess to connect it with video and blogs.  In the Puerto rican hotel, they decided to make an interesting hybrid - the YouTube concierge, whose duties include assistance with preparing videos on YouTube and downloading videos of the guests to the channel.  The concierge records the guest‚Äôs video on its own camera, and then professionally prepares the video with an introduction and conclusion.  This is probably not the only expansion of standard concierge services. <br><br>  In addition to video blogs, people watch streams, because they are always interested in something that they don‚Äôt have enough time in real life.  The more attention is drawn to the videos, which feature exotic terrain.  At least once a year there is another announcement about the ‚Äúdream job‚Äù in a very, very remote and warm region.  Usually it is a tropical island with a white beach, fresh fruit and turquoise water.  The lucky man needs only to sit in this heavenly place, watch the migration of animals, drink coconut milk and write notes to the blog. <br><br>  However, Ben Southall, who really got the ‚Äúbest job in the world‚Äù on a tropical island some time ago, speaks of it like this: ‚ÄúShe should have been called the most fussy.  What I do is radically different from what everyone originally imagined: a hammock, a beach, and doing nothing other than weekly blog entries. ‚Äù  He notes that he lost his usual daily routine.  The superintendent of the island spends all the time traveling, and he has to write to the blog at night.  As a result, the traveler blogger rests only when he does not go online.  ‚ÄúI do not write on Twitter and blog when I leave for a vacation,‚Äù <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17690978">he admits</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0d/6cd/2d9/d0d6cd2d909e46788be0ff2b57d8c96a.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://vmireinteresnogo.com/puteshestviya/nuzhen-storozh-zamka-na-shotlandskom-ostrove.html">A source</a> <br><br>  In Scotland, a similar vacancy appeared several years ago - the watchman of the castle, who was ready to isolate himself from live communication for eight months for eight months, looked for only the Internet, looking for a castle.  You can get to the facility only by boat, and having previously calculated the stocks of food and water for the entire stay.  There is no Starbucks.  Not even french fries.  And what if toilet paper ends a month ahead of time? <br><br><h3>  Beyond the Arctic Circle </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/747/3a0/ba7/7473a0ba7d204d5d8e2c4c839b6ada55.jpg"><br><br>  Salaries of meteorologists of the north are relatively low, conditions are harsh, life is solitary.  Most of the time, there is no cellular connection or Internet.  However, there are also happy exceptions - there is a permanent connection at the White Nose polar hydrometeorological station located on the coast of the Barents Sea at the entrance to the Yugorsky Shar strait.  According to the station staff, life with the Internet is much more fun, because before that there was no entertainment, except for old magazines, books and a few hackneyed videotapes. <br><br>  After the harsh subarctic territory it will be difficult to surprise with something, but still continue.  Now we are transferred to another hard-to-reach region - to the slope of the highest peak of the world, where there is always a chance to become a hero, die, get frostbite and go online.  Yes, there are several network access points on Everest.  The last of them is located at an altitude of about 5300 meters, from where climbers begin the final stage of climbing.  There are even 4G!  In 2010, nine base stations of the cellular network began to function on Everest, the ‚Äúlowest‚Äù of them - at an altitude of 2870 meters above sea level.  Four stations operate on solar panels and are equipped with a spare battery capable of ensuring uninterrupted operation of the station for up to three days, which is very important in conditions of changeable high-altitude weather.  In 2013, equipment was installed for LTE-TDD-connection, ensuring uninterrupted operation for 200 climbers-bloggers.  In general, now schoolchildren who get tired of killing virtual monsters can prepare to conquer peaks without fearing to part with a streamer career. <br><br><h3>  Registrar Country </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a85/5fc/c25/a855fcc25dee4f77a6d230c957599bf8.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://ua3rf.ru/e6st-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2583%25D1%258D/">A source</a> <br><br>  You can be a representative of any profession and still go online every day, no matter where you are.  True, this fantastic opportunity exists only in residents of one country.  Niue is an island country, the Internet in which is connected to the entire population (1,400 people), and wireless networks even cover coastal waters.  Free and free access to wireless Internet is the main and, probably, the only attraction of the island.  Thank you for this gift should be concise domain zone of the state "NU", for registration in which the island <a href="http://internetniue.nu/">receives a</a> profit from tens of thousands of companies from around the world. <br><br><h3>  Space booting </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/a01/a4b/ddfa01a4b492408f9a5a71c3eb414814.jpg"><br>  <i>Photograph by Scott Kelly</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53d/e3d/e5f/53de3de5fe2a4b42b20a1ea90b0cb425.jpg"><br>  <i>The rise of the milky way.</i>  <i>Photo by Oleg Artemyev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2a/6f7/3ae/b2a6f73aec2f437692697c1c53a8a338.jpg"><br>  <i>Typhoon.</i>  <i>Photo by Oleg Artemyev</i> <br><br>  There is no place farther from the Internet than space, but even there humanity will not leave without favorite pages and e-mail.  Internet on the ISS is.  Through a long load, through the onboard server and repeater, through satellite radio commands and the mission control center (MCC).  Mail works through mail at NASA, where it is carefully checked, passes the firewall in the MCC, and only then goes to the web.  To speed up the loading, the astronauts inform the operators in advance which pages they are going to visit.  Pages are usually loaded at night when the crew is asleep and the communication channels are not loaded.  And now the most interesting thing: we answer the question of why we need the Internet in space.  Cosmonaut Sergei Volkov ( <a href="https://vk.com/iss_volkov">https://vk.com/iss_volkov</a> ) regularly publishes interesting photographs, including rare collections of photographs of a spacewalk.  Some - right from the ISS!  So, the American astronaut Scot Kelly ( <a href="https://twitter.com/stationCDRkelly">https://twitter.com/stationCDRkelly</a> ) in his microblog post hundreds of interesting pictures.  And our compatriot Oleg Artemyev, who has been in near-earth orbit for more than 169 days, sometimes runs a popular <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olegmks/">Instagram blog</a> right from space. <br><br>  Forester network?  Most of them have no Internet, but in the middle of the forests of Springhurth (Germany) there is an unusual one and a half ton boulder, inside of which there is a Wi-Fi access point powered by a thermoelectric generator.  A generator converts heat directly into electricity.  It is only necessary to make a fire near the boulder.  Once the router receives power, you can connect to the network.  And it also has a built-in survival guide, it may be useful in this remote part of the forest, which is not so easy to get to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da9/0fc/c63/da90fcc63c1c47409e53bd882fab3776.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://cameralabs.org/4146-zhan-fransua-leroj-jean-fran-ois-leroy-i-festival-fotozhurnalistiki-visa-pour-l-image">A source</a> <br><br>  And we are completing our review with a final farewell with irony and a transition to serious reality.  Let's talk about lifeguards.  These are not only professionals with many years of experience.  Sometimes even ordinary geek developers can really save lives by establishing the smooth operation of mobile access in disaster areas.  On the one hand, everything is clear - the Internet is needed for communication.  But is not it easier to use radios in extreme conditions?  Yes, easier.  But access to the Internet is necessary for another.  Fast 4G communication is needed to build real-time rescue maps.  For example, making changes to the project <a href="http://openstreetmap.ru/">Open Street Map</a> .  So after the devastating earthquake in Haiti, there were at least 400 edits of OpenStreetMap - outlining Yahoo!  and careful collection of information from old CIA maps.  We also used data from GeoEye images taken after the earthquake, which allowed us to mark the collapsed buildings on the map.  Every day on the OSM map there were new marks, debris, passages, camps of the victims - that is, all the relevant information. <br><br>  As you can see, April 1 can be an excellent occasion not only for practical jokes and laughter, but also for thinking about what interesting projects are born at the junction of various professions and technologies.  At first glance, absurd combinations turn ordinary work into socially significant projects or simply make our life a bit more interesting.  Do not forget to get knowledge from different areas, because it may be that someday you will create an inconceivable and completely new profession :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280676/</a></p>
