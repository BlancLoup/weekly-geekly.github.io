Each company is trying to something different from the other.  For example, the company Gigabyte <a href="http://www.aif.ru/techno/news/136762">released</a> the lightest ultrabook at the time of publication, <br>  Asus has released the second generation ZenBook with a matte FullHD display, while Acer has released the <strong>Aspire M3</strong> ultrabook with a drive and a 15.6-inch display. <br>  Here on him, such an overgrown, we will see. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1c/4cf/abc/d1c4cfabce670b04130cf8d640bfbea3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a nice, thin, but wide box of white color lies: a laptop, a charger, a little waste paper. <br>  <strong>The charger is</strong> small (93 * 48 * 25 mm). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4e/2fb/5ae/c4e2fb5ae2e20724674f1a2a5761688f.jpg"><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br>  Width: 376 mm <br>  Height / Thickness: 20 mm <br>  Length / Depth: 253 mm <br>  Weight: 2.2 kg <br><br>  Intel H77 chipset <br>  Intel Core i7 2637M processor <br>  NVidia GeForce GT640M Graphics Card <br>  Built-in video memory 1024 MB <br>  Processor frequency 1.7 GHz <br>  The amount of RAM 6144 MB <br>  DDR3 memory type <br>  15.6 "diagonal <br>  Resolution 1366x768 <br><br>  Processor Number i7-2637M <br>  Number of cores 2 <br>  Number of threads 4 <br>  Core frequency 1.7 GHz <br>  Turbo frequency 2.8 GHz

    <h2>  Outside and inside </h2><br><br>  The laptop is a <strong>matte</strong> black case.  The lid is made of <strong>aluminum-magnesium alloy</strong> , the case itself is a good plastic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/508/9a2/d89/5089a2d89418b6f36fbce57071a222a1.jpg"><br>  The lid is thin enough to declare ‚Äú <strong>ultrabooking</strong> ‚Äù.  When opening and closing almost does not curl.  To the touch a very pleasant roughness.  Lets not take care of the prints on it.  Wipe it with a soft cloth - and it is like new.  I do not know about scratches - I did not dare to check. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/370/ae8/a7b/370ae8a7b059132d922d2423a2bfdd7c.jpg"><br>  The laptop screen has a resolution of <strong>1366 by 768 pixels</strong> , with a matrix of 15.6 inches.  TN - with normal viewing angles, LED-backlit.  Due to the resolution, the graininess is noticeable.  In my opinion, it would be possible to make FullHD. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4d/40a/b82/c4d40ab8204faca0a0bb172c9905b2ed.jpg"><br>  The bottom cover is a monolith, with a flap ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/034/362/09c/03436209ca0fdf42951e2a5bb1436831.jpg"><br>  ... which hides the 500 GB hard drive from HITACHI, wi-fi + bluetooth from Anatel, <strong>20 GB SSD</strong> from PHISON (in the picture is outlined in green).  This same SSD contains a hibernation file, as well as a swap file, and other "old" information from RAM.  and allows the laptop to get out of sleep in <strong>1.5 seconds</strong> .  If the SSD volume were bigger, the system would be installed on it and the laptop would be loaded from the ‚Äúcold‚Äù not in 37, but in 15 seconds. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/999/c1d/e27/999c1de270f4c951ab9a461aae700e8f.jpg"><br>  In addition to air intake slots and rubber feet, there are also two speakers at the bottom.  The sound of them is very decent.  Maybe the inscription ‚Äú <strong>Dolby home theater |</strong>  <strong>Professionally tuned</strong> ‚Äù.  Listening to music, movies, playing is a pleasure.  Even at full volume, there are almost no wheezing, and the bass is deep. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc9/88e/e2d/dc988ee2dddbce86b6e76ae4d2b07545.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a3/c56/276/4a3c56276e9869002cbecdc8267c47a4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9e/af4/f72/c9eaf4f727d97ad86a178bc23c295a38.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdc/72b/1b1/cdc72b1b111635e4678367f1ba17ae4b.jpg"><br>  On the right side there is only a <strong>Kensington</strong> lock. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/755/7b4/522/7557b45229e4c7d341a66436aac65456.jpg"><br>  On the left side are located: a card reader for SD-MMC and <strong>a DVD burner</strong> (due to which the thickness of the laptop has increased to 20.3 mm). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a7/b67/6ba/0a7b676ba8edb5beb8bdf55daebc0e30.jpg"><br>  The front face is almost empty, it is located on ... <strong>the power button</strong> !  Well, indicators of work and charging. <br>  The power button has a blue backlight, the indicators are either blue or orange, depending on the situation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d50/38e/20d/d5038e20d3dd89771a8d9d35d317579a.jpg"><br>  Back edge - the concentration of all connectors.  From left to right: an air vent (a very good solution to blow back and not into the arm);  headset jack, microphone or speakers;  two usb 2.0 connectors;  One <strong>USB 3.0 connector,</strong> which, by the way, also works for charging devices when the notebook is powered off;  HDMI connector, gigabit network port rj-45;  charger connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db3/5c2/90f/db35c290f0bc3b10cd6bdff1b9a0d4a0.jpg"><br>  Open the lid, which opens at an angle of <strong>155 degrees</strong> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c1/fb8/d11/8c1fb8d115abcc427a0dddb28c2c2fc1.jpg"><br>  Keyboard and touchpad below, 15.6-inch display with a webcam - on top. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f78/aac/b1a/f78aacb1a1b2737622cb6b52f9fc3944.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f0/0d0/aa4/2f00d0aa450e9634fa33357066c51d30.jpg"><br>  I have already mentioned the display - the TN matrix, 1366 * 768, the viewing angles are normal, the webcam is an HD camera.  Noise if you are not sitting under the lamp.  Good quality video communication. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d21/1f8/691/d211f86919a5dbd4c35cd724b7906fb2.jpg"><br>  Keyboard - islet type ( <strong>chiklet-</strong> keyboard). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25a/3b0/625/25a3b0625a4e2d1055ec0cb0d2af95c9.jpg"><br>  Arrows - small, but comfortable.  Enter - trimmed, wide.  The upper part is a slash (and backslash).  Numeric keypad - in full.  Conveniently.  The keyboard does not bend at all (a frequent illness of keyboards of this type). <br>  Figures: button <strong>15 * 15 mm</strong> , space - <strong>91 * 15 mm</strong> , arrows <strong>7 * 15 mm</strong> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/963/6f1/ec9/9636f1ec9cb72d0153e58f5050cb4e22.jpg"><br>  The large (107 * 78 mm) touchpad supports multitouch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce8/ebf/d81/ce8ebfd81ab51defee4c7e9a6973ec00.jpg"><br>  The click works on almost the entire area.  The right button is in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits theoretical location.  However, I caught an unpleasant glitch.  At the same time, two buttons do not work.  Therefore, it was inconvenient to play.  But with a mouse - it is somehow more correct. <br>  The thickness of the case in the thickest place, as I have already noticed - <strong>20.3 mm</strong> .  For a laptop with a drive - in my opinion - a record. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a47/7ea/2ba/a477ea2ba2259d6798ffdbd9693f0dba.jpg"><br>  Drive unit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e97/246/7de/e972467dee3f5b996557cc31c2a0720d.jpg"><br><h2>  Numbers </h2><br><br>  As you have probably noticed, the filling of the laptop is good. <br>  Core i7 2637M processor, nVidia 640M graphics card. <br>  According to Windows 7, these numbers are converted to the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f56/141/d43/f56141d4315d2f76a22aa1ce3935c1a8.png"><br>  What Windows Aero doesn't like - never understood. <br>  <i>It prompted that this measurement is made on the built-in video (Intel HD3000).</i> <br>  But for the test, I played <strong>Crysis 2 at maximum settings</strong> (with the native resolution of the laptop) without brakes.  Witcher 2 - braked as usual.  The rest of the games (Batman: Arkham City, Assassin's Creed: Relevation, World of tanks, Minecraft, WoW, etc) flew. <br>  At the same time, the laptop was barely heated, just buzzing with a cooler.  The cooler is not the quietest, but you don‚Äôt notice it at work. <br><br>  Synthetic tests gave the following numbers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/231/fd5/f0b/231fd5f0b13221f3761ba00848ef44e6.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da6/9f8/3e6/da69f83e6823c44aab913c7c1286e34f.png"><br>  For those to whom these numbers mean nothing I will inform those that are understandable to everyone. <br>  When loaded in 100%, full backlight, running wi-fi and bluetooth (well, that is, squeezed out all the juice, rendered graphics, played), the laptop pulled out <strong>2 hours and 47 minutes</strong> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/978/bf5/494/978bf549436263713229d14af68d8d51.png"><br>  When viewing FullHD ‚ÄúDark Knight‚Äù on full backlight, full volume, but without wi-fi pulled <strong>3 hours 17 minutes</strong> (the whole ‚ÄúGreen Mile‚Äù, one and a half times <br>  ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù, two times ‚ÄúTristan and Isolde‚Äù, well, or 4.65 episodes of ‚ÄúDoctor House‚Äù). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c3/078/b05/9c3078b05cd41f10374fe5eb1f480ac3.png"><br>  The manufacturer claims 8 hours.  We get them as follows: turn off the brightness to the minimum, turn off wi-fi, bluetooth, without load.  that is, we read books.  <strong>8 hours 3 minutes.</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7f/ab7/092/d7fab7092f02a766e2dfb42850b7e202.png"><br>  Tests for measuring the hard disk: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a8/eb2/220/8a8eb222052305294d2db79d9d7da676.png"><br>  If the system partition was on the SSD - it would be faster. <br><br>  In general - the performance is enough to play in isolation from the outlet.  And this is not an empty sound.  <strong>Almost three hours can be hacked in Crysis 2 at maximum settings.</strong>  Although, to tell the truth, then the laptop will go into power saving mode and there may be lags.  But after all, we can always donate in half an hour for the sake of good performance (forcefully turn on the graphics from nVidia). <br><br>  The chipset is a modern Intel H77. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/710/94e/76b/71094e76be504381f33db0857ef81caa.jpg"><br>  RAM can be increased to 8 GB.  Hard disk - no limits.  Well, more than anything you can not reach. <br><br><h2>  Summarize </h2><br>  <strong>disadvantages:</strong> low display resolution, average viewing angles, all ports in one place <br>  <strong>merits:</strong> full keyboard, good case materials, huge touchpad, good sound, powerful configuration, almost no noise and does not heat up, long working time <br><br>  Ultimately, we have an awesome laptop.  Anyone who constantly needs with a 15 inch laptop, but at the same time powerful and compact - take it!  And who knows - suddenly, on duty (or friendship), you still need a drive? <br><br>  Oh yes, the issue price on <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> : Average price: 36,215 rubles.  (34 438 ... 39 574 rub.) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145382/</a></p>
