Cadence will present an hourly report with the program at the end of this post. <br><br>  Registration <a href="http://edunano.ru/doc/6335690702352234538">on the site</a> (UPD: apparently, the initial registration is overfilled. But the Rosan officials said that if the first hall is full, they will allocate a larger room. Write an email <a href="http://Yulia.Osaulets%40rusnano.com/">to the post office</a> ).

      * Secondly, four leading Russian chip design companies joined the seminars: NIIMA Progress JSC, BAIKAL ELECTRONICS JSC, LABSISTEMS LLC and ELTC JSC.  Each of them will make a public presentation with information that you, under other circumstances, usually cannot get without NDA. <br><br>  * Third, in addition to the official program of seminars in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev, we decided to organize informal meetings for those interested in a walk first in Moscow on this Sunday, October 30th.  You can show Charles Danchek Moscow (he is the first time in Russia) and ask about chip design. <br><br>  We are thinking of expanding such activities in the Novosibirsk-Tomsk region in the following year, in connection with which, here is a welcome video with a girl from the Novosibirsk Academgorodok: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8scZxqSihmU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Explanation: RUSNANO and MISiS organize a Nanometer ASIC seminar in Moscow, but in St. Petersburg such a seminar is organized by ITMO University, and in Kiev - KPI and KNU, Lamp's laboratory of KPI and student workspace ‚ÄúBelka‚Äù KPI. <br><br>  Details about the meeting and seminars - under the cut: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The format of the informal meeting will be the same as the format of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264234/">last year‚Äôs meeting</a> (which really was without Charles Danchek).  We meet at 12 noon on Sunday, October 30, the Smolenskaya metro exit of the blue metro line (we adopted the tradition of the meeting point from MEPI-Schnick).  After that, we go to dinner at 3 pm in Jean-Jacques on Nikitsky Boulevard to reposition Jean-Jacques from the meeting place of creative humanities to the meeting place of the harsh engineers of the microelectronic industry. <br><br>  If you are late, call me (Yuri Panchul) at +7 925 022 5427 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acd/646/b61/acd646b618df7d3fd9cd71ff1451294d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Information about the seminar "Specialized Nano-Level Integrated Circuits"</b> <br><br>  The workshop introduces students to the phased development of special-purpose integrated circuits (hereinafter - ASIC) using nanoscale technologies (32 nm and below). <br><br>  Information about the lecturer: Charles Danchek (Charles Dancak) <br><br>  International expert, professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz in Silicon Valley, engineer of the executive office of Synopsys for 10 years. <br><br>  Received MSEE at the University of Wisconsin (Madison), as well as a master's degree in solid state physics at the Polytechnic Institute in New York (Brooklyn).  He taught in eight countries.
