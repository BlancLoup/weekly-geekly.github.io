  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea: Startup Exchange or Nasdak for Small</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm discovering America with this idea.  I am sure that such thoughts came to many people and that because of their obviousness, there have already been attempts to implement such a project.  However, I would be interested to share my vision of the organization of such a stock exchange and to hear the views of our esteemed community. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not wanting to be considered ignorant, I hurried to do a little research on this topic in Yandex.  In the Russian segment of the network, a considerable number of sites built on the principle of "demand / supply" were found.  On the first line of Yandex, the site <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/">www.napartner.ru was</a> highlighted.  But nevertheless, the Ukrainian site <a href="http://o2invest.com/">o2invest.com</a> was ideologically <a href="http://o2invest.com/">closest</a> . <br><br><h4>  The essence of the idea </h4><br>  The essence of the idea is to organize a stock exchange for collective investment in startups.  Yes, it all looks like O2, but I would emphasize the following key features. <br><br><ul><li>  Jurisdiction: Russian Federation.  Well aware of the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of work in our country and knowing about calm and reliable alternatives with golden beaches, I would still like to reduce transaction costs.  Offshore use imposes its limitations. </li><li>  Legal status: joint stock companies.  No conditional agreements, rating systems and accumulated karma will protect better than official paper.  As the Chinese saying goes, ‚Äúpale ink is better than very good memory.‚Äù </li><li>  Process: formalization and regulation.  The result can only lead a well thought-out step by step plan.  In the creative process, the regulation is disastrous.  In the matter of money, transparency and predictability decide. </li><li>  Divide et impera.  The project implementation process should be cleared of financial and legal issues.  100% of the time on the project - the most important task of the exchange. </li></ul>

    <h4>  Some moments </h4><br>  Who will benefit from this service?  For people with insufficient funds to invest in a large-scale project.  For projects whose potential may be underestimated by ‚Äúbig‚Äù investors. <br><br>  This exchange can be closed or half-closed in order to restrict access to it to fraudsters and network marketing enthusiasts. <br><br>  An important question: how will such a large enterprise be managed?  Here I want to voice another key idea.  The exchange should not be private, in order to exclude a conflict of interest.  The ideal option: a consortium of several large IT market players, a collegial management system, maximum openness in decision making. <br><br><h4>  Questions </h4><br><br>  All of the above is a brief confusion of ideas about such a stock exchange.  I do not claim for originality and for authorship.  But I hope for a discussion. <br><br><h4>  First postscript </h4><br><br>  After some comments, the time for the first update has come. <br>  In the comments below are links to similar, allegedly, projects.  But the essence of the exchange about which I wrote was to provide co-financing services for the project, to transfer it to the legal plane in accordance with the laws of the Russian Federation (in particular, the Federal Law "On the Securities Market").  Reliable and time-tested tool - this is corporatization.  Projects like indx.ru do not conduct their own depositories, but provide services for the virtual purchase of well-known tools of other exchanges. <br><br>  In addition, an important point - is the economic status of the exchange.  It should not be concentrated in the same hands, it should be a collective project, the purpose of which is to give more good, useful and profitable projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126893/</a></p>
