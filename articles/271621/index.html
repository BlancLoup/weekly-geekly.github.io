      And another boy was kidnapped by aliens, but he also knew how to program and was able to reflash the spaceship to listen only to him, and flew back to the earth, and brought the aliens with him to the experiments.  And the president himself handed him a medal, and a house by the sea, and a bicycle. <br><br>  And, one time, one girl sat in the park with a book on programming, and the most beautiful boy in the world passed by, and when he saw what she was reading, he immediately confessed her love, and they lived happily ever after, and programmed all the time. <br><br>  And one fat boy decided to write a game and got so carried away that he forgot to eat all the time, and very much lost weight while he wrote, and then this game was sold, and he became a millionaire and a playboy. <br><br>  There was also a case when an ugly girl learned programming best of all and became the director of a huge corporation, and all the boys ran after her, because there are many beautiful women and it is difficult to find smart ones. <br><br>  And one hooligan and Losers decided to study programming just out of boredom, and he suddenly had a talent for it, and he immediately received a bunch of awards, and bought a car, and went to study at the best institute.  And all his hooligan friends continued to drink beer in the yard and did not achieve anything in life. <br><br>  And the other boy was so smart <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  that he had no one to talk to, because everything compared to him seemed stupid, and they even wanted to erect a monument, and make the president, but he refused, because he was carrying out an interesting project, and his terms were on fire.  And then he met that ugly girl who became the director, and they immediately understood each other and talked all night long and mostly about programming. <br><br>  Or there was a case.  One boy was kicked out by his wife, but he didn‚Äôt drink himself as she expected, but he learned how to programmer and get rich and bought a new apartment.  And every time he passed his wife‚Äôs house, he laughed out loud. <br><br>  And someone else looked at this cartoon and also decided to become a programmer, even though the aliens did not kidnap him, but he always had an interesting job for which they paid a lot of money. <br><br>  And in general, everything in the future has become very zashib. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1jSFCRIFgU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhjQlS0ajDFc9OcSKaR2H22tj0g2w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  And then there are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/271495/">testers</a> , they are also great, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/271495/">saving the world from disasters</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271621/</a></p>
