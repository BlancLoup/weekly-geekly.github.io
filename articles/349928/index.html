Like Samuel Hulick, they look at the problem more broadly than just a few training messages - it is important to lead the client through the entire life cycle (they are focused on a paid subscription). <br><br> <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/c-a-r-e-simple-framework-user-onboarding/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/ft/pb/uyftpbxhr2xeusguh6alg0flcyq.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://medium.com/ge-design/the-ux-designers-copy-tool-kit-5b7ca0ef41ec">The UX Designer's Copy Toolkit</a> </h3><br>  Tips for creating generic interface texts from Matt Jones from GE. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/design-like-a-teacher">Design Like a Teacher</a> </h3><br>  Aimee Gonzalez-Cameron shows what the designer should do in a seemingly impasse - users have to partially work in the interface of the partner product, which cannot be changed, and he himself is not so hot.  She focused on user expectations before they go to a third-party interface, and it helped greatly increase loyalty. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://measuringu.com/flower-ux/">The User Experience of Flower Websites</a> </h3><br>  Jeff Sauro has conducted comparative testing of several US flower delivery sites.  There are also NPS values ‚Äã‚Äã(very low, by the way). <br><br>  * average NPS <b>-2%</b> <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/comprehensive-guide-to-mobile-app-design/">A Comprehensive Guide To Mobile App Design</a> </h3><br>  Detailed memo on the design of mobile applications from Nikolai Babich. <br><br><h3>  Mailing Lists </h3><br><ul><li>  Matt Helbig, curator of the Really Good Emails collection, shows <a href="https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/what-makes-a-really-good-email-1aa835e5f3a6">how they choose high-quality emails using the example of a few good letters.</a> </li></ul><br><h3>  Baymard Institute Studies </h3><br><ul><li>  Christian Holst from Baymard Institute gives online shopping advice on the right moment in the process of placing an order, <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/delayed-account-creation">when you should ask the user to register.</a> </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Design systems and guidelines </h2><br><h3>  <a href="http://bem.design/">BEM Design</a> </h3><br>  Yandex has launched a set of prototyping tools and themes for BEM.  It turned out a good template for a quick start of your design system - you can redefine styles for your tasks (this was how Studio Manufactory and the first version of Alfa-Bank‚Äôs platform did).  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yamoney/blog/341028/">An article by Mikhail Koloskov about the approach as a whole</a> and a <a href="https://wsd.events/2018/02/03/pres/bem-design.pdf">presentation to the launch</a> .  BEM is generally one of the most respected domestic developments in the international community - a huge number of people at the last conference on design systems Clarity warmly recalled it.  It will be great if this results in ‚Äúour Bootstrap‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="http://bem.design/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/mz/w8/cemzw83gh1kpsescaqxn-x8rqii.png"></a> <br><br>  Such initiatives help to change the minds of designers, many of whom still understand the design system as a template in Sketch or another design tool, rather than a technological solution on the components in the code into which the design is sewn.  <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system/">Brad Frost is also tired of this</a> .  This is the thinking of the middle of the last century, when this word was understood as the system of visual identification of the brand, to which a beautiful printed book went (they were actively republished in recent years).  But then it was about the physical products and objects that are on the shelf in the store (or the chain store itself), and we are working with digital products, where the layout does not guarantee anything and changes many times before launching to users.  So you have to work with the main material of this environment - the code. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://jvetrau.com/digest-2018-jan/">last issue</a> , a bridge between the two worlds (components in the code and design tools) was mentioned, which will be one of the main themes of the year.  So, Mark Dalgleish describes in detail <a href="https://medium.com/seek-blog/sketching-in-the-browser-33a7b7aa0526">how SEEK linked components to React and templates in Sketch</a> (they are assembled from a live guideline).  Watch out for such things carefully and try it yourself - it‚Äôs easier to implement it than it seems. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="933634632444080129"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Well, just a few fresh stories about the creation of design systems: <br><br><ul><li>  Marcin Treder describes the <a href="https://medium.com/%40marcintreder/the-minimum-viable-design-system-75ca1806848a">6-day sprint on the formalization of the design system</a> , which they used to organize the UX Pin interface.

A good indicator of the maturity of the market, where designers six years ago humbly thought that they would always have to be content with Photoshop - a tatter from the upper arm, not sharpened by interfaces.

A sensible model of its definition from positioning to specific values ‚Äã‚Äãis described, as well as a step-by-step evolution of the product itself - naturally, through the company's traditional experiments.  It is unlikely that this is something strongly new for specialists on the topic, but the combination of the brand with the interface and digital branding in general is one of the most important topics of recent years, when more and more Internet companies are becoming mature as a business and are trying to work with the user at all levels .

This is the most valuable material that shows how advanced the approach was at that time - iterative work, emphasis on usability testing and many other methods and practices which seem mundane now, but were used by single companies 25 years ago.  It is very interesting to read about how, for example, it was difficult to accustom people to the now double click of the mouse.  Windows 95 is one of the most important interfaces in history that made such a complex thing as a computer accessible to the mainstream user, including through the mission ‚Äúcomputer to every home‚Äù.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/348728/">Translation</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://socket3.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/designing-windows-95s-user-interface/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g2/ek/k8/g2ekk8ig37p5oevw72hup1uzrq4.gif"></a> <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://bangbangeducation.ru/course/100-years-of-design/">Free online course on world design history from the best Russian designers</a> </h3><br>  Bang!
