The topic was in demand, and I decided to write about my methods of dealing with the problem ‚ÄúI can not wake up‚Äù. <br><br>  I think the problem itself should not be described: most people know how difficult it is to wake up in the morning, and what unpleasant feelings arise when one thinks that you need to leave a warm bed, which is so nice and calm ... But you need to get up somehow, otherwise Problems.  Personally, I was very hard to get up in the morning.  But I had to force myself, because of what the rest of the day the mood was in the red, and it was always sleepy. <br><br>  And then I, not without the help of the Internet, developed my own way to wake up so as to minimize discomfort.  So, how do I wake up in the morning ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Alarm clock </h2><br>  1. The sound of the alarm should <b>gradually</b> increase. <br>  2. To wake up to <a href="http://muzpuls.ru/music/">music is</a> better than to simple sounds. <br>  3. It is good if the melody is always different.

      The ideal option is a TV or computer that will automatically turn on the music channel or play random music from a large number of songs. <br><br><h2>  Eyes </h2><br>  1. You need to open your eyes when you <i>want</i> to open them.  If you do it earlier, they will ‚Äústick together‚Äù, and, most likely, they will want to sleep throughout the day.  Therefore, no need to hurry, and after the following points, the eyes will open by themselves. <br><br>  2. First of all, after you regained consciousness, you need to make movements with eyes with closed eyelids.  Circular movements, eights, diagonals, etc. will work well. <br><br><h2>  We bring ourselves to feelings </h2><br>  To wake up is to activate your perception of the <i>external</i> world.  The 1-2-3-4-5 method is well suited for this: say to yourself one thing you hear, one thing you see (it can be an internal image) and one thing you feel.  Then - two things, three, four, and finally five.  So you smoothly "return to reality."  By the way, the reverse procedure (5-4-3-2-1) perfectly helps to fall asleep. <br><br>  After activating the psychological we will engage in the activation of the physiological: <br><br>  1. Squeeze and unclench the fingers and toes alternately.  Every 5-10. <br>  2. Smile (5-10 times). <br>  3. We make 2-3 deep breaths. <br>  4. "Blink" 5-10 times.  Eyes can not open. <br>  5. We are caught up with the whole body. <br>  6. Gently rub hands, face, temples and ears.  Ears - necessarily. <br>  7. We rub hands, a stomach, legs.  In general, the whole body :) Grind the belly vertically or clockwise. <br>  8. We get up. <br><br>  The above makes it easy to wake up.  Further - how to charge yourself with energy and good mood for the whole day. <br><br><h2>  Shower </h2><br>  It is better to take a shower immediately after the ascent.  It promotes good appetite, and additionally stimulates the body.  The shower must be warm. <br><br><h2>  Charging </h2><br>  Very important thing.  Needed in order to disperse the blood.  The number of exercises should be such that it is not hard. <br>  1. Circular head movements left and right. <br>  2. Mahi hands: forward and backward, together, alternately. <br>  3. Tilt forward. <br>  4. Circular movements of the pelvis left-right. <br>  5. Circular movements in the knees left-right. <br>  6. Pushups. <br>  7. Squats. <br><br><h2>  Breakfast </h2><br>  To taste :) I can only say that I add coffee with lemon to vivacity :) <br><br><h2>  At last </h2><br>  As I was convinced from my own experience, these simple exercises really give a huge effect.  It becomes easier to wake up, more energy appears, and life becomes brighter :) Tomorrow is Monday, and I wish everyone to wake up in the most pleasant way :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67793/</a></p>
