This perseverance is paying off.  According <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx%3Fqprid%3D10%26qpcustomd%3D0">to NetMarketShare</a> , Windows 10 is already installed on 7.94% of computers.  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey">These</a> game Steam service even higher: every fourth gamer uses the "ten".  But the penetration of Microsoft's new operating system is noticeably slowing down.  Therefore, in Redmond, it was decided to deliver the update to the ‚Äútop ten‚Äù from next year as the recommended one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br clear="all">  Windows 10 operating system was released July 29 this year.  24 hours after the release, it was installed on 14 million computers, and after four weeks, the number struck 75 million.  To reach nine digits (one hundred million), the OS took only 10 weeks.  The latest data from October 6 from Microsoft itself <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/263572/">claims</a> that the ‚Äúdozen‚Äù is installed on 110 million devices. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c48/20a/b8c/c4820ab8c9544d529f1c71820723bcf3.png"></a> <br>  NetMarketShare estimated that in October, almost 10 percent of Internet users used Windows 10.  This data was obtained using HitsLink Analytics and SharePost analytics services.  Information is collected from more than 40 thousand sites and 160 million unique visitors worldwide.  In September, users of Windows 10, according to NetMarketShare, were 6.63 percent, that is, an increase of 1.31 percent for the month.  This is a noticeable slowdown: in the first month, almost 5 percent of users moved to the ‚Äútop ten‚Äù, and for the following second and third months, only slightly more than a percent was received. <br><br>  Despite the free upgrade, the vast majority (55.71%) uses Windows 7. G7 <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2012/09/01/windows-7-finally-overtakes-windows-xp-mac-os-x-overtakes-windows-vista/">took the</a> place of Windows XP as the most popular system 3 years ago, in September 2012. Now there is enhanced support for Windows 7 - security patches are coming, but new ones functions are no longer added.  Extended support will be available until January 14, 2020.

      Gamers are much more susceptible to updates than ordinary users.  Windows 10 promises performance gains in games through the use of DirectX 12. Therefore, every fourth has moved to the top ten on Steam.  According to <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey">statistics for October</a> , 26,42 computers on which the Steam game client is installed, work under Windows 10. Another percentage uses the 32-bit version, which does not allow to address more than 4 gigabytes of RAM (this number also includes video memory).  But even among gamers, the system is gaining popularity too slowly.  Detail of the portrait of a typical Steam user is the use of Windows 7: "Seven" is set to 36.67% of computers. <br><br>  Microsoft targets a billion devices under Windows 10 in 2-3 years.  This number is not so fantastic, considering that it includes personal computers and laptops, Xbox gaming consoles, smartphones and tablets.  But growth on the PC is already noticeably slowing.  Perhaps that is why the company <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/10/29/making-it-easier-to-upgrade-to-windows-10/">decided to</a> start more aggressively forcing users to make the transition.  At the beginning of next year, Windows 10 will be in the list of recommended updates for Windows 7 and 8 / 8.1. <br><br>  For many users, recommended updates are downloaded and installed automatically.  But the nightmare in which the user, having turned on the computer, suddenly finds out that the usual ‚Äúseven‚Äù or ‚Äúeight‚Äù has disappeared somewhere, will not become a reality, and instead of it, the ‚Äúten‚Äù collecting personal data welcomes ominously.  The installer will run automatically, but it will still require user confirmation for the installation process.  Microsoft promises a clear and precise confirmation of the upgrade process.  As with a regular upgrade, after upgrading to Windows 10 for a month (31 days), you will be able to return to the old system without any serious consequences - all data will remain on the disk. <br><br>  Last month, an update to Windows 10 was briefly <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/windows-10-upgrade-installing-automatically-on-some-windows-7-8-systems/">included</a> in the list of recommended updates for Windows 7/8 / 8.1.  Then Microsoft said it happened by mistake.  At the beginning of next year it will not be an accident. <br><br>  Microsoft explains its decision by saying that many users wanted to upgrade, but for one reason or another did not use the update reservation system.  (Updates to the ‚Äúdozens‚Äù were not immediately available to everyone, but gradually in the order of the recording queue.) Therefore, the update will be made available through Windows Update. <br><br>  Upgrade to ‚Äúdozens‚Äù will be downloaded automatically from everyone who has recommended updates enabled.  For users with chargeable traffic, Microsoft recommends disabling automatic downloading of updates (or you can turn off recommended updates).  In Windows 7 and 8, this can be done in the settings for Windows Update in the Control Panel.  Detailed instructions are <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/turn-automatic-updating-on-off">available on the Microsoft website</a> . <br><br>  This is not the only change.  Now after the availability of the update to Windows 10, the system displays a tray notification.  The notification window is reworked to make it more understandable and attractive to the user, but at the same time correct for different cultures. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/727/c75/129/727c7512961d4257957ac3604b869235.png"></a> <br>  <em>The pun, built on the sound of a quiet engine, compares a computer running Windows 10 with a kitten.</em> <br><br>  Microsoft will release an improved version of the Media Creation Tool utility.  Now with its help, you can create a bootable flash drive or DVD-ROM, from which you can upgrade the license Windows 7/8 / 8.1 to 10. The new version eliminates the need to choose the version.  The resulting flash drive or disk will be able to update or install completely a 32 or 64-bit version of Windows 10 Home or Pro.  (At the moment, you can only update and only a specific version of the system.) For a "clean" installation, you will need a key or license. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e81/c56/5ae/e81c565ae4db466eb5d1f020d0f9ea44.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Warning no activation.</em> <br><br>  Finally, Microsoft thought about the user-pirates.  It was noticed that many users of unlicensed versions are updated to the ‚Äúdozens‚Äù, but after that they buy a key for activation.  This process will be facilitated by the experiment for residents of the United States.  The system can be activated by purchased code or a simplified indulgence in the Windows Store.  If such a paid cleaning conscience becomes popular, then the program will expand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366957/</a></p>
