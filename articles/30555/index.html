  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About a good movie and a little girl of 16 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We met here with one girl of sixteen years old (well, just made friends).  She came to us for the summer and was my "neighbor" for a couple of months.  We met from time to time, smoked together, went to the store together and all that.  She told me how they are there at school, and I - how are things at my work.  It was interesting to both, by the way. <br><br>  And from time to time I asked ‚Äúcasually‚Äù: ‚ÄúDid you watch the movie XXXXX‚Äù, there was also the actor YYYYY, and the film itself was about ZZZZZ. ‚ÄùPerhaps because of the very significant difference in age and the difference in artistic tastes, she replied : ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt watch it.‚Äù After it happened for the fiftieth time, I was already quite desperate (I just love to discuss good films with pretty and interesting people). <br><br>  The first "bell" sounded about a month after our acquaintance with her. <a name="habracut"></a>  When we talked about ‚Äúreal‚Äù acting, I gave the example of Russell Crowe and his two most successful roles in the films ‚ÄúGladiator‚Äù and ‚ÄúMind Games‚Äù.  And, oh, a miracle, finally, she said: "Yes, I know this film, there is about the commander who became a gladiator, and at the end killed the evil Caesar and saved Rome."  I was surprised and delighted.  Still, the film "Gladiator" (with all its "pop" and "golivudnosti") - this is a definite "must have" for any lover of a good movie.  But that was only the beginning.

      The worst thing happened a couple of weeks later.  Again we are talking about the movie.  And then for some reason she remembered her favorite film (despite the fact that I had asked about it many times before).  Her favorite movie turned out to be ‚ÄúRequiem for a dream‚Äù.  She said something like this: "I just watched it many times, maybe that's why I like it so much."  I didn‚Äôt expect to receive such a ‚Äúdummy‚Äù from a 16-year-old girl. <br><br>  And what, exactly, was the matter?  Even those people who are well versed in the cinema, as a rule, do not have the opportunity to watch all the films that are worth it due to an elementary lack of time (not only to watch, but also, so to speak, to ‚Äúchew on‚Äù spiritual food).  But still, almost all the ‚Äúserious‚Äù films shot in the last 40 years, we know something, and they just wait their turn.  ‚ÄúRequiem for a dream‚Äù, just at that moment, was waiting for its turn.  And I have a very long queue and not all the films that are in it, I like.  After watching some of them, I even feel sorry for the time spent, not looking at any Oscars, Cannes and so on. <br><br>  And it is unknown how many would have stood in the queue ‚ÄúRequiem for a Dream‚Äù, if it were not for this girl, from 11-B class.  Simply put, the fact that I did not watch this film, and she watched, I was very hurt.  I nevertheless knew something about this film and you can‚Äôt name it at all.  I somehow joked it off, then we once again smoked on the corner.  And when I came home, first of all, I sat down at the computer and started looking for this film in the Nizhny Novgorod ring.  I really could not wait to correct such an annoying misunderstanding.  Found, downloaded, looked. <br><br>  Half a day went to a trance.  For many reasons.  Two major.  First: the film is just great.  Second: I was advised to watch it by a 16-year-old girl!  For those who watched this movie: everything is clear.  For those who have not watched: this is the hardest movie, and for viewing, and for perception.  But by this I simply did not say anything, you just need to look at it.  What is the movie about?  In a nutshell: about how four completely different people first have a dream, and then life collapses. <br><br>  If someone wants to read in more detail about this film, then you can see in the Russian Wikipedia on the official page of the film, there is a lot of information. <br><br>  Well, what am I doing all this?  Maybe someone already guessed.  It's not about the film, although it's worth it.  The fact is that I, like many others, who are proud of their knowledge of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù cinema, (we also have such), we have reviewed hundreds or even thousands of films in our lives, including 7 out of 10 - just not worth it.  And now here I am proud of it and brag to everyone that I am a fucking film fan.  Is there anything to brag about?  The head is filled with useless information, unnecessary experience, unpleasant sensations.  And this is not going anywhere.  And for 2 months of our communication, the little girl (which any wise guy would immediately record as blondes) remembered only about 2 films (I, for comparison, a few dozen).  But which films are we talking about?  And which of us is blonde?  Here I am, in fact, about what. <br><br>  PS: I apologize for the inadmissibly large amount of text. <br><br>  PPS: I apologize for the poor quality of the text and, in particular, for the words ‚Äúpop‚Äù, ‚Äúgolivudnost‚Äù, ‚Äúspit‚Äù and ‚Äúfucking‚Äù. <br><br>  PPPS: I apologize for a topic not interesting to the majority. <br><br>  PPPPS: The girl of 16 years old is called Masha and she is from Dzerzhinsk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30555/</a></p>
