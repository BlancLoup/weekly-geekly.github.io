  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Detailed analysis of the crackme01_x64 solution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is designed for beginners who are interested in reverse engineering and have a basic understanding of the work of the CPU, the assembly language.  This crackme is relatively old and simple, but in solving it the same techniques are used as in solving more complex ones.  In the open spaces of the Network, you can find several articles with his analysis such as <a href="https://kaimi.io/2016/05/solving-easy-crackme-with-angr/">this one</a> , and he <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kaspersky/blog/203228/">is also</a> mentioned <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kaspersky/blog/203228/">here</a> (crackme with a story), however those solutions are not as detailed as this.  At one time, I strongly lacked such a line-by-line parsing, where I could look in when I got confused and do not understand what a particular code section does.  If this post will be useful for at least one person, then I tried for nothing.  All screenshots (except the first) are clickable.  Enjoy your reading. <br><br>  So, we have a simple crackme, run it and see how it works. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/k9/nv/jjk9nv2pqg-jrvdmitevaymv6kk.png"></div><br>  Yeah, it's pretty simple, we have to enter the correct serial.  Now open the program in disassembler.  As a rule, disassembled listings, even relatively simple programs, are rather voluminous.  To determine the part of the code that checks serial input, we will find where in the program's memory a line is stored with the error message ‚ÄúFail, Serial is invalid !!!‚Äù and which code refers to this line. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/ci/gm/dncigmnt3yg3e69lhuiezgaztvm.png"></a>

      <br>
      In the data section, we see the desired string, and below it, the disassembler forms a link to a section of code that refers to the string, we follow the link. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9n/wv/n1/9nwvn1-vrodbw6bxwrzle5wgmii.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>Loc_140001191</b> is a label for the transition, below we see the line " <b>call cs: MessageBoxA</b> ".  Suppose a function is called this way that draws a window with the text ‚ÄúFail, Serial is invalid !!!‚Äù.  It turns out that if we enter the wrong serial, the control is passed exactly by the tag <b>Loc_140001191</b> .  Ok, let's continue to dig and figure out where else there is an appeal by the same tag, for which we will follow the link to the right of it, which we carefully arranged for us, the disassembler. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/87/8z/9t/878z9tvftzd50sgxa4skqn9iqso.png"></a> <br><br>  This is a very important part of the code, look closely at it.  We see the call of the function ‚Äú <b>GetDlgItemTextA</b> ‚Äù, in the title there are the words <b>get</b> and <b>text</b> , obviously this function reads the entered serial.  After the function has completed, the command ‚Äú <b>lea rcx, [rsp + 78h + String]</b> ‚Äù loads the register <b>rcx</b> , the address of something from the stack.  It then writes the value from <b>eax</b> to <b>edx</b> and calls the <b>sub_140001000</b> function.  Manipulations with registers before the call are not random, thus passing the arguments to the function, and after the function has completed, the command ‚Äú <b>test eax, eax</b> ‚Äù checks the contents of <b>eax</b> , if it is not <b>0</b> , then the addresses of strings reporting that all OK.  Then the window drawing is launched with the corresponding notification.  If, after work, <b>sub_140001000</b> in <b>ax</b> is <b>0</b> , then control is transferred to the previously considered label, where we will receive an error message.  We conclude: <b>sub_140001000</b> returns the value in the <b>eax</b> register.  Now we can recover the logic of this crackme: the <b>GetDlgItemTextA</b> function is <b>called</b> , <b>let me</b> remind you that it presumably reads our serial, then the <b>sub_140001000</b> function is <b>called,</b> which as arguments receives the address of something from the stack and the value of the <b>eax</b> register through the <b>edx register</b> , if the function returns ‚Äúnot zero ‚Äù, then the correct serial number was entered; if‚Äú zero ‚Äù, it is not correct.  Suppose that it is <b>sub_140001000 that</b> checks our input, rename the labels and functions in our listing for convenience and clarity.  Now our listing looks something like this. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/6k/xk/qf6kxktl4enr3f7hko1q1jf1blw.png"></a> <br><br>  So the floor is done.  Now let's see what the <b>check_func</b> function <b>gets</b> as arguments, for this we will run the program in the debugger before calling the function and see what is stored in <b>rcx</b> and <b>edx</b> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/-a/2j/wl-a2je7t2cmlpyk8kc5nln-agm.png"></a> <br><br>  I entered <b>12345</b> .  The execution stopped at the call of the check function.  We look at the registers, in <b>rcx</b> is the number <b>12F660</b> , as we know this address, let's look at the memory dapm using it in the window below, aha there is our input, now we look at <b>edx</b> (it‚Äôs the younger part of <b>rdx</b> ) there is the number <b>5</b> , and this is our serial.  So we figured out which arguments and what the check function returns, now we can assume what its prototype could look like: <b>int check_func (* char, int)</b> .  It's time to study it.  Open the check function in disassembler.  It is quite large, so we analyze in parts. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/u1/sh/tqu1she0klu0xsohfzsu-urfrdm.png"></a> <br><br>  Everything is relatively simple here.  Let me remind you that the <b>edx register</b> stores the size of the entered serial number, and <b>rcx has</b> its address in memory.  It can be seen that, first of all, the function <b>check_func</b> checks the length of the entered number.  It should be equal to <b>19</b> ( <b>13</b> in hexadecimal system), if this is the case, then the check continues (go to the <b>good_size</b> tag), if not, then the control goes to the <b>bad_serial</b> tag, where the command ‚Äú <b>xor eax, eax</b> ‚Äù <b>clears the</b> <b>eax</b> register and exit function.  We conclude: <b>19</b> characters in a valid serial number, and which ones, let's look further.  We note that almost immediately the address of the entered number is placed in the register <b>R8</b> . <br><br>  We continue to investigate the verification mechanisms. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s5/cg/qc/s5cgqcd-6-5vwigcdd_uyzl35_o.png"></a> <br><br>  We remember that <b>R8</b> points to the first element of the serial, which means that the address of the 5th element will be stored at the address <b>R8 + 4</b> , it is recorded in <b>RAX</b> .  Further we see a very strange set of commands, which we will meet more than once: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">xchg</span></span> ax, ax db <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">66h</span></span>, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">66h</span></span> xchg ax, ax</code> </pre> <br>  Now more: <br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Xchg ax, ax‚Äù</b> is the equivalent of the ‚Äú <b>nop</b> ‚Äù command on the <b>x86</b> platform. <br>  The next line is the so-called prefix, it is used to indicate the bit depth of the next instruction.  This code we can ignore.  After these instructions there is a check of the following kind: what is located at the <b>RAX</b> address (and there the address of the <b>5th</b> element of the serial number) must be equal to the number 2D (in the hexadecimal system).  2D is the ASCII code of the ‚Äú-‚Äù sign, we draw the following conclusions: <br><br>  1. A function that reads our input reads a string, not a number, <br>  2. In our serial will be several groups of 4 numbers separated by hyphens. <br><br>  If the 5th character is not ‚Äú-‚Äù, then the serial number is not correct, a transition to the bad_serial label and exit from the function with a value of 0 occur, but if there is a hyphen at the 5th position, then <b>RAX is</b> increased by 5, now when it points to 10 the element is checked which character is at this position.  In total, such a check is carried out 3 times, every 5th character of the serial is ‚Äú-‚Äù, and there are only 19 characters in it, which means it has the form: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.  If the input format is appropriate, then verification continues. <br><br>  The next section of the function is not of particular interest to us. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wu/yy/i8/wuyyi88wo35bmar7ppyb1ccg-jk.png"></a> <br><br>  Go ahead. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q0/j-/wy/q0j-wyxvny1se1lpscgmpo-jy4g.png"></a> <br><br>  Pay attention to the following: <b>R9</b> always points to the first element of the block, and <b>RCX</b> keeps the offset inside the block, so after checking, <b>R9</b> increases by 5 to get to the next block, and <b>RCX</b> is reset to zero after checking the block, remember that there is zero in <b>RDX</b> , therefore, zeroing occurs on the <b>zero_to_rcx</b> tag.  The line ‚Äú <b>add eax, 0FFFFFFD0h</b> ‚Äù is not as simple as it seems.  In fact, it is not addition, but subtraction.  Yes, yes, do not believe your eyes, <b>0FFFFFFD0h</b> for a computer is the number -30h, apparently the fact is that the command ‚Äú <b>add eax, 0FFFFFFD0h</b> ‚Äù is more optimal from the point of view of the compiler than ‚Äú <b>sub eax, 30h</b> ‚Äù.  In <b>Eax,</b> the ASCII code of the element is stored, 30h is subtracted from it and compared with 9. The meaning here is: ASCII codes of digits from 0 to 9 are 30h - 39h, respectively, so if you subtract 30h from the digit code, the result will not exceed 9, but if it exceeds , it means that in eax the code was not a digit, but some other sign, and then we go by the label <b>wrong_serial</b> .  Our serial should consist of numbers and hyphens.  Then the codes of all 4 elements of the block are summed, the code of the 4th element is added 3 times and 150h is subtracted.  The result is pushed onto the stack, we add up the sum of all the blocks in R10 and the result is divided by 4. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/ao/8c/tgao8ceocgh_ssoosfkdthb_xnu.png"></a> <br><br>  Now the sums are checked for all 4 blocks.  The value for each block should be equal to the sum divided by 4, in other words, the sum of the ASCII code of the first character plus the code of the second, third plus 3 times the code of the fourth and minus 150h should be the same for all blocks. <br>  Remained the last stage of verification. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/4g/e8/fx4ge84hjda8eniwq73d141qlrs.png"></a> <br><br>  Everything is clear, in the serial should not be the same blocks.  Do not forget that <b>R8</b> stores the address of our input, <b>RAX</b> here is used to select the character inside the block, and <b>R8</b> to select the block inside the serial number. <br><br>  Now we know how the check is performed and we can write keygen.  I tried to describe the solution in as much detail as possible, questions can be asked in the comments, thank you for reading. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342676/</a></p>
