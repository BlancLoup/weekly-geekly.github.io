      First of all: a lot of unnecessary.  Just up to * yo.  Especially in a crisis.  It seems that Habr's visitors are sad dreamers, because almost all the web projects that came to us for an investment request (there were 62) are another service of the third kind, and not a normal product.  And almost all web projects want to fight back with advertising. <br><br>  And then we wonder: <i>‚ÄúWhy is this advertisement flooded the TV, the Internet, the streets and finally the whole world?‚Äù</i> That's why it was flooded because unfortunate businessmen are not able to come up with another financial model.  Some more honest.  Service, at least, though also not ice. <br><br>  A typical project: but we will make a portal on which it will be possible [to do something], then we will give advertisements, attendance will increase, we will sell advertisements ourselves and get rich with it. <br><br>  Pi * dec. <br><br>  Do you know what a third kind service is?  <b>The first kind</b> is a direct service to the consumer: <i>‚ÄúWife,</i> get <i>ready to eat - now, honey</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  <b>The second kind</b> is a service for the service: <i>"Our new super-pan helps you cook faster and tastier</i> . <i>"</i>  <b>The third kind</b> is a service for a service for a service: <i>‚ÄúDo you know how to choose the right frying pan?</i>  <i>Come to our portal superskovoroda.ru "</i> ... <br><br>  In * that is all.  The product must solve the problem!  What is the problem with the hostess?  Choose the right frying pan?  Not.  Quick and tasty to cook?  Not!  Her problem is HUNGRY HUSBAND!  And they, instead of solving the problem, only aggravate it with their <i>‚Äúportals of the right choice of frying pan‚Äù</i> . <br><br>  <b>Problem solver</b> <br><br>  Here I come to the supermarket.  Where is the problem?  A selection of 20 varieties of green peas?  Yes, poher, in fact, they are all the same, today I will take this one, tomorrow another.  Then where is the problem?  But for example, pay if cash is not enough.  This is closer, but also not new.  What else?  Do not know? <br><br>  The most tasty problem is when the stated concept DOES NOT WORK, and it needs to be fixed.  The concept of the supermarket says: <i>‚ÄúYou no longer have to poke the seller for the right products - take what you like,‚Äù</i> implying that we no longer have to stand in lines.  It would seem convenient ... In fact, I‚Äôm picking up the basket for a couple of minutes, and then I‚Äôll pause for 30 minutes at the cash register. <br><br>  The line at the box office is a bottleneck, a real problem.  <b>Solve it!</b> <br><br>  Or, for example, registration of any documents.  Why personally?  Why again turn?  Why passport?  Do somebody submit documents online - this will solve a REAL problem.  A portal with a bunch of information like <i>‚ÄúHow to submit such documents here‚Äù</i> does not solve it.  On the contrary, the new pain is added to the old headache with documents - with remembering the correct method of filing, avoiding bottlenecks and other things. <br><br>  Do not teach me anything.  Do it for me.  Remove from me the problem, but do not hang a new one - and it will be great. <br><br>  <b>Little about good</b> <br><br>  The project in which we finally invested: an Internet provider in Novouralsk (satellite city Ekb).  The whole city is sitting through ADSL, the speed is disgusting, they pay 4000 rubles per month, don‚Äôt understand why.  Problem!  We came to the administration, said <i>‚ÄúWe want to give you a normal unlimited, 1-2-4mbps‚Äù</i> - we immediately gave all the permissions and signed all the papers.  This is how people for * balo overpay to the brazen provider for a disgusting connection. <br><br>  There was a problem - no problem.  That's right. <br><br>  And you with your ‚Äúportals‚Äù. <br><br>  As children, honestly. <br><br>  <b>What not to say to investors</b> <br><br>  Look, maybe someone has not seen yet: a speech on the topic <i>‚ÄúWhat can not be said to an investor‚Äù</i> .  Maybe it will somehow clarify the situation for someone, and he will correct his understanding of the world before going to the next investor with his superproject. <br><br>  <a href="http://2009.icamp.ru/news/6/">Speech by Pavel Cherkashin (Head of the Adobe Systems Representative Office in Russia and the CIS)</a> <br><br>  A brief quotation for those who ‚Äúniasilil‚Äù (in any case there are such): <br><br><ol><li>  <i>‚ÄúWe have no money to make a prototype</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Losers, goodbye.  If they can't even figure out how to dodge in this situation, how are they going to manage big business when it grows up? </li><li>  <i>‚ÄúWe need investment in advertising to attract more users to sell advertising</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Understand the flawed model, right?  You actually sell the ruble for ninety-five kopecks. </li><li>  <i>‚ÄúWe cannot disclose details because we have a super secret idea.</i>  <i>Until you sign something or give no money, we will not tell you anything</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Also clear.  Then it will be unrealistic to agree with such people.  Investor is not interested. </li><li>  <i>‚ÄúOur project will kill someone</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  The phrase ‚Äúkill‚Äù immediately kills the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmeeting.  People do not have their own ideas, they are trying to someone ... to transfer responsibility to others. </li><li>  <i>‚ÄúWe have difficulties between authors‚Äù</i> , <i>‚ÄúGive us money, we need to buy Vasya back, because he no longer participates in business‚Äù</i> .  Everything, the investor immediately collects things.  Chew yourself. </li><li>  <i>‚ÄúI have some more interesting projects</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Such a phrase at the end of the meeting will immediately kill all the effective potential that you could build during this meeting.  Never speak it at a meeting with investors. </li><li>  And, of course, the phrase that also killed my communication several times was when, after a long interesting discussion, everything was fine, everything was interesting, and then the person said: <i>‚ÄúWell, you understand that I myself cannot deal with this business.</i>  <i>I am only the founder.</i>  <i>We will then hire a professional director to do this</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  And what did you come then? </li></ol><br><br>  Come on, good luck in business.  And be smart. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64825/</a></p>
