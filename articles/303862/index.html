I decided to post it here, I think it will be interesting to everyone.  So let's go.  There will be questions, write, if possible I will answer. <br><br>  Today I want to tell you about the development of the Internet advertising market: what was 10 years ago, what is happening now and what to expect in the next 2 years, my opinion is purely mine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  2006 </h4><br>  Internet advertising market is formed as a platform for the commercial promotion of companies.  Advertising is based on the output of keywords in the Yandex search engine and the use of contextual advertising.  St. Petersburg companies are actively engaged in exchanging links, bringing sites to the top, Moscow companies are starting to use the first service for buying and selling links - Sape (an automatic buying system of links for rent, allowing you to increase the link weight to output key queries to the top search engines).  Banner advertising is expensive, it is bought by billions and traffic websites earn huge money, for example, a women's website with a search traffic of 50,000 visitors a day earned about 3,000,000 rubles a month of net profit. <br><br><h4>  2007 </h4><br>  The market is developing rapidly.  Appear the first grid of sites aimed at selling links.  The price of the link depends on the thematic citation index.  The higher it is, the more expensive the link.  Begins artificial cheat TIC and the further sale of links.  The Internet is flooded with websites made not for selling services or products, but with fake phone numbers and non-existent addresses.  Online business is growing rapidly.  The first companies appear, which will later become Digital full-service agencies.

    <h4>  2008 </h4><br>  Several Digital Agencies are entering the market, which in 2014 will become one of the largest agencies in online advertising.  Begins to gain momentum a new type of advertising - teaser (this is an ad unit, consisting of small pictures and descriptions of them).  As a consequence: there is a large number of sites aimed at getting traffic on the Internet.  Top companies in the Internet business, such as Rambler and Ko and Mail Group, are beginning to buy other portals to expand their audience.  The first SeoPult link control panel appears, which greatly simplifies the purchase of links.  As a result, online stores are beginning an active struggle for issuing tops and increasing the reference mass. <br><br><h4>  year 2009 </h4><br>  Online advertising receives a new round: all large b2b companies are starting to transfer work to contractors to Digital agencies.  The reason is quite simple: all aggregators and traffic sources take an advance payment for traffic or links, and portals selling advertisements work on post payment.  Digital agencies become the usual intermediary between the final client and the contractor, taking away a commission.  Often commissions reach 300%.  In the same year there are Conveyors, who work through mobile operators and sell the results of various tests for SMS or subscription. <br><br><h4>  2010 </h4><br>  Selling links to the exchanges is at the peak of activity.  Small companies begin to enter into contracts not for a position in the search, but for incoming traffic to the site (that is, companies are starting to sell better promotion sites).  In connection with this, the first traffic twists appear.  At the expense of conveyors teaser advertising is rapidly gaining momentum.  Webmasters are learning to create the first one-page sites (landing page) for selling SMS tests.  Profits reach 1000% and more. <br><br><h4>  2011 </h4><br>  The first major change to the Yandex algorithm (read more here: <a href="https://yandex.ru/blog/webmaster/10399">yandex.ru/blog/webmaster/10399</a> ).  More and more webmasters are moving from selling links to working in teaser ads.  There are many traffic portals that sell teaser ads.  The new Rookee console is gaining momentum, the advantage of which is the full automation of the processes for renting links and the ability to set the minimum price of links to 1 keyword - 1 ruble.  More and more customers are starting to order the traffic service, not the top.  Appear first customers who work on the system of CPA (cost per action), pay per action.  That is, the client pays not for the top and not for the traffic, but for a certain action of the client (for example, payment for registration, for a call, for payment of the order). <br><br><h4>  year 2012 </h4><br>  The concept of Landing Page is fully included in online advertising, many companies are starting to make one-page websites to advertise their services.  Teaser ads and the traffic business are starting to lose momentum, as mobile operators set strict conditions for the sale of subscriptions.  Webmasters start selling products through teaser ads and Landing Page.  Various coupons, ad aggregators are gaining momentum.  As a result, a large share of the Internet advertising market is leaving them. <br><br><h4>  year 2013 </h4><br>  The first market players appear, advertising for companies for% of sales.  Ad aggregators are gaining momentum even more, there is an active struggle for the tops of all the major market players (Avito, Cyan, Avto ru and others).  The e-commers segment is at the peak of popularity.  Large online stores invest millions in all types of advertising: teaser, CPA, SEO, contextual advertising, ad aggregators.  SMM advertising is gaining momentum, communities are actively developing in social networks, companies are starting to buy targeted advertising.  RTB advertising appears (Real Time Bidding) - a technology for purchasing display advertising through programmable online auctions, which are predicted to turn the Internet advertising market upside down. <br><br><h4>  year 2014 </h4><br>  Begins an active development of mobile applications, mobile traffic.  There are more and more responsive sites that are replacing mobile versions of sites and which themselves adapt to any screen size.  All large companies are beginning to remake their portals under the new market conditions.  Budgets for online advertising companies are falling, the crisis.  Customers are becoming smarter and not ready to just pay for advertising.  More and more players in the advertising market want to be attached to specific indicators to achieve the goal, and pay for it.  Small companies are starting to go broke because they are not ready to compete with large ones on budgets. <br><br><h4>  2015 </h4><br>  In my opinion this is a watershed year for many large companies.  All the time, companies considered SEO as the main source of profit.  Website in the top of search engines - the company receives customers, the site is not in the top - the company does not receive customers.  This year, Yandex is changing the algorithm for ranking sites, because of this, the Internet advertising market is being redistributed.  SEO becomes expensive, long and risky.  Many large online stores and companies that previously lived only through SEO, go bankrupt.  The development of traffic sites becomes unprofitable.  Customers are less likely to buy banner and teaser ads.  Popularity is gaining advertising aimed at business training, investing training, buying and selling franchises.  Hybrids sites are actively appearing: grocery site + landing page + corporate site.  Advertising budgets are falling even harder.  Some of the companies selling advertising services are closing, some are starting to dump.  Many digital agencies work almost to zero.  In the same year, the service of dynamic remarketing appears (more details here: <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/3124536%3Fhl%3Dru">support.google.com/adwords/answer/3124536?hl=en</a> ) <br><br><h4>  2016 and beyond </h4><br>  Today, the Internet advertising market has changed.  Very often, performers are not ready to go on conditions that suit customers (for example, payment for services with a percentage of profit).  Customers are not willing to pay money for the air.  In my opinion, the next situation will be a rather simple situation: Internet advertising specialists will be a thing of the past, as they will not be able to withstand competition from generalists.  They will be replaced by companies and experts who will be ready to offer comprehensive business development that understands the company's business processes.  And who are able not only to build the entire sales funnel and increase conversion.  But who will be ready to become attached to the result, think over the individual, the most effective method of promoting this particular company.  And who own the skills to run and manage all types of online advertising. <br><br>  Data sources: support.google.com, yandex.ru/blog/, memory of the author of the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303862/</a></p>
