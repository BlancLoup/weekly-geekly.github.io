All users, as we have made in Russia, are pulling the blanket over themselves.  Well, let me tell you how I brought my Ubuntu to mind. <br><br>  Once at the New Year sale (2007 was coming) I bought an Acer Aspire One ZG5 netbook.  Inside, there is not much interesting, but as a notebook - a handy thing.  Having used his factory OS Linpus for some time, I realized that I need to change something.  The choice fell on ubuntu. <br><br>  Installing ubunt was pretty easy and not forced.  But then "yes, it began hemorrhoids on the setting."  The setup was long and caused many questions, disputes, misunderstandings, and so on.  Recently, I picked up a box with a new Ubuntu 10.04 distribution.  And for me it was amazing.  Compared to previous distributions, many actions simply ceased to be necessary.  But the conversation is not about that ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      After installing Ubuntu 10.04, I suffered a few days and started to make changes. <br><br><h5>  Remove unnecessary localization </h5><br>  Having on your "notebook" quite a bit of space (8 GB for everything about everything) you have to monitor the availability of space.  To your pleasure, a program was found that allows you to do everything on the machine - localepurge. <br> <code>sudo apt-get install localepurge</code> <br>  During the installation, she asks to specify which locales to leave in ‚Äúrest‚Äù and starts the first ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù.  To save the necessary locales for applications, I left the following: <br> <code>en <br> en_US <br> en_US.ISO-8859-15 <br> en_US.UTF-8 <br> ru <br> ru_RU <br> ru_RU.CP1251 <br> ru_RU.KOI8-R <br> ru_RU.UTF-8</code> <br>  After execution, the localepurge "cleaned" about 300MB of garbage.  Another plus - after each installation of any application - it runs automatically and according to the settings cleans the new application. <br><br><h5>  Archivers </h5><br>  The built-in and already quite comfortable configured archive manager allows you to perform all the work in the graphical interface.  But he has one drawback - the lack of a rar-archiver.  I don‚Äôt know, maybe prejudice, maybe the influence of signals from Mars, but using rar, as a data archiver, seems to me inappropriate.  In my opinion, it belongs to a variety of programs from the 90s - when the only archiver for Windows machines with a graphical interface was ‚Äúhe‚Äù. <br>  The treatment of this problem is made by one team (perhaps two - depending on which repository is configured): <br> <code>sudo apt-get install rar <br> sudo apt-get install unrar</code> <br> <br><h5>  We build networks </h5><br>  Having a few more computers in a home network running Windows make settings for accessing their resources. <br>  I don‚Äôt know why, but samba wasn‚Äôt automatically installed when you installed Ubuntu.  But nothing - we do it by hand. <br> <code>sudo apt-get install samba <br> sudo apt-get install cifs <br> sudo apt-get install cifs-utils</code> <br>  After that, all resources are available for viewing and editing. <br>  Also, I store all the music and video on one of the computers and the desire is to mount the partition in the desired folder automatically when I start the system. <br>  Add the necessary lines to / etc / fstab (I did it like this) <br> <code>//mousetrap/music /home/mouse495/music cifs rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,username=user,password=Rah7chis,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0</code> <br>  Here you only need to correct <br>  <b>// mousetrap / music</b> - in the name of a shared Windows resource, <br>  <b>/ home / mouse495 / music</b> - to the address where to mount, <br>  <b>username = user</b> - respectively on the username on the computer with Windows and <br>  <b>password = Rah7chis</b> respectively to the password of this user. <br><br><h5>  Configure Nautilus </h5><br>  Many newcomers ask themselves the question - ‚ÄúWhere is the address bar?‚Äù, Then they find out that there is a <b>Ctrl + L</b> combination and they are not very happy. <br>  The solution to this problem is very simple - in the console, enter the following: <br> <code>gconftool -s --type bool /apps/nautilus/preferences/always_use_location_entry true</code> <br>  Wow!  The address bar is constantly displayed! <br><br><h5>  Updating ... </h5><br>  Those who use Ubuntu with some consistency know that the update manager constantly gets out of its way to ‚Äúupdate something‚Äù and constantly gets out with suggestions.  I don't like this either.  Therefore, we do the following: <br> <code>gconftool -s --type bool /apps/update-notifier/auto_launch false</code> <br>  Everything!  He won't bother us anymore! <br><br><h5>  Call on Skype </h5><br>  A big disappointment for me was the problem of someone calling from Skype.  With video, everything is fine, with sound too, but with a microphone problem.  But nothing is solved!  Recalling past work in the service, I knew that often microphones in laptops and netbooks are mono.  Here from here also we will dig. <br>  The first thing we need is to set the volume control from pulse-audio and replace the standard alsa with it. <br>  To do this, simply install the pulse-audio: <br> <code>sudo apt-get install pulse-audio</code> <br>  After installation, just in case we restart. <br>  To adjust the settings, start the volume control from pulse-audio and select the Input Devices tab and set the ‚ÄúFront Left‚Äù to 80% and ‚ÄúFront Right‚Äù to 10%.  We start Skype and we are glad that we are heard now. <br><br>  PS Probably I didn‚Äôt say anything new in this post, but these moments often make the user a little ‚Äúterrified‚Äù and give a shout like ‚ÄúHERE DOES NOT WORK ANYTHING!  FRAUD DEVELOPERS ".  This is their right, but people remember one thing - these settings ‚Äúunder you‚Äù in Linux are equivalent to changing the desktop wallpaper when you first start Windows. <br><br>  Thank you: <br>  1. Me (for experience in Ubuntu) <br>  2. Kottenator (for writing incentive) <br>  3.
