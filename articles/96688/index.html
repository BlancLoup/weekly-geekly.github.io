But, my acquaintance with Fischer Audio headphones is a pleasant exception to this rule. <br><br><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/4466/6172043.jpg"><br><br>  This time I got the FA-004 Brown earphones that were pleasant to my eyes and ear (Knowledgeable people say that there is a black model, but I like this one more). <br>  I hope, they will like not only me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As always, first impressions begin with the box.  She is more than ordinary here.  I would say it is ascetic: plain cardboard, rectangular, no frills, just the inscription ‚Äúopen here‚Äù and the company logo.  By the way, she somehow reminded the boxes in which they send parcels to the United States.

Substitute), adapter 3.5 - 6.3 mm.  This is all that is inside, and more we don‚Äôt need: I got it, put it on and went.  Convenient and fast, all for the sake of the end user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77c/d4a/9da/77cd4a9da71cc701521e237b48501109.jpg"><br><br>  But let's not focus on the box, it‚Äôs not the purpose of this review.  I pass directly to the headphones. <br>  They have no special technical characteristics, but the most important: <br><ul><li>  Frequency range: 10.5-23500 Hz. </li><li>  Driver diameter: 38 mm </li><li>  Sensitivity: 94 dB. </li><li>  Resistance: 32 Ohms. </li><li>  Input power: 180 mW. </li><li>  Color: brown / golden </li><li>  Equipment: 6.3 mm adapter. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/5926/6172036.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones look quality made, plastic is quite pleasant to the touch.  Chocolate color gives a special charm and individuality, while gold and black emphasize beauty.  The size is regulated by metal gold-plated arcs, which only complement the unique design of the FA-004.  The headband is soft and almost not felt on the head.  The ear cushions are quite deep and wide, so the ear completely fits into them, it is a pity that they are non-removable and there is no replacement in the kit, since I would like the size to be a little smaller.  In general, the headphones look very stylish and fit the notorious fashionistas who love high-quality sound. <br><br>  High-quality materials finishing headphones provide excellent comfort during prolonged wear, absolutely no pressure, only the ears sweat a little, but this is a flaw in a closed design.  The gold-plated 3.5 mm jack and 6.3 mm jack adapter allow you to connect headphones to almost all types of sound reproducing equipment. <br><br>  I have headphones with a straight cable, but there are also variants with twisted ones.  This is already everyone chooses for himself. <br>  For me, the wire is a bit short, but, in principle, you can get used to.  A little upset that you can not change the wire here, but in the end, this is not a professional headphones from Fischer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/103/c3c/e4a/103c3ce4aadd8d5c3232734dd0ad1c8e.jpg"><br><br>  The two halves of the headphones are connected by a wire in a rag braid, which provides the best protection against chafing.  By the way, the arms are made in a very original way: metal, gilding and black, similar to stone, plastic. <br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ee/c56/a03/8eec56a03ce69f780e614a234f5fa638.jpg"><br><br>  Fischer Audio FA-004 has a very accurate localization of the music scene, and the closed headphone design provides a high level of noise insulation.  Listening to music in them is a pleasure.  Perhaps, for me, at the moment of the closed - this is the most pleasant option, because  and the size is small and the sound quality, and the price pleases (but, about it later). <br><br>  The sound is soft, deep and pleasant, the bass is tapped well.  Noise isolation at a high level, in the subway, in the club - everything is audible and does not even have to press.  According to user experience - like it.  I don‚Äôt know, maybe professionals will find flaws, but it‚Äôs tolerable to me, with not an absolute ear for music. <br><br>  For experts I cite frequency response, phase response.  Thanks for the data DoctorHead.ru <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3e/621/6b1/f3e6216b15102666d2e07413fba88d85.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/595/f7e/70a595f7e585968cea0af2eb5e9e3fcb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The price of the headphones - about 2000r., Which undoubtedly pleases in the presence of good sound, comfortable design and pleasant look. <br><br><h4>  Summarizing </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c8/c75/92b/8c8c7592b7875252562613a688db43bc.jpg"><br><br>  Stylish headphones with an interesting youth design, which have a good high-quality sound and like music fans.  Upset the lack of twisted wire, but as it turned out it was only in black models.  When located in the price range up to 2000r., I think that this instance is a very good option for novice DJs or just for those who like to listen to the music of "delicious" quality.  Or just for those who love beautiful nice things =) <br><br>  pros <br>  + Design and color <br>  + Package <br>  + Construction (convenient, does not crush) <br><br>  Minuses <br>  - No twisted wire <br>  - Short cable <br><br>  I hope you liked them too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96688/</a></p>
