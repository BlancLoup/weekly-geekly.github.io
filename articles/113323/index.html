Most of them are complaints.  It `s naturally. <br><br>  It is clear that there are all sorts of situations and in working with people it is impossible to be 100% white and fluffy.  So, if such cases arise, you should try to reduce the negative to a neutral attitude and solve the problem. <br><br>  In this post I will describe a short list of useful tips on how to combat negative things.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  By writing this note I was inspired by the following case: I look to the new machine.  To this end, I traveled all the salons of the city and chose what appeals to me in price and performance. <br><br>  Signed up for a test drive.  They promised me that they would call. <br><br>  Nobody called me.  I waited another hour and contacted the salon myself.  There they explained to me that the car got into a small accident and offered another car with similar characteristics for a test drive.  Persuaded about 5 minutes. <br><br>  In the end, I still got the answer that after 2 weeks, the car I liked will be on the move. <br><br>  Naturally, I was upset and I had fair questions: <br><ul><li>  why no one called on time? </li><li>  Why do they convince me that they know better that I need to not even see me? </li><li>  if they work with the client like this before the purchase, how will they treat me after? </li></ul><br>  We will understand what to do if such a situation arose. <br><h4>  Objectives of working with negative feedback </h4><br>  So, our main goal is to solve the problem of a person who made a complaint, and not to insulate in any way a company, product or service.  Only in this case can we not only restore the company's image, but in some cases improve it. <br><br>  <b>So, why does a company need all this:</b> <br><ul><li>  understand the essence of the claim </li><li>  remove the negative, get a neutral or positive feedback </li><li>  show those who will read the correspondence that the company is open for communication, cares about its customers and is not silent about the obvious facts </li></ul><br>  By the way, a detailed consideration of the problem will help to make the product / service better, taking into account the information received, which means it is more attractive for buyers. <br><br><h4>  The most common causes of negativity </h4><br>  The first thing to do is to figure out the reason for the negative. <br><br>  <b>Possible options:</b> <br><ul><li>  product advertising in the wrong place at the wrong time </li><li>  black pr </li><li>  lack of attention from client managers </li><li>  service / product flaws </li><li>  ‚ÄúAdd to heap‚Äù </li></ul><br>  With those who are behind the company kicks, everything is clear.  The competitors' intrigues are also easy to calculate - such ‚Äúclients‚Äù simply do not make contact, do not leave personal data and unsubscribe in the style of ‚Äúeverything is always bad with you‚Äù. <br><br>  Publication of advertising where your target audience is not, usually leads to the very ‚Äúfinish.‚Äù <br><br>  If there are objective product flaws (the example of Nokia, which does not make contact with problem buyers), you should try to find out all the possible details about it and try to fix them to make the product even better.  This is a free focus group! <br><br><h4>  General points on working with reviews </h4><br>  Track feedback constantly and respond promptly.  Ideally, after someone adds a message, you should immediately receive a notice about it. <br><br>  Nick and the signature of the employee answering the question must clearly tell who the buyer is in correspondence with.  Company, position, surname, name and contacts. <br><br><h4>  How to respond to reviews </h4><br>  I will give an example that I remember most of all.  A company that produces hand-made dumplings receives a review similar to the following: dumplings are molded by hand, without gloves, this is not hygienic and can lead to poisoning. <br><br>  The owner of the company wanted to answer the heat of the moment, but he was reassured and the staff of the company responsible for working with clients and communication on the Internet, who realized that they needed to remove the negative and find out its reason, reassured and responded. <br><br>  In response, it was written that dumplings can only be sculpted with bare hands, and the nose and glove can be easily wiped off.  All hygiene standards in the company are complied with, and the staff undergoes daily testing by a health worker. <br><br>  Description of the inspection process of the staff, how the dumplings are molded, the filling and dough is prepared, photos of the workshop and the products themselves were also provided. <br><br>  Some people who read the report wrote grateful feedback to the company that described the process and the subtleties of their work in such detail. <br><br>  As it turned out later, the review was left by a person working in the SES. <br><br>  <b>So, how to respond to such reviews:</b> <br><ul><li>  do not write with hot </li><li>  introduce and indicate the position in the company, the name and surname, the position of the one who answers, give your contacts </li><li>  apologize on behalf of the company for inconvenience </li><li>  find out the details of the order (number, number, etc.) and what exactly was done wrong </li><li>  Be sure to thank for the feedback and write that the information will be communicated to the manual. </li><li>  if the person left contact information, call him back, apologize on behalf of the company and clarify whether all the questions were published by him in the recall </li><li>  find out the true cause of the negative, because  Often people are dissatisfied with the lack of attention from the company's employees.  In case of dissatisfaction, people tend to exaggerate.  We arrived at the wrong time, we installed everything crookedly, trampled, rude </li><li>  to answer after you have sorted out the details of the order for <b>all the</b> questions in order, which the person asked and which you received by phone.  Accurate and intelligible. </li></ul><br><h4>  Some moments from personal experience </h4><br>  I do not advise you to publish praise from non-existent buyers. <br><br>  A small part of people enter the dialogue, who left a review, they splashed out emotions and calmed down (I know from myself).  So perhaps your first answer will be the last.  It should lead to the fulfillment of the goals I indicated at the beginning of the note. <br><br>  Never convince a person of anything.  This will lead to the opposite.  He already had an opinion about your company and your task is to fix it. <br><br>  Thank people for feedback.  For positive - doubly. <br><br>  Reviews on other sites that you do not have the ability to control.  Please note that your message may be deleted or even corrected so that the meaning will be distorted.  Therefore, I advise you to look at the attendance of these sites and decide whether to do anything at all. <br><br>  With negative reviews that have high positions in search engines, you also need to work.  Minimal - push out neutral or positive reviews from top positions. <br><br>  Always read carefully your answer so that it is unambiguous and does not contain errors, because  some even in the names are wrong.  This can cause even more negative. <br><br>  In response, contact the person by name.  This will show that you are attentive to your customers. <br><br>  Do not forget that your answer will be read by other people who still may not have become your buyers, so you need to write for them too.  If the claim is made to the quality of the goods - to describe and prove with the help of objective facts that your product is made from high-quality materials and is assembled by qualified specialists.  If the price - to describe why the price is such. <br><br>  And another thing: if you, for example, fix a marriage made when installing plastic windows, then an employee traveling to rectify the flaws should know everything about the problem thoroughly, have all the necessary documents on hand, and most importantly, make an appointment by phone and arrive on time, fix everything and ask the person to leave a review. <br><br>  I hope this information will help you avoid mistakes in communication with customers. <br><br>  Thank you for the examples from the practice of Vlad Titov and Ilya Yakamsev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113323/</a></p>
