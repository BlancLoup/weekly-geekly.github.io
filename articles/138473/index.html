  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will the client appear for rutracker.org in the App Store or the history of unfinished development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon. <br>  I can not say that I am a frequent visitor to the site rutracker.org, but the series "Doctor House" download regularly.  The process of the appearance of new episodes is quite unpredictable and I would like to be able to find out from my iPhone whether the new Hausa series has appeared in the distribution and what new films can be watched.  I was inconvenient to use the built-in browser ‚ÄúSafari‚Äù, and so the idea arose to write an application that would make it possible to track new distributions.  To date, the application still can not go through the review of the apple censors, but the struggle continues.  Detailed history under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea to create a full-fledged torrent client was dropped immediately as fantastic.  Such an application would never have passed the apple review.  And in general, I assumed, and as it turned out, it was not in vain that even the most innocent application, in which rutracker is mentioned, will have difficulties with revue.  For this, I decided not to turn anything particularly difficult, but to create the simplest client with the ability to view the latest distributions and add interesting branches to my favorites. <br><br><h2>  Development </h2><br>  Sam rutracker publishes in the rss feed, only the name of the distribution, the author and the time, as well as a link to the appropriate section of the forum, which is naturally not enough.  Therefore, it is useless to include a link with rss tape of a rutreker into a regular rss reader, the usefulness of the received information tends to zero.  After all, I also want to read the description of the distribution and see the screenshots. <br>  Here's how my rss feed from a rutracker in a regular rss reader looks like <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38b/a05/8b4/38ba058b479267e5a73466ee17a07115.jpg"><br>  The rutracker API is missing, which means you need to parse or use a third-party service. <br>  From the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãparsing on the phone, I refused immediately.  Here there are such disadvantages as mobile Internet traffic, which is not cheap and very often slow, as well as dependence on the speed of the phone, because there are a lot of 3g and 3gs phones on hand.  I decided to move in the direction of a third-party service, I considered <a href="http://xpoft.ru/">xpoft.ru</a> and others.  But then I came across an article by user <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ivo_pupkin/" class="user_link">ivo_pupkin</a> , who gave an example of using the <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">‚ÄúYahoo Pipes‚Äù</a> service just for my purposes.  In his article, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ivo_pupkin/" class="user_link">ivo_pupkin</a> kindly allowed everyone to take advantage of their work and gave permission to clone their pipes and finish them for themselves, which was done.  My application sends an http request for Yahoo Pipes, and the Yahoo service itself parsit rutracker and gives me an xml tape with the necessary information in response. The plus is substantial saving of Internet traffic and stable operation speed regardless of Internet speed, and minus the expectation of 30-45 seconds until the whole tape has been parked. <br>  In general, I did all this, I started testing with various Internet 3g, wi fi, gprs- suddenly everything stopped working, but only yesterday everything worked in the simulator.  It turned out under the DDOS attack "lay down" rutracker.  And here I presented how many <s>tons of ***</s> negative reviews could be at the moments when the site is lying.  Having presented all this, I, while the root-tracker was unavailable, added a notification to the project, i.e.  at any time there is an opportunity to inform users about problems with rutracker.  Having finished the development, I tested everything again and sent the application for review in apple.  Here is how it should look. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/edd/fb6/888/eddfb6888a1447ccb1320cae07cab6d8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a11/7c6/8f8/a117c68f85401a3811401220e8ade89b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/093/7d9/172/0937d91720139bdecde8ccfccde33532.jpg">

    <h2>  Revue </h2><br>  And after 6 days, the application moved to the status of ‚ÄúIn Review‚Äù.  Usually, after this, within one day (in our time, within one night), the answer is whether the application was missed on the App Store or not.  In my case, the answer came in 2 days.  He, as expected, was negative.  The censors referred to clause 22.4 of the ‚ÄúApp Store Review Guidelines‚Äù:  Although, once again, the application does not load the content itself, but only allows you to follow the distributions.  Most likely, the censors did not understand much, only after seeing the name rutracker.org, which is listed by the US trade mission in the pirate list, they immediately refused.  Although the site "VKontakte" is also listed in this list, but the App Store is full of applications that allow you to download, listen and view any content from Vkontakte. <br><br>  What was done: <br>  (1) A line has been added to the application description that the application does not allow downloading content; <br>  (2) Removed links to rutracker.org; <br>  (3) A detailed letter was sent to the review team explaining the purpose of the application and the impossibility of downloading content. <br>  No answer yet.  We are waiting ... <br><br>  What will I do if the application does not pass review? <br>  Never mind.  I will do another application.  I achieved my goal, the application works on my phone and I can follow the distributions from the iPhone.  Well, maybe somewhere else I'll post a .ipa file and any owner of an iPhone with jailbreak will be able to install it and also monitor distributions from the rutracker. <br><br>  If the application passes review, then I will write a client for the iPad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138473/</a></p>
