How to lead?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea2/0ba/46d/ea20ba46dc96410d91b7cecb37455838.jpg"><br><br>  Scientists from St. Petersburg State University published the study "Educational possibilities of webinars in modern practice of distance learning."  In order to derive an effective webinar formula, they interviewed people ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù - teachers, business trainers, IT specialists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="009900">What is the effectiveness of the webinar?</font> <br><br>  Anastasia Azbel, a psychologist and InternetUrok manager, believes that webinars do not provide the most important thing for successful learning - vivid and vivid impressions.  Without them, there is no lasting memorization of new information.  The data stream passes by the listeners, unless they specifically make notes to repeat everything later.

      To the question ‚ÄúIs there any special training for the webinar teachers themselves?‚Äù All the interviewed experts answered in the negative.  All that the trainer has to do is to have a deep knowledge of the material and oratorical skills in order to keep students from getting bored.  But there are exceptions when the teacher himself needs a teacher - and then the same lesson is conducted with him in a distance format. <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåHow many people can I collect?</font> <br><br>  Technically, from 1000 to 5000 people can be gathered for a webinar.  But in reality, it is possible to conduct effective training if there are no more than 50 students in the class, as in a regular full-time lesson - then the lecturer can work alone, without outside help. <br><br>  A much larger number of students covers distributed learning: moderators help each lecturer, each of whom is in the audience with the listeners and conveys information from the lecturer to them using special software.  Such a system already exists in many universities. <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñå How to interest the audience?</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8e/2ad/ed1/e8e2aded183146dda58423630dc2c116.png"><br><br>  The scourge of webinars is quickly dying off the interest of listeners.  Distance learning does not discipline badly, to say more, it does not discipline at all.  Pupils need to rely only on themselves, on their own willpower and their motivation.  How to help them?  Many experts say - to make webinars paid, then the motivation will immediately become more apparent.  For free webinars there are other ways: <br><br><ol><li>  Talk about current and topical, about close to the audience; </li><li>  Invite a famous speaker - light the webinar with the rays of glory; </li><li>  Use an interesting approach to learning. </li></ol><br><br>  And even these techniques will not give a guarantee of motivation.  It is not enough to advertise the course - you need to be interesting to lead <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñå ‚ÄúClip Thinking‚Äù</font> <br><br>  Teachers have to deal with such a phenomenon when students are under 30 years old.  The director of the ‚ÄúCenter of copyright programs‚Äú Advance ‚Äù, Valentina Deinega, advises every 15 minutes to stop for a two-minute rest - to distract something, tell something interesting or funny, even put on music. <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñåEffective webinar recipe</font> <br><br>  Rich presentation material.  Each new topic of conversation is well supported by illustrations: videos, slides, presentations.  It is necessary to attract attention. <br><br>  Artistic speaker.  People like professional proficiency in timbre of voice, well-delivered diction, expressiveness of speech.  If your mimicry is not so developed, experts advise to put a beautiful photo and conduct a webinar with just one voice. <br><br>  Quality platform for webinar.  At the first technical problems, with delays in sound and video, you will begin to lose your audience many times. <br><br>  Interactive.  Use polls, tests, cases.  Use all the features of your platform. <br><br>  <font color="009900">‚ñå Real and Future</font> <br><br>  Experts agreed that distance learning has great prospects for growth and development.  However, now only such lectures are at the heart of such an online format.  This makes distance learning technologies a surrogate, an appendage to traditional education. <br><br>  Therefore, today the webinar is a good addition to the classical training.  At the same time, there are no general webinar maintenance techniques.  Speakers should rely only on their charisma and their oratory skills - you should always keep the attention of listeners. <br><br>  In schools and universities, experts say, the webinar is unlikely to survive.  But in corporate training he has a great future.  Teaching employees remotely is cheaper and faster.  It is more comfortable.  In this case, the effect is the same as with full-time study. <br><br>  The authors of the study: Ilyushin LS, doctor of pedagogical sciences and Alina Matveeva, a graduate student of St. Petersburg State University. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.edutainme.ru/post/webinars/">via</a> <br><br>  <i>Organize effective classes on a distance learning platform</i> <br> <a href="http://teachbase.ru/landing/%3Futm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_content%3DPost_247474"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/c26/9b1/b54c269b17a34122ba31a7f80eadd238.PNG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374781/</a></p>
