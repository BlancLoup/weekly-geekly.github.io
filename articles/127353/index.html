  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free IBM Connections Mobiles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://rww.readwriteweb.netdna-cdn.com/enterprise/ibmconnections150.png" align="left">  Not everyone knows that IBM is developing and distributing a social tool that allows you to effectively build communities, wikis, social streams, discussion forums and many other things that can unite your company's team into a single internal social network - <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/products/connections/">Connections</a> Lotus products.  Today, the mobile version of Connections has become free. <br><br>  Versions of the application exist for the most popular mobile platforms: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ibm.lotus.connections.mobile">Android</a> , <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/ibm-connections/id450533489%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> and <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/52232%3Flang%3Den">Blackberry</a> .  The mobile application connects to a server based on Windows or Linux Connector installed in your office.  If IBM Connections is not used in your business, but you want to look at the functionality of the application and try it out, you can do it.  Register on the <a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/wpsgh/wcm/connect/lotus%2Bgreenhouse/lotus%2Bgreenhouse%2Bnext%2Bsite/home/lgh%2Bnext%2Bhomepage">Lotus Greenhouse</a> website (you are filling out an application, it is considered even if everything is good, assigning you a login and password - my application was considered 5 minutes), after which the same data is used to enter the mobile application.  When the application asks you about the URL to connect to the server - enter <a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/mobile">greenhouse.lotus.com/mobile</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, besides mobile applications, there are also desktop versions that still remain paid.  But here, too, there will be a loophole for your favorite habrayuzer ‚Äî if you really want to see what Connections looks like, but you don‚Äôt see the point in downloading the application, try the cloud version of LotusLive (formerly called Lotus Connections).  Despite the fact that the subscription fee is $ 7.50 per user per month, there is a <a href="https://apps.lotuslive.com/manage/account/public/trial/showCreateTrialAccount">60-day trial period</a> , which everyone can use. <br><br><img src="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/assets_c/2011/08/LotusConnections3_Communities-thumb-610x471-32993.jpg" alt="image">

      In addition to various social features, we also added additional functionality to mobile applications, which depends on the operating system installed on the device: <br><br>  - Partial deletion of information from Apple iOS devices.  This is a relatively new feature that allows a corporate Connections administrator to delete all information belonging to a company from a device, leaving the phone owner‚Äôs data intact. <br>  - For owners of Android OS added the ability to make a call directly from the calendar.  For now, this feature is in beta, but Lotus Notes Traveler allows IBM (i.e. Lotus) mail users to call people indicated in the application calendar with one click. <br>  - Only for Blackberry owners is supported the possibility of online meetings, this requires the installed OSv6. <br><br>  By the way, <a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/wpsgh/wcm/connect/lotus%2Bgreenhouse/lotus%2Bgreenhouse%2Bnext%2Bsite/home/products/ibm%2Blotus%2Bnotes%2Btraveler">Traveler</a> is another IBM product from the Lotus family, a mobile application that provides two-way synchronization of e-mail and PIM data between Domino servers and a mobile device. <br><br>  IBM is the largest user of this product - it is unlikely to surprise you, because  if the product does not satisfy its own needs, then it is unlikely to satisfy others.  If you look back at the evolution of services for corporate communications, you can see the movement towards the end user: in the early 80s, IBM worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_OfficeVision">PROFS</a> , the system of letter circulation that worked on the mainframe and also had a calendar, and a common repository of documents.  After that, the era of Officevision came, which in essence was the same product for desktops and ‚Äúmini-computers‚Äù - remember the times of OS / 2.  Finally, after the merger with Lotus Development, the movement began in the direction of Notes, which was a huge success, as the application was written really well.  And now, in the rhythm of the rapid development of Internet services and social media, Connections has finally leaned toward the user, giving him opportunities that have never happened before. <br><br>  Finally, one last thing - one of the new and exciting features in Connections is that you can now see the organizational hierarchy of your contacts.  For any large company or corporation, this is, literally, a goldmine: you can see what data the head of the department receives, or find an employee of the regional / international branch of your company who is currently helping one of your clients away.  The range of possible use of such information is truly enormous. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127353/</a></p>
