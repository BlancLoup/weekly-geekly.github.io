      By the way, well-known designer David Lewis from Bang &amp; Olufsen, who previously worked on creating the cutting-edge ASUS NX90 style, was once again attracted to work on the design of new N-laptops. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Specialists from Bang &amp; Olufsen have a hand in creating the audio system of new laptops - ASUS SonicMaster, which is a complex of hardware and software tools for improving sound quality.  As a result, ideas about the pursuit of perfect sound, embodied in the first models of the N-series, were further developed and unexpectedly embodied.  For a more powerful and expressive low-frequency transmission, an external subwoofer is included with the notebook.  SonicMaster technology brings the sound quality of laptops to a whole new level, providing a wide dynamic range, deep bass, clear vocal reproduction.  Thanks to the audio system, the N-Series laptops can match the sound quality with stand-alone speakers. <br><br>  The notebook configuration includes a second-generation Intel Core processor and NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GT555M graphics card with DirectX¬Æ 11 support and NVIDIA¬Æ Optimus technology.  The logical addition to the modern technical equipment of new laptops of the N series is a high-speed USB3.0 interface.  In addition, laptops have USB Charger +, which is useful for all users of mobile gadgets, allowing you to charge an external device from the USB port, even if the laptop itself is turned off. <br><br>  You can read more about the new product in the nearest review, which can be found in our blog. <br><br>  As part of the lineup support program, ASUS joined forces with a creative team that included Grammy winner, musician <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CC%25F0%25E0%25E7,_%25C4%25E6%25E5%25E9%25F1%25EE%25ED">Jason Mraz</a> , director Andy Morahan, photographer Don McCallin and director and producer Azif Kapadia.  Together with them, ASUS and Intel went in search of the most amazing stories around the world and announced a competition, the participants of which should offer their vision of something incredible.  Incredible can be anything: image, sound, moment.  The text description provided by the participants of the competition must be accompanied by appropriate visual and audio materials.  The jury, which will select the winners, includes Jason Mraz, author and performer of songs with a track record of several platinum albums. <br><br>  In each country, one winner will be selected, who will receive the main prize - the new ASUS N Series laptop. Winners from different countries will get a chance to win an international prize.  The winner of the global competition will have the opportunity to transform his incredible story into a short film with the help of a professional film crew put at his disposal.  In January this film will be shown at one of the world's leading film festivals in the city of Park City, Utah.  In the course of the competition, Jason Mraz will serve as an example for other participants, as he will travel around the world in search of the incredible, which will lead him to various parts of the globe, from California to Morocco.  The results of his searches will be captured in a series of web clips by renowned director Asif Kapadia. <br><br>  More information about the competition can be found on the website <a href="http://www.neveroyatnoe.ru/">neveroyatnoe.ru</a> . <br><br>  And some more photos from the press conference: <br><br><img src="http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4968/90199570.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a contest.  You photograph the QR code, you get a question about the ASUS company, and at the end, according to the scores, you take part in the prize draw lottery. <br><br><img src="http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/755/44236889.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/9317/12386690.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/1581/81421383.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/8279/38345684.jpg"><br><br>  Updated N series.
