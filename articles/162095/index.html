      <b>Question 1.</b> Is it planned to introduce API and OAuth authorization on <a href="http://www.gosuslugi.ru/">www.gosuslugi.ru</a> and if so, when?  This will allow us to create applications and services that could be used to interact with government services ‚Äî for example, so that without transferring passport data to a third party you can send a photo of an incorrectly parked car near our office to the traffic police :) <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>We are planning to work out the possibility of introducing such technologies.</i>  <i>The question of the most convenient use of electronic public services and the creation on their basis of new products, including the commercial sector, is one of our priorities.</i>  <i>But in order for these technologies to work (in particular, OAuth or other Single Sign-On tools), it is necessary to make changes to the regulatory framework.</i>  <i>After that, it will be necessary to refine our mechanisms ( <abbr title="Unified Identification and Authentication System">ESIA</abbr> ) and add the API to gosuslugi.ru.</i>  <i>We are open for potential customers of the API and <abbr title="Single sign-on">SSO to</abbr> express their wishes.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 2.</b> It is interesting, but when will the website <a href="http://www.gosuslugi.ru/">www.gosuslugi.ru</a> start to work like a human being - so that you can fill out the required applications, order services and pay for them?  And what's the use of this site, if you still have to stand in a queue all sorts of BTI, passport desks, traffic police, etc. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>You are right, the way many services are now implemented does not hold water.</i>  <i>In order for the services to be rendered completely electronically, we have planned the connection of the system, expanding the possibilities of paying for various types of services.</i>  <i>Also, in order to reduce visits to the authorities, the infrastructure of qualified electronic signatures for individuals is being developed, which will allow to avoid personal signatures under paper documents.</i>  <i>And by 2015, it is planned to abandon the mandatory documents of personal storage: passports, birth certificates, etc., which will allow for most services, where there is no transfer of physical objects, to completely exclude trips.</i>  <i>The role of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is to create the infrastructure, and specific authorities will provide the services themselves, so they have to do a lot of work on their part, including changes in regulatory documents.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 3.</b> When will it be possible to pay fees, taxes and fines on the website of public services with credit cards? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Now the credit card payment function is implemented only for traffic police fines.</i>  <i>In 2013, it will be possible to pay with a credit card all services and taxes, including those that are not state-owned, but are perceived as such, for example, housing and public utilities.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 4.</b> Despite the adoption of the standard GOST R ISO / IEC 26300-2010 ‚ÄúInformation technology.  Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0 "Websites of government services, departments, etc., continue to provide information in various non-standard formats, often only in them.  Are there any changes planned for this? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>The use of this standard is voluntary.</i>  <i>We will prepare a proposal to consolidate not only this, but also other open standards as binding on government bodies.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 5.</b> When will all government services transfer to the automation of queues, including online recording?  The <abbr title="The Federal Migration Service">FMS</abbr> did a great job (I think), I think it‚Äôs worth going on with the rest of the state.  apparatus. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>The solution to this problem can only be complex.</i>  <i>The task of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is to create the necessary infrastructure for this, including communication channels (reducing digital inequality), interdepartmental interaction, a public services portal (including its API), the use of qualified electronic signatures for citizens and legal entities, a unified identification and authentication system, an electronic notary, a unified the system of normative-reference information and a lot of other activities to prepare the technical base.</i>  <i>Electronic queues are half measures, we want to get rid of queues in general.</i>  <i>Now we are building a joint work with other authorities to make this a reality.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 6. We</b> contacted you on Twitter about the use of the Kazan version of public services in other regions.  You are advised to contact @my_region (Kristina Talanova) with this question.  They do not want to help, because  2 months already "prepare the offer" for other regions. <br><br>  <b>Answer: The</b> <i>Kazan option is to connect non-governmental organizations to the system of inter-agency electronic interaction ( <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> ).</i>  <i>It was an interesting pilot project, which is now being transferred to the federal level.</i>  <i>At the moment, we are developing a general mechanism for connecting non-governmental organizations to <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> .</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 7.</b> Why are some orders issued almost in hindsight?  Regions and departments will never be able to change all their services and software in one or two months (hundreds of disparate services), therefore, common deadlines constantly occur.  For example, the Ordinance ‚ÄúOn Measures to Ensure the Transition of Federal Executive Bodies and Government Extra-budgetary Funds to Interagency Information Interaction in Electronic Form‚Äù.  Total dates from April 1 to July 1 for full integration.  Of course, most regions did not cope with the task. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>See the answer to question number 9.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 8.</b> Do you plan to make or finish the existing well-known <abbr title="Content Management System - Content Management System">CMS</abbr> for use on all government sites?  It should be minimalistic and functional - it will allow to cut budgets for the creation of websites of various ministries and to remove inexperienced specialists from creating such resources. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>We do not see the need to do this at the federal level.</i>  <i>The commercial sector copes with this task.</i>  <i>There are many quite mature products of different levels of functionality and cost that fully meet the current needs of state bodies.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 9.</b> When will the looting of the regions be stopped under the auspices of the introduction of public services?  All over the world: 1) The supplier simply provides a service (the region creates infrastructure, pays for each service 300 thousand rubles in RTK. Only for integration) 2) The variety of services should be leveled by <abbr title="Federal System of Interdepartmental Electronic Interaction">FSMEV</abbr> (we have all the data packed in the archive and Behind the regions. This work should be done by <abbr title="Federal System of Interdepartmental Electronic Interaction">FSMEV</abbr> ) 3) Methodical recommendations are not recommendations, but direct instructions on the development of services?  Recommendations and rules are different concepts.  4) The region is dictated by its vision of <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> and directly <abbr title="Federal System of Interdepartmental Electronic Interaction">put</abbr> pressure on the rejection of integration with <abbr title="Federal System of Interdepartmental Electronic Interaction">FSMEV</abbr> .  But the region pays quite a lot of money only for integration.  5) Service created with violations of rules and standards should not be published.  We have the opposite.  Invalid wsdl, xsd, "empty" service passports.  And they are in productive and have to work with them?  How? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Yes, you are right, everything you named is a serious problem that we are working on purposefully.</i>  <i>First of all, we are going to significantly simplify, in our opinion, the redundant infrastructure of regional <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SIEI</abbr> .</i>  <i>A variety of services will be leveled by new methodical recommendations.</i>  <i>And since they will be very significant, we are going to create reference (open source) implementations of adapters, service emulators and sets of autotests for them.</i>  <i>It also provides for a simpler, but more stringent policy on the registration and validation of (mostly automatic) services in the test and production environment of the <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> .</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 10.</b> When will a single document storage be created?  That it was possible to transfer simple links to documents instead of bulk data in the queries themselves.  Now there is a 5mb limit on ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù, because <abbr title="Service-Oriented Architecture - Service-Oriented Architecture">SOA is</abbr> not document oriented. <br><br>  <b>Answer: You can</b> <i>send a link to a resource in a protected contour instead of the data itself now within a single node, detailed instructions are in the methodological recommendations (Methodological recommendations on the development of electronic services and the use of electronic signature technology in interdepartmental electronic interaction, block description smev: Reference and xop : Include, available on <a href="http://smev.gosuslugi.ru/">smev.gosuslugi.ru</a> ).</i>  <i>Now the concept of transfer of links on the scale of the entire <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> is being developed, basically, this need is dictated by the transfer of cartographic data.</i>  <i>It is unlikely that this will be a single document repository.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 11.</b> How real do you think the commissioning of the federal <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> until the end of the year seems to be, as planned? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>The question is not clarified year.</i>  <i>If we are talking about 2012, then yes, it seems quite real.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 12.</b> When <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> cease to be a garage crafts in their guidelines and will follow international standards?  Structured XML data is structured in order to be transferred not in zip archives.  And now we are doing our bicycle document circulation on archives.  Why then <abbr title="Service-Oriented Architecture - Service-Oriented Architecture">SOA</abbr> architecture? <br><br>  <b>Answer: There are no</b> <i>projects in the world similar in scale to the Russian <abbr title="Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System">SMEV</abbr> .</i>  <i>We have a huge country with a federal structure and a large population.</i>  <i>Many of the difficulties that we face are caused by the effect of scale, which has not yet been encountered in world practice.</i>  <i>Classical service-oriented architecture is also not a panacea, difficulties arise even within small companies, not to mention the scale of the state.</i>  <i>At the same time, the insufficient rigidity of the methodological recommendations, including intentionally made as a compromise with the existing de facto implementations, led to a wide range of private interpretations of the standards, one of which you are talking about.</i>  <i>We will tighten and change a number of standards, create reference implementations of services and adapters and autotest systems for them for a less painful transition to new standards.</i>  <i>However, the problem is more in the original information systems that send and receive requests.</i>  <i>The level of their development, unfortunately, in most cases is very low.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 13.</b> Question on the <abbr title="Universal Electronic Card">UEC</abbr> .  In this project, according to earlier statements, it was decided to combine all that is possible.  And travel tickets, working in different regions, and identity card, and access to the portal of state.  services, and a lot of regional applications, etc ... The introduction of this innovation is constantly delayed, for various reasons.  There is a feeling that it is stated many times more than can be done in a reasonable time.  And, frankly, it is not clear how much it is needed.  And the money invested huge.  The question is: will the state's position on the <abbr title="Universal Electronic Card">UEC</abbr> change?  We have changed both the president and the minister of communications, has the concept changed? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>Indeed, the concept of a universal electronic card ( <abbr title="Universal Electronic Card">UEC</abbr> ) has repeatedly undergone changes.</i>  <i>The position of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media is that, in order to provide state and municipal services in electronic form, as well as a number of other projects, first of all, mechanisms are necessary for citizens to identify and affix a qualified electronic signature.</i>  <i>The implementation of other applications, including payment, may be different, and it is not necessary to use a single card in the form of a <abbr title="Universal Electronic Card">UEC</abbr> or an electronic passport.</i>  <i>The use and selection of additional services is the prerogative of a citizen in the form of voluntary connection to identification tools offered by the government or business.</i>  <i>Our task is to create all the necessary infrastructure for this.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 14.</b> How does the ministry formulate requirements for programs implemented?  (In terms of technologies used. As an example - the choice of software platform for a particular system).  Is there a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù mechanism with the ministry to optimize such requirements? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>None.</i>  <i>This is expressly prohibited by Federal Law No. 94 ‚Äú <a href="http://www.gov-zakupki.ru/zakon/2">On Government Procurement</a> ‚Äù.</i>  <i>This often leads to the fact that the technologies chosen by the contractor hinder the development of the project, or there is no open market for specialists on the selected technological stack, which provides an unjustified advantage for the contractor in further tenders.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, there is no universal solution to this problem.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  <b>Question 15:</b> In the local (Novosibirsk) news, information slipped that hundreds of millions have already been spent on <abbr title="Information system">IP</abbr> for municipal structures over a period of 3-5 years, but the system has not been put into operation.  With such a pace of development, I fear it is morally obsolete.  Also in a recent article on Habr√©, partially refuted the information on one item (on the national platform), but the question of e-government and IP remained open.  As you can see and how is planned the development of federal and municipal <abbr title="Information system">IP</abbr> .  Will it be modular and commissioned in part as the modules are ready?  Wouldn't it be wiser to develop a unified system based on one region, and then introduce it everywhere? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <i>It is not very clear what kind of information system we are talking about.</i>  <i>If you clarify a question, we will prepare an answer within a reasonable time.</i> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font> <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uTxBUlBShaLBBUOwE7XGxKd5AySVWoL9dxVbJ9oVxc/edit">Full list of questions</a> <br><br>  Next on the list are questions on the development of the IT industry, then on communications and postal services, and the minister will answer the last 10 questions on the list.
