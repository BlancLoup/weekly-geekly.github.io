  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impact of the portal on corporate culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Corporate culture is a phenomenon directly related to the organization's personnel, values, norms, rules, patterns of behavior of people in the company.  According to the interpretation of the personnel management dictionary, the corporate culture is a system of declared values, norms, rules, patterns of behavior of employees of the organization, purposefully formed by the management team, the ideal desired image that the management team would like to see its organization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Positive impact</b> <br><br>  First, the portal helps new employees adapt to the new work environment and corporate culture.  The newcomer receives exhaustive information about ‚Äúhow we do it‚Äù - how the holidays are going, whether it is customary to celebrate them, meaningful dates for the company, values, goals, where and how to solve emerging issues, where you can smoke, eventually.  Intranet also forms a novice image of the company and creates an adequate vision of the organization's policy.  Every employee should have access to reliable information about the company, its history, structure, leadership, traditions and rules. <br><br>  Secondly, everything that can be written down - mission, goal tree, job descriptions, local regulations, answers to "sick" questions, feedback from employees, polls, rational suggestions - can be put on the portal.  Thus, you will not have to repeat many times the beaten truths and doubt that you have not been heard.

      The informative and communicative function of the corporate portal is equally important.  If the main postulate of the organization is informational openness, then the portal should become a platform for discussing all sorts of pressing issues that inevitably arise in the work of any company.  Discussions, gossip and speculation in the smoking room do not ennoble the image of the average employee.  If a person finds all the necessary information on the internal site, then the degree of private-conversations will noticeably decrease, and the latest news from the corporate site may be added to the topics of conversations. <br><br>  Experienced Human Resource specialists share the experience that forums and chats existing on the local network, in which employees can discuss the problems of the organization, make it possible to establish not only vertical, but also horizontal communications between employees. <br><br>  <b>We analyze the components</b> <br><br>  The components of corporate culture are traditionally considered to be: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ adopted leadership system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ conflict resolution styles; <br>  ‚Ä¢ current communication system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ position of the individual in the organization; <br>  ‚Ä¢ accepted symbolism: slogans, organizational taboos, rituals. <br><br>  Most of the tasks are successfully solved with the help of a corporate portal.  The site is not one-way communication.  It can easily become a convenient platform for all sorts of research staff - it can be surveys about the needs, opinions and attitudes of employees, identifying their level of loyalty to the company.  To create a truly sustainable organization, it is important to understand the level of employee satisfaction with the work process.  This will reduce staff turnover, and therefore - to declare itself as a sustainable, stable organization. <br><br>  <b>Negative impact - single case</b> <br><br>  According to experts, the portal may not affect the corporate culture, only in one case - if it is uninteresting and unreadable.  A negative impact is possible if the content publishes information that does not correspond to reality.  For example, a company anthem is laid out, which supposedly employees must sing every day at the workplace. <br><br>  However, there are other very curious examples.  The world-famous catering chain McDonald's has a developed interesting internal website, and songs and legends are made up about the policy of the Team Building company.  The team spirit is reflected in everything - in advertising materials and slogans, in the format of building work, HR-experts speak these values ‚Äã‚Äãwith newcomers and experienced employees over and over again.  People from the staff of these fast-food restaurants seem to be zombie. <br><br>  The portal is one of the most powerful tools for building a strong cohesive team.  But in retaliation for the prevailing corporate spirit, the McDonald's group of enterprising employees created their own internal website - a regular forum where you can unnoticed by the management complain about the severity of their fate.  The forum was very popular until it was closed.  Either at the initiative of the company‚Äôs management, or because the organizers themselves lost interest, but one conclusion is clear - give your employees the opportunity to complain.  They will thank you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156201/</a></p>
