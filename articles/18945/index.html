      A dozen virtual friends and hundreds of friends of your friends - more fertile ground for recruiting future colleagues.  Work sites are trying to socialize, but so far unsuccessfully.  ‚ÄúHeadhunter‚Äù opened the web of professional dating Webby.ru and the collective blog Live.hh.ru, but the Eychary and the managers are silent about them.  Still, it is not ‚Äúheadhunters‚Äù who argue in the categories of personnel branding and reputational risks that sign social networks are doing now, but physicists and mathematicians who created ‚ÄúMoykrug‚Äù or civic journalism enthusiasts who themselves invented that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  1. <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My circle</a> <br>  More than a million registered users.  Each of them has a profile on the site with personal, professional, contact information, a list of interests.  And of course - with a circle of friends who can tell a lot to the employer about the opportunities and status of a person.  ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù is number one among social projects that facilitate recruitment, and not only in the exchange of vacancies and resumes.  Maya Kozlova: ‚ÄúEven if a social network user is not looking for work, he can recommend someone from his friends.‚Äù  In the poster this way 20-30% of employees were found.  Convenient "My Circle" and to collect information about the candidates. <br><br>  There is a fat minus (this is my subjective opinion).  ‚ÄúMy circle‚Äù is a big ‚Äúnotebook‚Äù.  Many potential applicants are disappointed in the site.  Well, fill out a resume, well, invite friends - what's next?  I will not constantly look at vacancies.  And blogs on the site are unlikely to develop, given that Yandex recently launched a blog hosting service for Ya.ru.  It is said that the increase in the audience of "My Circle" slowed down. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://filip.habrahabr.ru/blog/21025.html">Habrahabr</a> <br>  It is the emphasis on blogs that makes ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù interesting for the employer.  If a potential candidate keeps a blog and leaves comments on other people's notes, you can get to know him much better than by reading the sample resume. <br><br>  Two nuances on "Habr√©" greatly reduce its recruiting power.  IT specialization and the rudiment of the "Job" section: there is not even a search in it.  It remains for me to post a vacancy, leaf through a resume and, if you have time, track down interesting candidates on blogs.  It is very tiring. </blockquote><br><br>  On Habrahabr and in My Circle, I received less feedback than working sites.  But on the ‚Äúpersonal affairs‚Äù of the candidates, it became clear which of them should be met. In my case, practically with no one.  But saved time.  True, completely different perspectives open up if you study the resume and the environment of their authors on their own, but this simply may not be the time. <br><br>  In any case, social networks greatly brought their users closer to the state of implicit interviews, but use their capabilities incompletely.  And more importantly, they have not yet come up with ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù that would attract the maximum number of active applicants and employers to them. <br><br>  <strong>3. Two "big ideas" and experimental romp</strong> <br><br>  These "big ideas" have long become an open secret: competition for the rating followed by the distribution of elephants and the service of career referees. <br><br><blockquote>  1. The career referrals service is already active on the <a href="http://www.job24.ru/">Job24</a> site.  The employer announces a vacancy, after which anyone can recommend it to someone.  If successful, the employer pays the referee 20% of the salary of the new employee.  For the first two months, Job24 employed only 3 people.  No wonder: it is easy to find free advisers in My Circle.  In addition, due to the red tape with accounts, some managers cannot pay 1000 rubles for a banal advertisement of vacancies.  What to say about the fifth part of the salary of a good specialist. <br><br>  But to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpaid referees is not worth it.  As Leonid Belikov said, recently their company conducted a ‚Äúviral‚Äù action ‚ÄúInvite a programmer - get $ 500‚Äù.  They placed a test for a programmer on their website and sent a link to it to their friends.  Now the right people found, and the mediators got their money. <br><br>  2. Site users compete in professional self-expression - they keep blogs.  The result - the selection of the most competent in the business.  Leaders of the rating are awarded employment or one-time, but tangible material benefits.  Something similar is now being implemented on the website for office workers <a href="http://grumy.ru/">Grumi.ru</a> .  The rating of users is on "Habr√©", but it acts more like carefree phallometry.  Because it is not the professional quality (resume) of a person that is being evaluated, but, for example, his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/25487.html">experiments with Mamba</a> (which I, by the way, myself enjoyed with pleasure).  A separate topic is how to calculate such a rating so that it reflects only the professionalism of users and gives employers the picture they need. </blockquote><br><br>  Maybe I was wrong.  There are many websites that experiment not with ‚Äúbig stimulating ideas‚Äù, but with the organizational and technical side of things.  RBC launched <a href="http://ulov-umov.ru/">Ulovumov</a> , a search engine for vacancies and resumes all over the Internet.  <a href="http://www.hrhome.ru/index.php">Eychar Home</a> offers place job simultaneously on multiple sites.  ‚Äú <a href="http://bimbim.ru/">Bimbim</a> ‚Äù - sell yourself or buy candidates at auction.  Having seen enough of everything over the past 80 years on the Internet, I realized that he was completely unpredictable - even a stick could "shoot" here.  Perhaps Judgment Day will come and the <a href="http://monsterrussia.ru/">Monster</a> will devour everyone.  At least, as Maya Kozlova told me, it‚Äôs impossible to do without work sites: they help to compile salary statistics. <br><br>  <strong>Sitemap for a small employer for 2008</strong> <br><br>  <em>Getting ready to go out</em> <br>  Grumy.ru - office competition and selection of the best. <br>  Gooroo.ru - promises to do so, "so that young talents do not sit down their pants in companies-losers, and highly professional managers solve problems corresponding to their level." <br>  Whatdoyoudo.ru is only known that this is a ‚Äúweb-dance‚Äù working site. <br>  Funkyjob.ru - going to offer "unique methods of searching / hiring staff, additional income." <br><br>  <em>Social networks and community blogs</em> <br>  Moikrug.ru <br>  Habrahabr.ru <br>  Free-lance.ru <br>  <a href="http://yaca.blogs.yandex.ru/yca/Business/Employment/">Blogosphere communities</a> <br><br>  <em>Ongoing experiments</em> <br>  Job24.ru - paid candidates recommender <br>  Ulov-umov.ru - search engine vacancies and resumes on the working sites of the RuNet. <br>  HRhome.ru - publisher of vacancies on the working sites of Runet. <br>  Bimbim.ru - auction of vacancies and resumes. <br><br>  <em>Universal Sites</em> <em><br></em>  <em>(Top 5 "Rambler")</em> <br>  Headhunter.ru <br>  Rabota.ru <br>  Job.ru <br>  Superjob.ru <br>  Joblist.ru <br><br>  <em><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_job/profile">Specialized sites</a> (good selection in LJ)</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18945/</a></p>
