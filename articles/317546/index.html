The material is aimed at people promoting startups.  The format of the performances: stage, live audience, projection of the presentation file. <br><br>  For people with little experience, this is a short tutorial.  And for those who have already ‚Äúeaten the dog‚Äù - this is a checklist to check the readiness and quality of the presentation. <br><br>  Used notes from events:

      1. ‚Äú <i>Oratory</i> ‚Äù, Robert Menegulov;  11/19/2009, Volunteer Translators League ‚ÄúNead For Speak‚Äù, Center ‚ÄúSelat‚Äù, Kazan. <br>  2. ‚Äú <i>Presentation of innovative projects</i> ‚Äù, Theos Samfost;  11/26/2009, in the framework of the seminar ‚ÄúMovement to success‚Äù, Innovative Technopark ‚ÄúIdea‚Äù, Kazan. <br>  + personal skills. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Presentation preparation </h1><br><h2>  Content </h2><br>  1. Be sure to have diagrams, numbers, diagrams, pictures, tables. <br>  2. The presentation should not contain the entire text of the speech!  It should have a visual representation of information for additional assimilation and that which is poorly perceived by hearing, for example numbers. <br>  3. Do not forget that the juice of the speech should be in live communication, and not in the slide show. <br>  4. The sequence should be logical. <br>  5. A clear structure corresponding to the performance plan should be tracked. <br>  6. It is advisable to suppress the temptation to use animation tricks. <br><ul><li>  <i>A whirling logo in the footer, for example, can be very distracting.</i> </li><li>  <i>Changing objects on a slide on a click is the risk of disrupting the demonstration script for technical reasons.</i> </li><li>  <i>If dynamic visualization is needed within the meaning, then it is better to copy the entire slide and make changes to it.</i>  <i>In this way, you can even emphasize the importance of a separate element of the slide.</i>  <i>Example: select a keyword by creating a copy of the slide on which it is highlighted, and the rest of the copy is unchanged.</i> </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Specifically for innovative projects </h3><br>  1. Relevance of the topic. <br>  2. A brief introduction to the subject area. <br>  3. Disclosure of technical features of the solution. <br>  4. Prove innovative solutions. <br>  5. To review the competing, related products. <br>  6. Show the benefits of the solution. <br>  7. Planned market share, revenue, in numbers. <br>  8. Stage of project implementation. <br>  9. Plan for further development. <br>  10. What are the investments and labor resources needed. <br><br><h2>  Registration </h2><br>  1. If the presentation is conducted on behalf of a particular enterprise, it is necessary to receive recommendations for its design in accordance with the company's corporate style.  Be sure to use the company logo. <br>  2. If the presentation contains information about the cooperation of companies, then you can use the logos of both partners. <br>  3. It is highly desirable to use the status bar or page numbering (current and total number) so that the viewer knows how much is left.  It is possible to use various techniques to achieve this goal, for example, to make several blocks with a gradation of the same color in the header or at the bottom of the page, paint the last slides in a rich, but not bright tone, highlight the current one, and the future ones - pale. <br>  4. It‚Äôs better to do a lot of slides than to pile each one with too much information. <br><br><h1>  Speech to the audience </h1><br><h2>  Preparation for performance </h2><br><h3>  Questions to ask yourself </h3><br>  1. How to persuade the audience to your side?  Think through a strategy of persuasion. <br>  2. What do we know about the audience?  Collect information. <br>  3. What are the central ideas of the show? <br>  4. What ideas can be grouped together? <br>  5. Do these groups reflect the optimal performance structure? <br><br><h3>  What should be done before the show? </h3><br>  1. Understand your fears. <br>  2. Present your success. <br>  3. Practice in front of the mirror. <br>  4. Prepare yourself clues in the text. <br>  5. Prepare audiovisual tools. <br>  6. Test equipment. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Any technical problems distract attention, confuse both the public and the speaker.</i> </li><li>  <i>If the slides are shown in the dark, then you need to stand up so as not to cast a shadow on them, but the face to be highlighted.</i> </li></ul><br>  7. Than to poke a finger at the monitor or cast a shadow by hand, showing the important, it is better to get a pointer - laser or other, at least a pen, and use it. <br>  8. If there are any dynamic events in the presentation, and you need an operator to help them turn on in time, then you should rehearse it in advance. <br>  9. Familiarize yourself with the place of performance.  Prepare the conditions: air temperature, lighting, ventilation. <br>  10. Choose a suit suitable for the occasion, put it in order. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>The suit and the image of the speaker as a whole should not distract from the presentation itself.</i> </li><li>  <i>You should feel comfortable in this dress.</i> </li></ul><br>  11. Relax before the show. <br>  12. Immediately before the performance, experience any physical activity in order to distribute adrenaline throughout the body.  But, of course, not sweating;) <br>  13. You can not memorize speech by heart, too much to repeat it. <br>  14. When the public has gathered, you need to ask if they can clearly see the projected slide, whether it is light enough, not too bright, not a small font.  You can do this setup slide. <br>  15. Be sure to ask to turn off the sound of mobile phones.  Calls distract not only the speaker, but also the entire public. <br><br><h3>  Performance plan </h3><br>  1. It is necessary to formulate the central ideas, main ideas, theses.  There may be 3, 5, 7. They must correspond to groups of ideas. <br>  2. If the task is to convince the audience of something, to persuade them to make a certain decision, then it is recommended to use the theses in the following order: strong, weak, very strong.  The weakest thesis does not use at all. <br>  3. Prepare a conclusion, conclusions, resolution. <br>  4. However, one cannot act as a robot, be too logical, structure information too clearly. <br>  5. Prepare for discussion and possible questions. <br><br><ul><li>  <i><b>Cunning number 1</b> : Ask yourself three questions and give three ready-made answers.</i> </li><li>  <i><b>Trick number 2</b> : Deliberately admit two weak points in the presentation in order to successfully answer questions about them.</i> </li></ul><br><h2>  During the performance </h2><br><h3>  Speech </h3><br>  1. Speak loudly and clearly, but do not always keep the same volume level.  Monotonous speech is worse absorbed. <br>  2. Do not chatter, but do not put to sleep the public. <br>  3. Insert a short pause, as if to think, to give time to digest what he heard. <br>  4. Use your wits - jokes attract attention and set up in a positive way. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>It is not always necessary to use the prepared jokes, they may be out of place.</i> </li><li>  <i>It is better not to joke at all if you are speaking to foreigners or in a foreign language.</i> </li><li>  <i>Do not joke too often.</i> </li></ul><br>  5. Do not repeat the same thought many times in different words. <br>  6. If you have to read a lot of text from paper, then you should read it as if it were your free speech, and not as a test for reading speed. <br><br><ul><li>  <i>You can look through the text in small pieces and retell in your own words.</i> </li><li>  <i>After reading a small excerpt from the sheet, it is necessary to translate the view to the public, and then back to paper.</i> </li><li>  <i>Check whether the students understood the information.</i> </li></ul><br>  7. The amount of information produced should be commensurate with the time for its assimilation.  It is best to be concise, explain the essence in brief and pay more attention to specific issues. <br>  8. Round up in time, do not delay the speech. <br><br><h3>  Public contact </h3><br>  1. Communicate with the audience, not with the screen. <br>  2. If the public‚Äôs attention fades away, you can slightly tone down the tone so that people listen, afraid to miss something interesting and important. <br>  3. Constantly analyze students, receive non-verbal feedback. <br>  4. Eye contact: 30% of the time to look at the very center of the audience, the rest is to look around the listeners' faces, not forgetting about the listeners sitting on the periphery. <br>  5. Do not look somewhere above the public, at one point, do not keep your eyes above the surface, but do not sharpen your eyes on a particular person. <br><br><h3>  Awkward situations: way out </h3><br>  1. As a reaction to events, you can laugh at yourself without losing self-esteem. <br>  2. If you are nervous, you will be given reflex movements with your hands, for example, torsion of a button.  It distracts attention, it is worth looking after yourself. <br>  3. Do not hide your hands behind your back.  The attention of the audience is distracted by the question: what are you hiding there? <br>  4. You are a person who is allowed to make mistakes, and it even looks cute.  You can make a mistake somewhere, but correct it. <br>  5. If you lose your thought or forget something, ask the audience a question, it will give time to collect your thoughts. <br>  6. If there are people who are not interested mostly in the information that you are carrying, ask them to leave the audience (this applies mainly to lectures and reports). <br>  7. If a stormy, closed discussion begins in a certain corner, then we must stop and look in that direction, achieve silence. <br><br><h3>  After performance </h3><br>  1. To summarize the meeting. <br>  2. Be sure to thank the audience. <br>  3. Do not delay people. <br>  4. You can stay for fees yourself to give you an opportunity to come and talk in person. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317546/</a></p>
