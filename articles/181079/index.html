Of course, it is very important to choose a theme for the book and correctly title it, but this task turns out to be difficult if the theme of the book is very conceptual.  Many books are devoted only to one or another level of programming, such as object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design, object-oriented programming, design patterns, object-oriented data (XML), unified modeling language (UML), object-oriented web development , object-oriented mobile development, various object-oriented programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand many other topics related to object orientation.

      However, when studying all these books, many people forget that all these diverse topics are built on one basic concept: object-oriented thinking.  Often, both professional programmers and students embark on the study of such books, without bothering to first understand the design concepts underlying the code. <br><br>  I dare say that the study of object-oriented concepts is not limited to the study of a specific development method, programming language or set of design tools.  An object-oriented approach to work is, in essence, a way of thinking.  It is about object-oriented thinking and tells this book. <br><br><h4>  The target audience </h4><br>  This book is a general introduction to fundamental object-oriented concepts.  All theoretical calculations are supported by code examples.  One of the most difficult tasks was to simultaneously ensure the conceptuality of the entire code and form a solid code base.  The purpose of this book is to help the reader understand concepts and technology without directly referring to the compiler.  If you are going to work with the compiler, then the code from the book should be executed and examined. <br><br>  The target audience of this book includes managers, designers, developers, programmers, project managers, as well as all other readers who want to get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãobject orientation.  After studying this book, you will gain good basic knowledge that will help you when reading other books on topics related to object orientation. <br><br><h4>  How is this book built </h4><br>  So, I am deeply convinced that you first need to master the process of object-oriented thinking, and only then proceed to the study of a specific programming language or modeling.  This book contains many code examples and UML diagrams.  However, you can start reading a book without knowing a particular object-oriented language or UML.  But if I have already said so much about concepts, then why is there so much Java, C # .NET, VB .NET, and Objective-C code in the book, as well as so many UML diagrams?  First, they illustrate the story well.  Secondly, such examples are very important for understanding object orientation and should be considered already at a basic level.  I don‚Äôt want to elaborate on Java, C # .NET, VB .NET, Objective-C, or UML, but I want to use them as a material illustrating basic concepts. <br><br>  Also note that I use UML class diagrams specifically as illustrations to study classes, their attributes and methods.  In fact, class diagrams are the only UML component covered in this book.  I believe such diagrams are great for representing the conceptual nature of object models.  In the future, I continue to use object models as a visual aid in explaining the structure of classes and their relationships. <br><br>  In examples of the code to this book, in particular, such entities as cycles and functions are described.  But to understand these concepts it is not necessary to understand the code itself in detail.  If you are interested in details, it is better to have a book on hand that tells you about the syntax of a particular language. <br><br>  Once again, this book does not teach Java, C # .NET, VB .NET, Objective-C, or UML ‚Äî there is already extensive literature on all these topics.  I hope that my book will arouse your interest in other aspects of object orientation: analysis, design and, of course, programming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181079/</a></p>
