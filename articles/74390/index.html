  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Light VPS image</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The VPS service on Hyper-V has been around for some time, but it has already gained a well-deserved popularity.  This is not to say that this service is perfect (there are no perfect services), but it is very useful for the client.  Usually, VPS is taken by those customers who already have few limits provided by hosting, and it is still too early to buy / rent a whole server.  According to my observations, 90% of the stable and <b>not rapidly</b> growing projects are undergoing the VPS stage.  Now I don‚Äôt consider large-scale start-ups that have investments and usually buy a complete set of hardware right away, as well as business cards sites, which can consist of one page. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Technically, Hyper-V VPS is a set of giant VPS servers running MS Win2008 server, each of which runs a set of client virtual Hyper-V machines.  Appropriately, each client has its own virtual machine, completely isolated from the rest.  Like a real machine, an operating system must be installed on a virtual one, and from the very beginning we were interested in the question of how this process can be optimized.  The fact is that the OS is not installed instantly, even with the Hyper-V ‚Äúscam‚Äù (such as the extreme read-write speed of disks).  Win2008WE on HyperV-256 is set, for example, 3 hours.  Plus post-tuning, which also takes time ... It turns out sub-optimal, because you need to constantly monitor a number of active installations.  Plus, to slow down a client who has already paid for the service and does not long to wait.

      Help came from no waiting - the existing DotNetPanel hosting control panel, as it turned out, is able to work with auto-deployment of images.  He knows how to conceal, pretty corny, but at least somehow ... <br>  What can DNP itself: <br><ul><li>  Copy HyperV Server Virtual Disk Image </li><li>  Stretch this disk to the size determined by the tariff. </li><li>  Mount a disk to replace files on it (the disk must be only FAT32 or NTFS) </li><li>  Replace the predefined variables in the file set (manually specified).  The set of variables includes the IP address, user name and password, and tdp </li></ul>  The functional, as you can see, is not rich.  But it is better than complete nothing. <br><br>  Having on hand this functionality we set to prepare images for auto-installation of systems.  Of course, the MS Win2008 server in various versions has become the most ‚Äúpromising‚Äù option - it is not difficult to prepare it and install it conveniently.  The second big way was Debian Linux - also extremely popular among (the most popular in Linux).  When the popularity of the service began to grow, we added Ubuntu Server and CentOS, and then FreeBSD.  The latter had to suffer a lot, since the implementation of APIC in MS Hyper-V is different from real hardware.  And the ‚Äúclean‚Äù installation of FreeBSD has a strange glitch - it does not turn off.  That is, in general, and in any way.  At the stage of ‚Äúcutting down the power now‚Äù, the machine hangs and no longer reacts to external stimuli.  I had to sweat a lot to catch this bug and eliminate it (thanks to the unknown Japanese comrades for the patch for IO-APIC). <br>  All the above images are clean ‚Äúempty‚Äù operating systems designed for the incoming client to install the software he needs.  In principle, this is how it happens most often, a technically savvy client perfectly puts everything he needs (well, he is well aware of what he needs and where to get it).  However, there are a certain number of clients who are not technically savvy, and are switching to HyperV precisely (and only) because they lack the hosting tariff.  And some of these clients in the word "server" does not understand anything.  For these clients, we also collected several images - with a pre-installed set of software.  Namely: <br><ul><li>  Windows server + IIS + ASP + MSSQL - Windows platform for web </li><li>  Windows server + IIS + PHP + MySQL - hybrid :) </li><li>  Windows server + Apache + mod_php + MySQL - for windows lovers </li><li>  Linux + Apache + PHP + MySQL - Standard Linux Web </li></ul>  Such a server is ready for work (hosting) immediately after deployment and requires almost no configuration - for a non-specialist this is very convenient.  Although I personally don‚Äôt welcome such an approach (IMHO, anyone who understands this business should be involved in any business) - this image is very popular and is actively used by customers. <br><br>  And now a little about the future.  Everything changes, and in the IT world everything changes very quickly.  By this, I want to ask the respected habr-community to voice what, in the opinion of the community, there are not enough images.  wishes I ask to make out in the form of the comment and (or) send me <a href="">an email</a> .  We already had a few ideas on this topic, but the idea without support is dead.  And I don't want to stamp images for the sake of images.  I promise personally that the most popular images will go to realization. <br><br>  Thanks for reading us :) <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Pavel Rudnitsky (habrauser logan) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74390/</a></p>
