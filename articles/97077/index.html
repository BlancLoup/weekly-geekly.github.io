Additionally, with the release of this version, WEBO CDN has become available for wide use. <br><br>  About the product: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/site-speedup/">www.webogroup.com/ru/home/site-speedup</a> <br>  Download: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/download/">www.webogroup.com/en/home/download</a> <br><br>  And now more <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What's new </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20e/a2a/948/20ea2a948c5dff7ed77cc8015587d787.png" alt="SaaS version"><br><ul><li>  <strong>SaaS version</strong> .  Now all the features of the full version are available in continuous consumption mode of the internal balance of the application ( <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/3c8/6a7/31d3c86a723d27a5d561be47740697ae.png" alt="(w)">  - we have not yet come up with a name for this currency, but we will be grateful for the options).  You can connect only the necessary features, and easily switch between different configurations, for example, at the moment of traffic influx (turn on extreme acceleration) or its decline (connect free configuration).  Balance replenishment is now possible to accomplish in many ways, and it is possible to purchase accelerations for a month, or for just 10 years ahead.  No restrictions. </li><li>  <strong>Reworked server caching mechanism</strong> .  We didn‚Äôt have time to add popular memory storage engines (Memcached, APC, etc.) to the current version, but they will be added this month.  Additionally, the ‚ÄúExtreme Mode‚Äù setting of caching has become available, which allows you to make the site just lightning fast, while retaining all the basic functionality.  WordPress users were especially lucky: the corresponding plugin was reworked, and now it is even better in terms of the performance of the caching characteristics of its closest analogues - W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache and Hyper Cache.  Additionally, adjustments were made to the logic, and now all known mobile browsers are correctly supported. </li><li>  <strong>Significantly improved work with CDN.</strong>  Added the ability to distribute not only images, but also stylesheets and scripts, support for working in protected mode, automatically uploading files via FTP, several well-known options for CDN, and WEBO CDN, covering the whole territory of Russia (available only in SaaS version). </li><li> <strong>Improved delayed loading</strong> .  The main scourge of social sites - popular JavaScript widgets - began to hit on performance noticeably less.  This became available with the removal of their load on the <code>window.onload</code> event, which corresponds to the "Improved mode" in the "Unobtrusive JavaScript" settings.  <a href="http://webo.in/articles/all/2010/07-langocity.com/">The introduction of</a> <a href="http://webo.in/articles/all/2010/06-be-healthy-vllv.ru/">several sites</a> promedonstriroval 2-3-fold acceleration according to the Google Webmasters panel.  Also added support for about 10 other known JavaScript widgets to the common piggy bank. </li><li>  <strong>Added a few useful settings</strong> for finer optimization control: now you can exclude files not only from the union, but also from minimization and automatically remove duplicates of known libraries (jQuery, Prototype, MooTools, YUI).  Additionally, adjustments have been made to most optimization algorithms to make them more stable and reliable. </li><li>  Added support for CS-Cart (at the level of the system add-on), X-Cart and Magento (apparently, we will soon have a module for the latest system). </li><li>  And many other smaller improvements (in the user's appearance, definition of the server environment, help texts, etc.) </li></ul>

    <h3>  WEBO CDN </h3><br>  With the release of version 1.2.0, we officially announce the arrival of a consumer CDN (content delivery network) in Russia.  Now, to use it, you do not need any technical knowledge, many hours of implementation and testing.  Simply <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/download/">load WEBO Site SpeedUp</a> for your favorite platform, install it, get the SaaS key on the Personal Data page and enable WEBO CDN (on the Setup page in any configuration, CDN tab), remembering to specify which files via WEBO CDN to give out. <br><br>  Charging using CDN is more than modest.  The basic version (up to 10 GB of traffic per month) costs about 105 rubles (35 <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/3c8/6a7/31d3c86a723d27a5d561be47740697ae.png" alt="(w)">  per day, 1 <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/3c8/6a7/31d3c86a723d27a5d561be47740697ae.png" alt="(w)">  approximately equal to 0.1 ruble), an advanced version - 450 rubles (up to 50 GB of traffic) and extreme - 810 rubles (up to 100 GB of traffic).  If you are interested in professional use of CDN in Russia, then additional options <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/corporate/cdn/">can be found here</a> (besides WEBO CDN, WEBO CDN Mirror and WEBO CDN Geo Mirror are available). <br><br>  Using CDN allows you to: <br><ul><li>  Increase the regional accessibility of your site, reducing the load time resources for end users. </li><li>  Increase website loading speed by reducing the network overhead for loading static data. </li><li>  Remove the burden of servicing users from your main server by mirroring the resources of your site. </li><li>  Increase the resiliency and security of the site by using server capacities that are available 24 hours a day and which cannot be fully loaded during a DDoS attack. </li></ul><br>  The WEBO CDN product line basically uses the infrastructure of the largest Russian content delivery network <a href="http://ngenix.net/">NGENIX CDN</a> ( <a href="http://ngenix.net/network.html">NGENIX Content Delivery Network</a> ).  The NGENIX CDN network consists of 14 multiservice platforms deployed in 7 federal districts of the Russian Federation and in Ukraine.  Distributed platforms NGENIX interacts through direct peer-to-peer interfaces with more than 350 telecom operators, which allows delivering content to end users via the shortest network route at high speed and without delays. <br><br>  The NGENIX CDN network provides daily access to popular news and entertainment resources for the multi-million Russian Internet audience, speeds up the download of music, games, movies and software, ensures comfortable viewing of your favorite TV programs, videos and live broadcasts on the Internet.  Today, dozens of Russian and Western companies use the services of NGENIX CDN, including Rutube, SUP, VGTRK and Microsoft. <br><br><h3>  Future plans </h3><br>  Already, various caching engines are being added to increase server caching performance.  It‚Äôs also obvious that the Joomla! Performance problem will be somehow solved.  (due to selective block caching), and database query caching will be enabled (for all platforms supported at the system add-on level, now it's WordPress, Joomla !, Drupal, Bitrix, CS-Cart). <br><br>  In addition, we plan to rework the product configuration mechanism for each site used, so that the main configuration problems are resolved in (semi) automatic mode, and the webmaster is only required to install the product and enable the setup wizard (which will figure out what is good for the site and what is not ).  Then the acceleration of sites will really be possible "in 1 click." <br><br>  Naturally, we always welcome new ideas or intelligible error messages.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/issues/list">The bug tracker</a> will soon mark the 500 entry, which is good news. <br><br>  And thanks to everyone who supports us: for us it really matters. <br><br>  About the product: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/site-speedup/">www.webogroup.com/ru/home/site-speedup</a> <br>  Download: <a href="http://www.webogroup.com/ru/home/download/">www.webogroup.com/en/home/download</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97077/</a></p>
