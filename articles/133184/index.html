  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How corporate-secret becomes publicly explicit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to a survey conducted on the portal "Professionals.ru" this spring, <b>about 2/3 of the employees cause confidential information leakage</b> .  Probably, in most cases, the leakage occurs unintentionally: it would seem that he took the work home or fell ill and asked that the documents be sent to you, and now the intellectual property left the limits allowed to it.  However, this is probably the most innocuous scenario, events can develop many times more tragic.  Imagine that a personal laptop / phone / smartphone or other kind of device was lost due to carelessness, and now two types of property were freely available. <br><ul><li>  65% of people traveling with laptops <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204226204576600531532461052.html%3FKEYWORDS%3DPonemon%2BInstitute">admit</a> that they never perplexed themselves with information security issues on their computers.  Meanwhile, according to statistics from London Heathrow Airport, about 900 laptops are stolen within the air terminal within a year. </li></ul>  The same can be said about phones.  Being busy people, we all prefer to leave access to their accounts open.  No wonder, because the authorization procedure takes so much power, and why is it on your own electronic device?  Particularly forgetful even allocate a special folder in the inbox, into which passwords are collected for everything and everything.  All this provides unhindered access to information, the harm from the use of which can be enormous. <br><br>  <b>Another scourge of modern times is social networks.</b> <b><a name="habracut"></a></b>  <b>who played with many a cruel joke.</b>  Believing the name and goal-setting of these resources, we see in them, first of all, platforms for companionship in leisure hours.  However, somehow it turns out by itself that half of our list of "friends" are colleagues, including managers, most of the pages we are subscribed to are about work, and absolutely everything can be viewed by our profile and activity.  Thus, the information about each of us turns out to be a blue saucer lying in the center with a white branding inscription. <br><br>  Industrial espionage penetrates socially and slowly.  network, using the intrusion of all available methods: from spam bots and sending messages with malicious links to hacking account. <br><ul><li>  According to Facebook statistics, 600 thousand pages of daily unplanned change of the owner, and <a href="http://www.xakep.ru/post/57648/default.asp">each 60 entry on the resource</a> is malicious. </li><li>  Last year's Cisco <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/395254.php%3Fsphrase_id%3D857514">survey</a> (500 IT professionals from companies in the USA, Germany, Japan, China and India) showed that 51% of respondents ranked social networks as the TOP 3 most dangerous tools in terms of corporate security.  Every fifth pushes them to the first place. </li></ul>  The trend of the last time is blocking access to social networks from workplaces.  (According to <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/career/news/1302390/dve_treti_rossiyan_zhaluyutsya_na_blokirovanie_dostupa_v">Superjob</a> , the number of locks in our country has reached 63%, which is higher than the "average world" figure of 56% (according to <a href="http://www.clearswift.com/news/press-releases/worldwide-clampdown-on-technology-as-businesses-overreact-to-high-profile-data-breaches">ClearSwift</a> )).  However, there are more liberal solutions to the problem, for example, <b>sets of rules for the safe use of social resources for IT services</b> , <a href="http://www.iksmedia.ru/search/3356539.html">written by software developers</a> .

      Nevertheless, as practice shows, social networks still find ways to disrupt the steady flow of corporate life.  The Wall Street Journal states: the shortest and cheapest way to company secrets is through them.  For example, the vice-president of a corporation <b>talked about the impending bankruptcy of the company</b> in correspondence with the ‚Äúvirtual spy‚Äù on Facebook.  An information security specialist, who loved social networks and graphic images, <b>declassified his trip to Interpol</b> by posting photos of nearby places on twitter.  And these are the ‚Äúhard‚Äù risks associated with disclosing financial statements and strategic plans.  And the image component?  Reputational risks?  How to regulate this channel of information? <br><br>  Gartner <a href="http://www.osp.ru/news/articles/2011/4/13007748/">proposes a</a> set of corporate rules governing social behavior that promote "rules of good taste and common sense, as well as the norms of behavior adopted by the company" when communicating in social networks.  So, IBM introduced its guidelines for covering the company's activities on blogs <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jasnell/entry/blogging_ibm%3Flang%3Den">back in 2005</a> .  But, as they say, ‚Äúyou cannot sew your head on‚Äù - companies can only rely on the very ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù of their employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133184/</a></p>
