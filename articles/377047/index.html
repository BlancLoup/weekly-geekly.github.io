And today we‚Äôll talk about one of these - close the browser tabs with currency rates and store popcorn. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/gtlab/blog/246754/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f0/576/4bb/0f05764bbe2a47239bdef388f16e8571.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Recently, manufacturers of TV technology in the struggle for the buyer are doing their best: they can either bend the TV, then the OLED panel will roll out half a million rubles before the crisis, then they will come up with a new resolution - 4k2k.  Unfortunately, the content for such resolutions is still a cat, but the ‚Äúchicken and eggs‚Äù problem is already there - if there are no screens, then why content, and if there is no content - why screens?  However, we have never heard that the resolution of already produced TV models decreases, so you can buy TV now, and in a couple of years the super-sharp movie will be pulled up and shown without problems.

      Under the cut, we will tell about one of the most interesting 4k2k-TVs on the market, which we tested personally.  Firstly, it has a relatively interesting price / features ratio, and secondly, it will harmoniously fit into any interior and add life to rich colors: the Philips 8800 series LCD TV with Ambilight function.  Well, a couple of words for heating interest: this is one of the first Philips TVs that runs on the Android OS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Just want to make a small but important remark.</b>  Although we ranked TV as the flagship, there are even more sophisticated models.  Unfortunately, their price is more like real estate prices than electronics, so consider the option that is closest to reality. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/663/ce2/a8f/663ce2a8ffb04013a119be92894c0076.jpeg"><br>  We tried to focus on the image quality test of the device, since it would hardly be interesting for you to read the banal ‚Äúbright and clear image‚Äù in the review, which in the flagship TV goes without saying.  Therefore, do without preludes - immediately to the point.  Therefore, let us warn in advance: there is a lot of text and pictures below, but even this did not allow us to tell about all-all-all possibilities of the device, so that some of the obvious and marketing ryushechek are missing. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Product line and positioning in it</font> </h2><br>  Of course, the entire Philips lineup will not be considered, let‚Äôs dwell on the most interesting.  In 2014, the company released 13 smart TVs with Android OS on board.  The two models are located in the ‚Äúyounger premium league‚Äù, the 7000 series is 49 inch and 55 inch versions, 8 models are in the 8000 series (48 and 55 inches), and 3 in the ‚Äútop line‚Äù are the 9000 series, where the diagonal devices are impressive 55 and 65 inches. <br><br>  The hero of our review, the <b><a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-philips-ultra-hd-55pus8809-60-10006850">Philips 55PUS8809 / 60,</a></b> is the ‚Äúsecond in coolness‚Äù in the 8000 line: it does not have a curved screen (as in the flagship model <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-philips-ultra-hd-55pus8909c-12-10007392">55PUS8909C / 12</a> ), but there is something that even the most expensive 65-inch nine- <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/televizor-philips-ultra-hd-55pus8909c-12-10007392">kilometer</a> doesn‚Äôt have ".  If you're interested - here is a comparison of the above three models on the official website (clickable): <br><br> <a href="http://www.philips.ru/etc/philips/b2c/compareproducts.html%3Flocale%3Dru_RU%26ctn%3D55PUS8909C/12,55PUS8809/60,65PUS9809/60"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea6/a84/872/ea6a848722d54fdc9c4697b87586c1b0.png"></a> <br><br>  In a nutshell: the 9000 has a slightly larger diagonal (and with it, more power consumption, about twice), four-sided Ambilight (sharpening under the ‚Äúwall‚Äù mount) and a wireless subwoofer in the kit.  Our TV has two independent TV tuners.  All other characteristics are the same and differ only in price: slide with 3 telecoms <br><br>  <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-p/55PUS8809_60/8800-series-ultra-slim-4k-uhd-tv-powered-by-androidtm-with-ambilight-3-sided-and-perfect-pixel-ultra-hd/specifications">Specifications 55PUS8809 / 60</a> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Equipment</font> </h2><br>  Inside a rather huge box (alone TV can lift Valuev, the rest will not have enough hands or strength) there is a board, there is foam on it, and there is a TV in it.  In addition to him in the thickness of the foam are also: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/764/00d/79d/76400d79df0a49daba7c1b415fd294a7.jpg"><br><br>  - Remote control and batteries to it <br>  - Two legs for vertical mounting <br>  - 4 washers for wall mounting <br>  - Two points and batteries for them <br>  - Cable tie <br>  - Power cord <br>  - Papers <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10c/a8e/a10/10ca8ea10f5442b6b3eef3f5ed107a98.jpg"><br><br>  You are always waiting for something special from a premium-level device, even in aspects such as equipment.  Unfortunately, manufacturers often think differently and Philips is no exception: the bundle does not even have an HDMI cable, so that the telly ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù can be connected to at least some source.  Apparently, it is implied that the necessary wires either have the buyer, or he must buy them separately, while the cost of the wire for the manufacturer is a fraction of a percent of the cost of the device.  Not to mention all sorts of fibrotryapochki for wiping the screen. <br><br>  Even 3D glasses and only two couples, although in the promotional videos they show us happy moms, dads and their children, who all together watch TV with glasses - and that's how they do it?  However, points, in contrast to those that are bundled with the same LG, are active, which means they cost more than 10 cents apiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/136/7f4/8d0/1367f48d0553485db1356f098c5c4ff7.jpg"><br><br>  Further research in the field of picking continues to amaze: there is not even a paper manual in the box to acquaint the user with all the functions of the device - it is offered to download it in electronic form.  You can argue about this approach for a long time (the trees are still alive, no need to bathe with the language of the instruction, it will not roll after reading, etc.), but imagine that you bought a car and some unknown to you fire on his way a light bulb, or it suddenly did not start in the cold.  In the glove compartment, instead of a beautiful daddy with a thick manual, there is a card with a QR code in which there is a link to multi-megabyte instructions in all languages, but according to the law of meanness, the Internet does not catch, the battery has sat down and so on ... in short, all manufacturers need future instructions . <br><br>  By the way, the instruction from the official site is more than exhaustive - in Russian, 111 pages, with clear color pictures.  Obviously, in the article we will not be able to tell about all the possibilities of the TV, but if he is interested in you, then here is a <a href="http://download.p4c.philips.com/files/5/55pus8809_60/55pus8809_60_dfu_rus.pdf">link</a> with a detailed description. <br><br>  We screw massive metal legs, put the TV on the table ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  And let's probably from the stand and start.  In the vertical state, the panel is held by two V-shaped legs made of metal, which look quite stylish - primarily due to the finely ground texture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/113/63d/e2c11363d8964178af45c69bad16160b.jpg"><br>  <i>We hope no perfectionist will suffer from this photo.</i> <br><br>  The design is stable, but once again it is still better not to rock it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93e/e60/8e5/93ee608e5d5840609c8a97af9f66fec6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8b/ccb/b3e/d8bccbb3ea9c442581d616abd47827e3.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is glossy, in the off state it can be used as an alternative to the mirror.  Marky surface - once again it is better not to touch your fingers.  Along the perimeter of the display itself there is a stylish metal frame that will interfere with wiping dust in the corners - in this regard, frameless screens are more practical. <br><br>  Bottom - the protrusion with the company logo, which glows in the dark (brightness is adjustable, you can turn off). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/667/d4b/4fd/667d4b4fd8f742d58b9e42bf44278d38"><br><br>  Under it (below, yes, below!) There is a hidden webcam, which is called automatically depending on the application (or through the activation of the setting responsible for managing gestures). <br><br>  The depth of the TV on the legs is 23 cm, while the thickness of the panel itself is about 4 centimeters.  The device can optionally be hung on the wall, for which the back panel contains holes for VESA mounting (400x400). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/839/b3f/74e/839b3f74e217464eb126a09c560a5900.jpg"><br><br>  AmbiLight LEDs are U-shaped on the back side, the bottom side of the panel is not highlighted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09b/ce2/7bc/09bce27bc70e423c9807aed85f4f874a"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f9/a56/928/8f9a569285ab432b85e1e9cb2e19d447.jpg"><br><br>  Connectors are not just a lot, but a lot.  Whole mountain!  3xUSB, 4xHDMI (with HDMI ARC function), SCART (RGB / CVBS), component input (YPbPr), antenna jack and two satellite inputs, audio input (L / R), digital optical audio output, minijack for headphones, service jack and even two CI slots.  There is also an RJ-45 connector, but at the same time, there is a Wi-Fi 802.11n module (dual-band 2x2) inside that works fine.  For the complete set, all that is missing is the VGA and DVI interfaces, but they are not really needed at 4K resolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/9e1/e23/43e9e1e23a2a45fd93761cfeb47aafbb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efc/896/c5c/efc896c5cfff4b9382f7cc266c23adc4.jpg"><br><br>  A few words about CI + slots.  The TV supports conditional access system CI + (Common Interface), which makes it possible to watch programs in HD-format, which are broadcast in your area by someone from the operators of digital TV.  The signal is encrypted by the operator, and decoded by a specially prepared CI + module.  When you purchase a subscription to paid programs, operators provide the CI + module (conditional access module, CAM) and a smart card.  Programs are broadcast with a high level of copy protection, however, the operator can provide a second CI + module with a smart card, for which there is also space on the TV: all this will allow you to simultaneously watch one channel and record another channel of the same operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b6/b1b/bcb/7b6b1bbcbd6ff51dc7969873b0e93606.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the bottom of the back of the TV are stereo speakers.  And on the left side is the hardware manipulator to control the TV - in case you lost the remote. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Remote controller</font> </h2><br>  Perhaps this is the most beautiful, functional and convenient remote control from those that we have ever seen.  A long stick of matte plastic, prints on it do not remain (more precisely, only on the arrow buttons).  Exactly the same remote goes to all top models of Philips TVs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c9/189/e7c/0c9189e7c4974fa98696776f0863387a.jpg"><br><br>  The stick has not only two ends, but also two sides: with one there are familiar buttons, on the other - a full QWERTY-keyboard with miniature arrows for navigation.  The keys are divided into two parts - at first it seemed that the touch panel was between them, but it was just a battery cover :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfa/ab3/4cb/cfaab34cbef241e982a242016846f26d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/554/ca2/fe4/554ca2fe428842ec9a63895d826cefd5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The remote control conveniently lies in the hand, the layout of the buttons is fairly standard and easy to remember - after half an hour you can not watch the remote.  You can‚Äôt see all the time about text input from the keyboard, because it‚Äôs more convenient than the on-screen keyboard, but it‚Äôs still not very practical.  And in the dark you will not enter anything at all (without preliminary training) - at such moments you understand that at least the optional button illumination would not be superfluous.  Buttons on the back side do not cause any discomfort while using the ‚Äúmain‚Äù side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cc/a0e/08f/2cca0e08f9ee4f199d48545be626b51f.jpg"><br><br>  Under the power button on the front of the console is a microphone for voice control.  To navigate the TV menu, you can use the arrow buttons, or use the gyroscopic capabilities of the remote control to control the cursor (pointer mode).  Often, this cursor only hinders (for example, LG TVs), but Philips made it convenient: it only works if you put your finger on the OK button and stop working as soon as you move it away from the button.  And if you don‚Äôt need the pointer mode at all, you can easily turn it off.  In any case, the process of controlling the TV is truly interactive: a remote control, voice, gestures (running forward) and a mobile application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd5/5a8/621/cd55a8621d8d4710afd83e4c497c00f1.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">3D glasses</font> </h2><br>  Included are two active 3D glasses that run on CR2032 batteries.  In order to start the magic, you should press the button at the top of the nose.  The same action turns off magic - to save power.  The points are removed points, but in the assembled state points can not be folded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/578/54b/4b557854b04041eda84924942196f218.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/81c/6fe/9c181c6fe314449b95addea5131ed4fe.jpg"><br><br>  The size of the glasses is universal, they sit on each head differently: I (the author of the text) was comfortable and confused only by the narrow arms through which I could look at the outside world with my peripheral vision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/870/2a9/8ea8702a99bb4d14bb0a4f0c1407db17.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Turn on and work</font> </h2><br>  When you first turn on the TV to conduct its basic setting.  The subsequent work does not cause questions, but the TV is not loaded as fast as we would like - most likely the reason lies in the Android OS installed on the device.  Ideally, it would be nice if the device ‚Äúfell into a dream‚Äù, turned off the display and left the OS running, but what Philips did was do.  On board - JellyBean with version 4.2.2.  In principle, we are not very concerned about the energy saving and computing efficiency functions, so that 4.2, that 4.4, that 5.0 is no difference, unlike smartphones.  All current software works thanks to the integrated Google Play Services, which include all the latest changes in the API, the major version of the Android OS has almost no effect on applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b23/000/108/b2300010814849f29940867afb83b0db.jpg"><br><br>  If you think that after turning on the TV, a desktop appears with clock and weather widgets ... then you are partly right :) In the main menu there really is some sort of desktop, on which icons of installed applications, widgets (embedded and from installed applications) and other system things.  But the first acquaintance does not begin with this: the first time you turn on the TV, it will ask you to say if it‚Äôs ‚Äúat home‚Äù, or it works as a display stand in a store.  After that, you will be taken to the step-by-step manual for setting up the basic parameters of your new device. <br><br>  In principle, everything is more or less logical and thought out, does not cause the desire to beat the developers or to quickly ‚Äúskip‚Äù all the steps and get into the settings yourself, as happens with some other vendors.  The TV is perfectly Russified, and there is no difficulty in understanding what is happening. <br><br>  One of the most interesting aspects for me (the author of the text) is the work of the 3D mode.  I do not really like passive 3D based on polarization, and the implementation of active glasses is so different in quality that you wonder.  Everything is in order here.  The ‚Äúthree-dimensional‚Äù mode is activated by a button on the remote, there are several algorithms to choose from: both 3D generation from 2D and work with native content.  In addition, there are still ‚Äúgame‚Äù features, but about them a bit later ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Features</font> </h2><br>  TV is generally quite difficult to call a ‚Äúgeek‚Äù product: only used and popular technologies, understandable to the average man, are being rolled into the mass market.  With the same Philips is definitely another story: it is stuffed with all sorts of features to the eyeballs.  The packaging designer was probably beaten with a stick.  He would be happy to make a neat minimalist packaging "like Apple," but they do not say, they say that it is necessary that everyone around could see what a cool thing someone is dragging home.  (I wonder how they imagine this?) So, what do we get in Phillips?  In short. <br><br><ul><li>  Smart TV based on Android OS (4.2).  It's nice that the developers did not reinvent their smart bike with square wheels.  Unpleasantly another: the software focused on "TVs" in Google Play is not enough.  But in general, a wide choice, and a lot of toys. <br><br></li><li>  The built-in content store (Video on demand) allows you to rent a movie without leaving your home or getting into torrent trackers. <br><br></li><li>  Broadcast social networks.  The feature is dubious: firstly, there are few social networks in laptops, tablets and phones or what?  Secondly, you never know who will write what and who will read the wrong one.  In general - let it be, for sure its audience will find this opportunity.  On the other hand, if the buyer lives alone, then why not read a twitter feed before going to bed? <br><br></li><li>  By the way, we talked about toys available Android OS, well, so this is not all.  The developer added a set of ‚Äúfor two‚Äù toys to the TV set, using shutter glasses to show each player a full-length image without interference for the second.  Oh, here in Need For Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãIII, so play with a friend, remember youth!  We consider it necessary to note: the built-in memory of the TV is nothing at all (even in the top model itself), no decent-sized toy (the same Asphalt or Real Racing, for example) will swear that there is not enough memory.  It is solved by installing a flash drive on 8-16 gigabytes and formatting it through the TV menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/4cb/2f9/e3d4cb2f9dba42029f52354f065adba8.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy, but even the Flashlight application works ‚Äî it turns the TV backlight on to the maximum :) But the Habrahabr application is not even searched in the store. <br><br></li><li>  Support 3D content.  The TV can both work with ready BD-plates with stereo image, and ‚Äúconvert‚Äù flat video to 3D (using the information from the previous and next frames to analyze moving objects and generate picture displacement. <br><br></li><li>  The manufacturer claims native support for Skype.  I would not like to see a stretched and noisy picture from my grandmother‚Äôs webcam (640x480 or 1280x720) on so many inches, and even if you are buying a TV for that kind of money - probably on a different device, you have the more ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù contact .  In any case, this is a much more convenient option for collective communication, when the whole family does not need to huddle around a relatively small laptop. <br><br></li><li>  Instead of a fairly convenient remote, you can use any smartphone or tablet based on iOS or Android.  Almost every vendor has this, it is implemented differently everywhere, but the feature is certainly convenient.  Another question is that during testing we were unable to connect to the TV mobile app Philips My Remote, which is recommended by the manufacturer - the TV did not show up on the Wi-Fi network.  At the same time, the application is there and over time it will only grow into functions, and it was not in the plans to make a detailed review of it within the framework of this article. <br><br></li><li>  Wired and wireless connection to the local network and the Internet.  By itself.  How else to rent content?  :) By the way, even with the simplest router, the TV perfectly pulled the video from the same YouTube and showed it without any jerks and delays. <br><br></li><li>  With Wi-Fi support, you automatically get a full set of wireless technologies: Miracast (streaming video from a smartphone or tablet), SmartCreeen (reverse process, sending content from a TV to a mobile device), access to DLNA services, network balloons and any other PLEX ' am <br><br></li><li>  The TV has a fairly wide range of ‚Äúrecognizable‚Äù USB-equipment.  Wireless and wired keyboards and mice, photo and video cameras, game controllers, flash drives and external hard drives work. <br><br></li><li>  The presence of a connected external HDD or flash drive allows you to record broadcasts and suspend "live broadcast".  However, to activate this feature you will need to format your drive using the TV menu.  In fact, the external disk becomes just a ‚Äúbuffer memory‚Äù, you can remove it and use it ‚Äúas usual‚Äù, but again you will have to format it in NTFS for use with a PC and lose all data when you need to re-use the HDD to record the TV broadcast. <br><br></li><li>  The built-in camera (for Skype and collective sofa selfies, not otherwise) allows not only to communicate via the Internet, but also to control the TV using voice / gestures.  There are not many gestures, and they are easy to learn.  Essentially, you control the circular menu.  Not to say that the feature is ultra-useful, but it's damn cool, especially when you lost the remote at home.  You feel like a Jedi.  This is not the channel you are looking for! <br><br></li><li>  TV is not a TV without the ability to receive regular (or HD) channels via cable.  Philips went further and put a television in the TV so you can watch your favorite shows when you watch your favorite shows.  Simply put, the 8800 has two TV tuners that allow you to receive two signals in parallel, one displays on the screen, and the second can be recorded to watch later.  Basically, of course, the feature is useful to football fans, whose wives have time to seize control of the TV before they get settled in front of the screen.  Any other content is now easier to "buy" on torrents or just rent in the store, and watch without advertising and SMS, at a convenient time. <br><br></li><li>  Hue-lamp support.  Many Philips TVs have Ambilight's proprietary backlight technology, which ‚Äúcontinues the movie‚Äù on the wall behind the TV.  This TV model went even further: it can control not only Ambilight's built-in backlight, but also Philips' <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-p/8718291241737/hue-personal-wireless-lighting/overview">newfangled</a> <b>Hue</b> <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-p/8718291241737/hue-personal-wireless-lighting/overview">lamps</a> (they can be controlled using Bluetooth) - to create an even more atmospheric environment when watching.  True, lamps (like HDMI wiring) should be purchased separately, and they are significantly more expensive than even the most expensive energy-saving light bulbs. <br><br>  The Phillips website has a separate <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-m-so/televisions">interactive page</a> where you can see how the room will look like with AmbiLight + HUE (clickable): <br><br> <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-m-so/televisions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ee/8d3/f08/6ee8d3f08d7849378a3264688c9a9871.jpg"></a> <br><br></li><li>  In addition, a dozen of brand-name improvers with the taste of wild berries and other SWAG are built into the TV, which you should not even mention on a decent techno resource.  Okay, okay, they asked for it :) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is a list of indecent words:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Picture:</b> <br>  - 1000 Hz PMR Ultra <br>  - Micro Dimming Pro <br>  - Local Contrast <br>  - Perfect Natural Motion <br>  - Ultra Resolution <br><br>  <b>Network features:</b> <br>  - SimplyShare <br>  - CloudTV <br><br>  <b>Sound:</b> <br>  - Incredible Surround <br>  - Incredible Surround 3D <br>  - Clear Sound <br>  - Auto volume limit <br>  - Dynamic bass boost <br>  - DTS Premium <br></div></div></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Ambilight work</font> </h2><br>  One of the most impressive and really affecting movie viewing features is the Ambilight backlight, which analyzes the image on the screen and highlights the wall behind the TV, bringing the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù beyond the television screen.  One video demonstration will be better than a thousand words: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZJAZblRdhY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj6Z3qUFke5nf_qr6EDqV9etOAcXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But believe me, no video will give you impressions of the actual use of Ambilight.  And it is not even about the fact that it is important or necessary.  Here, rather, as with some cars: I saw, rolled, fell in love, went crazy and you can not live without this thing.  If it clings, then once and for all. <br><br>  Philips engineers are no fools: they took into account many odd little things.  Here's what to do if your TV is not installed on a white / light background, but, say, in front of a blue, red or dark green wall?  Ambilight can be configured taking into account the color of the wall, next to which the TV is installed - it is set in the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eac/0bb/589/eac0bb58950745f198768f0632cb78b5.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, Ambilight can be ‚Äúbrought out‚Äù of the TV-frame: a special set of Philips HUE LED lights and their control module will allow you to paint at least the whole room in the colors of the film: a shootout at a steel mill - this is your red-orange atmosphere.  Morning in the forest - green-yellow colors throughout the room.  Seascapes?  Well, you understand ... <br><br>  Lamps are purchased separately, costing from 5k, but it is better to take a set that costs more (but cheaper in terms of the cost of the lamp). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">To be continued...</font> </h2><br>  While writing the review, we realized that there is no point in putting it out completely, with one big sheet - about the possibilities of the Android shell, about the internal structure of the TV itself, and most importantly - about testing color reproduction, we will tell in the second part, this week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10b/195/8e6/10b1958e649e42db82503dad58301320.jpg"><br><br>  Thank you for your attention, stay in touch! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377047/</a></p>
