  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook killer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  They say Google is obsessed with killing Facebook.  Putting aside his experiments with Google Wave, without further ado, he decided to offer just the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù social network Google+.  The giraffe is big, he knows better, but I think Google was near the place where it is "hot."  Listen to what someone <a href="http://www.mir-google.com/google-base.html">wrote</a> about the Google Base service: <i>using the motivation of authors posting their content online and wanting to find it, to further structure the Internet.</i>  <i>No, even the best automatic analysis of the usual HTML page, in which the content is mixed with the presentation, will not be able to categorize this page better than the meta-data explicitly written by the author</i> .  The most fat here is the motivation of authors thirsting for an audience.  And note that the more accurate the content is tagged, the more relevant the audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The audience is the key word, it is unusual for search service users to be called audiences for authoring content.  Apparently this routine perception and led the project to Google Base in a completely different direction, it has now degenerated into some kind of Google Merchant, it seems, is also not very popular.  Plus, Google‚Äôs clear direction is to use structuring to improve search.  And before it was possible to write a text about the same content as on Habr√©, tag it (also on Habr√©) and upload it to Google Base.  At the same time, Google seemed to assign a fairly high PR to such a page, i.e.  when searching for topics tag material went somewhere in the top issue.  I did it once, just to try, and was probably among the few, because the bulk of the content was made up of ads for selling something.  If a mass of people began to write there on the habrotemes in the fight for a place in the top, then obviously I would have to rank these materials.  On Habr√©, the rating for this is sharpened, but what would Google do? .. <br><br>  Another problem is that the publication in search results can not be commented.  In principle, you can probably think so.  But the usual approach is that the resource should be positioned as intended for publications and discussions, have for this convenient functionality and user interface.  Well, that would be thought in this direction.  The combination of Google Base and Google Wave could give interesting results. <br><br>  Would such a service be a competitor to Habra?  Perhaps because various interesting authors on topics close to Habrovsky do not always write on Habr√©.  Some have their own separate blogs, some post in LJ and all sorts of specialized media resources.  Base + Wave would offer them a larger total audience.  And this is all incentive incentive.  And Base + Wave would kill not only Habr, but in general almost all thematic resources.  In this version, for Facebook, the role of Odnoklassniki would remain - exclusively for communicating ‚Äúabout anything‚Äù and maintaining connections.  Although the latter is a very large niche, the fan would leave Fesbuka, the elite, and with them the brands, would treat it probably in the same way as the habros users relate to Classmates.  But behind the elite, the masses are stretching too.  And here Google+ could well be useful too - as a fashionable and prestigious competitor in a niche "about nothing". </div>
