America.</i>  <i>The elder brother of adviser J. Harris.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Oliver Steele (nicknamed "Steel General", a reference to his English surname Steele) is a friend of Matt Harris, one of the main resistance commanders, the commander of the main attack corps.</i>  <i>At the time of the beginning of the story - he deserted and tried to hide in the criminal suburb of the capital - Ghetto.</i>  <i>Mass murderer, and "bloody butcher" - gave the most terrible orders during active battles.</i>  <i>The shooting of soldiers, prisoners, women and children.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Deimos (before the loss of memory and the operation to implant the Oka module - captain Henry Johnson) - a military man who deliberately for some purpose was sent by J. Harris to the experimental program.</i>  <i>Friend of Richard O'Connell.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Colonel Richard O'Connell - a new character (appeared only in 18 parts), a colonel of government counterintelligence, was wounded while performing in the leg, charged to staff work, made a career.</i>  <i>Is in a relationship with Melissa.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Melissa (last name unknown) - one of the "graduates" of the project "Eye", was assigned to the department of Richard O'Connell.</i>  <i>Composed with the latter in a relationship, at the request of the latter went on the assignment of adviser to Harris to accompany and help Matt Harris and Oliver Steele.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Astrea (real name unknown) - The eldest of the sisters.</i>  <i>How to get into the project is not completely clear.</i>  <i>It has a higher level of module synchronization than other operators.</i>  <i>Of the existing members of the project, ‚ÄúEye‚Äù is the second most powerful telepath after Deimos.</i>  <i>Honest, proud, straightforward.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Adikia (real name unknown) - The youngest of the sisters.</i>  <i>How to get into the project is not completely clear.</i>  <i>It is the third most powerful telepath after Deimos and Astrea, but prefers more sophisticated methods of influence, eliminates the lack of strength with tricks and mind games.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Anna Price is an assistant to Mike Ivor, the second person in the Eye project.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Professor Nikitinsky is the original creator of the concept of the EP-22 drug that enhances cognitive abilities and with the implantation of the module of making people telepaths.</i>  <i>about 50 years before the story, conducted experiments on prisoners in a closed research institute in Russia, killed by his own experimental subjects, as well as all the staff.</i>  <i>On the basis of his records and diaries, the ‚ÄúEye‚Äù project was launched.</i> <br></div></div><br><h4>  The book is entirely in reader formats: </h4><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/Ut-hio7OsBNbq">mobi, epub, fb2.</a> <br><hr><br>  Mike went through the documents when Anna came to him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDr. Ivor,‚Äù the woman began, ‚Äúthe security chief is waiting for you,‚Äù she faltered, ‚Äúabout escaping ...‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúLet him wait,‚Äù the surgeon threw back, ‚ÄúI have more important things to do here.‚Äù <br><br>  - So he pass on? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, just say so,‚Äù he replied, without raising his head, ‚Äúby the way, - Ivor finally broke away from the papers, - did you finish with my assignment?‚Äù  Anyway, why are you standing in the doorway?  Come on in.  - He pointed to the visitor chair. <br><br>  Anna hesitated a little in the door, but, not daring to contradict her boss, gently closed the door behind her and sat down at the place offered to her. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDr. Ivor,‚Äù she began after a short but very difficult pause for her, ‚Äúyou instructed me to deal with personal matters, or rather ...‚Äù She stumbled, not knowing how to continue, ‚ÄúWell, you understand. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have instructed you to purge the subjects' cases,‚Äù Ivor, irritably, set aside another folder, folded his hands in front of him, and leaned toward Anna a little, ‚Äúdid you mean to say that?‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  - It seemed to me that no problems should have arisen, - he clasped the fingers of his hands into the lock and lightly slammed his hands on the table, from which Anna shivered, - but, as I understand, they arose? <br><br>  ‚ÄúSee, Mike ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Dr. Ivor. <br><br>  - What?  - Anna was disoriented. <br><br>  - First of all, I am your boss, Anna. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, Dr. Ivor,‚Äù the woman corrected, ‚Äúyou see, I had some questions when working with the database.‚Äù <br><br>  - What exactly? <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe some kind of mistake,‚Äù Anna was nervous, ‚Äúbut there are eighty-five entries about objects, although Deimos was the last experimental ... I found the odd one, it goes out of chronology and is completely empty.  - Anna was silent, but from the look of the surgeon she understood that she could continue.  - So, I wanted to ask you, Dr. Ivor, you do not know what kind of she? <br><br>  Mike leaned back in his chair and again picked up the folder that had recently been set aside. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have no idea,‚Äù he replied, not looking at Anna, ‚Äúperhaps it‚Äôs some kind of failure.‚Äù <br><br>  - Clear. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCome work better, Anna, we have a complete mess here,‚Äù Ivor said right at the moment when Anna was going to turn to him, ‚Äúwe all have a lot of work.‚Äù <br><br>  The woman nodded in agreement, walked out of the office, and still gently closed the door behind her, while Dr. Mikhail Ivorinets was following her gaze. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  ‚ÄúSomething is wrong,‚Äù Oliver said quietly. <br><br>  - Come on?  ‚ÄúMatt quipped,‚Äù are you talking about a riot, about fucking telepaths, or about our life in general? <br><br>  Oliver was ready to joke back, but Richard interrupted him: <br><br>  ‚ÄúHush, you both,‚Äù the Colonel was younger than the two, but the thrill of his elders was never observed, ‚Äúwe are almost there.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù Oliver said to Richard, ‚Äúare you sure that your toys will be there?‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes, - O'Connell looked around, - I gave the order to make at least five working samples, if one does not work. <br><br>  He checked again that there was no one around, and with a brief rush he crossed the street.  Matt and Oliver followed closely behind him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù began the old Commander, better one of the two of us, going first?  We are in armor, after all, and on you only the old jacket of a ragged one. <br><br>  Richard just shook his head. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf I am the first to be caught by the guards,‚Äù he said, then they may have time to recognize me, and if you are against the rebels, you will cover.  So? <br><br>  ‚ÄúA crap plan,‚Äù muttered Matt. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBetter not,‚Äù O'Connell replied. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, let's go further, seemingly clear,‚Äù Oliver interjected. <br><br>  They reached the entrance to the building without any problems.  Passing through the foyer, all three rested against a metal service door.  Oliver had already raised the railgun in order to turn the castle and half of the wall, but Richard stopped him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHave you forgotten what?‚Äù  This is my building. <br><br>  The colonel fumbled in his inner pocket, from where he removed the key card. <br><br>  One movement and the door opened with a slight click. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPlease follow me,‚Äù Richard said, and, hobbling, he went forward without even looking around. <br><br>  After a couple of minutes, all three were in his office. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt doesn't look like a lab,‚Äù Matt drawled, and, as if by chance, intercepted his submachine gun more comfortably. <br><br>  From Richard this movement did not hide. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf anything,‚Äù he began, opening the closet, which caused even more alarm to his companions, ‚ÄúI am a cripple, and my things would not hinder me.‚Äù <br><br>  At this point, the man removed another cane from the depths of the closet, and then a raincoat. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou should have warned,‚Äù said Matt, lifting his finger off the trigger. <br><br>  - And what would you say to me?  - objected Richard.  - Something in the style of ‚Äúman, we have another revolution here, and will you follow the cane ?!‚Äù So? <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Oliver said, ‚Äúif I understand correctly what is happening in the city, then we have just enough time.‚Äù  Richard, is it far to the lab? <br><br>  The scout had already put on his raincoat and took out a spare pistol and a couple of stores from the shelf of the table. <br><br>  - Two minutes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Oliver replied, ‚Äúcome on, pick up all the crap you need and go.‚Äù <br><br>  As Richard feared, there was not a soul in the laboratory, however, why would the employees stay in their places on Friday evening.  In addition, they already waited for him for a long time last time, when they activated  and Astraya's collar. <br><br>  Richard‚Äôs chest stung.  He again remembered how the girl died.  And Melissa.  Melly.  It seemed to him that because of the shock he could not understand how everything had turned out this way, but now, after a few hours already, he still could not believe it;  as if someone's invisible hand pushed his heads against the resistance leaders, but took away from him those who could really at least oppose the power of Deimos. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCould they?‚Äù, Richard thought.  - "Not.  Indeed, could Melly have something to help now?  After all, even Astraea recognized that against the background of Deimos she is an ant against the background of a shoe. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúCould Melly help?‚Äù, - the Colonel supported the internal dialogue, - ‚ÄúShe could at least stay alive.‚Äù <br><br>  - Colonel O'Connell? <br><br>  It was Matt.  He pulled Richard out of the stupor in which he fell, plunging into a mental argument with himself. <br><br>  - Yes, - Richard tiredly rubbed the nose, - a little thought. <br><br>  - Where are these collars?  - Oliver asked. <br><br>  Richard confidently walked to the rack near the wall and, having familiarized himself with a couple of labels, grabbed one of the boxes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù he threw to Oliver standing next to him. <br><br>  When the box was on the table, all three leaned over its contents. <br><br>  - It's them?  - Asked Matt carefully looking at Richard. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the colonel, ‚Äútake off your armor and put on those damn things.‚Äù <br><br>  - And over the top in any way?  - Oliver asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe guys who did them insisted on contacting the body,‚Äù Richard replied.  - Probably, it is possible and on top, but why tempt fate. <br><br>  - Do they really work?  - Matt has already pulled out one of the PUSAPs and turned it in his hands. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I ran into Deimos at the casino, mine worked,‚Äù the colonel answered. <br><br>  His companions did not respond and silently began to deactivate the combat armor. <br><br>  ** <br><br>  - What are you waiting for? <br><br>  Deimos was extremely surprised that Henry managed to break through his mental block.  He may have underestimated the power of his hallucination, or maybe it was in EP-22.  In any case, he was again not alone. <br><br>  - What are you waiting for?  - Henry repeated his question. <br><br>  - I will start ten minutes earlier or ten later - what's the difference?  - Deimos answered him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI heard that things should be finished as soon as possible,‚Äù Henry was extremely dissatisfied, but, as it seemed to Deimos, he tried to hold back. <br><br>  Too crucial moment. <br><br>  He plunged into the stream of consciousness of the crowd.  The meeting with Oliver finally formed in the mind of Deimos, what he would be guided by when sentencing.  Of course, he has his own guidelines, values, but not to say that they are too hard.  But they are enough to burn these abscesses on the body of society with a hot iron. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou have been busy for a long time,‚Äù Henry was next to him, in the thoughts of the crowd. <br><br>  Deimos did not even have time to understand what was happening, as the stream surrounding him was stained with threads of pain and violence. <br><br>  - What are you doing? <br><br>  - Come on?  - answered Henry, - you yourself understand what I am doing.  Bleed them like mad dogs.  Deimos, we don't have time to mess with them. <br><br>  He did not feel him, he lost control of him.  Separated from Deimos, Henry, like an artist who writes in broad strokes, drove people in a crowd crazy. <br><br>  Smear here, smear there. <br><br>  The crowd in the square began to move.  People, who were peacefully and sleepily standing in the square, put to sleep by the will of Deimos, now turned into brutal monsters, rushing at each other. <br><br>  But Henry did not stop there. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy does the rest of the city sleep?‚Äù <br><br>  Deimos felt like Henry penetrates the minds of ordinary people, turning them into beasts with only one installation - to kill. <br><br>  To drive the whole city crazy in one fell swoop is an impossible task even for Henry.  He chose to select specific areas of the capital, those where things were worse than others, and delivered his blow. <br><br>  - Enough!  - Deimos sent all his power, all the power that he had in order to embrace this stream of human consciousness, to pacify, suppress. <br><br>  Here, a man drops a knife brought over his wife.  Fights stop, clubs and chains go down. <br><br>  At some point, it seemed to him that everything had succeeded. <br><br>  Nearly. <br><br>  The threads that belonged to his fellow operators began to go out one by one.  Someone deliberately exterminated them, as when he was frightened by a couple on patrol.  He tried to concentrate, to find the "hunter", but a sharp pain in his left side pulled him out of the stream. <br><br>  Deimos looked down and saw the handle of the bayonet-knife protruding from under the ribs.  He was very similar to the one with whom Henry, in his hallucinations, killed the soldiers of the guard.  At first, Deimos thought it was again a vision, a hallucination, but the pain was too real. <br><br>  - What? .. - He began to lose consciousness. <br><br>  Already lying on the steps, breathing heavily, he saw a figure above him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat's all, captain,‚Äù said the man, leaning over him, ‚Äúit's time to work it out.‚Äù <br><br>  - What?  Who are you?  What?  - trying not to whimper in pain, Deimos croaked. <br><br>  - You will not recognise me? <br><br>  The stranger‚Äôs face swam, and in a second Henry was already standing over him.  From flesh and blood. <br><br>  - Henry? <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo, Henry is you.‚Äù  And I am me. <br><br>  Deimos tried to rise on his elbow, but the man poked his fingers in his forehead, tilting him back to the steps of the Council building. <br><br>  - Lie-lie, from here a good view of what you did. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's not me,‚Äù Deimos croaked, ‚ÄúI didn't want this violence.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, technically,‚Äù the man drawled, ‚Äúyou.‚Äù  Your module. <br><br>  He rose to his feet and, turning his back to Deimos, looked around the square. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you know, Captain, how much strength I should have endured you?‚Äù  Your reflection, indecision?  Your fuss with Oliver Still does not know why?  If I had the opportunity to invade the minds of ordinary people, I would become the king of the world.  But I, unfortunately, can only twist like you - operators. <br><br>  He glanced at the telepath. <br><br>  - From here and all this fuss with you.  Michael did not fully believe that we would succeed.  You have no idea how he had to get out in order to deceive James Harris, that I would destroy the government and the army elite just with your help, how much effort he spent on finding at least someone similar to me by sex, age and other parameters.  How ironic - his most important asset - I left with a defect.  100% synchronization with the Oka module, but with a module unable to operate at the desired frequencies.  And the second time, the operation did not tolerate anyone. <br><br>  He turned and sat down on the steps, next to the bleeding Deimos. <br><br>  - And here you appear.  The ideal candidate: a man, my age, almost 100% synchronization, but already with an improved, working module.  We even have the same growth.  Did you really think you were going crazy?  That EP-22 melts your brains and you talk to yourself?  Ivor has long got rid of side effects.  Yes, painkillers or the EP-22 itself somewhat expand the consciousness, shorten the life expectancy, but certainly not dement, as it was in the early experiments of Professor Nikitinsky, no. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDocuments ...‚Äù Deimos croaked, ‚ÄúI saw those documents myself.‚Äù <br><br>  The man whom Deimos considered his alter-ego the last weeks only smiled, and they both ended up in a telepath‚Äôs room in a research center.  There was no knife in the side, like pain. <br><br>  - Is everything you see - true?  - He asked Deimos, patted him on the shoulder and moved to the exit. <br><br>  Already standing in the corridor and checking his pistol, the ‚ÄúHenry‚Äù turned around and added: <br><br>  ‚ÄúHappily stay, Captain Johnson.‚Äù <br><br>  And shut the door behind him. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  - God, what's going on here? <br><br>  As soon as Matt, Oliver and Richard went outside, they were in the middle of hell. <br><br>  If on the way to the management of it came across rare gangs, now a full-scale war has begun in the Capital.  At first glance it seemed that everyone was fighting against everyone, but after a few minutes they understood that the city was divided into monsters and victims. <br><br>  Richard would never have believed if he had been told that a person could tear out his larynx with his teeth with his teeth, but he saw it personally. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe need transportation,‚Äù said Matt. <br><br>  - No, - Richard compartment, - they will crush us. <br><br>  - More options?  - Oliver asked. <br><br>  - Wait in management?  - Matt suggested.  ‚ÄúThe building should have a siege protocol, drop the armored blinds and wait it all out.‚Äù <br><br>  A group of madmen ran past them with a howl, but the trio went unnoticed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot an option,‚Äù when Richard replied, ‚Äúyou met Henry ... Deimos, I mean, Deimos.‚Äù  This is his handiwork. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd how do you order us to find one single telepath in this chaos?‚Äù  - Reasonably asked Oliver. <br><br>  Richard thought. <br><br>  - It should be in the center.  The Council building is a symbol of the current government, and if I wanted to plunge the city into chaos, I would start from there - from the very center of the Capital. <br><br>  Matt leaned out from around the corner and appreciated the decor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is suicide,‚Äù said the old commander, ‚Äúeven combat armor will not save us, and you are completely lame.‚Äù <br><br>  Richard was trying to solve now, probably the most difficult task that he had ever faced. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù the scout decided nevertheless, ‚Äúit is possible that they will hand me over to the tribunal, but this is unlikely.‚Äù  Under the building of management there is a tunnel.  He leads to the very center.  Provided for the case of government evacuation. <br><br>  - And where does he go?  - Oliver asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRight in the Council building,‚Äù Richard answered, ‚ÄúTrue, the security protocol might have worked there and the move could be blocked, but this is our only option to avoid walking the streets.‚Äù <br><br>  After a brief discussion, Richard‚Äôs version was adopted unanimously. <br><br>  As carefully as they got out, all three returned to the control hall.  Richard led Oliver and Matt through some service corridors and stairs.  It seemed to Oliver that they would never reach the tunnel and did not exist at all, but at last they were in a small room with a door under a magnetic lock. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIs there a guard there?‚Äù  - Matt asked. <br><br>  - Should not, but beware. <br><br>  Oliver picked up the railgun more comfortably, and Matt checked his machine gun. <br><br>  - Ready?  - Asked Richard. <br><br>  The men nodded silently. <br><br>  O'Connell put his key card to the reader, the door opened with a flick, and the colonel looked into the opening. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPlease follow me,‚Äù he said jokingly and took a step inside.  Oliver and Matt followed him. <br><br>  A narrow, dimly lit corridor led to an unknown destination.  Sometimes dodging, with corners at right angles, he created the impression of a maze, rather than an emergency evacuation path. <br><br>  - Have you been here before?  - Oliver asked Richard. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the man answered quietly, ‚Äújust at the entrance.‚Äù  Access is strictly limited here, even for me.  For each key draw-up, it was necessary to write a whole report for what purpose a particular employee would go. <br><br>  - And often? <br><br>  - Once a year, on inspection of the generator and stocks.  Something to fix, something to change and back.  Bypassing the entire route from time to time the security service did, not us. <br><br>  Oliver began to lose time.  Did they go for five minutes or was it already fifteen?  This could be understood by the degree of fatigue, but the combat armor clearly performed the function of support ‚Äî it was still relatively fresh and full of energy. <br><br>  At the next turn, the trio suddenly bumped into the door. <br><br>  ‚ÄúJust a second,‚Äù said Richard, and put his key on the reading panel. <br><br>  Nothing has happened. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat the ...‚Äù The scout muttered to himself and tried again to open the door. <br><br>  Nothing. <br><br>  - Heck!  - O'Connell found this path difficult, and the prospect of returning him a little pleased, - apparently, we will not go here. <br><br>  Oliver appreciated the door. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGet away,‚Äù he told the colonel, ‚Äúmove both round the corner.‚Äù <br><br>  - Are you going to blow?  You will give us a ceiling on your head; this turn is as old as the city. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù answered the Steel General, ‚Äújust knock out the lock.‚Äù <br><br>  Richard glanced at the railgun in the hands of Oliver, and then at the man himself. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou think this gun can handle it?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, you managed the armored truck,‚Äù replied the Steel General, ‚Äúgo away.‚Äù <br><br>  When Matt and Richard took cover around the corner, Oliver raised the railgun and aimed at the point where, in his opinion, there was a magnetic lock mechanism. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, just don‚Äôt let me down ...‚Äù He muttered to himself and pressed the trigger. <br><br>  The pig rushed to the door and without any resistance pierced a torn hole in it.  To be faithful, Oliver launched another pair of projectiles above and below the spot he hit the first time. <br><br>  - Done!  - He shouted to his companions.  - Matt, come, help! <br><br>  Already, the two of them grabbed at the still hot edges in the holes and, applying all the available forces, they pushed the door towards themselves.  She succumbed and with some effort, but still opened. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWelcome to the holy of holies, the Steel General,‚Äù Matt told Oliver playfully, ‚Äúwe are in the Council building.‚Äù <br><br>  - You know, not much and wanted. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúLet's get out of here,‚Äù Richard said, ‚ÄúHenry must be somewhere close by.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver and Matt silently followed the colonel along the narrow staircase leading up somewhere. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Through several narrow flights of stairs and a pair of doors, the trio found themselves in one of the service corridors of the Council building. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Are you generally guided here? - Asked Matt Richard. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù answered the colonel, ‚Äúall government buildings have similar layouts.‚Äù - He looked around, as if choosing which way to go - here.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As they walked, Oliver looked at the light-flooded marble corridors of this palace. Heavy, carved doors from the pre-revolutionary era, heavy crystal chandeliers and perfectly clean carpets. This place contrasted so much with what was outside that it seemed to the Steel General that he had fallen into another, parallel world. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúAnd why all this wealth?‚Äù He thought. - ‚ÄúFor the sake of a dozen old men?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the next turn, they came upon protection, more precisely, those who had previously guarded this building. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two men in uniform beat the third. When one of the guards raised his hand for another strike, Oliver saw that the head of the unfortunate had already turned into a bloody mess, but the killers were not going to stop.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It took just an instant to get them to navigate with Matt. Oliver carefully lowered the railgun to the floor, and Matt threw the machine gun behind his back. Richard simply took a step back ‚Äî he understood that he could do little to help these two. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was over quickly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver killed the first guard on the head with one blow of his fist, and Matt dealt with the second, simply turning his neck; these two were so passionate that they didn‚Äôt even notice the attackers approaching them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Everything? - Richard approached them, holding a pistol at the ready. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIt seems yes,‚Äù Matt replied, ‚ÄúI still can't understand what the hell is going on here.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNo idea,‚Äù Richard was still looking at the guard Oliver had killed. The bones of the poor fellow's bones were deformed inside, and if O'Connell had not seen with his own eyes how he had died, he would have decided that he had been killed by a blow of a sledgehammer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hey!</font></font> Help!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- At the end of the corridor a middle-aged man appeared. Apparently, he ran away from someone, periodically looking over his shoulder. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Stand! - shouted Matt and raised automatic. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do not shoot! I'm normal! - The man was already very close - these madmen are chasing me, two or three! You're from the army, right? Help me! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Richard put his hand on Matt‚Äôs trunk and lowered it to the ground. At this time, the man was already hiding behind the trinity. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, where are they? Matt asked, peering into the end of the corridor, hoping to see the shadows or to hear some noise. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver spotted some movement behind his back, but it was too late.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Loud shot. The bullet entered Matt‚Äôs head and went right through the entire skull of the old commander. Two more bullets got in the back of Richard, who never understood what had happened. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Steel General tried to turn around, but he felt that he did not have time. The attacker had already taken two steps back, and now the gun in his hands was sent to Oliver‚Äôs face. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first two bullets hit him in the chest, but Oliver knew that he could not carry him forever: the next bullet would definitely enter his head. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver rushed forward, thundered the third and final shot. The steel General in a jump knocked a man down and together with him fell to the floor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù Richard croaked. In his hand, the colonel clutched a service pistol, which he took from the office - Oliver, are you alive?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">O'Connell's shot left a neat hole in the forehead of the unknown, from which blood was oozing slowly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the Steel General could not believe that he was alive, ‚Äúdid you not think that you would shoot me?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThere were chances, but you survived,‚Äù Richard tried to rise, but the back pain knocked him back to the floor, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel my legs, Oliver.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWait,‚Äù the Steel General rushed to Matt first, although he understood that it was all in vain. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He turned the resistance commander face up. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, then,‚Äù said Richard, wincing, ‚Äúnow you are the resistance commander, so, Oliver?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The steel general did not answer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What was it all about?</font></font> What kind of nonsense?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOliver could not understand what happened to them, and why this man attacked them.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù O'Connell replied, ‚Äúalthough it seems I have seen him.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Where? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Richard paused, took one more glance at the body beside him and answered: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Today, in the casino. Where was Deimos. I then thought that he was strangely dressed for a guard. Listen, continued the colonel, give me the machine gun Matt, and go ahead, find Henry and shoot him to hell, it was he who made this mess. And as you finish, come back. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver nodded in agreement, removed the weapon from the corpse of his friend, and from the medical kit on the suit he took out a pair of syringes, and handed everything to the scout. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- One will relieve pain, and the second - will slow the bleeding. Got it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYes, I know,‚Äù answered Richard, ‚Äúget out already.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The steel general rose silently, took the pistol from which Matt was killed and, without looking back, jogged down the corridor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Richard understood that hardly anyone would return for him.</font></font><br><br>  ** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few minutes later Oliver reached the main hall. He looked around and had already thought of going back into the building, as he heard screams. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, it was the orgy of sounds. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Steel General had already taken hold of a heavy doorknob, as he was shocked on his shoulders. PPUSEP could not bear two hits, even if through a suit, and ordered to live long. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Well, fine," thought Oliver, "only this was not enough." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For a moment, the Steel General thought that the voices had become louder. He just shook his head, as if chasing away obsession, and opened the door leading to the street. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The picture that unfolded before him was terrifying. The whole area was turned into a huge mass of writhing, fighting bodies. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver almost went back inside, as he noticed the body lying lower on the steps.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was Deimos. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even from here it was obvious that someone had stabbed him with a knife and left him so to die. I really wanted to take refuge inside the Council building, but the Steel General was able to convince himself that he needed to check whether Deimos was alive, or that someone had killed him in truth. He went to the body, laid the railgun aside, and knelt down beside the telepath. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At that moment, when Oliver took the knife handle to pull him out and, if necessary, finish off Deimos, he wheezed and opened his eyes.</font></font><br><br>  *** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captain Henry Johnson was sitting on the edge of the cot, staring blankly at one point in front of him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHenry?‚Äù, He still called the unknown telepath with his name, ‚Äúhow did he manage to lead me?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deimos gave up trying to get out of this mental trap. He did not know how much time he spent here, in relation to the real world - did a second pass? Or ten minutes? Is he still alive or is he about to give up on blood loss? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He had no answer to these questions. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe power to interfere in the fates of others, the Golden King ...,‚Äù the captain recalled bitterly, ‚ÄúWhat an idiot I was that I thought it was my thoughts, my subconscious mind.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He lay down on his cot, closed his eyes, and prepared to die here, locked in his own mind, as if he had burned his left side.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Opening his eyes, Deimos saw Oliver Steele leaning over him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the telepath croaked.</font></font><br><br>  - What?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oliver stopped dumbfounded, not knowing what to do next. Can he still control himself, or is he already under the control of Deimos? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDon't,‚Äù it sounded already in Oliver‚Äôs head, ‚Äúwhat you see was not made by me.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And then who? - asked Oliver. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In response, Deimos sent him the image of "Henry", the way he saw him at the last moment. In it, Oliver unmistakably recognized the bastard who shot Matt. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And who is this? - Steel General broke the scream. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúEnemy,‚Äù it was hard to think, but Deimos tried. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, that means one less enemy,‚Äù Oliver replied. He parted the jacket and looked at the wound. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a lot of blood; Deimos had only about twenty minutes to live.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou have a little left, man,‚Äù the Steel General told Deimos. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"I know," the telepath replied mentally. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deimos braced himself for the last spurt, plunged into the stream again, now no longer golden blue against a black background, but bardo red from the pain and violence that reigned around. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIt will all be over soon, and then - do me a favor,‚Äù he turned to the Steel General and, without waiting for an answer, dived into the stream of consciousnesses around. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhy bard-red tones? Or is it just my brain being so adjusted? ‚ÄùHe thought distractedly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deimos touched the mind of one, the other, the third, tried to revive.</font></font> Useless.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Using it as a conductor, "Henry" burned out the brains of a good half of the city in one fell swoop. Now these madmen had more in common with animals than with people. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And mad beasts should be put to sleep.</font></font><br>  ** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hey, are you alive? Deimos? - Oliver tried to reach the telepath, because he understood that something terrible, irreparable had happened. Some kind of mistake. But Deimos was silent. Even though he was breathing, the telepath seemed to be either deeply swooning, or dying. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At one point, Oliver realized that something had changed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything was quiet around. The cries, groans and sounds of struggle came to naught. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the Steel General looked up, a square littered with bodies appeared to his gaze. People lay on each other, in blood and dirt. Someone fell, never letting go of another opponent, someone quietly crawled to the ground and no longer showed signs of life.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Deimos did what he wanted - he cleaned out the Capital, but many more people died than he had originally planned. Under the distribution were all, not just officials and the army command. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When the last unfortunate, reduced "Henry" crazy, fell to the ground without moving, Deimos opened his eyes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhy? ..‚Äù Only Oliver could ask. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIt was necessary. Mad dogs need to put to sleep or shoot. I chose the first, ‚ÄùOliver could swear that he heard a grin in the mind of a telepath. - ‚ÄúBut I forgot about one more biting dog. About you". </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this point, the instinct of self-preservation, which so many times saved Oliver's life, worked. Without hesitation, the Steel General pressed the handle down, raising the blade higher to the heart, and then drove the knife all the way under the ribs of Deimos.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The telepath twitched for the last time and fell silent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver rose to his feet and looked again at the city in front of him. Somewhere in the distance there was an explosion of a charge laid by Tommy or one of his fighters, after which tons of glass and concrete buried under a piece of hell into which the Capital, the last stronghold of civilized life on the continent, had become. Following the first explosion, more and more, until most of the main skyscrapers of the Ring of Life and the government sector disappeared into clouds of dust and debris. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oliver did not even want to think about what would happen next. It is unlikely that he will ever be able to go to the mountains and build a small house there for himself, as he wanted. The old world collapsed again. We'll have to build a new one. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He turned and walked back inside the Council building. First you had to help Richard.</font></font><br><br><h2>  Epilogue </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Anna, move! Fighters should already be loaded on cars! - Ivor did not even turn to the sound of the door that had opened, and still, with his back, was packing his things to move to the Council building. He had his own small army, which metropolitan cataclysm had passed, and a whole detachment of telepaths was enough to come to power. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He heard his assistant sit in the guest chair instead of following his order. Irritated, Ivor turned to read Anna, but the first thing he saw instead of his assistant was the barrel of a pistol. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúMikhail,‚Äù the man settled himself more comfortably in the chair, ‚Äúwhere are you going?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To the credit of Ivor, he refrained from sitting on the floor, only swung a little.</font></font><br><br>  - How?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Mikhail, if you think that you were able to lead me and that your subordinates and your creations are operators, were loyal to you, then you are deeply mistaken. Sit down - The man in the chair pulled the barrel, pointing the surgeon to his chair. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After Ivor fulfilled the order, the guest gave in a little ahead and continued: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou are a bad politician, Mikhail, if only because he considered himself smarter and more cunning than those around him.‚Äù</font></font><br><br>  - Yes?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Only Ivor could ask. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTo make such a way, such a job, so that this bastard will take everything into his own hands,‚Äù he thought. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, Michael. Never consider other people more stupid than yourself. And never betray your partners, ‚Äùsaid the man and shot the old surgeon several times in the chest and stomach. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe don't need another tyrant, Michael.‚Äù We need peace. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He waited until the head of the center gave up the spirit, after which he got up and went out into the corridor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the fighters immediately approached him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhat instructions will there be, sir?‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Immediately finish the loading of people, products and medicines. There are a lot of wounded people in the capital, famine and epidemics will start soon, if you do not take control of everything. And also, he added, if someone engages in looting or something similar, shoot on the spot. Now discipline among fighters above all. Report to personnel. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, sir. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Follow. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He spent the soldier wearily glance, until he disappeared around the bend. Ahead still raids on the laboratory for the production of "dust", which kept the army cones.
