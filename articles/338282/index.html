  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vivaldi 1.12 - Immersion in the details</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.12_hero_screen_RU.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Hello! <br><br>  What do we see working daily on the net?  Texts, images, files - in general, simple and long-familiar elements, of which, in fact, consists of the content, the content of web pages and, in fact, the entire Internet.  All these elements carry certain information and, as a rule, this information is always in sight - we easily read it from the screen.  But in reality, the world is not as primitive as it seems at first glance: even the simplest things can hide a lot of additional useful information that can tell a lot about the subject under study. <br><br>  These are the questions that we dealt with when preparing today's version of the Vivaldi 1.12 browser.  Moreover, you have long asked to add such functions.  And we did it, without distracting from the much more important and long-awaited new products that you will see in the next versions of the browser.  So, meet:

    <ul><li>  View image information </li><li>  Extended Download Panel </li><li>  Adjust the color saturation of browser themes </li></ul><br>  Now let's take a closer look at these improvements. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  View image information </h3><br>  There are many pictures in the network and sometimes it is very useful to see how the author achieved such beauty: what camera he took, with what aperture and shutter speed, when and where, in general - the more information the better.  Quite often, such data is hidden inside the image file itself, and now you can read this data: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.12_image_props_RU.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  To get to the information about the image, just select the corresponding item ‚ÄúImage Properties‚Äù in the context menu of the image.  The authors of the pictures do not always leave a lot of information about their works, but the browser will try to give the maximum of what can be viewed: <br><br><ul><li>  File name and network address </li><li>  The model of the camera with which the picture was taken </li><li>  Aperture settings and sensitivity parameters (ISO) </li><li>  Exposure and focal length </li><li>  Histogram, white balance and color model </li><li>  Image and file sizes </li><li>  Time and date of snapshot </li><li>  Event location </li><li>  Copyright </li><li>  The program used to process the image </li></ul><br>  This feature will be useful for those who are interested in photography or web design.  Judging by the number of requests for this function, we have many such users. <br><br><h3>  Extended Download Panel </h3><br>  The following function is useful to those who often download various files from the network.  That is, almost all users.  Now, when downloading a file, detailed information is displayed in the sidebar of downloads about which file is being loaded, from where, where, at what speed, and how long to wait until it all ends: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://vivaldi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1.12_downloads_RU.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Here, of course, there is still something to work on, so we are waiting for your suggestions and recommendations - how to make this function more useful and more convenient. <br><br><h3>  Adjust the color saturation of browser themes </h3><br>  Those who use Vivaldi from the very first days of the browser‚Äôs life will surely remember how many different reviews were caused by the function of changing the color of the browser window when browsing various web pages.  Let me remind you that the color is taken from the site icon.  So many then told us thanks for such an unusual, but useful function.  In some browsers, it even appeared as an extension. <br><br>  But there were those to whom the colors seemed too bright and annoying.  For them, we provided for disabling this feature and naively thought that the problem was solved.  As it turned out a little later, in addition to supporters of radical solutions, there were also those who, as it were, and not against, but as if not for.  In general, everything is difficult.  Well, that's what we are here to do to solve complex problems.  Since some users have not yet decided how much they are for or against the color highlighting of the browser window, we decided to offer them a special setting with which they can independently set the desired level of color saturation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://ru.vivaldi.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/970/2017/09/saturation.png" alt="image"></div><br>  On this review, new features and you can finish.  Of course, this is not all changes - a complete list, including also a lot of corrected errors, you will find on <a href="https://update.vivaldi.com/update/1.0/relnotes/1.12.955.36.html">this page</a> . <br><br>  Yes, and not to get up twice.  Synchronization and mail client are still actively developing within the company and very soon will be offered to all users for testing.  And about the mobile version, we have not said anything?  Well, we will not say anything yet.  Everything has its time. <br><br>  That's all.  As always, if you find an error or you have recommendations and tips for improving the browser - let us know about them through the appropriate <a href="https://vivaldi.com/bugreport/">form of sending error messages</a> . <br><br>  You can download a new version of the browser from the <a href="https://vivaldi.com/download/">official download page</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338282/</a></p>
