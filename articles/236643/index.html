  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Astronomy at the computer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That began the new school year.  Pupils and students poured through the doors of scientific institutions.  And teachers and teachers prepared to meet them.  But now, the first days have already passed, the joy (am I not mistaken?) The meetings have calmed down a bit and ordinary days have come.  Teachers on the one hand, students and pupils on the other.  The chain that unites them is the subject being studied, the personal character of both representatives of the one and the other, their charisma, communication skills, and so on.  And if the character, and other qualitative features of the individual are different depending on the person, then the subject serves as something generalizing.  And it is interesting, having presented to his student (student) with high quality, the teacher (teacher) establishes a strong connection with the audience.  On the other hand, the audience of interest "eats" with pleasure. <br>  Accordingly, I wanted to dwell on the teaching of an interesting and most ancient science - astronomy.  Or rather, not even on teaching, as about this, but about its diversity.  How can you diversify teaching in the 21st century?  Of course, using software and modern gadgets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This publication will be a small overview of the programs that make it possible to facilitate and diversify the teaching and study of such an interesting subject as astronomy. <br><br>  <b>SkyChart (Cartes du Ciel)</b> <br>  SkyChart (Cartes du Ciel) - sky atlas, free planetarium software for MS Windows, Mac OS X, Linux.  The program allows you to create maps of the sky using many astronomical catalogs of stars and nebulae, taking into account the positions of planets, asteroids, comets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/168/2b8/19b/1682b819b9954b56af31967eb9045f90.png">

      The goal of the program is to prepare various star charts for specific observation.  A large number of customizable parameters can be selected either automatically or manually: the catalogs used, the color and size of stars and nebulae, the display of the grid, and much more. <br>  All these features allow the heavenly atlas to fully compete with the programs of planetariums. <br>  Download SkyChart (Cartes du Ciel) here: <a href="http://www.ap-i.net/skychart/ru/start">www.ap-i.net/skychart/ru/start</a> . <br><br>  <b>Kstars</b> <br>  KStars is a planetarium program included in the KDE Education Project educational package. <br>  The program is available to users of UNIX-systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a2/311/987/5a23119873df484099482e0393d1d982.png"><br><br>  The goal of the program is to prepare various star charts for specific observation.

In this virtual planetarium, the user can freely travel through the universe. <br>  The program is available to users of MS Windows, Mac OS X, Linux platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/9e0/fb3/8339e0fb375746e5bd7780530f43da06.png"><br><br>  Celestia displays objects in the solar system, more than 100,000 stars according to the Hipparcos catalog, more than 10,000 galaxies.  There is an extension mechanism for adding more objects.  Accordingly, in the network, you can find many add-ons created by enthusiasts from around the world. <br>  The program allows you to take screenshots, record videos.  There is support for training scenarios. <br>  Download Celestia: <a href="http://celestia.sourceforge.net/">celestia.sourceforge.net</a> . <br><br>  <b>Stellarium 0.13.0</b> <br>  Stellarium is a realistic 3 D sky simulation in real time.  It displays the stars, constellations, planets, nebulae and other things like soil, landscapes, atmosphere.  In fact, it is one of the best planetariums.  It is also free, and available for both MS Windows, Mac OS X, Linux platforms, and for Simbian, Android, iOS (Stellarium Mobile). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4f/ee5/c6b/d4fee5c6b2814df1a3a39abbc045eebe.png"><br><br>  The catalog of this program, by default, consists of more than 600,000 stars (there are additional downloadable catalogs with more than 210 million stars), data on almost all objects of the NGC catalog, Messier objects and the Milky Way.  All the planets of the solar system and their main satellites are present.  Artistic images of all constellations are available, and there is a choice of drawings from a variety of cultures (modern Western, Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Chinese, and others).  There is the possibility of modeling solar and lunar eclipses.  In the location window, you can change not only the city or country but also the planet. <br>  There is support for plugins. <br>  Download Stellarium here: <a href="http://stellarium.org/">stellarium.org</a> . <br><br>  <b>WorldWibe Telescope (WWT)</b> <br>  WorldWibe Telescope (WWT) is a planetarium program running under the control of a client program on a Windows platform or a cross-platform browser client created using Silverlight technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9b/ced/d72/f9bcedd72ee14fb7b4fa938bf353b888.png"><br><br>  The WWT Virtual Planetarium allows you to view a detailed photographic map of the starry sky, as well as the surfaces of various bodies of the Solar System, to travel on the Earth and the Universe, to simulate celestial phenomena occurring both at present and at any time from 1 to 4 000 g. n  e. <br>  WorldWibe Telescope official website: <a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/">www.worldwidetelescope.org</a> . <br><br>  <b>Google Earth</b> <br>  Google Earth is a cross-platform project of Google, which included satellite images of the entire surface of the Earth.  This program has interesting bookmarks: ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù, ‚ÄúSky‚Äù, ‚ÄúMars‚Äù, ‚ÄúMoon‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/a86/6bb/d61a866bb673420f890e069c0082dc44.png"><br><br>  And if everything is clear with the function ‚ÄúEarth‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSky‚Äù leaves much to be desired, then ‚ÄúMoon‚Äù and ‚ÄúMars‚Äù can be actively used when studying these celestial bodies. <br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/ru/earth/">www.google.com/intl/ru/earth</a> . <br><br>  <b>Orbiter 2010</b> <br>  Orbiter 2010 is a free space flight simulator with carefully crafted realistic physics and extensive configuration and writing of various extensions.  Realistic physical models of ship dynamics, atmospheric phenomena, and planetary motion are used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9be/05c/82c/9be05c82cfaf4dd08bfa807aca38d95a.png"><br><br>  The simulator allows you to fly into space, flights between planets and orbital stations, both on real-life (or existing) and fantastic spacecraft.  To him developed a large number of addons. <br>  The program works under the MS Windows platform. <br>  You can <a href="http://orbiter2010.ucoz.ru/">view the</a> program, instructions, addons here: <a href="http://orbiter2010.ucoz.ru/">orbiter2010.ucoz.ru</a> . <br><br>  As the reader noted, in my review, I considered only free software.  It is available online and anyone can read it.  I hope that this review will be useful not only to students and their teachers, but also to all those interested in astronomy and astronautics. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236643/</a></p>
