  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My story "Robophile" (based on the animated series "Chobits")</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Chii was sitting at the table across from me, nicely folding her hands.  Everything about her was cute, cute to impossibility, as it should be in chobits.  This robot was no different from the drawn character, whom I loved so much from childhood.  Am I alone?  Probably millions of people in the world went crazy with this childish face, long platinum hair with an intricate hairstyle, causing a dress and her sweetest ‚ÄúChia‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While I was eating, Chii stared at me with her devouring gaze.  For the robot, I was nothing more than an abstract source of commands and information.  She knew almost everything about me only with one such look, although she behaved like a little child. <br>  - Chii? <br>  ‚ÄúIt's all right, we're finishing now ...‚Äù <br><br>  Chii came to me not so long ago, there were a lot of ‚Äúwhite spots‚Äù in her self-learning program, and almost everything had to be taught, although at times it was funny.  I stopped thinking about her and went back to my plate. <br>  Chii cooked superbly, with skill that was incomprehensible to me, and as a housewife was indispensable.  But in my heart the cats scrubbed, so I ate little, but Chii with the agility of the maid in an instant removed the dishes. <br><br>  I could not sit still and decided to immediately walk along the street.  The mood was getting worse, I did not look around, staring at my feet.  Sometimes I forgot that Chii, who was looking straight ahead, then at me, was walking alongside.

      I could not stand it and took him, this indefatigable robot, by the hand, as if we were an ordinary couple in love.  Chobit even ‚ÄúChii‚Äù did not say, and his fingers were just a miracle.  Who would doubt that! <br><br>  And suddenly I noticed on myself the glance of a classmate, who happened to be walking along the same street.  With a view of a man who missed the train, she, silently and gloomily, passed by us. <br><br>  The cry ‚ÄúChii?‚Äù Brought me back to the land where only I and Chii were.  Once I found myself in a quiet corner, cut off from the bustle of the city, where no one saw us. <br><br>  With incomprehensible determination, I abruptly turned my whole body towards Chii.  I never imagined how low she is, my little one.  I knelt in front of her and gave a little hug.  Her "Chii?" Followed immediately. <br>  ‚ÄúShut up, don't move!‚Äù I whispered in her ear, if the robots have ears at all, and began to furiously kiss the insensible inhuman face as from the picture. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  The next day at school I was waiting for a note from that same classmate. <br><br>  It seemed that the lessons were drawn for eternity and that it was better to die than to live like this.  Thoughts endlessly galloped from Chii to that girl and vice versa.  I myself was like a robot, remarking, I managed to answer questions, complete tasks and even get good grades. <br><br>  But this torture ended for today, and I was already standing in a secluded place next to the author of the note.  Not a beauty, a bit cute, but nothing more, and the ugly school uniform made it even more inconspicuous. <br>  - Do you already have someone?  Do you go on dates? <br>  - Why?  Are you jealous?  This is my robot, I live with it. <br><br>  The girl, whose name I never remembered, blushed.  I noticed that she was standing too close at arm's length. <br><br>  - Why are you not dating girls?  Or do not you like them? <br>  - Do you even meet someone?  Come to my house? <br><br>  She gave me a slap in the face without any hesitation and walked away energetically, seething with anger and pouting at the whole world. <br><br>  I silently stood and looked after her, not feeling pain and resentment and watching how one more unattached heart disappears forever from my life.  When her back disappeared from sight, in my head flashed: "I wonder how is Chii doing?" <br><br>  September 22-23, 2007, Kalachinsk </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25920/</a></p>
