  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What IT professionals play and do not play (summary 2018)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  8 years ago I first wrote on Habr√© about board games that are played in IT offices.  We have a discount program for business cards of various IT companies, and now for many years we know more precisely who loves what.  I'll tell you now. <br><br>  But for now, I just want to say about another trend.  Do you know how the good old books suddenly start to release in the form of films?  Type here the series about the witcher is filmed there.  The first time I was surprised when I saw the screen version of the desktop role-playing system Shadowrun (the film "Brightness").  But before that there was a great game Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and before it there was generally Shadowrun for Sega, and the hit one. <br><br>  So now we have the second round of postmodern.  People take the good old computer games and make them desktop.  For example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/a5/wv/voa5wvz05g4imbx-sd_u2emuz8e.jpeg"><br><br>  There is Fallaut.  But I do not believe Bessede, but Sir-Tech I remember very well. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here, then, is Fallaut and Valentin, a man who is able to charm any girl n at the exhibition and ask her for a promotional sample of the game: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/49/m_/jl/49m_jl34-v16mwi7et4mjhplste.jpeg"><br><br>  And here is the Jagged Alliance field: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ky/xg/ry/kyxgrybrpeeo9rjckzmbrrbtt4k.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Seen by Ivan Dolvich.</sup>  <sup>We on the nighttime answering machine of the Mosigra call center, by the way, are worth his phrase from the answering machine from the mercenaries website.</sup> <br><br>  The second important trend is that games acquire applications.  So far it turns out well with ‚ÄúSpace truckers‚Äù ( <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/176517">I wrote about them</a> ) and <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/258655/">Neuroshimy</a> .  Children are happy, for them this is already the natural interface number 1, and not something that needs to be taught: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/nh/gt/jdnhgtm1dh2r5sm5ajxkr-jq7jq.jpeg"><br><br>  The third trend - there are a lot of hybrid games (here is the <a href="https://habr.com/company/mosigra/blog/430960/">last post</a> about them). <br><br><h2>  Out of the market </h2><br>  During this time, the Starcraft desktop, Roboralli, and Twilight of the empire (something like Master of Orion, but they did not agree on the license for the race, and as a result there is a separate MOO game) and many other games of the era of market development.  There is no classic Doom, Space Hulk for Warhammer almost never for sale and so on.  The editions of ‚ÄúSpace alarm‚Äù, ‚ÄúSepticon‚Äù have been sold out, many versions of ‚ÄúCivilization‚Äù have been eroded (the latter are even being sold). <br><br>  This does not mean that computer games are not needed in the desktop market.  This means that we have become old. <br><br>  Seriously, the market is being updated, for example, relatively recently there has been a very successful project on the This War of Mine desktop.  Subjectively, it could be screwed up, but it turned out to be very interesting. <br><br><h2>  Favorite games in Russia </h2><br>  But let's talk about what they play in IT offices all the same. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC">Imaginarium</a> - judging by the number of Mail.ru Group sold at a corporate discount, it seems there is played in every room.  Good game on the association to the pictures.  In general, Imaginarium is always in hits, and is constantly updated.  For example, Imaginaire Dobro (with children's drawings) and Imaginiarium Novogodniy (for those who missed all additions) have recently come out.  By the way, the game is in hits and in Microsoft, but in MS they also take additions. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/jackal_treasure_island/">Jackal</a> and the new edition <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/shakal_arhipelag/">Jackal Archipelago</a> - goes to almost every IT office.  I suspect that this is still the same fame as a hit (it was the best sales strategy of the year several times with us, and last year it became the game of the year), plus the fact that the game came from MSU.  The archipelago directly pleases: a strategy without a long ‚Äúswinging‚Äù, a solution from the first moves. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/otvet_za_5_sek/">Answer in 5 seconds</a> - another "universal" game for parties.  A simple quiz where you need to quickly and quickly answer the simple same questions.  Due to the high priori probability of purchase, it falls into all IT offices. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/codenames/">Code names</a> - this beautiful thing is very popular with people from SAP.  Most likely, due to expatriates in the state or a large number of people communicating with Europe - it‚Äôs still a European hit (but not yet a Russian one).  In general, if you have not seen it - I strongly advise you, the game is beautiful. <br><br>  Uno could not help but get to the top, again due to the high priori probability of purchase.  And the point is not the name of the novelty " <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/uno_dos/">UNO DOS</a> " that caresses the ear - it does not start under DOS and appeared not so long ago.  No special preferences, just take it all.  IT guys too. <br><br>  From the interesting - according to the Yandex discount program, it is clearly seen that very interesting people live in the office.  Someone very fond of the game of <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/opiata/">honey agaric</a> and blew on the team, it seems.  Another uncharacteristically distinguished love for " <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/Lifeboat/">Overboard!</a>  ¬ªSyadek and <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Ekivokam</a> .  Perhaps we are to blame because we spent a couple of corporate events there and dragged these games in a heap. <br><br>  Well, traditional geek games are already straight: <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/nefarius/">Nefarius</a> about crazy scientists, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/manhattan_project/">Project Manhattan</a> ‚Äù about project management and nuclear program, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/startup/">Startup</a> ‚Äù about panic in the eyes of PM'a, excellent <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/soprotivlenie/">Resistance</a> (we released the second edition) and the <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Hive</a> .  There are no surprises. <br><br>  I can also advise ‚ÄúThe <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/bitva_polov/">Battle of the Sexes</a> ‚Äù (she has a terrible edition, you can't give it) out of the unusual - but she is a great instigator of cheerful holivar in the company. <br><br>  While all of the news from the fields.  About six years ago I was asked here to make such a post not on January 20, after summing up all the results of the year, but in December, in order, if anything, to have time to buy presents.  Therefore, here.  And at once I remind you that the phrase ‚ÄúI know the password - Habrahabr‚Äù in any store in the country inevitably leads to a discount.  Just do not tell the sellers what Habrahabr is, maintain the tradition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433128/</a></p>
