      1. <b>transparent</b> - absolutely all information is open both inside and outside (including the fact that <br>  usually considered a secret - income, salaries, processes, suppliers, employees) <br>  no patents - everything that is invented, is given for use without restrictions; <br><br>  2. A free corporation does not set its primary goal to make a profit.  The mission of a free corporation is <b>to improve the quality of life of people</b> (both consumers and employees) <br><br>  if it is more close to life: for example, the release of a medicine, the creation of some household items, the creation of useful Internet services <br><br>  3. The <b>rate of return</b> is a fixed percentage of research, investment and new projects of the corporation;  (Provided if these studies, projects and investments are available) <br><br>  For example: 5% (this is the client‚Äôs progress charge) <br><br>  4. <b>pricing is flexible</b> - as soon as a new technology or process was introduced or something was optimized - the price of the product changes in a tight second ... because the costs have decreased, <br>  but if something went wrong, the price may rise ... (otherwise someone will be left without a salary) <br><br>  Pricing formula: Product price = cost price + 5% development rate of return <br><br>  what is important is that any buyer knows what constitutes the price of a product of a Free Corporation, a <b>public formula</b> <br><br>  5. <b>people</b> (employees): the corporation must constantly think and take care of its employees; <br>  (improve working conditions, life) <br><br>  Corporate employees are like-minded and ideologically like honest work for the good <br>  people and themselves, they like creative activities.  They like that the corporation with them is honest and <br>  they know everything that happens and why it is done. <br><br>  Responsibility of employees as in any company.  You work badly - sanctions, if it's good - honor and praise, the opportunity to grow and do more. <br><br>  Salary at market level. <br><br>  Ideas and initiatives are encouraged. <br><br>  6. <b>Shareholders / owners of</b> Shareholders in a free corporation.  Owners and top managers do not receive bonuses, do not receive dividends, but if they work for the benefit of the corporation, for example, in the positions of directors, then they receive the RFP like all employees.  (here is the moment that causes me the most doubt, but if there are no shareholders, then there are no dividends) <br><br>  Maximum for the founding fathers - pension.  But it is better to let them work with everyone =) <br><br>  7. The corporation acts exclusively in the legal field and <b>loves the constitution</b> and abides by the law :) <br><br>  8. <b>cost reduction</b> is the second goal of each employee of the corporation. <br><br><h5>  What is the trick: </h5><br>  1. personnel: people like to work creatively and earn when they are honest with them; <br>  <b>reach out to us, but we take only the best</b> <br><br>  2. customers: again, everyone likes <br>  when with them are honest and open and <br>  when do for people <br>  when the product or service does not include excess gratitude (in the form of the rate of profit <br>  which in traditional companies varies from tens to hundreds of percent, for rare <br>  exceptions); <br>  <b>cheaper and better</b> <br><br>  3. and of course we are not steaming about our inventions - you can use <br>  them for the common good, we will only be happy, but we will try to introduce them ourselves <br>  in their products and services.  Often, the first mover has an advantage. <br>  <b>freedom of knowledge and technology</b> <br><br>  4. <b>competitiveness is</b> determined by the social vector of the corporation: cheaper, <br>  employees are better, quality is possible, technologies are open, and methods and methods <br>  work.  (we accept everything: anger, gratitude, rats.predlozheniya, criticism or bugs :) <br>  income taxes less <br>  <b>will set the heat to traditional companies :)</b> <br><br><h4>  Doubts: </h4><br><br>  1. where does the investment come from if there is no profit (in the form of dividends)? <br>  perhaps in the form of some kind of commitment, if the company succeeds <br>  pay the amount of investment + risk premium assumed by the investor <br><br>  2. The problem started: someone is very risky giving money for this ‚Äúfree adventure‚Äù :) <br>  on one side of the scales is a risk, for something on the other to be a pioneer (in my opinion <br>  it is very weighty) <br><br>  3. reserves, and stability - such as the formation of reserves gives corporations <br>  stability under changing conditions, but you can create reserves <br>  only at the expense of consumers, increasing the cost of reserves: / <br><br>  4. with such transparency, how to make a surprise?  ;) <br>  or how to intrigue people with a new product, as Apple sometimes does <br><br>  5. there is a risk that they will shoot and shake: / <br><br><h4>  Similar models </h4><br><br>  1. Open-surs, some things are done on the idea; <br>  2. Coworking; <br>  3. Can you tell me in the comments? <br><br><h4>  Here is about a concept.  How do you?  :) </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70725/</a></p>
