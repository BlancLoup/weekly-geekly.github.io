This is no accident: in both releases there is a function that allows these products to work together.  We develop our products in such a way that they are maximally integrated with each other, this becomes a good tradition and practically the standard of the company. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kerio.ru/products/kerio-connect">Kerio Connect 8.3</a> adds significant changes to the security and usability of the Kerio Connect client, namely: support for digital signatures and email encryption, the ability for users to "over the air" to remove Exchange Active / Sync devices and the ability to make calls directly from an email with one click . <br><br>  First, consider the 3 most important features of the new release.

    <h4>  <b>1. S / MIME support in Kerio Connect client</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>What is it?</b> </h5><br>  <b>Kerio Connect now allows users to send and receive digitally signed messages as well as encrypted messages (S / MIME) in the Kerio Connect client.</b> <br>  S / MIME provides the necessary set of tools for identifying the sender‚Äôs identity and encrypting the transmitted e-mail. <br>  In the Kerio Connect client, users can now ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ send digitally signed emails to authenticate the sender <br>  ‚Ä¢ encrypt email content so that only the trusted recipient can read it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ read encrypted messages received from other users <br><br>  For S / MIME to work correctly, the following conditions must be met ... <br>  Both the receiver and the sender must <br>  ‚Ä¢ use an email client that supports S / MIME (for example: Kerio Connect client, Outlook, Apple Mail, iOS Mail) <br>  ‚Ä¢ have your own public and private key obtained from a certification agency <br>  ‚Ä¢ have each other‚Äôs public keys obtained from digitally signed letters sent to each other <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>For what?</b> </h5><br>  <b>Digital signature and message encryption is used when sending confidential information by e-mail, when you need to verify the authenticity of the recipient and the sender.</b> <br>  S / MIME support in the Kerio Connect client gives users greater flexibility when using email clients when they need to send encrypted or digitally signed emails or receive encrypted emails. <br><br><h5>  <b>For whom?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>This feature is intended for both business owners and IT administrators and ordinary employees of companies.</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Business owners will be calm knowing that confidential information sent via e-mail will be protected. <br>  ‚Ä¢ IT administrators will not have to force company employees to use a specific email client to comply with a company's security policy. <br>  ‚Ä¢ End users can use any email client to exchange encrypted emails no matter what PC or browser they are on. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. Simplified management of user contact information</b> </h4><br><br><h5>  <b>What is it?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>The new Contact tab on the Add User and Edit User screens in the web administration interface allows the server administrator to manage user contact information directly in the web interface.</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ User data includes first name, last name, photo, phone, mobile phone, department, office location, etc. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now the full contact information of users is stored not only in the directory service, but also in the local user database <br>  ‚Ä¢ User contact information is synchronized with the global address list (GAL) and directory service <br>  ‚Ä¢ Company addresses can now be identified and used in user contact information and in domain footnotes <br><br><h5>  <b>For what?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>Previously, extended contact information about users and their photos was only available when using integration with directory services.</b>  <b>Now the same information can be stored in a local user database.</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Administrators can now manage user contact information directly in the Kerio Connect web-based administration interface. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Administrators no longer need to switch between the web interface and the directory service management interface - all changes made on the contacts screen are synchronized with the GAL <br>  ‚Ä¢ When viewing a message in the Kerio Connect client, user photos are now located next to the email address, even if a local user database is used. <br><br><h5>  <b>For whom?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>This feature is primarily intended for IT administrators, although it is also useful for regular users.</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ IT administrators will love the fact that the management of user contact information has appeared in the Kerio Connect web-based administration interface, and has become simpler and more independent of whether a directory service or local user base is used. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now, when using special variable fields in the domain footnotes, users do not need to create their own signatures.  User photos will be visible in the email headers, as well as in the instant messaging client, even if the administrator does not use the directory service. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. ‚ÄúClick to Call‚Äù function in the Kerio Connect client interface</b> </h4><br><br><h5>  <b>What is it?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>Now users of the Kerio Connect client can make calls with one click using integration with Kerio Operator</b> <br>  You can call ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ by clicking on any phone number in the Kerio Connect Address Book of the client <br>  ‚Ä¢ by clicking on the sender or recipient of the message in the message header, and selecting the phone number <br>  ‚Ä¢ by selecting any number in the body of the letter, and clicking on it to call <br>  This feature works in versions of <a href="http://www.kerio.ru/products/kerio-connect">Kerio Connect 8.3</a> and higher and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kerio/blog/224471/">Kerio Operator 2.3</a> and higher. <br><br><h5>  <b>For what?</b> </h5><br><br>  <b>The ‚ÄúClick to Call‚Äù feature in the Kerio Connect client improves employee productivity and efficiency by removing unnecessary actions when trying to make a call.</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Users do not need to spend time searching for a number and dialing it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Simply select the number you want to call, click and pick up the phone. <br><br><h5>  <b>For whom?</b> </h5><br><br>  End users will be delighted with the ability to simply click on the name of a colleague or select a phone number and start a call - you no longer need to search for numbers and dial them on the phone. <br><br><h4>  <b>Other innovations</b> </h4><br><br>  <b>Multiple user mail accounts in a single KOFF mail profile</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Users can now have multiple Kerio Connect accounts in one Outlook profile, allowing them to choose which email address will be displayed in the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù field. <br><br>  <b>Managing Exchange ActiveSync devices from the Kerio Connect client interface</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Users will now be able to remove devices synchronized via the Exchange ActiveSync protocol directly in the Kerio Connect client "over the air" <br><br>  <b>Variable fields in domain footnotes</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ An administrator can create a generic user signature for a shared domain footnote, which will allow you to attach a personalized signature for each user sending emails from this domain. <br><br>  <b>Administration Interface Assistant</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ A new search function allows you to quickly find and highlight the necessary dialogues and parameters. <br><br>  <b>Archiving instant messaging history</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ User chat history via instant messaging can be archived for further review by the administrator. <br><br>  <b>Exchange Internet Accounts Support (EWS)</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now, with the automatic configuration service enabled and correctly configured, users can easily set up their Kerio Connect account in Max OS X desktop applications using only a login and password. <br><br><h4>  <b>IMPORTANT: Changes in system requirements</b> </h4><br><br>  <b>Discontinued Support for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ This applies to both the Kerio Connect server and desktop clients. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac, Apple iCal, Apple Address Book, Apple Mail, Safari, and any other Mac OS X applications designed for deployment on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or higher. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The Sophos Antivirus engine also no longer supports Mac OS X 10.5 since May 2014. <br><br>  What does it mean? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Administrators using Mac OS X 10.5 or earlier versions for Kerio Connect and Sophos Antivirus to work properly must upgrade the OS to Mac OS X 10.6 or higher. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Even if the administrator does not upgrade to Kerio Connect 8.3, he will have to do such an OS upgrade for Sophos Anti-Virus to work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Users with Mac OS X 10.5 and below must upgrade their OS on Mac OS X 10.6 or higher. <br><br>  <b>ATTENTION!</b>  <b>May 30, this Friday, will host a webinar on this release.</b>  <b>You can register by the <a href="http://info.kerio.com/RU_KerioConnect8.3.html">link</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224469/</a></p>
