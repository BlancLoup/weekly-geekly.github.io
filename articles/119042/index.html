  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Photoshop companion software for iPad: Adobe Nav, Adobe Color Lava and Adobe Eazel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a month ago, Adobe announced a new Photoshop Touch SDK for developing mobile applications designed to work in conjunction with Photoshop.  And this morning, the first programs for the iPad appeared in the Appstore.  it <br><br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-012322.png"><br>  Nav navigation bar, Color Lava palette and Eazel drawing tool. <br><br>  All three applications are designed for the iPad and can somehow interact with Photoshop from version 12.0.4, the menu of which now has the ability to enable receiving connections.  Since I am a fan of any extensions for Photoshop, I certainly tried all these things and would like to share my opinion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a small entry.  For connecting applications with PS, wifi is used, applications do not work through the cable.  All you need to do is to select the checkbox in the Photoshop Edit&gt; Remote Connections menu and set a password for the connection. <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/Remote_Connections-20110510-235346.png"><br>  And then connect with the FS through the icon in the corner of the application.

      The cheapest ($ 1.99) of the new companion <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/adobe-nav-for-photoshop/id426614130%3Fmt%3D8">software</a> is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/adobe-nav-for-photoshop/id426614130%3Fmt%3D8">Adobe Nav</a> .  It serves two purposes.  First, this is an additional panel, the tools on which you can arrange at your discretion: <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-005529.png"><br><br>  Nav setting: <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-011632.png"><br><br>  Secondly, it is a navigator for open documents. <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-011826.jpg"><br><br>  A 4x4 grid is available for tools, switching occurs with minimal delay.  In the navigator mode, you can view information about open documents. <br><br>  The utility of the program is proportional to the price.  I would be very interested to try it in conjunction with Cintiq tablets (which are a screen with an active area and, I can imagine, it is somewhat difficult to work with the keyboard), but otherwise it is more convenient to switch the keyboard.  For regular users of Photoshop, the thing is pretty pointless, for those who are too lazy to learn hot keys, it can be useful.  My main claim to it is actually no opportunity for extensions.  If it were possible to assign buttons-menu items or scripts, the utility would be much higher (I hope they finish in the future).  Another of the drawbacks can be identified the inability to save Presets from different panels. <br>  Navigator can be conveniently used in a pile of open documents, but Expose (or its analog on Win) do the same and faster. <br><br>  The following application is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/adobe-color-lava-for-photoshop/id417634383%3Fmt%3D8">Color Lava ($ 2.99)</a> .  Palette for mixing colors: choose a color from the left jar, smear nicely, wet your finger with water, take another little paint, mix it up, transfer the color to PS.  In words, idyll, in fact - complete junk.  The trouble with Lava is that the colors are disturbed by the stupidest algorithm, which has nothing to do with mixing real paints.  Here is a look at this shame: <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-011918.jpg"><br><br>  And this is when in ArtRage (Ambient Design raster editor) from time immemorial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJSK7n9rZegU">blue + yellow = green</a> .  Would not recommend it to anyone. <br><br>  And another application - <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/adobe-eazel-for-photoshop/id421302663%3Fmt%3D8">Adobe Eazel ($ 4.99)</a> .  That's cool.  Eazel is a painter, the material feels <i>slightly</i> reminiscent of watercolor: the paint stays ‚Äúwet‚Äù for a while, so the next color is mixed with the previous one (is it worth saying that it is mixed with the wrong algorithms, well, God bless them) In Adobe, at the first, in my opinion, it turned out to make a convenient multitouch-interface.  At first it is absolutely inconvenient, but after ten minutes it is impossible to rejoice. <br>  The principle is that while you are drawing on the screen there are no interface elements, and by taping the top of the screen on the screen below each of the fingers, the menu appears: undo, color, size, opacity and settings.  And by releasing 4 fingers, the remaining we change the selected parameter.  It sounds weird, but Eazel is truly the best drawing experience I've ever tried.  Here is a screenshot (I had to get up in a very funny position to make it) <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-012041.jpg"><br><br>  The colors interfere quite interestingly (it is quite possible that people from Adobe bought the creators of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUwcYP2KMgFc">Moxi</a> worked on this program: it looks like a simplified model of their watercolor). The sensation of magic does not let go.  The finished picture can be transferred to the PS in a fairly high resolution (2x1.5k) <br>  There are also disadvantages and limitations: there are no layers, only one document (!), Only one Undo level, only one brush without any additional settings, not the most outstanding Color Picker. , and having blurted out two times already you will not particularly roll back.  But I really hope that in the future Adobe will develop this program and direction. <br><br>  In parting, this is my ten-minute masterpiece about a humanoid robot, subsequently ruined with overly flowing paint: <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/skitch/skitched-20110511-004026.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119042/</a></p>
