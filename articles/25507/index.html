      Here I once again had such an idea, and I decided to ask the well-known bloggers that they would change in their blogs. <br><br>  This is the question asked: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you now go back, at that time, when you were just starting to blog, what would you do first, and what would you change (would you do differently like you did this time)?‚Äù <br><br>  And such answers were received by me: <br><br>  Dmitry Davydov: <br><br>  "Nothing" <br><br>  Arseny Fedorov aka "Apache" <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think I would simply not have led him.  Would do something else. <br><br>  And after six years, someone would ask me the same question. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dimok <br><br>  ‚ÄúI would write less‚Äú posts in one line ‚Äùbecause I like articles more.  And I would not cancel the comments .. " <br><br>  Maniac <br><br>  "Would not change anything" <br><br>  spomoni <br><br>  nothing.  Everything would have done as it is.  The only thing possible would have started to maintain contact with the bloggers on my subject. <br><br>  Ghostik aka ‚ÄúHomeless without registration‚Äù :-) he is here and the new blog is here <br><br>  I would not change anything ... <br>  All I got is an experience ... and the experience should be different ... <br><br>  MaulNet <br><br>  I would change the subject to: Audrey Hepburn. <br><br>  Petrovich <br><br>  What would I do? <br>  Would consider entering your blog niche. <br>  I would start with general topics and only later talk about things that are specialized in specific matters. <br><br>  Alexey Glazkov <br><br>  If I had started all over again, I would have done everything the same way :) I think I‚Äôm doing everything right. <br><br>  Unique person <br><br>  I think I did everything right.  I would not change anything.  Everything turned out quite well and I am glad about it. <br><br>  Ilya Rabchenok <br><br>  Everything suits me, but it would be possible to immediately make a stand, and not in <br>  Learn the blog open.  On the other hand, LJ gave a lot. <br><br>  Goblin <br><br>  When I did it, I was 39 years old.  Accordingly, before you do something at that age, you first think (as a rule).  The site was needed so that the modem user would load instantly.  He "weighed" 30 kilobytes.  The essence of the site is not the appearance, but what I write on it.  Readers do not go to admire beauty, but read texts.  Well, this site has done an excellent job since its inception. <br><br>  The post would have been published but the answer came from Copernicus. <br><br>  Honestly, I‚Äôd make a blog with a normal domain right away, on a normal hosting :) Well, I already have a domain, but I don‚Äôt want to change the platform.  Otherwise, I would not want to change anything.  Everything was great.  I studied the blogosphere and moved forward.  I did well and successfully.  Many thanks to famous bloggers for those times already - Dimka, Maulnet, Davydov.  Now, if I start a new blog, it will be much easier for me to gather an audience, because on my blog there are about 1000 regular subscribers. <br><br>  That was such a question and such answers were received. <br><br>  By the way, I did not even think that there would be such a response from reputable bloggers, but, after all, they are the same people like us, right?  Or does someone think differently? <br><br>  It is interesting to know, and what conclusions did you make after reading these answers? <br><br>  taken here: <a href="http://vit-v.blogspot.com/">vit-v.blogspot.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25507/</a></p>
