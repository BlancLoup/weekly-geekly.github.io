  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 online survey services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Are the impressive costs of research with marketing agencies always justified, and is there an alternative to agencies in general?  Of course, to carry out a deep analysis of the market or comparable in scale tasks direct road to marketers, if, of course, allows the budget.  But online surveys will help in less global research - there are services that allow you to conduct online surveys as simply as possible: you create a survey, distribute it and get the results already processed.  What kind of service to choose and how such services differ? <br><br>  I propose to evaluate them by the following parameters: <br>  - Is there a trial version? <br>  - Is there a free version, and what does it include? <br>  - Cost and possibilities of the base tariff. <br>  - Optimization for mobile devices. <br>  - The possibility of disseminating the survey. <br>  - Design settings. <br>  - Finding the server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://www.testograf.ru/ru/">Testograf.ru</a> <br>  Testograf offers custom service functionality for free, without limiting the number of polls created, questions and answers received.  The professional version, Testograf PRO, is available at a one-time rate (1 survey, 1 year, 1,390 rubles) and annual (an unlimited number of surveys, 1 year, 12,500 rubles).  It is possible to test the PRO version by creating a survey without registration and payment, but if you want to save the survey, you will need to register, and to get access to the results, you must pay. <br>  The service is optimized for mobile devices. <br>  In addition to self-collection of responses through direct and additional links, there is the possibility of embedding a poll on the site, a pop-up window (auto show or click on the button) and a poll widget with auto show settings and branding.  It is also proposed to search for respondents according to a given target, while the respondents are not paid. <br>  The possibilities of setting up a survey design are quite wide: the color and font of the texts, the color of the buttons and check boxes, the addition of a logo and the settings of the survey cap, changing the background (image, color). <br>  The company's server is located on the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Survio.com <br>  On the free version, you can create 5 questionnaires with an unlimited number of questions and collect max.  100 responses per month. <br>  The minimum tariff ($ 29 / month for a one-time purchase or $ 14 / month for an annual tariff) allows you to create 100 surveys, get 1,000 answers and do not limit the number of questions in the questionnaire. <br>  The service is optimized for mobile devices. <br>  In addition to the standard distribution of the survey via a direct link, there is an embedding of the survey on the site and a pop-up window, however both of these features do not have additional settings.  Paid use of the CINT respondents panel is also proposed for collection. <br>  Design settings include: adding a logo, changing the color theme or using ready-made backgrounds. <br>  The company's server is located in the Czech Republic.

      Surveymonkey.com <br>  It has trial and free versions. <br>  Free, you can create 10 questions and collect 100 answers. <br>  The base rate (1,790 rubles / month) expands the number of collected responses to 1,000. The service is optimized for mobile devices. <br>  It is proposed to distribute the survey to collect answers independently, several possibilities: direct link and additional links, embedding the poll on the site, a pop-up invitation to the survey (there is a design setting and% auto show), a pop-up window of the survey itself (with design setting and% auto show) <br>  The survey design can be changed using the prepared color and background themes or use a custom theme with customizing the color and font of the texts.  Of course, you can add a company logo to the survey. <br>  Surveymonkey server is located in the USA. <br><br>  Google Forms <br>  Google, with a server in the United States, allows you to create a survey for free without limiting the creator to the number of polls, questions and answers received, which, however, will have to be collected on your own using a direct link or embedding in the site (without additional settings).  There is also a mobile version of the service.  When setting up a survey design, you can use prepared color schemes, as well as add a header and logo. <br><br>  Simpoll.ru <br>  The service has both trial and free versions. <br>  The free version allows you to create 3 surveys, limits the number of questions in one questionnaire (max. 10) and the number of responses to a survey (max. 100). <br>  The minimum tariff (150 rubles / month) offers 5 surveys on 25 questions in one questionnaire and 1,500 answers. <br>  Of the minuses - the lack of optimization for mobile devices. <br>  Respondents are also encouraged to search on their own.  In addition to the direct link, there is an embedding on the site and a pop-up window (without settings). <br>  Design settings include changing the color / font of texts and changing the background of the survey (color). <br>  Server service is in Estonia. <br><br>  Each of the listed services is constantly working on expanding the functionality, trying to offer its users something unique.  However, to conduct high-quality online research, many of these problems are simply superfluous, and a fairly standard set of functions that is available on all the above services. <br>  The important thing is that often the creator of the questionnaire, in addition to its customer base, also needs to interview random respondents who are not easily found.  And then you will need help in finding respondents, which are provided only by some services, and those providing this service adhere to different approaches to collecting answers.  Of course, the possibility of self-distribution of the survey, where technical settings and design settings may not be superfluous, are also important. <br>  And yet, today the offer on the online research market is quite wide, which allows you to choose a service that meets all your needs and wishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297686/</a></p>
