  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We learn English cheaply and effectively. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost three years have passed since the writing of the first part.  Probably, even the link to give meaning is gone.  All this time I continued to learn English with the help of various websites and applications, resources changed, but they did not become ideal. <br><br>  At the moment I have not found a single application with which you can learn the language at least to the Advanced level.  It is time to create your own. <br><br>  Yes, there are a lot of bicycles, but I have something to offer, and I remember very well how the local public is concerned about this topic, so comments are welcome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Main application problems </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>There is no automatic repetition of previously learned words:</b> at best, you need to press a separate ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù button, where old words randomly fall out.  When you learn 500 words, it works.  If you are aware of 5000 words, random samples will no longer help you in repeating. </li><li>  <b>Words have many meanings,</b> and you learn 1-2 translations, which go first in a card. </li><li>  <b>There is a lack of grammar, idioms, phrasal verbs, irregular words:</b> this is all that relates to the Advanced level. </li><li>  <b>Voice of words:</b> few announcers, sometimes voiced by robots.  Voicing examples of the use of words I have never seen anywhere.  It is necessary to watch serials in order to somehow develop a hearing. </li><li>  <b>Expensive</b> or with annoying ads.  Although this is not so critical. </li></ul><br>  Now I am learning words with Anki.  Anyone who has used this application will ask me: ‚ÄúHow did you get down to this?‚Äù.  Anki is not friendly, but this is the only application that allows you to learn a lot of words at the expense of a good system of repetitions, and the AnkiDroid mobile application works perfectly offline (I learn the language on the subway on the way to work).

    <h2>  What i suggest </h2><br>  At the moment I managed to work out the layouts of the application, the database structure and the overall system architecture.  Brief information can be viewed in the presentation: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cc1S0aBfl0Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  Pay or say </h3><br>  <b>Pay or Say.</b>  This principle kills several problems at once.  For those who are not ready to pay real money for using the application, you can ask for a little work.  Instead of viewing an advertisement, they can slander words and phrases in their native language.  Further, all records are evaluated, sorted, processed and: <br><br><ul><li>  Quality videos used in the course for the voice of all words and all phrases. </li><li>  All videos are used for teaching artificial intelligence. </li></ul><br>  Even 10 thousand users per year can say 3 million words and phrases.  The guys from FORVO will be envied.  Trained neural networks can not only understand users, but also reveal an accent in the student's speech. <br><br>  You can even trite to sell access to samples of words, so that you can pay salaries to employees and for server rent. <br><br><h3>  Words always in context </h3><br>  A typical card for learning the language: "Word - Translations."  This approach works, I learned about 5,000 words in this way.  But I learned not all the meanings of words, and I don‚Äôt understand how to use many words at all.  The main mistake - we learn words. <br><br>  <b>The main problem of words is that they do not exist.</b> <br><br>  We have many Values ‚Äã‚Äãin our heads, these are abstractions that do not depend on language at all.  The meanings are connected with the Sounding - what we pronounce in our native and foreign languages.  If you graduated from school, then perhaps Values ‚Äã‚Äãare still associated with Writing. <br><br>  Where is the word here?  He is not here.  A word is just a word, another abstraction.  So why teach them? <br>  All words must necessarily be given in context - in sentences.  You read the sentence, the Value pops up in your head, and then the brain <s>simply</s> remembers the bundles of Meaning, Writing and Sounding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/w_/xv/wsw_xv_v-h1pwrvs8iuz1sjpd00.png"><br><br>  For each Meaning its own phrase (within reason). <br><br><h3>  Ease of use </h3><br>  One language - one ‚Äúlearn‚Äù button. <br><br>  By this button for the training session, the user receives: <br><br><ul><li>  New words, including their irregular forms. </li><li>  The repetition of words: the better you know the word, the less often it appears in repetitions.  Anki can do this, but the replay system should be smarter. </li><li>  Phrases with grammar elements: new and repetitions.  Here is very good old Pimsler, it is a pity that in his time there were no applications, but only audio tapes. </li><li>  Idioms and phrasal verbs.  This is already for advanced. </li></ul><br>  As soon as some developers get rid of them, they stuff a bunch of Lessons into the interface, until you get to the right place - the desire to learn disappears. <br><br><h3>  Stable work offline </h3><br>  This not only saves the nerves of users, but also reduces the load on the server. <br>  That's all, nothing supernatural.  Why is there no such application on the market?  <s>Maybe it‚Äôs enough to hire productologists who are not able to do anything other than marketing?</s> <br><br><h3>  About sad </h3><br>  According to the most modest estimates (experience is not lost), the creation of such a system will cost at least $ 300,000, and this is without artificial intelligence, an embedded social network, a bookstore and a database of teachers.  Development of all components and promotion of the application - this is about $ 2,000,000. <br><br>  Investors in projects at the ‚Äúconcept‚Äù stage do not come close, so there‚Äôs only one hope - to get initial investments through crowdfunding.  The more people learn about the project - the greater the chance that the perfect application will appear.  The more questions, comments and suggestions you leave to me - the more likely that the application will be perfect for you. <br><br><h3>  Materials </h3><br>  <a href="">General architecture</a> <br>  <a href="">Database structure</a> <br>  <a href="https://7h461l.axshare.com/">Application</a> layouts, clickable, in Russian. <br>  <a href="https://wg627n.axshare.com/">Layouts of the application</a> , in English. <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458850/</a></p>
