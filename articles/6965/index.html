      Agree, if a dear-looking girl, who came to work as a secretary, writes depressive blog posts about ‚Äúblood and dirt‚Äù, then it is worth assessing the feasibility of her job taking into account this new face of her personality :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I do not like to spend time on personal interviews with a potential employee.  In general, if I had my way, I would have sat somewhere with a gray-eyed brown-haired woman and / or a natural blue-eyed blonde, a laptop, fast internet and would not go anywhere, and would not drive, only worked remotely.  Therefore, all innovations in the activity of Light Loan are aimed primarily at achieving this high goal: D <br><br>  And the fact that we, besides the fact that we started first in the industry in general, were the first to make the majority of contacts with customers and partners online, and the fact that our ATSka (when it is not busy calling and does not transfer to the answering machine: oops :) redirects calls to employees where anything transparent to the caller, and that the employee has the opportunity to work equally fully in the office, at home, etc., etc. <br><br>  So the reduction of personal interviews is quite a necessary measure to maintain the overall integrity of the company's style :) <br>  About 70% of applicants are eliminated at the stage of reading a resume.  Not too young, they want too much money, they have work experience, but rather harmful work is all stop factors of which there are many.  And, unfortunately, the photo too. <br><br>  I write letters to the rest if the person writes correctly, i.e.  there is a signature, there is a greeting (and not an automat inserting Hello, suslov! God knows where), and the text is literate, then it would be necessary to schedule an interview.  But when the head of the customer service department had not yet gone on maternity leave - that was, in a way, her duty.  And this year everything.  Only I was left for interviews. <br><br>  And what is interesting is that the job seeker's blog is quite simple to find.  It would be an incentive :) Of course, if you have at least some experience searching for someone.  E-mails are always indicated in the summary, and then in Yandex you can search by full name or by mail, find, for example, the full name and address of ICQ next to it, then search ICQ and find a nickname on some forum.  In parallel, see what's left in ICQ itself.  In general, if the applicants are 5-7, then, spending fifteen minutes on each minute, you can find interesting information, and as a main goal - a personal blog. <br><br>  If there is nothing at all, then perhaps the person is not very active on the network for some reason.  And since such reasons may be a weak acquaintance with a computer and the Internet, we do not need such a person. <br><br>  But if you have a blog!  I‚Äôll just make a reservation that I don‚Äôt consider this an interference with privacy, for the simple reason that a blog is usually public and public. <br><br>  In the blog, I am interested in the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù of the identity of the applicant, because at the interview all the paws and hardworking workers.  And let the applicant in the blog, too, try to create some kind of image, but this image is clearly not intended for the employer.  Those.  if a person writes that ‚Äúit‚Äôs terrible to work, I want to hang out all the time, at the last job they were all the same scum and intriguers, like at the previous one, they famously chatted yesterday with Katka, filed a job application form - you need to perekantovatsya somewhere business will not start, bloody gebnya around "and other nice phrases, you should not take it, even if he is a professional.  Because this professional can be terrible in its moral and ethical qualities. <br><br>  Here, revealed the secret of the internal dropout.  Now I have to be suspicious of the records like ‚Äútomorrow I will call this wonderful company Easy Loan about work, because I really, really want to become a mortgage broker!‚Äù.  What if the author of such a record just read this article?  : p </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6965/</a></p>
