And the search begins.  Searches to buy and not to give.  The very essence of the gift in modern society has lost its original meaning.  In pursuit of material benefits, comfort and financial well-being, we began to forget about the most important.  These mandatory dates only constrain us, and we ask our relatives and friends ‚Äúwhat to give you?‚Äù, And without receiving an answer, we solve the problem, but the choice of a gift has become the problem, money in a beautiful envelope - let the person give himself be any  Or simply buy unnecessary trinkets, which we have a full wardrobe, and give or peredarim. <br><br>  Each person has his own talents: someone can draw, someone can compose music, someone understands chips, someone is interested in photography, you can continue indefinitely.  Even a simple ability to cook is already an ability that can be developed.  Why not use these talents and try to create a gift yourself?  There are many options: write a song, poems, make a video, create a photo book, arrange a photo session, create a photo album of memories with captions that only you and your loved one can understand.

      In this case, you will take into account all the interests and characteristics of the people to whom you want to make a gift.  No one knows their preferences better than you, and no one better than you will give them real, living emotions that will be remembered for a long time and will lift their spirits on a gloomy rainy evening. <br>  At the moment, a sufficient number of creative sites and communities in social networks have been created to help you show your talent and make a real interesting gift. <br><br>  Here is a small selection of such sites: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.infoniac.ru/news/Interesnye-podarki-svoimi-rukami.html">infoniac</a> - the site contains many tips on how to make a gift with your own hands, there are video tutorials, as well as useful information in addition to gifts.  This site has a community in the social network <a href="http://vk.com/infoniac">infoniac</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://propodelki.ru/">progodelki</a> - on this site everything is correctly explained, and most importantly there is a description of what you can make gifts with your own hands, study the technique you like, and then everything depends on the flight of your imagination. <br><br>  <a href="http://podelkisvoimirukami.ru/">podelkisvoimirukami</a> is a very good site, a lot of various handicrafts and their constant updating, plus, again, various techniques and ideas for creativity. <br><br>  In social networks, such as VKontakte, there are also a lot of do-it-yourself gift communities: <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/i_d_t">One</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/smart.gifts">Two</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/public46257871">Three</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://goquests.ru/">goQuests</a> is a decent and still free application where you can create quests for your loved ones - it can be anything you want - from a hidden gift to a place where you will wait for a person and arrange a holiday for him or just positive emotions from passing specifically for human assignments. <br><br>  PS <br>  Do-it-yourself gifts are more valuable than those purchased in stores; emotions upon receipt are much brighter and richer.  You can easily check this by trying it at least once. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293038/</a></p>
