I didn‚Äôt want to miss something interesting while chewing a loaf. <br><br>  Molinos girls: <br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs608.snc3/31992_1486770808604_1213936305_31384062_7843596_n.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Thank you for the photos of girls kulhazker - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php%3Faid%3D2066931%26id%3D1213936305%26page%3D5">www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2066931&amp;id=1213936305&amp;page=5</a> I only have from a mobile phone.

      I visited the following sections: <br><ul><li>  A1.  Advertising market: media and contextual advertising - trends and efficiency </li><li>  AT 2.  The site is a business that makes a profit. </li><li>  IN 3.  Web Studio Management </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the first section there is a double sensation - a comrade from Infoks-Interactive was so energetic that I almost fell asleep, but I was encouraged by the performance of Svetlana Pavlova from Molinos.  It was interesting to listen to Igor Bukhanov from Subscribe - statistics on the development of e-mail newsletters became a small discovery for me - they are alive and will live! <br><br>  In the second section it was interesting to listen to Oksana Bogomaz from NetCat.  The report was dynamic and in some kind of native format.  We need to pay more attention to this CMS with a rich history. <br><br>  The section on web studio management is a section for our youngest viewers :-) The information was given to the most elementary level, but I liked the format of presenting information from Bunin (Ontiko), Tkachenko (Lenvendo Soft) and Saminsky (Business Council).  By the end, the brain of people was liquefied;  I think it was informative for young or not yet created studios - it was shown on simple numbers as changing a couple of parameters (employee salary, number of employees, number of projects, etc.) may unexpectedly change the final profit. <br><br>  In general, the last section seemed to me the most monolithic and conceptual.  The information was, as I have already said, a rather unaware level of importance (how to cut costs, using a ready-made CMS for a beginner studio is more profitable than developing your own), but the speakers lit the hall, hooked everyone. <br><br>  Of course, nobody discovered America today, but it was interesting.  As always, it‚Äôs a pity that it‚Äôs impossible to go to several sections at once.  I personally would like to visit the promotion section.  What secrets did Ashmanov &amp; Partners reveal?  I will wait for the video. <br><br>  I also want to say about Megaplan.  In the last section I visited, their director spoke.  The romantic-naive mood of Mikhail‚Äôs report encouraged the audience and I also liked it, but we had doubts about purchasing this product for our company after I asked him a couple of questions in one break before, and at the end of a short conversation we had a dialogue: <br><br>  - We think you buy the maximum version.  How much will it cost? <br>  - It will be expensive and why? <br>  - To install on your server.  Privacy :-) <br><br>  In response, I was told something about the fact that if they wanted to get access to your information, they would have left the backdoors, and then his phone rang and the conversation was over.  Well, do not want to sell ... <br><br>  Nevertheless, thanks to all the speakers and organizers! <br><br>  Tomorrow we are going to the SPIK - I think it will be no worse, and even more interesting - good weather, Olgino and decent speakers.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94034/</a></p>
