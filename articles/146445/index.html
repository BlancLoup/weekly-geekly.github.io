The main feature of the smartphone has become a camera with a matrix of 41 megapixels in size: this is more than that of any soap dish, digital SLR cameras and even of medium format.  Some users, who have just learned the formula ‚Äúmegapixels without optics are nothing,‚Äù were at a loss.  However, the uniqueness of the PureView technology is not in the number of megapixels, but in the way they are used. <br><br>  Today we will analyze all the innovations in the Nokia 808 PureView and tell you about all the advantages of this revolutionary camera phone. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  The device is made in a classic case, but it looks very interesting;  in white, it generally resembles an EVA robot from the cartoon WALL ‚Ä¢ And - all because of the protruding camera on the back of the case.  The reason for this was a huge matrix, thanks to which the smartphone makes such high-quality photos.  The dimensions of the Nokia 808 PureView are 123.9 √ó 60.2 √ó 13.9 mm with an extension of up to 17.95 mm in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera, and the weight is 169 grams.  Having tested the dimensions of the device in the pockets of a number of pants, we can safely say that the smartphone is hiding everywhere, and, to the delight of the hipsters, even in skinny jeans.  In general, in life the phone looks thinner than in the photos, but the white model seems to be larger than black.

Moreover, the body material is strong and with a bang weathered a couple of random drops.  For three weeks of testing it did not appear any noticeable scratches.  The build quality also does not cause complaints: neither the back cover, nor the keys, made of stainless steel, do not play.  Smartphones will be available in white and black cases. <br><br>  A micro-HDMI connector, a micro-USB connector for connecting to a PC and charging a battery, a 3.5 mm audio-visual connector for a headset and video output, as well as a barely noticeable microphone for noise canceling during a phone call or video recording are located on top of the case.  On the right are the volume keys, which control in the photo zoom mode, the lock key of the smartphone (which, when pressed for a long time, turns on the flashlight) and the camera key, activating the shooting of photos or videos.  At the bottom of the device is the main microphone, a powerful and high-quality loudspeaker, a hole for the strap for the hand.  Directly below the screen are the standard for Symbian mechanical call keys, menus and call disconnection, and above the screen is a speaker and front camera for video calls. <br><br>  At the back of the smartphone is a 41-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics and an LED flash.  Under the back cover are hidden battery and slots for micro-SIM and microSD cards.  Getting under the hood of the phone is quite simple, while the back panel is adjacent to the body very tightly and does not accidentally open.  By the way, if you turn the back panel itself, you can see a large NFC frame on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bf/28d/413/3bf28d413b39349eb8015fd7ce40fa65.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The Nokia 808 PureView uses a 4-inch AMOLED display with a standard Symbian resolution of 640 √ó 360 pixels.  Despite not the highest resolution, it is quite comfortable to work with such a screen - thanks to the use of ClearBlack technology, thanks to which the screen is not afraid of bright sunlight and has large viewing angles and excellent brightness and color rendition.  To protect the screen from scratches and chips in case of accidental fall, the time-tested protective glass of Gorilla Glass is applied. <br><br><h4>  Cameras </h4><br>  So we got to the most important thing!  For the first time in a smartphone, a camera with a matrix of 41 megapixels is used.  However, behind such a large matrix lies not the trick of the company's marketing specialists, but the Nokia PureView Pro technology, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich has been hatched by Nokia and Carl Zeiss engineers for about five years.  The essence of this technology lies in the fact that having a 38 megapixel image at the input (this is the active number of pixels when shooting 4: 3 frames), the Nokia 808 PureView programmatically combines several neighboring pixels into one ‚Äúsuperpixel‚Äù, producing at the output a frame from 2 Mp to 8 Mp.  The resulting image has the best color, sharpness and, importantly, has virtually no noise (up to ISO 800). <br><br>  The aperture value when shooting is f / 2.4, so that the frames are obtained with a bokeh characteristic of SLR cameras.  Moreover, such a diaphragm, coupled with a sensor whose size is 1 / 1.2 inches (2.5 times larger than the Nokia N8, and almost the same as in Nikon 1 Series mirrorless cameras), allows you to shoot in low light, and Taking into account the focal length of 8 mm, with this crop factor, the equivalent focal length is 26 mm for 16: 9 images and 28 mm for 4: 3 images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/561/f60/a72/561f60a7291398cf6ca80c4fdb76ae1b.jpg"><br><br>  The Nokia 808 PureView has significantly improved the camera interface, so now it is very different from the interface of the previous top-end camera phone from Nokia N8.  Three shooting modes are available in the camera menu: ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù, ‚Äúshooting modes‚Äù (preset modes) and ‚Äúartistic‚Äù (custom settings for all parameters). <br><br>  In the automatic mode, the smartphone takes 5-megapixel images using the PureView Pro technology, the user remains the flash control and the ability to zoom the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37e/043/6e9/37e0436e93071754bb2a2790988439eb.jpg"><br><br>  In the "shooting modes" the user can select the preset modes available in most cameras: landscape, automatic, close-up, portrait, sports, night mode, night portrait, spotlight, snow. <br><br>  In the "artistic" mode, all camera settings are on the user, and for quick access to frequently used settings, you can save three of their options.  The settings include the following parameters: full resolution or PureView, aspect ratio (4: 3 or 16: 9), resolution in PureView mode (8, 5, 3 and 2 Mp), JPEG quality (regular and highest quality), saturation, contrast and sharpness.  In addition, you can set up bracketing for the subsequent creation of HDR-photos, take frame-by-frame shooting (from two to 1500 frames with an interval of 5 seconds to 30 minutes) to create a time-lapse video, as well as set the timer for 2, 10 and 30 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba3/9a1/d19/ba39a1d19000b003ebadadef9bf7f1e6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sup>Kremlin on a not so sunny day</sup> <br><br>  The focus point is selected by pressing your finger on the desired place on the viewfinder.  If you hold the screen for a second, you can select the focus mode: endless, hyperfocal, close-up, automatic.  In addition, exposure compensation, white balance, ISO (50 to 1600) and shutter speed settings are available, you can turn on the viewfinder grid and histogram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb9/e7c/86b/cb9e7c86b4956e16981b835824fdaf5a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sup>Starbucks Vanilla Bear</sup> <br><br>  Do not forget that the Nokia 808 PureView allows you to shoot at least excellent HD-video.  There is all the same package of settings.  For shooting video, the same three modes are also available.  In automatic mode, the smartphone records video in 1080p format and the only thing that can be controlled is to enable / disable continuous autofocus and flash backlight.  In the "shooting modes" there are five preset settings: low light, automatic, sports, searchlight and snow, plus the options available for automatic mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20a/340/c1f/20a340c1f2a2f293ce7a932439efe3b9.jpg"><br><br>  In art mode, you can adjust the video resolution (1080p, 720p, 360p), frame rate (30/25/24/15 frames per second), saturation, contrast, sharpness, exposure compensation, white balance.  At a resolution of 1080p, you can use 4x zoom without loss of quality, at 720p - 6x, and at 360p - 12x.  When recording video, digital stabilization is available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b5/eca/b6f/3b5ecab6f7dc9b8fffb363ff761d4832.jpg"><br>  <sup>50 rubles close up.</sup>  <sup>TsBR50TSBR50TSBR50 ...</sup> <br><br>  The sound when recording is as clear as the video.  Unlike most other smartphones that record sound at a volume of up to 110 dB, the Nokia 808 PureView can record sound without distortion at a sound pressure level of 140 dB - this is the maximum volume at rock concerts. <br><br>  In the original size, these and other photos can be found in the <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/nokia-official/album/188454/%3Fp%3D0">Nokia 808 PureView</a> album in Ya. Photos. <br><br><h4>  Communication </h4><br>  The Nokia 808 PureView smartphone is equipped with Wi-Fi (802.11b / g / n) and Bluetooth 3.0 modules.  The device can act as a DLNA server, so fast WiFi will be extremely useful for streaming media files.  As a backup option for those who do not have a DLNA-receiver or a fast router, the picture can be transferred via micro-HDMI.  Taking into account the fact that a minute of video footage in 1080p format weighs 150 MB, the presence of HDMI is justified a little more than completely. <br><br>  To navigate in the device, a GPS module is installed using A-GPS technology, reducing the time spent finding the current location.  The GPS receiver is used not only for free full-fledged automotive offline navigation of Nokia Maps, but also for geotagging photos. <br><br>  The Nokia 808 PureView has an NFC module for communicating with a range of Nokia accessories and other devices.  In addition, Nokia 808 PureView has been certified for compatibility with the contactless payment system MasterCard PayPass, so that the smartphone can be used not only as a camera, but also as a wallet. <br><br>  Also in the smartphone there is an FM radio with a transmitter for broadcasting your own music at a certain frequency of the FM band, which will first of all be useful to motorists. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The smartphone runs on a single-core processor with a frequency of 1300 MHz and is equipped with 512 MB of RAM.  This is enough for fast operation of both the Nokia Belle Feature Pack 1 system and the camera processing a huge array of graphic data. <br><br>  The device uses a BP-4D 1400 mAh battery, its capacity is enough for 11 hours of talk in 2G networks and 6.5 hours in 3G networks, and the maximum standby time is 465 hours.  In practice, the phone after a week of inactivity still showed a full charge.  With partial use of navigation, frequent use of the camera (it‚Äôs interesting to play around) and periodic calls and Internet surfing, the phone keeps on one charge for more than two days. <br><br>  The internal memory of the device is 16 GB, but it expands to 48 GB using a 32 GB microSD memory card. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The phone comes with a Nokia AC-50 USB charger, a Nokia CA-190CD USB charging and data transfer cable, a simple Nokia WH-209 stereo headset, an NFC info card, a black strap and a user manual. <br><br>  If interested, you can watch a small video about creating the Nokia 808 PureView.  By the way, this video was recorded on the Nokia 808 PureView;) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9eRGkZkdi8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6jOJl-I5f9PZ3qh7lpr74kk_NcA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Nokia 808 PureView is already on sale.</b>  <b>The price of the device from the official partners starts from 25 thousand rubles.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146445/</a></p>
