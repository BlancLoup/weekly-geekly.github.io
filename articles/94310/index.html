The growth of online video publishing is accelerating faster than ever, and although video SEO seems to be left behind the entire industry, it is finally starting to catch up, thanks to some interesting technologies that we hope will give additional incentives to publishers who create great video content. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the new year has begun and we are entering a new decade, let‚Äôs look at the state of SEO video right now. <br><br><h4>  Online video distribution </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73f/92e/06d/73f92e06d23dfd0e8febb8d0dc88c4a4.jpg" alt="Scheme - online video volumes"><br>  If you are creating a video today, there is no shortage of places where it can be placed.  Although <a title="Open YouTube in new window" href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> remains the dominant player in the industry, <a title="Open Vimeo in a new window" href="http://www.vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> , <a title="Open Blip.tv in a new window." href="http://www.blip.tv/">Blip.tv</a> , <a title="Open Viddler in a new window" href="http://www.viddler.com/">Viddler</a> , <a title="Open Metacafe in a new window." href="http://www.metacafe.com/">Metacafe</a> , and many other sites (most of them are free) split up the market.  Thanks to these services, you do not need to create or use your own video player, as well as the entire burden falls on their servers, and not on your own.

      Just as there is great competition in the arena of video services, the competition between the videos themselves is growing with terrible force.  YouTube spokesman Aaron Zamos said: ‚ÄúMore than 20 hours of video are uploaded to the site every minute, and about 1,200 years of video is uploaded annually.‚Äù <br><br>  Hundreds of techniques and tricks exist to optimize web pages for search engines, but the field of video SEO consists of only a few recommendations and a large number of dances with a tambourine. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMake clear descriptions and headings, create as many matching tags as you can.  For example, if you created a video that shows how to tie a bow tie, your name should be: "How to tie a bow tie."  This is very important because this is what the target viewer probably wanted to learn.  Think of images - a tie, a suit, how to dress stylishly, how to tie a tie, how to tie a bow tie, etc. <br><br>  It is also important to note that many users who are looking for videos just want to have fun, and may not be looking for anything specific.  So if you have created unique content, think about how the user is most likely to be able to find it.  General tags like ‚Äúcool video‚Äù can be very effective. ‚Äù <br><br>  Many publishers, however, are concerned about getting links and traffic to their website, and not just to their YouTube page.  Rand Fishkin, director and co-founder of <a title="Open agency website in a new window" href="http://www.seomoz.org/">SEOmoz</a> , a multi-million SEO agency, emphasizes the importance of posting videos on your own website and providing a video site ( <a title="Learn more about video sitemap" href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/topic.py%3Fhl%3Den%26topic%3D10079">video sitemap</a> ) of the site to search engines. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVideo search results are often much easier to rank than standard search results, but there are some‚Äú potholes ‚Äùthat will have to go around,‚Äù Fishkin said in his letter. <br><br>  However, the fact that users ‚Äúshare‚Äù their video discoveries in the form that they place on their blogs and websites using embedded (EMBEDDED) code often leads to the fact that the ‚Äújuice‚Äù of the links takes sides (the same YouTube or Metacafe), where the video really lies.  A vital part of SEO strategy is that other sites link to your site.  If people link to your content on YouTube, your site will benefit a little (if it gets something at all), neither ‚Äúreference value‚Äù, nor a high search engine location shines on you, and this can be an obstacle for web publishers. <br><br><h4>  New Developments </h4><br>  Due to the fact that search engine robots understand only the text itself, they cannot assess the quality of the video, the content inside ngo is only links to it and content around it, such as title or tags.  People have long struggled with this problem, and lately there have been some realistic solutions. <br><br>  First, YouTube now has the ability to sign <a title="Open in a new window an article on YouTube captions" href="http://mashable.com/2010/01/16/youtube-captions-how-to/">captions</a> on video.  Accompanying captions on top of the video can be tied to a specific frame, and users can now search for a specific part of the video by text request. <br>  These captions can be indexed by search engines, which means that the content of the video itself can now be taken into account when ranking.  Although it was originally necessary to create your own signatures, YouTube can now make signatures <a title="Open in a new window an article on the automatic creation of signatures on YouTube" href="http://mashable.com/2009/11/19/youtube-automatic-captions/">automatically</a> !  (approx. lane. Here we are talking about automatic translation of speech into text) But as with any automatic translation, human intervention may be required to eliminate the errors of the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù in the text. <br><br>  Creating a description for a video was a common SEO practice in the past, but linking descriptions to a video's timeline has definitely become a significant improvement.  Another company recently stumbled upon a similar video SEO solution, this is New York-based " <a title="Open SpeakerText website in a new window." href="http://speakertext.com/">SpeakerText</a> ."  SpeakerText allows you to create the same video signatures as YouTube signatures, but then transfers SEO power to publishers as part of a concept they call ‚ÄúQuoteLinks.‚Äù <br><br>  Simply speaking, after your video is ‚Äúfrom SpeakerTextino,‚Äù you can embed it in your website with the enclosed transcript.  Visitors can choose a piece of transcript, copy it and paste it into their own blog or website as a link at the time in the video in which this caption appears.  Link leads to your site, not on YouTube.  SpeakerText currently works only with YouTube, but the company claims that it plans to provide services for other platforms in the future. <br><br>  ‚ÄúEvery time someone quotes a transcript, it refers back to the original source, which is good for the end user, because he can see it in context,‚Äù says CEO Matt Mireles, ‚Äú... and the publisher of the video will also be rewarded, because he not only distributes viral traffic directly, but also user links create a huge SEO effect for him. " <br><br>  SpeakerText is free if you create the transcript yourself, as well as, you can purchase a decryption service directly on the site and it will cost you half the normal cost of such services.  SpeakerText uses the Uzbeks army from <a title="Open in a new window the site of the project Mechanical Turk" href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Mechanical Turk</a> to decrypt. <br><br><h4>  Future </h4><br>  So, what is waiting for video SEO next? <br><br>  Fishkin believes that new platforms such as the <a title="Go to articles on the iPad" href="http://mashable.com/tag/ipad/">iPad</a> and the <a title="Go to the articles on the Android system" href="http://mashable.com/tag/android/">Android</a> Marketplace are of great importance for the future.  ‚ÄúI think that leaving video from the open Internet, to closed services (an interesting shift, by the way) can lead to significant consequences in the future,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Zamos says that ‚Äúsocial elements are playing an increasingly important role in the development of new features on YouTube, especially in the field of search.‚Äù Taking into account social trends in search algorithms can cause big changes in the entire SEO industry. <br><br>  No matter what happens next - it is clear that video SEO finally begins to catch up with the rest of SEO.  For services such as SpeakerText and captions on YouTube, designed to eliminate the problem of not being able to search within video content, it can be assumed that automated and more accurate text-based video markup systems will probably appear in the future and perhaps ultimately the ability to edit video directly online. <br><br>  What changes do you expect?
