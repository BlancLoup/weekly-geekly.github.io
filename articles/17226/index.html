Phone call: - Hello, is it an apartment?  ‚ÄúYes, flat,‚Äù I am amazed.  - This agency (calls a well-known company).  We conduct a survey on the preferences of cars.  Do you have 10 minutes?  ‚ÄúTry to meet the 5,‚Äù I reply, forcing myself not to hang up.  - I need to talk to someone who drives your car most often.  - It's me, you already talk to me, - I understand that the script of the conversation with the respondents is not debugged.  - Are you going to change the car in the near future?  - Yes.  - when?  - Within a year, or two.  - So ... (pause) 13-18 months?  - Maybe.  - What car are you considering?  I need three titles.  - Honda Element, Toyota RAV4 and Mitsubishi Pinin, - I speak quickly, without hesitation.  - Wait.  I'm recording ... (pause) My program is slow.  Did you say Toyota?  - Yes.  Toyota RAV4.  - Not.  I now only need stamps.  Toyota, Mitsubishi ... And who was the third?  - Honda.  - (pause) And what models?  - Honda Element, Toyota RAV4 and Mitsubishi Pinin, - I lay down on the sofa, with patience, I understand that the conversation will be long.  - I just have a program that slows down ... Element, (pause) RAV4 ... (pause) For a second ... (pause).  Mitsubishi?  Not Pajero?  ‚ÄúPinin is a small Pajero,‚Äù comes the thought of starting to ask what program she uses.  - Yes!  I see her in the list.  Thank!  I have no more questions - short beeps are heard. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;anchor&gt; habracut &lt;/ anchor&gt; &lt;p align = "center"&gt; * * * &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Call- The center plays a key role in the contacts between customers and companies.  Not only the company's image, but also the effectiveness of its business depends on the quality of the call-center.  Regardless of whether the call center specializes in servicing incoming or outgoing campaigns, the quality of the information systems used by its operators depends on their speed and customer experience (customer satisfaction on the company's work). &lt;/ I&gt; &lt; / p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt; Usability, as the degree of convenience and efficiency of information systems, is critical, both at the level of specific user interfaces, the workplace of the operator, and at the macro-ergonomic level - the effectiveness of information processes of the computer.  NII.  To ensure a proper level of usability when designing the architecture of the information system with which the operator works, it is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of his work, key requirements for his activities. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p align = "center"&gt; * * * &lt;/ p &gt; &lt;p&gt; Call centers in modern business become the point of contact (interface) of an organization with its customers.  Often the call center employee is the only representative of the company with whom the client communicates ‚Äúlive‚Äù.  Therefore, the alternative name - contact center, more accurately expresses the function of a call-center in modern business.  Providing business interaction with the customer, the contact center plays a key role in customer relationship management (Customer Relationship Management). &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;h3&gt; Usability of incoming campaigns &lt;/ h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most contact centers are working on incoming campaigns: operator receives calls from customers who often come up with a problem or question.  The main dissatisfaction of customers with this is caused by incompetent responses of operators, or their inability to help the client in solving their problems.  Often, the client receives general answers to very specific questions. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; This happens because the contact center employee is not informed in the details of the business of the company in which he works, for example, on new marketing promotions, or on changing prices or work order.  A large company effort is spent on operator training, but training is always not effective enough because: &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 1.  Modern business is innovative in nature.  Curricula are quickly becoming obsolete, unable to adapt to change. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; 2.  One of the unresolved problems of contact centers is staff turnover.  Each contact center becomes an operator training center. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3b3/1fb/5c0/3b31fb5c0525dbcd666fa1dcd1fc219f.gif" width = 348 height = 342 border = 0 alt = "" hspace = 10 vspace = 10 align = right&gt; &lt;p&gt; The way out of this situation is to develop a knowledge base with effective search and navigation interfaces that would be accessible to operators and updated as employees of the company, responsible for innovation, as well as by the operators themselves. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most organizations provide operators with various information systems.  For example, telecommunications companies provide operators with access to billing information, as most customers call with questions related to finance (payments, bills, etc.).  But often the operator does not have an integrated information system that would allow to answer all the questions arising from the client. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; To improve the quality of the company's interaction with customers, it is necessary to build a system that is not just convenient for the operator, but requires incorporation into the company's processes .  Experts of the company and those who are responsible for innovation should support the relevance of the company's knowledge base, which contact center operators work with. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, the task to fill the base with knowledge ‚Äúfor all occasions‚Äù seems to be unrealizable.  Much of what will be created may never be unclaimed.  Therefore, the knowledge needed by the operator should be more based on the queries that customers form. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Imagine this situation: the client called the contact center with a question that the operator cannot answer.  For example, a call to an ISP contact center: ‚ÄúI bought a wireless access point that supports the standard &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet"&gt; Power over Ethernet &lt; / a&gt; (PoE).  Do your switches support this standard?  Is extra voltage available for such access points via cables? ‚ÄùSuch a question for an operator from among difficult ones.  The worst thing he can do is answer something that is not specific enough, for example, ‚ÄúWe have standard equipment,‚Äù because  this answer will not satisfy the client, and it may be prompted to contact another Internet provider. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is clear that in this case the client can wait for the answer and the operator can take the time by writing the client‚Äôs question to the knowledge base, and asking the client to call back, or tell us your email, to which the expert‚Äôs response will be sent. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such questions are answered unanswered by experts, for example, technicians, and after they have answered it, in the outgoing queue Calls add a task to dial to the client.  The operator (albeit different, since the change of the first, most likely, has ended) reads to the client the answer he received.  Or, if the organization does not have the technical ability to work with outgoing campaigns, the answer can be sent to the client's email. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; If the seemingly difficult complexity of such a system is, it justifies itself with its self-learning nature.  After all, the next time, answering the same question, you no longer have to go all the way the question went through for the first time.  Even another operator who was not involved in the case of a client who asked a difficult question will be able to find the answer in the knowledge base. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; And this time, the key will be the speed of information search in the database and ease of navigation through its catalogs. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The information system should not only be enriched in the process of working with knowledge, but should also preserve the history of interaction with the client.  This is only possible if the client is easily identified.  For example, in the case of a call center of a cellular operator, identification is carried out by the customer‚Äôs phone number, or by his account number, in the case of a bank call center. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although there are extreme cases, call centers that work with a very large audience, for example, a call center rescue service.  Usually people call such call-centers in extreme cases.  In such call-centers, caller identification is not an effective tool to enhance customer experience.  In other cases, the operator‚Äôs knowledge of the context ‚Äî what problems this client had before, and how they were solved, increases the efficiency of the operator‚Äôs work. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; By processing a large number of unrelated calls, the operator cannot remember all callers , besides, the operator in the shift is not one, and the call from the re-calling client with a high probability gets to another operator.  As a result, there is often no continuity between repeated calls.  The second operator does not know what the client was talking about with the first operator.  To solve this problem, it is necessary to integrate the call-center software with the CRM system, so that from the first seconds of answering an incoming call you can identify the caller and get access to the history of his previous calls.  &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A client who notices that no matter which operator he communicated with, other operators understand the context of the problem, a good impression is created that he is dealing with an integrated and organized system, and not with scattered people, performing isolated routine work.  Thereby, one of the main problems of call-centers is overcome - people's dislike for communicating with call-centers due to particular cases of ‚Äúincompetence‚Äù of operators, their inability to help in solving the client‚Äôs problem. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Moreover, the operator is Conversation may require different information, the information system with which it works should not be overloaded, as a critical indicator of its work is the response time to requests. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is important as at the organization level - saved seconds multiplied by number o  call calls give the company additional resources;  and at the client level - sometimes a person‚Äôs life depends on the speed of the call center operator‚Äôs work, and sometimes it is a matter of time and money the client spends on communication. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; Usability of outgoing campaigns &lt;/ h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Outgoing Campaigns (calling customers) in the practice of call-centers are less common.  Such campaigns are used, for example, in tele-marketing (mass sales by telephone), in conducting opinion polls, and not only.  Insurance companies offering new insurance services to existing customers use call-centers as a tool to bring a new service to the market.  In the work of the call-center, which provides translation services, communicating between clients speaking different languages, there are also outgoing campaigns: one client orders a conversation with another, indicating the time at which the conversation should be established.  As an example, call-centers of banks calling customers who have taken out a loan are reminded to pay off their debts. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Outgoing campaigns have their own specifics - the operator communicates according to a previously prepared scenario, instructions, asking questions, or telling something or to the client. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/38a/f81/8ee/38af818eedd65bf3422fbaa59b2c56c5.gif" width = 333 height = 342 border = 0 alt = "" hspace = 10 vspace = 10 align = right&gt; &lt;p&gt; This specificity is related to problems of another kind.  Customers feel that the operator does not speak naturally, but with some stress, pronounces the learned text, fearing to confuse words. &lt;a title="" style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"&gt; [1] &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This affects customer experience.  Due to the tension of the operator, the client often misunderstands the information that is communicated to him, and refuses the offered service only because he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to him in such a strange tone. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Stress the operator talks to can be removed by freeing his memory.  Instead of remembering what needs to be said, the operator should read the text of the prompt from the computer screen. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; This text can and should be organized in the form of customized dialogues (scripts) that will allow the conversation to be adapted to the answers that gives the client. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The structure of the screen on which each step of the script is displayed consists of the text that the operator must read out loud, and the form in which he must enter the client's answer.  Instead of the form, options (choice) are used more often to go to the next step depending on the client‚Äôs response. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; For example, the first screen will be the greeting text, ending with the question whether it‚Äôs convenient for the client to speak now.  Depending on the answer, the operator will go on the script further, or go to a screen where you can record the time at which you need to call the customer back and end the conversation. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; It would seem that you can simply provide the operator with a screen with a large form, which he must fill in during the conversation, for example, if a contract for the provision of services is made by phone. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; However, any screen form is universal (redundancy) and does not have the necessary flexibility, and the operator will have to make a decision like  e fields are filled in, and which ones are left blank. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The time that the operator spends on making a decision is critical for the work of the call-center.  Choosing everything else creates a burden on the operator, which leads to his fatigue, which, in turn, is fraught with errors caused by a decrease in the level of attention. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Therefore, the conversation script with the client should be presented as a dialogue. &lt;/ P &gt; &lt;p&gt; The transitions between the steps of the script must be so fast that the client does not notice them.  For this, the operator‚Äôs workplace should not call the server side for the content of the next step.  The client-server architecture in the described case may harm the business if the system‚Äôs response time to the operator‚Äôs action exceeds 2 seconds. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is highly desirable that all scenario information (with all its possible alternatives) be downloaded to the workplace the operator before the conversation with the client. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Saving the data to the information system server should be performed either after the conversation ends, or it should be done in asynchronous mode, so that the operator does not have to wait while the conversation ends  no intermediate data. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Non-optimal screen forms that the operator needs to fill out during a call can disrupt live communication and irritate the customer who has to wait while the operator works with the inconvenient form. &lt;/ p &gt; &lt;p&gt; To avoid such problems, it is necessary to design conversation scripts so that they can flexibly adapt to the specifics of a particular conversation on the move.  Those.  instead of working with forms, use dialogs (a sequence of questions or fields, which can be changed by a simple operator command).  This helps to prevent another frequent cause of customer dissatisfaction - they feel that they are not being spoken to in a human way, but according to a scenario. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dialogues reduce the time to search for the required fields, but if the technical implementation fails (if the response time systems on the operator's actions will be unacceptably large) may cause another problem - loss of speech dynamics - the operator will have to wait some time before moving on to another part of the script. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At the same time, it is necessary to solve such an important question as convenience edited  s scripts themselves.  As repeatedly noted above, a business is modified very quickly, and its efficiency depends on the adaptability of information systems. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Inconvenient interfaces for modifying outgoing program scripts can negate all efforts to optimize the call center, since However, changing business requirements, the entire work of the call center can stand up, or roll back to less efficient, but more flexible management methods ‚Äî scripts printed on paper or memorized. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;h3&gt; Conclusion &lt;/ h3&gt; &lt;p &gt; Working with awkward items  ogrammami, forcing operators to remember stare, not think about the conversation with the client, and about what button to press, operators get tired quickly, spending their strength effectively.  Such fatigue, unsupported by achievements that bring joy to a person - ‚Äúwas tormented with the program all day‚Äù, is destructive, accelerates the professional burnout to which service personnel are prone, and dramatically increases staff turnover. &lt;/ P&gt; &lt;p&gt; Usability as an approach to design human-computer interaction allows you to build user interfaces so as not to waste human resources in vain.  User-centered design leaves the user with more power that only a person can - on the lively involved attitude and friendly communication, intuition, understanding of the client's words, emotional participation, etc. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Optimum distribution of functions between man and computer, business is achieving the most complete realization of the capabilities of both parties, becoming more efficient and gaining additional potential for development. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;br clear="all"&gt; &lt;hr size = "1" width = "33%"&gt; &lt; p&gt; &lt;a title="" style="" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"&gt; [1] &lt;/a&gt; Another problem worth mentioning  A reminder is that if it is inconvenient to speak to the client, and he asks the operator to call back later, then often due to the features of the call-center software, no one calls back, or calls at the wrong time that the client suggested. &lt;/ p&gt; &lt;habracut &gt; </video></div>
