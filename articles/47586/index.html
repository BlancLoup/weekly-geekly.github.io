  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VoIP. Calls more convenient and cheaper?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is difficult to imagine the life of a modern person without telephone calls - communication with family and friends, business contacts, and getting information.  Most people traditionally use the offers of mobile and landline operators.  However, the cost of their services often makes it necessary to limit the number and volume of contacts.  An alternative to these types of communication is IP-telephony - a technology for transmitting a voice signal over a packet-switched Internet (VoIP, Voice over Internet Protocol). <br><img src="http://www.moroko.ru/habrinfo/pda.png" alt="pda"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Its main advantage is in low prices for long-distance and international calls.  For example, a minute of conversation when calling from Russia to Turkey using a landline or mobile phone will cost an average of 9-15 rubles, while VoIP operators will provide a similar service for only 2-3 rubles.  Savings are especially noticeable when making calls while traveling, since the cost of a minute of connection in roaming reaches 70-100 rubles.  In addition, it is possible to call for free. <br><br>  Despite the obvious advantages, IP telephony for many continues to be incomprehensible and difficult to use.  To solve this problem, we have developed and implemented a simple and convenient service - the <a href="http://moroko.ru/mobile/">Mobile</a> package of services.  The service allows you to use all the features and benefits of VoIP communication using any mobile devices, without requiring a computer and / or wi-fi network.

      The cell phone is the most frequently used mobile device, and therefore, it was decided to start work on the service with the development of a java application. <br><img src="http://www.moroko.ru/habrinfo/java.png" alt="java"><br><br>  The main difficulty was its compatibility with all models of mobile phones.  To insure against possible refusal to interact with the device, two versions of the java-program were written simultaneously.  The first uses built-in graphical controls, it allows it to function normally.  The process of creating this version did not contain any special difficulties.  But the second version required the design and implementation of its GUI model and a small library of controls (buttons, input fields, pop-up menus and tables), because to create a more convenient and understandable interface we could not find suitable ready-made, open and easy libraries of graphic elements. <br><br>  As a base for writing programs, the server callback function was selected - callback.  To make a call, it is enough to inform the VoIP-account service and two telephone numbers.  The system calls back to the specified numbers and connects them via IP-telephony channels.  At the same time, for each number, the call is incoming and paid only at the tariffs of the VoIP operator.  In addition, java-applications for mobile phones contain a complete set of management of the main functions of a VoIP account ‚Äî call order, balance check, sending sms, and also provide access to the phone book and call history.  All data from the phones are transferred via GPRS. <br><br>  The next step in the development of the service was the introduction of applications for PDAs. <br><img src="http://www.moroko.ru/habrinfo/pda.png" alt="pda"><br><br>  Guided by a limited time resource, the .NET CF 2 platform was chosen for application development, since the framework for it is bundled with WM 6, and you can easily install it for earlier versions. <br><br>  We could not ignore the popular iPhone in Russia. <br><img src="http://www.moroko.ru/habrinfo/iphone.png" alt="iphone"><br><br>  Development of the application for it began at a time when most people were still using the first firmware version, and the share of iPhones with its second version was constantly increasing.  For this reason, we were forced to write a program for both frameworks. <br><br>  After creating a single request processing center, unifying application teams and upgrading the interface for working with providers, we managed to implement new tools: sms order, wap site, ICQ bot, jabber bot, e-mail service, call order from another site and command line. <br><br>  To simplify the process of using the service, <a href="http://moroko.ru/mobiletest/">a ‚Äúone-button‚Äù system</a> was developed.  When accessing the service through the site, the new user needs to specify only his mail.  In response, the service sends an e-mail containing the data of the created VoIP account and an activation code, which should be indicated in any Mobile application.  The activation code replaces the manual entry of settings.  This allows you to test the service, even without having funds in the account.  A registered user who already uses one of the presented operators only needs to enter their account details. <br><br>  Thanks to the development and implementation of the Mobile service package, making calls at a relatively <a href="http://www.moroko.ru/tarifpay/">low price</a> has become not only available, but also convenient. <br><br>  Project Manager, <br>  Laginev Dmitry </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47586/</a></p>
