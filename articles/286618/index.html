In fact, negative words trigger the production of substances that cause stress in our brain.

      But worse, like a horror film, in which a babysitter looking after a child understands that the killer has already made his way into the house, we ourselves utter some of the most destructive words for us. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSelf-esteem is a verbal internal dialogue occurring in our brain,‚Äù says Mark Robert Waldman, co-author of the book <a href="http://www.markrobertwaldman.com/">‚ÄúWords Can Change Your Brain</a> . <a href="http://www.markrobertwaldman.com/">‚Äù</a> <br><br>  As an expert in communication, spirituality and brain activity, Waldman says that he and other researchers have discovered that few people realize what they say.  ‚ÄúInternal dialogue is constantly taking place in the frontal lobe of the brain,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúThe left brain is optimistic and focused on problem solving and decision making.  And the right hemisphere is a pessimistic part of the brain, it constantly generates anxiety, fears and doubts. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Do not worry</font> </h2><br>  The good news, according to Waldman, is that you can learn to switch to the left hemisphere of the brain using a two-step relaxation process and positive exercises. <br><br>  Most of us do not know how to relax, although it is quite simple.  Worldman offers four ways to achieve a state of relaxation, which reduces mental stress. <br><br><ul><li>  Running in place for 60 seconds.  Waldman keeps a treadmill next to his desk and takes breaks for a day during the day to clear his brain. </li><li>  Close your eyes and rotate your head 360 degrees, making one full revolution in one full minute. </li><li>  Yawn 10 times, even if you do not want.  After the first few yawns, your body will begin to yawn for real. </li><li>  Very slowly stroke your hand or fingertip. </li></ul><br>  All these exercises reduce the activity of the part of the brain that generates negative emotions.  "Your attention is shifting from the thoughts and words in your brain towards the sensations that your body is currently experiencing," Waldman says. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Keep calm and radiate positive</font> </h2><br>  After you managed to turn off the pessimistic voices and put yourself in a relaxed state, it's time for a positive attitude.  Waldman argues that you need to listen to your intuition, which is the weak inner voice of the mind, in order to realize its most hidden values.  Write the first word that came to mind.  For example, it may be ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù or ‚Äúpeace.‚Äù  Then, every morning, focus on that word for one minute. <br><br>  While teaching at Loyols University in Los Angeles, Waldman forced his students to do relaxation and positivity exercises for 10 consecutive days.  He claims that it reduced their stress for nine months.  ‚ÄúThe effect was so powerful that we later made it a key module of our executive MBA program,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Maintain positivity by taking breaks throughout the day for relaxation.  Waldman himself, he says, makes three 10-second breaks every hour.  ‚ÄúIt refreshes my concentration, and the work is really better,‚Äù he says.  You can also write your word value on the card and place it so that it serves to you as a constant visual reminder. <br><br>  Exercises for a more optimistic mood of the brain is akin to training the muscles to increase their strength.  ‚ÄúIf you give it a few minutes each morning, we can scan your brain in eight weeks and see that the negative processes in it diminish,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúUse these exercises and feel more confident, and then your quality of life will improve.  And if you remain in this deep state of relaxed attention, people around you will resonate with what you are doing. ‚Äù <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-uspeshnye-lyudi-spravlyayutsya-so-svoimi-toksichnymi-opponentami/">How successful people cope with their toxic opponents</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286618/</a></p>
