      DDoS-attack is very simple / cheap and effective, anyone can take it to a small online store directly from their home, losses can reach hundreds of thousands of rubles from idle time, especially if you actively launch advertising campaigns . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The attacker does not even need to know how and what works on your server, he can simply send parasitic traffic to his IP address and your <a href="https://vps.house/">VDS</a> server will be guaranteed to receive it.  These are the most common cases of attacks, when either SYN-flood is used, which overloads network equipment with SYN-requests in the TCP protocol, or the entire channel of the UDP-flood server is simply blocked. <br><br>  The administrator unprepared for this frantically begins to create rules in the firewall on the server or the network equipment preceding it, but all this is in vain, because the firewall, the router, will always receive all packets and only then will not be allowed to your application, the communication channel itself remains overloaded. <br><br>  The next step, or at the same time, angry calls to the provider with a demand to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù and restore work begin: ‚ÄúI pay you money, and my server is unavailable!‚Äù.  There is a common sense in this, but most often the provider simply stops servicing the attacked client, automatically or manually entering the client‚Äôs IP address into the so-called ‚Äúblackhole‚Äù (there are always such points in the Service Agreements). <br><br>  When attacking you, your provider (data center) suffers no less than you - traffic can be huge, even relatively weak attacks with a strength of 10 Gbit / s significantly impair the work of a network of small data centers and, accordingly, all the clients located there. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is impossible to cope with a DDoS attack on your own or by networkers in the data center.  About 15 years ago, when rarely any attacks reached 1 Gbit / c, you could feel at ease while on the 10 Gbit / c channel.  Now only geo-distributed protections work - when the traffic is filtered not at the point of the final addressee, but on all routes through the communication channels of the main providers.  It is considered almost impossible to score 100% of all communication channels of all providers, and even in a number of countries. <br><br>  Just such a geographically distributed protection service is offered to its customers by the market leader in Russia, <b>DDoS-Guard</b> , clearing traffic on routes in Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan.  This is all great, but many will find their prices inaccessible (from 6,000 rubles per month for a relatively poor performance VDS server with protection). <br><br>  Specializing in the provision of <b><a href="https://vps.house/">virtual servers</a></b> , the cloud provider <b>VPS.house</b> , renting secure communication channels in the company DDoS-Guard, we provide services to protect against DDoS-attacks to its customers.  This collaboration provides significant cost savings for VPS.house hosting end customers.  Thus, the configuration of a VPS server for 6000 rubles.  on DDoS-Guard will cost on VPS.house with a connected DDoS protection service only 2090 rubles.  per month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/xc/tx/m6xctxuymtfzhqowsvwtt9ewl8w.png"><br><br>  Rule number 1 for all whose income is directly related to the activities on the Internet - to include the default protection services.  It is inexpensive and ensures the normal operation of your resources, preventing losses from the actions of most intruders. <br><br>  And if you have a service at your fingertips that allows you to conduct DDoS attacks, you can test the protection of a <a href="https://vps.house/"><b>virtual server on VPS.house</b></a> for free within 3 hours after instant registration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354674/</a></p>
