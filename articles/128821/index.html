We managed to implement 91 updates of our social network.  About all of them you can read <a href="http://www.google.com/support/profiles/bin/static.py%3Fhl%3Den%26page%3Drelease_notes.cs%26rd%3D1">here</a> .  We want to say that this is only the beginning of a new amazing era, an era in which people will be able to communicate on the Internet just as easily as offline.  Every day we bring this dream.  And now one more step - the hundredth.  We want to bring to your attention 9 new Google+ features. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  + Hangouts: more mobile, more unexpected, more interesting </h4><br>  Hangouts is a convenient multi-user video chat.  From the very beginning, the service improved and grew thanks to you, our users.  You have already held culinary lessons, contests, concerts and much more with the help of our technology.  We, in turn, will continue to do everything we can so that you can continue to experiment with video calls, communicate and implement any of your ideas without restraining your creativity.  We are confident that the new features that have appeared this week will not disappoint you. <br><br>  <b>92. Hangouts on your phone screen</b> <br>  In real life, we constantly meet with different people - very often casual acquaintances become our friends, but now you can meet and get acquainted ‚Äúas in life‚Äù in video calls.  Straight from your mobile phone!  Just find an active meeting in the feed and click Join.  It is as simple as sending SMS.

Hangouts live</b> <br>  You've probably already had a Hangout with friends and relatives.  Now you have the opportunity to significantly expand your audience.  Be the host of your own live show! <br><br>  Everything works very simply.  Start a regular video call and click Live.  The show has begun!  As always, up to 9 people can join you.  If you wish, you can also be a spectator on the ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù of other users and record your broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bb0676e8/3462da4c/78f20a1b/5fc7dadc.png"><br>  <i>Anyone can join the live broadcast as a viewer.</i> <br><br>  <b>94, 95, 96, 97. Hangouts Extras</b> <br>  Communication is not limited to conversation.  Having met friends and chatting for about ten minutes, we can go to the cinema, see photos or just sketch out a weekend plan.  And if earlier in Hangouts you could only watch videos on YouTube and chat in the chat, now you can: <br><br>  Give your friends access to your computer screen to show them a presentation, photos, or their own record in the game. <ul><li>  Together draw on the board, making notes, sketches and diagrams. </li><li>  Work on documents, spreadsheets or presentations together </li><li>  Call your hangout so that people who are interested in your broadcast can find it. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1b179a54/074b339f/61cfd81e/03c29a57.png"></div><br>  <i>Extrafunctions have not yet become a full-fledged part of Video Meetings, but we want you to try them right now and share your impressions with us.</i> <br><br>  <b>98. APIs for Hangouts</b> <br>  The first thing that we have seen during the online testing of Hangouts is that there are so many developers among you.  Therefore, in addition to the API for Google+, which appeared last week, we launched a basic set of APIs for Hangouts. <br><br><h4>  + Search: find people and records that interest you </h4><br>  <b>99.</b> Many have asked us why there is no search on Google+.  Today, the long-awaited feature will finally appear on Google+.  So now you can search everything that interests you in this service: people, articles, photos, videos, everything that is on the Internet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b838b0ea/f52a57cd/5fec759f/4d16fe9e.png"></div><br>  <i>More than a billion entries are posted on Google+ every day, and we are eager to find out how the search will help people to thread each other.</i> <br><br><h4>  + All </h4><br>  <b>100.</b> And finally, the most long-awaited news: now for registration on Google+ invitations are no longer necessary!  During the last 12 weeks we worked in a test mode.  Of course, we still have room to grow and develop, but thanks to the work done during this time, we were able to do the main thing - the number 100 bun: open registration.  This means that anyone can now go to <a href="http://plus.google.com/%3Fhl%3Dru">google.com/+</a> and become a member of Google+. <br><br>  Everything is just beginning ... Life is beautiful and amazing! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128821/</a></p>
