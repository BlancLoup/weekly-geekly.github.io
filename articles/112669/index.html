But now I ran into such dirty tricks that it was just a shame for the company. <br><br>  So, the point is that thanks to one of the projects, a certain amount of votes (a little more than 10,000) has accumulated in my account, which is time to cash out.  And what was my surprise that everything turned out to be quite different from what was promised! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have always been guided by the information that is posted on VKontakte in the " <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/developers.php%3Fid%3D8261471">developers</a> " section:

I see "the <b>cost of voting will be about 3 rubles</b> ." <br><br>  OK.  We proceed to the finding.  I install the Robox application, enter all my data, register. <br><br>  What is my surprise when I see it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/61/a9/61a9ab4eb6fdfdc0559808bfe22a3c2a.png"><br><br>  Those.  instead of the promised 3 rubles per vote, in the end we have 2.15 p / voice.  (When withdrawing to webmoney or transfer - the amount does not fundamentally change). <br><br>  I go nuts.  Ask a question in the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/topic-9713780_23891860">official development team</a> . <br><br>  I get the answer: <br><blockquote>  Svyatoslav, that's right - you don't understand something. <br><br>  3 rubles with VAT.  If your company does not have VAT - do not be lazy to make a transaction on the calculator: * 100/118. </blockquote><br>  I'm shocked. <br><br>  Yes, of course, in the original article there is a "asterisk", under which is the link "All indicated prices include VAT.".  But this asterisk is in the paragraph concerning the withdrawal of votes under the contract.  Yes, it says under the asterisk that ‚Äúall prices‚Äù.  But this is somehow really quite attracted to the ears. <br><br>  And nowhere is there any mention of the income tax (???) of 13%. <br><br>  Those.  in fact, it says ‚Äúget about 3 rubles‚Äù.  You click on the ‚Äúget‚Äù link and happily receive 2.15 rubles.  Why from 2 rubles became 2,15 - you should guess. <br><br>  Honestly, after that I don‚Äôt even know how to relate to the ‚Äúcontact‚Äù.  Like and large respected company.  But I did not expect such dirty tricks ... <br><br>  By the way, I will say one more thing - I have a contract with "My World" and "Classmates."  So there everything is fair and transparent.  If the ‚Äúclassmates‚Äù say that I will receive 50 kopecks for one of their payment units (analogous to the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of VK), then this means that I will receive 50 kopecks.  I - SP without VAT and get 50 kopecks.  If I worked with VAT, I would still receive that amount, which after the payment of VAT would be equal to 50 kopecks.  Yes, I would have to pay another 6% income, but this is already my problem. <br><br>  What about the votes - while thinking about their cash out.  One does not want to lose almost 10 thousand on what.  It is also impossible to sell them to another person (except that it is prohibited), because  There is a limit on the transfer of votes between people at 100 g / day.  Accordingly, it is possible to sell votes at such a rate for 3 months :) <br><br>  <s>The only option is to find a person who wants to pay for the Vkontakte advertising campaign, take money from him and pay for it with votes.</s>  <s>But this is somehow a chore and incomprehensible.</s>  It turns out that the RK applications for voices are also disabled. <br><br>  In general, if you are a young developer looking towards Contact as a platform for developing applications and making money, then consider your income not at once at 3 rubles / voice, as contact people want to present, but at 2.15. <br><br><blockquote>  UPD: <b>Attention</b> !  Please do not write me to sell 100 votes.  I absolutely do not want to sell votes for 3 months with a limit of 100g / day </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112669/</a></p>
