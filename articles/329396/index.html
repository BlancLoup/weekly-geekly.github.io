In many ways, this was due to the prevalence of old versions of the company's operating systems.  Google Chrome and other browsers remained behind and ‚Äúkept‚Äù at a decent distance. <br><br>  But the situation has changed completely. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/329396/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/56e/09e/37d/56e09e37d50a4d21a92e28390775d460.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/isaacbowen/5619516786/">isaac bowen</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">cc</a></i>

      According <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/">to</a> Netmarketshare, in July 2015, the share of Internet Explorer was 53.13%, and Chrome - 27.82%.  However, everything changed, and last year Google Chrome approached the mark of 54.99%, while the share of Internet Explorer dropped to 23.13%. <br><br>  A little more than a year, browsers have changed places in the top.  And Google‚Äôs browser didn't stop there - it continued to ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the market.  To date, ( <a href="https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php">data</a> w3counter), the share of Chrome has exceeded 60%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f06/b2c/1db/f06b2c1dbfc848238b7313c24b3d96a5.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i>Source: <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/">StatCounter</a></i> <br><br>  If the trend shown on the chart above persists, IE will lose its entire customer base within 3 years.  The same can happen with Firefox, which is experiencing difficulties, approaching the market share mark of 2-3%. <br><br>  In part, this decline is due to the fact that web application developers are not testing their products on browsers with a low market share.  This leads to errors, and clients turn to browsers on which everything works - a kind of vicious circle is obtained. <br><br>  Some users <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D14420972">believe</a> that Chrome owes its popularity to extensions, namely the simplicity of their installation.  Microsoft has realized the importance of extensions too late, because in the past and lost to Google. <br><br>  The ability to install them <a href="https://xdrv.ru/articles/software/331/full">appeared</a> in the new Microsoft browser (called Edge) only last year, and the number of programs available for use is not so large. <br><br>  As for other browsers, they are also likely to remain in the shadow of the IT giant.  Although recently Mozilla <a href="https://medium.com/the-official-unofficial-firefox-blog/browse-against-the-machine-e793c0fee917">published a</a> post in which they described a plan for the return of Firefox to the competition. <br><br>  However, despite the fact that today Firefox can compete with Chrome in many areas (in some it even <a href="http://www.erahm.org/2017/05/15/firefox-memory-usage-with-multiple-content-processes/">surpasses it</a> ) and the company has increased the staff of employees working on the desktop version of the product, the browser share on the market still dropped from 16% to 14.85 % ( <a href="https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/">statistics</a> for desktop applications). <br><br>  At the moment Chrome began to gain momentum, Mozilla CEO John Lilly said: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFirefox doesn‚Äôt exist because the team wants to impose its browser on everyone.  We are working on Firefox because we <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D14420972">want</a> to give people a choice. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  And they gave it - their project inspired other companies to develop browsers: Opera, Safari, Edge, Brave.  However, their market share is also extremely small.  Growth is observed only in Safari, and this is primarily due to the proliferation of devices running iOS. <br><br>  And although these browsers will be present on the market for many years, looking at the graphs and numbers, we can say that they have lost the battle for the market and cannot compete with Chrome. <br><br>  PS Other materials from the blog "IT-GRAD": <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582-sap-%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">What to require from SAP hosting service provider?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-vmware-vsphere-6.0-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">Three reasons why using VMware vSphere 6.0 is still relevant</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vcloud-availability-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B2-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">vCloud Availability: deep immersion in traffic replication</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582-%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-wannacry">How to avoid becoming a victim and defend against the coder Trojan WannaCry</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">Rent a virtual server or rent a virtual data center?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-pci-dss-%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0">What to look for when choosing a cloud PCI DSS hosting service</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329396/</a></p>
