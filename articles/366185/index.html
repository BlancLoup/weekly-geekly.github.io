On all nozzles there is an inscription Audiofly. <br><br>  Each person has his own shape and diameter of the auditory canal, someone has more, someone has less.  The correct choice of nozzles is responsible for the fit and comfort.  If the attachment is chosen larger than the size of the channel, then the depth of landing is insufficient, there is no tight contact and the headphones will just fall out of the ear.  If the nozzle is too small, the result will be the same.  In addition to the unreliable fit, bass is missing due to the gaps between the nozzle and the canal walls.  The optimal selection of nozzles is a guarantee of high-quality sound. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d5/97b/599/1d597b599ff2427396ae1a193dd917d3.jpg"><br><br>  Case is beautiful and spectacular.  You can be sure that his strength is enough for any extreme situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/8b2/24a/d2a8b224a2634e299018f8ccd4d04c84.jpg"><br><br>  The wire is covered with fabric braid, providing additional strength.  The length of the wire to the fork for the right and left earpiece is the same.  The straight plug and headphones are optimally used with a smartphone or player located in a breast pocket.  The microphone effect on the wire is minimal. <br><br>  Tactile dots for blindly identifying channels are located on the right earpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c1/fb5/3be/2c1fb53be2954ecc8e293ba22054baa8.png"><br><br>  The Audiofly AF56 uses a 13mm speaker of its own design.  The large diameter of the membrane is necessary for obtaining deep bass with a small amplitude of oscillations and, accordingly, a low level of distortion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f9/fbd/7d2/8f9fbd7d2c0c46299a08ecc9d0dd3da8.png"><br><br>  The design of the headphones is completely closed, and the decorative grille does not actually have through holes. <br><br>  Despite the use of a large speaker, the headphones are compact and do not protrude from the ears, which allows them to be used both in the winter under the cap and at home, lying sideways on the pillow. <br><br>  If desired, headphones can be worn by ear (wire up).  With such a fit, if the wire clings to something, the earpiece will not fall out of the ear, because  tension will fall on the auricle.  Virtually all headphones for musicians performing on the stage are made by default for the ear-hook.  The only thing is that during AF56 ear-landing, the right and left channels will be swapped (although it depends on the size of the auricle, it may be comfortable for someone, and so). <br><br>  By the way, the headphones were fully developed in Australia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/4ad/8fd/2cb4ad8fdd7d44d0b50b01b5e2c2e38d.jpg"><br><br>  To assess the sound quality used Hi-Fi player <a href="http://soundpal.ru/733-0.html">Hidizs AP100</a> . <br><br>  The main advantages include confident transmission of the low-frequency range and low distortion over the entire frequency range.  High frequencies are not sibilant and are sufficiently detailed for their class.  Perhaps AF56 is a good alternative to <a href="http://soundpal.ru/351-0.html">Sennheiser IE60</a> with a similar sound handwriting. <br><br>  The low frequencies of the AF56 extend to the infranise itself, but at the same time they can not be immediately noticed, since  they are not enriched with additional harmonics from distortion (which is often observed in headphones with a small-diameter radiator with an increased amplitude of oscillations). <br><br>  The sensitivity of the headphones at a good level, the volume is sufficient not only from a specialized Hi-Fi player, but also a regular smartphone. <br><br>  Measurements in the <a href="http://reference-audio-analyzer.pro/">Reference Audio Analyzer</a> laboratory showed that the headphones have the most popular type of frequency response curve, with a rise in the low frequencies and lower highs with low upper mid-range.  This type of frequency response is most in demand on the street or in a noisy environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4e/81a/a84/e4e81aa843fe40fab3ed8a12c5f453c2.png"><br><br>  Due to the calibration of microphones up to 46 kHz, we can note the behavior of headphones in the extended frequency range.  Low frequencies do not fall down to 5 Hz and below; this is probably the result of using a speaker with a large diffuser area.  By the way, for example, Sennheiser IE 80 below 20 Hz shows a noticeable decline. <br><br>  In the high-frequency region, one can observe irregularity of the graph in the form of alternating peaks and dips - this is nothing but resonances inside the ear canal simulator.  The distribution of resonances individually depends on the shape of the ear canal and the graph should evaluate the curve without peaks and dips, keeping in mind that all these peaks and dips for each listener will be at other frequencies.  In this case, it can be seen that in the high-frequency region the curve decreases gradually and if the manufacturer wrote the frequency range as 3 Hz-45 kHz, then this would be fully justified.  In the technical specifications, the manufacturer indicated more modest data in the form of 18 Hz-20 kHz. <br><br>  <a href="http://reference-audio-analyzer.pro/report/hp/audiofly-af56.php">Detailed measurement report Audiofly AF56</a> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion on Audiofly AF56 </h2><br><br>  Audiofly AF56 headphones will appeal to lovers of high-quality bass reproduction, not in quantity, but in quality.  Good ergonomics and elegant look makes the headphones a universal gift for any occasion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366185/</a></p>
