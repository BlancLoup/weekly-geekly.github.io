The social media industry, whose component parts ‚Äî analytics, linguistics, and unstructured BigData ‚Äî has also been abutted against the walls several times, but again and again broke the cocoon of limited perception and has flown the butterfly to new heights. <br><br>  From visual problem-solutions we can recall: <br>  - ‚ÄúCollecting such powerful streams is impossible‚Äù - new teams appeared with new hikes and implemented <b>Topsy, gnip, SDS</b> ; <br>  - ‚ÄúAnalytics of unstructured volume multilingual data on the fly is impossible‚Äù - <b>Autonomy, Radian6, Brand Analytics</b> revealed the impossibility; <br>  ‚ÄúLinguistics will never cope with such speeds‚Äù - <b>AlchemyApi, EurekaEngine</b> came to replace the old slow algorithms ... <br><br>  The height of the next wall has risen to a new, already non-technological (here, in fact, the volume of humanity ‚Äúended‚Äù earlier), and to the socium level - <b>‚ÄúThere will be little data and everything will be lost!‚Äù</b> - this article is devoted to this promise.

      We have (our) answer to the next pugalka, but before its publication is it possible that someone from colleagues will express his opinion?  - welcome! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/026/0e0/eb1/0260e0eb1fd6400c844cf5e427af3561.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ================== <br>  <b>Is social media analytics coming to an end?</b> <br><br>  One of the greatest promises of the social media era was that they would become a kind of self-regulating speaker, allowing you to <b>connect with the whole world</b> .  That, suddenly, all people in the communication plan will become similar to the most influential and richest people on the planet, finally plunging inequality and overthrowing despots only with a couple of posts on the Internet. <br><br>  But the followers of this vision of the process is becoming less.  This idea is replaced by a different vision of social media, and <b>personal (and ever shorter)</b> conversations prevail at the current stage of the social revolution.  With the victorious procession of social media on the planet, they are increasingly moving away from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan all-rounder speaker and are getting closer to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa personal interest club, where participants gather in millions of closed rooms.  Instead of words publicly, people whisper among themselves.  These personal conversations, which are transmitted only to friends and subscribers, are not available through API and other external channels suitable for data aggregation, which means that social media are becoming more and more closed from external access and, in the near future, the era of social media analysts ( in the form in which it is now) can come to an end. <br><br>  Almost every social media analysis platform includes data on <b>Twitter</b> , and this is not by chance.  Since its inception, Twitter has presented itself as a kind of ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù of the social Internet, presenting what, in essence, was a cloud-based publishing platform designed to deliver millions of messages between multiple recipients across the Internet.  The platform itself was built from scratch around the idea of <b>"hearing"</b> , where all publications were public by default, and every tweet, regardless of who published it, could be found through the search bar on the system directly from the main page, and for that not even need to register.  The creators of Twitter even launched a special thread distribution system <i>Firehose</i> that works well with automatic information gathering tools, thereby maximizing the availability of the platform for analytical data processing systems.  And the combination of the basic principle of universal accessibility and machine-friendly Firehose made Twitter the main platform for a variety of public data collection systems. <br><br>  The complete opposite of Twitter is Facebook, which has grown into a kind of <b>‚Äúfenced garden‚Äù</b> , a closed segment of the Internet under the full jurisdiction and control of a single company.  Instead of the open Twitter browsing and search page, Facebook on its main page provides only a registration screen that you must go through to become another member of this community with clear rules about anonymity and concealing your identity.  To access most of the published information, the user will have to create an account and agree with the rules for using this closed version of the Internet. <br><br>  Most content is personal, allowing for publication to open access to it only to friends or subscribers.  When tweet is available to the world by default, posting to Facebook is only available to friends.  And even if someday Facebook offers us its version of Firehose, which, according to analytics from Twitter, will give access to all public publications, due to the nature of this platform, most of the information will not be included in it, since it is published only in personal correspondence. and will not be available for public data collection tools. <br><br>  This, however, does not mean that personal data from Facebook is not collected by anyone or anyone - they are actually used everywhere, from advertising and news to active manipulation of users' emotions.  The only difference is that only the administration of Facebook can, based on these data, conduct research on a social scale, such as <i>‚Äúhow online communication takes place between women‚Äù</i> or <i>‚Äúhow parents and children interact on the Internet‚Äù</i> .  In short, if Twitter focuses on the openness and accessibility of all information for all, then Facebook will focus on the privacy of information, although personal information is still used, but only by Facebook itself. <br><br>  And although the question of how much social media reflect the real state of affairs and whether they have critical flaws, it‚Äôs only obvious that the ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù social media is undergoing global stagnation.  Regarding informative publications and the number of users publishing content, as well as geographic diversity, platforms like Twitter have almost completely stopped, while platforms that focus on privacy, like Facebook, are constantly evolving and achieve much more significant results. <br><br>  While Twitter and its embedded widgets enable anyone to find any of the half a billion posts posted on the platform daily, Facebook and other services require registration to access their content.  In this regard, social media is becoming more and more like a private, private garden, where most of the data is private and inaccessible to social media analytics. <br><br>  Combining the above, we can conclude that the future for companies analyzing social copper is bleak.  Although the social media themselves are experiencing continuous growth and provide an opportunity to ‚Äúgive a vote‚Äù even to representatives of the most distant states, their conversations take the form of a whisper behind closed doors, rather than loud shouts to the mouthpiece.  Since cries become a whisper, information that social media analytics can work with is drying out.  In a world where social media is a personal conversation between friends, there is almost nothing for third-party analytics to do.  Like the Big Data revolution itself, even though the data around us is becoming more and more, but in a sense, we began to see even a smaller part of the world than we had before. <br>  ====================================== <br><br>  Here is such pessimism, life has failed, and the billions of money spent are thrown to the wind ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300596/</a></p>
