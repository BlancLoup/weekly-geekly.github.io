      But it is much better not to lose control from the beginning, and I‚Äôll tell you about it later. <br><br>  In this article I want to share with you my personal experience of an unusual solution to this issue, to whom it is interesting - I ask for cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Task </h5><br>  The situation is as follows: after registering a domain, whoever has a password for managing a domain, he is the owner, that is, he can change any information, including  and about the owner. <br>  Task: to split the authority to manage the domain. <br>  A bad decision is to give control to everything;  who first wants one and will change the password. <br>  A reliable solution is to divide the password between the owners, in accordance with the size of shares in the project. <br>  For example, there are 3 owners with equal shares, each comes up with their own six-digit password. <br>  Thus, it turns out the situation when something can be changed only by a collective decision, and if there is no such decision, then everything will remain as it was originally intended.  Problem solved. <br><br><h5>  There are nuances </h5><br>  In the absence of one of the participants in the scheme, the missing piece of the password can be recovered only by going through its password using the other known parts. <br><br>  This method is suitable for most registrars and domains of the first level, where management is carried out by login and password, for example, godaddy.com. <br><br>  What is the email, phone, address and full name? <br>  So that no one individually could use this data to restore the password to the account, block the contact information in the same way: <br>  Email - you need to register the mailbox on gmail and share the password on the same principle. <br>  Phone - enter a non-existent number, for example, that there were not enough numbers. <br>  In the full name, you can simply enter the names of all owners, or only last names, or only first names using a hyphen. <br><br>  Which DNS to specify, and which hosting to choose? <br>  Try to approach this issue very carefully, using a similar principle of access sharing.  It is better to use DNS and hosting with the same provider and separate passwords to the DNS panel and passwords for access to the server.  But remember that this choice can remain for a long time. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  In any case, each project is individual and has its own technological characteristics, which, of course, must be considered when using this model. <br><br>  Again, you need to understand that people work everywhere, everywhere there is a human factor, <br>  so remember to always use common sense when making such decisions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134520/</a></p>
