Today we opened our copy for the first time and share our impressions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6a/642/7bb/e6a6427bb7064da9b200e2b544c52ab8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Start with a little background. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Short background</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfully wireless headphones became popular after <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hellobragi/the-dash-wireless-smart-in-ear-headphones">The Dash campaign on Kickstarter</a> .  At the same time, almost no one received them except for backers.  Even Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bragi-Enabled-Headphones-Black-B1000-0001/dp/B01BHAU6QO">reports</a> that they will start shipping only on July 17.  We, too, have been at the stage of signing a contract and constant negotiations since six months ... <br><br>  Given the interest in the model, we looked at one of the more or less normal Chinese who had already thought of copying, and those were found.  So the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/267550/">GoGo model</a> came to us, not bad, wireless, but not cool enough to sell it.

Some time ago, rumors about a wireless model began to circulate around the network, and last month <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/new-technology/samsung-gear-fit2-iconx.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dblog">an</a> official presentation <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/new-technology/samsung-gear-fit2-iconx.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dblog">took place</a> .  The company introduced two new gadgets at once: an updated Gear Fit 2 with GPS and IconX.  At the same time, Charm has recently gone on sale - a stylish, but very simple activity tracker <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-smart-charmy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">for 2,490 rubles</a> , which has already begun to be forgotten after the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/samsung-charm.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dblog">May announcement</a> . <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>IconX</b> <br><br>  Anyway, the Samsung model appeared in our hands before The Dash.  IconX is a fitness tracker that works with <a href="http://shealth.samsung.com/">SHealth</a> .  However, it was possible to connect it there only by downloading the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.samsung.android.app.watchmanager%26hl%3Dru">Gear application</a> first and downloading an additional plug-in to it. <br><br>  You can control the functions of the headphones through the Gear-app, and with the help of ‚Äútaps‚Äù and ‚Äútouches‚Äù.  For example, a double ‚Äúhit‚Äù on the right headphone switches the next track, a double hit on the left one ‚Äî the previous one.  ‚ÄúFlicking‚Äù on the right will increase the volume, on the left we will decrease it.  A short "hit" - pause, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e6/1f5/df6/4e61f5df632d435093ed9c271a63bcd9.jpg"><br><br>  Also in the application, you can access the function of "external perception".  By activating it, you will hear everything that happens around through the built-in microphone, even over the music, even without.  Clear, clear, quite loud, and this is unusual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/07c/c43/5ee07cc435b147aaa3d6210fe2ec6e05.jpg"><br><br>  In the app - charge indicator of each device.  They synchronize among themselves somehow imperceptibly: you connect to the smartphone, insert it into your ears and - both work immediately without additional movements.  IconX also works in headset mode: the interlocutor‚Äôs voice is heard loudly, clearly, but only after 1 right earpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbb/4d3/a7e/fbb4d3a7eda746f8a099999a00227b4f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  They are small and do not stick out of the ears, like GoGo, for example, but the first sensations when listening to the ears were warm: perhaps because they took them out of the box that charges them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/5a7/986/e465a7986995494cb0854cc6802a735c.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are completely wireless, unrelated to each other, on each of them there are points-outputs for charging.  Replaceable rubber bands: those that go directly into the ear, and those that act as an attachment.  Charged from the case, which is also the PowerBank for them.  The case is smooth, has a "sausage" shape, not heavy, easily fits in your pocket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/0ab/a2d/2840aba2dd6e4540bdbc153abfcda416.jpg"><br><br>  Also, given their sporting purpose, the headphones are equipped with a heart rate monitor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6f/69c/3d6/b6f69c3d64bf4210b96117f983edc1fe.jpg"><br><br>  Each has its own sensor.  Pulse at rest shows very satisfactory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/193/ccb/b7e193ccb05f4358b04de9d3c1f56971.jpg"><br><br>  And here it is just appropriate to say about the main difference from Dash - you cannot swim in Samsung headphones.  It is worth adding that the cost is lower: Dash headphones now <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/the-dash-besprovodnye-umnye-naushniki.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Ddash">cost 21,500</a> , and IconX costs <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/novosti-2/new-technology/samsung-gear-fit2-iconx.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3DiconX">12,999 rubles</a> . <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br>  The gadget comes in a box with instructions, each item is arranged in its cells.  The box has a rectangular shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/004/b8c/8d9/004b8c8d90d54a599367f8308c6c3b8b.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Headphone size 18.9 x 26.4 x 26.0 mm, weight approx.  6 grams each </li><li>  The size of the cover-charging 35.3 x 30.3 x 92 mm </li><li>  Touch surface </li><li>  Built-in memory: 4 GB (Can be used as a standalone player) </li><li>  Wireless: Bluetooth 4.1 </li><li>  Compatibility: Android </li></ul><br><br>  In fact, it‚Äôs not entirely correct to talk about compatibility only with Android: you can also connect headphones to iOS via Bluetooth, but of course, you cannot use them as a tracker.  In the case of iOS, this will be a regular wireless headset.  Also, as already mentioned, you can use them altogether as a standalone player. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  When listening for the first time, there were no serious complaints about the sound quality, the only thing that catches the <s>eye</s> is the weak sound of the ‚Äúlower classes‚Äù, although in some, in particular, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/obzor-gear-iconx-kachestvennyj-zvuk-v-nebolshom-korpuse.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dicon%26utm_campaign%3Dblog">translation</a> reviews, the only drawback is the lack of full-fledged work with IOS, without making any sound complaints . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372485/</a></p>
