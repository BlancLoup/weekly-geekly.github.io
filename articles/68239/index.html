There were good and bad reviews, but for us they are all excellent because they help to make askdev better. <br><br><h4>  What has been done in these six weeks? </h4><br><ul><li>  The site design in general remained the same, but the types of questions and answers were changed to avoid confusion and improve the perception of information. </li><li>  Gravatar support has been added, after which most of the users of the site have avatars. </li><li>  Removed the gradient in the preview of the question and the "incomprehensible" background in the website's header. </li><li>  Added sorting on the tags page by alphabet and popularity </li><li>  Arrows of voting for questions and answers have become brighter, so as not to "burden" the left side of the site. </li><li>  Account and profile is now one page where you can see your questions / answers and edit personal information. </li><li>  The profile has a section where you can view all your comments. </li><li>  Fixed bugs in checking the username and when changing the password (were not critical and did not interfere with the work of the site) </li><li>  Changed URLs for questions, added URL question URL (search speed in the database by ID is of course higher than the long line) </li><li>  Reworked tag cloud, excludes all tags used only once, and the build algorithm is now logarithmic </li><li>  Updated user list page </li><li>  Layout is fixed, now there is no horizontal scrolling on 1024x768 </li><li>  Now you can not vote if there is no minimum rating (10 points) </li><li>  RSS now displays the full text of the question (previously abbreviated) </li><li>  Added widget of choice of tags of interest / ignored </li><li>  Now you can edit your answers and questions at any time, because the change history is now recorded and available for viewing.  In the future, it is possible that users with high ratings will have the opportunity to edit other people's answers / questions as on stackoverflow, but up to this point you need to go further. The Discussions tab has been added to the new profile where the feed of answers and comments is posted to the user <br>  Small link to send a question to twitter

    <br>  Of course, this is not the whole list of changes, because it makes no sense to list all the details.  Most of the changes are already small, but on the whole they gave quite a good result. <br><br><h4>  So what is habraeffekt in our case? </h4><br>  I think this topic is interesting to many, especially those who are only going to submit their project to the court in the future. <br><br>  After getting to the home page, a lot of visitors came.  For greater clarity, I cite the schedule for 7 days.  The peak point on the chart is the day of the post here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aab/d87/1f8/aabd871f8ee11f86e5b38c9857b64a93.png" alt="traffic schedule"><br><br>  Then there were a couple more jumps with Habrahabr, I do not know what it was connected with, but they were not so noticeable anymore.  At the moment, the number of visits has leveled off and keeps around 200-300 per day. <br><br>  Next is probably the most important schedule, this is the number of registrations.  It is very approximate, but I will say that the data is somewhere under 10% underestimated, the goal is apparently not exactly tuned, but it's easier for me to see the exact amount in the database, and the analyst gives a general idea quite on a level.  At the time of writing, the number of users is 790. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef2/0dc/7d4/ef20dc7d4471babf97229beda0fb46e6.png" alt="registration schedule"><br><br>  The server was not absolutely ready to habraeffektu, during stay on main it fell twice.  So that this did not happen again, I had to throw in the RAM as a matter of urgency.  If you believe that you will get to the main habr, prepare better for us, do caching (we have but not saved), set the opcode cache, set up the server as it should be, test the site‚Äôs work under load, learn from the mistakes of others. <br><br>  Work on the site continues, and will not stop until there is interest in the resource.  During this short period, the site has become more stable, faster and more convenient, a little more mature.  I think in the near future the site will become even more beautiful, I have not forgotten reviews about the design. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to thank everyone who appreciated, expressed his positive or negative opinion, all who joined the resource.  Special thanks to Habrahabr.
