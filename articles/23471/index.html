And I'm with her. <br><br>  How many years I listened to the insane cries of "Habrahabr has changed!  He is not the same as before! ‚ÄùAnd only grinned.  Then I did not feel the change.  But not now.  Now I clearly feel that Habra is not the same as I found her in his youth.  Time did not spare her.  As, however, and me.  Wrinkles, sagging belly, gray hair on temples are just some of the signs of approaching old age.  I have experienced a lot in my life.  Takeoffs followed by a fall.  Unrestrained growth suddenly fell into a bottomless abyss.  I rejoiced and exulted.  I mourned and yearned for other times.  I reached many peaks and conquered many depths.  I even remember some of them - sclerosis could not overcome me. <br><br>  Habra also had an interesting life.  Simply Habra and the Super-Witness that has repeated its success were forgotten after the provocative Megahabra.  Fortunately, Gigahabra has revived the good name of Habra.  And now, when the third beta of Terakhabra is coming, I feel that this is not the Habra that I have lived with all these years.  She has changed.  She changed her spirit.  Even the failing Megahabra was much closer to its nature.  She followed the right path.  This is probably the reason for its failure - the habra people wanted something new, and they were returned to the old circles that were already known to all of them.  Only the most seasoned optimists and the most persistent habramaniacs remained.  The rest are gone.  Gone to another world.  A young (then), promising, intriguing world with fresh solutions ...

      Well.  It was their decision.  Leave  Their right.  They did it then, marching under loud slogans ‚ÄúThey spoiled Habra.  Habra has changed!  Youngsters, naive youths.  Then I considered them exactly like that.  And now.  I'm leaving now too.  Now I am old and have seen a lot in my life.  I found more than a dozen ups and downs.  Both their own and others.  But I'm leaving the same way as everyone.  I am leaving, marching under the loud slogans ‚ÄúHabra has changed.  It will not return. "  Just because it is so accepted. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Interestingly, are the minuses minus the topic for a sharp topic or for my flat humor?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23471/</a></p>
