  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another feat of management "K": for the first time in the Russian Federation, the activity of online casinos</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From today's Interfax tape: Interior Ministry officers liquidated online casinos, whose daily income was 200 thousand rubles. <br>  ‚ÄúEmployees of the‚Äú K ‚Äùdepartment of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia stopped the activity of the largest online casino in Russia.  A criminal case under Art.  171 of the Criminal Code (illegal business) " <br>  From there: ‚ÄúThis is the first criminal case on the organization of the gambling business on the Internet‚Äù and ‚ÄúDetectives found that the organizer of the criminal group, which included five people, was a 33-year-old man.  About ten years ago <a name="habracut"></a>  he organized online casinos in overseas technical areas, but the site was administered on the territory of the Russian Federation. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to <s>the</s> police, anyone who made bets on even symbolic amounts - from 50 rubles could become a client of an online casino.  "The casino provided its customers with a wide choice of gambling games - from slot machines and roulette to poker, in total over 470 items." <br>  According to operational data, the attackers earned about 200 thousand rubles per day, and for the entire existence of the casino they got rich for hundreds of millions of dollars. <br>  ‚ÄúAll the proceeds through sophisticated financial schemes were transferred to the accounts of foreign banks.  Subsequently, they were cashed through offshore companies, ‚Äùthe Interior Ministry representative said. <br>  According to her, during searches in the places of residence of participants in a criminal group, as well as in the office of the organization, ‚Äúcomputer equipment was discovered and seized, with the help of which the casino site was managed and administered, as well as funds in the amount of more than 27 million rubles‚Äù. <br><br>  Neither the names, nor the name of the site, nor the region in which the "criminals" lived has been named yet. <br>  Another kind of vileness from the management of "K".  As I understand it, the project was completely offshore, issued to a foreign legal entity, hosting was also outside the Russian Federation.  The only thing that the owners lived in the Russian Federation, and here was the computer from which they "administered" the site.  Of course, I understand that the president breathes unevenly to the word "casino" and everyone should somehow be noted before him, but one should not bring it to the point of absurdity. <br>  Based on the information, even 14.1 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation cannot be priplesti, 2500 rubles fine. </div>
