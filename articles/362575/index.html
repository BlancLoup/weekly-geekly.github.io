To avoid the negative impact of permanent sitting on health and well-being, you need to actively engage in sports.  Swimming, running, strength exercises - literally what the doctor ordered. <br><br>  But how to assess the quality of their workouts and the achievement of previously set fitness goals?  This will help fitness trackers: devices that have become popular over the past couple of years.  Fitness trackers are now a great many, and we will try to help in the selection, presenting several options.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Striiv band </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49f/e7e/fde/49fe7efde5fb42bcbb586281c6778540.jpg"><br><br>  This bracelet helps to monitor your activity during the day, as well as to monitor the quality of sleep.  The device does not have the usual display, but there are LEDs.  The more LEDs are lit - it means, the more active is the training. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.striiv.com/striivband/">Striiv Band</a> allows you to find out how many steps you have traveled, how much distance you have covered in a day and whether your goals have been achieved (for example, to run a couple of kilometers). <br><br>  The function of monitoring the quality of sleep allows you to find out why you are not getting enough sleep (if so).  The data is transmitted to the mobile application of the paired smartphone, where all information is processed and provided in a convenient form for viewing. <br><br>  Quite good.  In Russia, the device costs about 5 thousand rubles. <br><br><h3>  Sony smartband </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/458/fa8/eb2/458fa8eb2e6042cc88ac6364fe8fcea1.jpg"><br><br>  The bracelet from Sony should appeal to those of us who lead an active social life (at least virtual).  You can share your training results with friends and colleagues, and see who achieved what. <br><br>  In addition, <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/smartwear/smartband-swr10/">Sony SmartBand</a> will show where the owner was, how he was having fun, with whom he was photographed.  The more active the device owner, the more points it gets, the higher it rises in the rating among registered users. <br><br>  Any event can be bookmarked using the special Life Bookmark button. <br><br>  Sony SmartBand is something like the social version of a fitness tracker. <br><br>  The price in Russia is 3990 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Xiaomi Mi Band </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d37/36c/a25/d3736ca25a73408c8ef2f34f8f2700e7.jpg"><br><br>  Another bracelet, this time from the company, which just recently took the third place in the world in terms of the production of mobile devices. <br><br>  Xiaomi Mi mainly produces mobile devices, but recently released a fitness bracelet.  When the price of the device became known, it seemed suspiciously low to many.  But the bracelet was surprisingly functional and practical. <br><br>  Reviews of Xiaomi Mi Band, both on foreign and domestic sites, are positive.  And there are several reasons for this.  One of them is functionality: <br><ul><li>  Pedometer; </li><li>  Sleep tracker; </li><li>  Smart alarm clock, taking into account the phases of sleep; </li><li>  Notification of incoming calls; </li><li>  Counting calories burned; </li><li>  Automatic locking and unlocking of the smartphone using a bracelet. </li></ul><br><br>  In this case, the price of the gadget in the Russian Federation is only 1,750 rubles.  This, as far as can be judged, is the lowest price in the segment.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/xiaomi-miband.html">Xiaomi Mi Band</a> functionality - at the level of bracelets from the middle price segment. <br><br><h3>  Zefit </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36d/417/f73/36d417f73a8442fcac621a30e463d2b9.jpg"><br><br>  This bracelet already has a display.  The functionality of <a href="http://www.mykronoz.com/collections/zefit/">ZeFit is</a> about the same as that of the devices described above.  These include the ability to set goals, view activity results for the day (distance traveled, number of steps), monitor sleep quality, set reminders for upcoming events. <br><br>  Information is displayed on a small, economical display. <br><br>  The price of the device in Russia - 3200 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Youwell </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc0/eea/976/dc0eea97663943118917ec8dda182843.jpg"><br><br>  It should immediately be said that this is a good bracelet, although the Chinese craftsmen copied its design from the Prestigio bracelet.  Actually, for the Chinese, this is the usual method of work, and in this case, the guys from Youwell also wrote their own application.  Well, the price of Youwell is much lower than that of Prestigio.  So, if you dreamed of Prestigio, but the price seemed high, you should think about a Chinese relative. <br><br>  The fitness bracelet is equipped with a bright LED-display, the information on which is visible on the sunniest day.  At the same time, the device is equipped with a large number of functions, including monitoring the quality of sleep, determining the distance traveled and the steps taken, setting goals and tracking the implementation of these goals. <br><br>  On the arm, the bracelet sits very comfortably thanks to an elastic rubber strap.  The positive side of the device is the ability to charge the battery through any USB port. <br><br>  Applications for Youwell released for iOS and Android. <br><br>  The cost of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/youwell-smartband.html">Youwell tracker</a> in Russia is 2350 rubles. <br><br>  Perhaps you have experience using such a device?  Then share this experience in the comments, if, of course, there is time and desire. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362575/</a></p>
