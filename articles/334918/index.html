The conference was well organized and the reports were diverse, informative and effective.  The first day was devoted to technical issues and mostly revolved around Laravel.  The second day was diluted with speeches on a variety of topics, quite entertaining and thought-provoking. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Personally, I liked the opportunity to meet with a whole bunch of people with whom I communicate with Twitter. </p><br><p>  Another interesting point is the opportunity to make a small ‚Äúfood pilgrimage‚Äù in New York.  Larakona also had a lot of free food, and I even tried it a bit, but I wasn't going to miss this opportunity. </p><br><p>  This article will be a brief overview of what I learned in the presentations.  Unfortunately, I was not able to listen to a block of reports from the Science Fair.  I did not take notes and could not provide a detailed report on each statement.  There is a lot of material on some performances, but not enough on others. </p><br><h2 id="den-1">  Day 1 </h2><br><h3 id="freek-van-der-hertenhttpsmediumcomfreekmurze-spatie">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40freekmurze">Freek Van der Herten</a> , Spatie </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Creating a control panel with Laravel, Vue.js and Pusher </p><br><p>  I was already familiar with the material that Frick covered in his speech, since I had already read a blog entry on this topic.  And yet, I learned a lot of new things, since it is live kodil to show how time / weather components, packagist statistics and Twitter feed are made. </p><br><p>  He also presented impressive Spatie open source statistics. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/freekmurze">Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://spatie.be/en/opensource">OSS packages Spatie</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://murze.be/2017/06/building-realtime-dashboard-powered-laravel-vue-2017-edition/">Blog entry</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Panel source</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/freekmurze/dashboard-laraconus">Speaker deck</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="tom-schlickhttpsmediumcomtomschlick">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40tomschlick">Tom Schlick</a> </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : How to build multi-user applications </p><br><p>  The presentation hit the mark, because half the audience dreamed of building their own cool SaaS application.  Tom talked about various database strategies: He compared how one can be used and how several can be used, talked about their strengths and weaknesses.  He also spoke about his other considerations: for example, about how to segment the various components of his application (queues, console commands, migrations, file storage, cache, etc.) and domain assignment strategies.  I will share the details below, as his presentation is already publicly available. </p><br><p>  Tom mentioned on his Twitter account that he would be speaking for the first time, so for the first time it came out quite well. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tomschlick">Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://multitenantlaravel.com/">Site</a> (work in progress) </li><li>  <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tomschlick/building-multi-tenant-applications">Speaker deck</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/HipsterJazzbo/Landlord">Package source</a> (single database) </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/orchestral/tenanti">Package source</a> (multiple databases) </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/tomschlick/townhouse">Package source</a> (multiple databases) (work in progress) </li></ul><br><h3 id="adam-wathanhttpsmediumcomadamwathan">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40adamwathan">Adam wathan</a> </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : CRUD design </p><br><p>  Adam in his speech focused on the need for controllers to be as RESTful as possible.  First, he showed a screenshot of Basecamp 3, which David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) mentioned in his tweet: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b5/9a8/881/3b59a88819d24ec0a0b8e88896c16a18.png" alt="basecamp-3"><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/647163196839739392">https://twitter.com/dhh/status/647163196839739392</a> </p><br><p>  Here you should pay attention to the following indicators: the number of controllers, a small number of methods per controller and the average number of lines of code in each method. </p><br><p>  Adam wrote code on the stage for a demo application - Casthacker.  In his route file there were two controllers - PodcastsController with 13 methods and EpisodesController with 5th. </p><br><p>  He reworked them into additional controllers using the following principles: </p><br><ul><li>  If this is a nested resource, create a new controller. </li><li>  If the resource can be edited independently, create a new controller. </li><li>  If you are affecting pivot records, create a new controller and possibly a new model (see the last link below) </li><li>  If you change the state of the resource, create a new controller. </li></ul><br><p> The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe demo was that you never need to write custom actions.  Limit controller methods to 7 CRUD actions: <code>index</code> , <code>create</code> , <code>store</code> , <code>show</code> , <code>edit</code> , <code>update</code> and <code>destroy</code> . </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs perl">// : <span class="hljs-regexp"><span class="hljs-regexp">//</span></span>  PodcastsController@publish PodcastsController@unpublish //  PublishedPodcastsController@store PublishedPodcastsController@destroy //  PodcastsController@subscribe //  SubscriptionsController@store</code> </pre> <br><p>  His presentation and demo application can not be viewed online, but he tweeted that he would soon post it.  But if you are already subscribed to his Test-Driven Laravel course, then you will find this topic in the ‚ÄúPublishing Concert Drafts‚Äù section. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">https://twitter.com/adamwathan</a> </li><li>  Blog - <a href="https://adamwathan.me/">https://adamwathan.me/</a> </li><li>  Test-Driven Laravel‚Äî <a href="https://adamwathan.me/test-driven-laravel/">https://adamwathan.me/test-driven-laravel/</a> </li><li>  Your REST API hides the model - <a href="http://transmission.vehikl.com/theres-a-model-hiding-in-your-rest-api/">http://transmission.vehikl.com/theres-a-model-hiding-in-your-rest-api/</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="maxime-locqueville-algolia">  Maxime Locqueville, Algolia </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Laravel Scout + Algolia + Vue </p><br><p>  I was impressed by the presentation of Maxim, where he showed live how easily you can build a search interface for your existing project.  In about 15‚Äì20 minutes, he built a functioning search interface for the list of speakers at the conference.  To do this, do the following: </p><br><ul><li>  Installed Laravel Scout and imported models into Algolia using the artisan <code>scout:import</code> command. </li><li>  I configured the search results in the Algolia panel, in particular, assigned weights to certain attributes, so that they were higher in the search table. </li><li>  Created a search interface using the Vue component - vue-instantsearch.  Components in React and pure JavaScript are also available on Algolia's github account. </li></ul><br><p>  If you didn‚Äôt know, Algolia has the option to search the <a href="">Laravel documentation</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/maxiloc">https://twitter.com/maxiloc</a> </li><li>  Demo application - <a href="https://github.com/maxiloc/laracon17">https://github.com/maxiloc/laracon17</a> </li><li>  Laravel Scout - <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/scout">https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/scout</a> </li><li>  Algolia - <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">https://www.algolia.com/</a> </li><li>  Algolia Vue Component - <a href="https://github.com/algolia/vue-instantsearch">https://github.com/algolia/vue-instantsearch</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="evan-you-vue">  Evan You, Vue </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : State of Vue for 2017 </p><br><p>  The presentation of Vue seemed to me a bit restrained, and for good reason, since Vue 2.x is now in a stable state and in the near future there will be no releases with new cool features. </p><br><p>  The first VueConf conference was held in Poland in June. </p><br><p>  Evan mainly talked about Vue growth: showed impressive statistics from Github (61.2k + stars), NPM (622k + downloads per month) and Chrome Devtools (228k + active users per week).  He also gave examples of the growth of the Vue ecosystem.  The most remarkable of - <a href="https://weex.incubator.apache.org/">Weex</a> , mobile UI-framework. </p><br><p>  I also noted a number of points: </p><br><ul><li>  Now I can more clearly explain why I prefer Vue.  This is the most progressive framework: you can use its functionality to a minimum, completely, or stay somewhere in the middle.  With Vue it is much more convenient than with React. </li><li>  Vue, like Laravel, will have utilities that make it easier to test the frontend code.  Evan mentioned that they are still working on them. </li><li>  According to Evan, Vue's goal is happier and more efficient developers. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi">Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://weex.incubator.apache.org/">Weex</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils">Vue test utilities</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://conf.vuejs.org/">Vueconf</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="nils-adermann-composerpackagist">  Nils Adermann, Composer / Packagist </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Dependency Management </p><br><p>  I missed a rather large chunk of this talk.  It looks like Private Packagist (or Satis) was offered there as a solution to the problem of package peacekeeping and risk management of software dependencies. </p><br><p>  In the second half of the report gave good tips for the composer: </p><br><ul><li>  Package Maintainers - Use SemVer Consecutively To Notify Users Of Changes </li><li>  Document all changes. </li><li>  Users - use a conservative version restriction for dependencies. </li><li>  Use <code>composer update [--dry-run] &lt;package&gt;</code> instead of full <code>composer update</code> .  The <code>dry-run</code> label allows you to view changes without any effect on the files. </li><li>  Send <code>composer.lock</code> to the version control system.  Use <code>git checkout &lt;branch&gt; composer.lock</code> to resolve merge conflicts in the lock file. </li></ul><br><p>  An important clarification to the last point: if you work in a team, you will have problems with <code>composer.lock</code> only if everyone runs the <code>composer update</code> in their branches at the same time without any purpose.  If you follow these two rules, problems will rarely occur: </p><br><ul><li>  Only one person in the team is responsible for <code>composer.lock</code> for updating packages. </li><li>  Other team members can run <code>composer update &lt;package&gt;</code> , if you need to upgrade a specific dependency when working on a function or when fixing bugs.  This point also needs to be discussed with the whole team so that several people do not inadvertently update the same package while they are working on something else. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/naderman">Twitter</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private packagist</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Composer lock</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="taylor-otwellhttpsmediumcomtaylorotwell">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40taylorotwell">Taylor otwell</a> </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Laravel Horizon (maybe there was something else there, but it was this topic that everyone had in mind) </p><br><p>  Finally, it's time for the main report.  Taylor went through the entire list of Laravel 5.5 features.  I have included Laravel News and Laracasts in the list where you can explore all the features in detail.  I was particularly pleased with the custom validation classes.  I wrote about them earlier in <a href="https://medium.com/koomai/model-factory-and-custom-validation-artisan-commands-in-laravel-5-5-cf7f62b8d70a">another article</a> . </p><br><p>  But all eyes were on Horizon.  When he was finally shown to the public, I was very happy, because this is exactly what I need for my current work.  Horizon is a Laravel package that helps manage queues through a configuration file.  And it has a great interface.  If you often suffer from the fact that you have to manage several failed tasks simultaneously via the command line, then you will like Horizon.  One caveat: it only supports the Redis driver, but this is open source, so the community may soon add support for other drivers. </p><br><p>  Horizon website launched on the 2nd day of the conference: <a href="https://horizon.laravel.com/">https://horizon.laravel.com</a> </p><br><p>  Taylor also hinted that there will be more updates soon.  Almost certainly they will be associated with the <code>cloud.yml</code> file, which he had in the root folder of the demo application, and the <code>cloud deploy</code> command, with which he made changes to the configuration. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell">https://twitter.com/taylorotwell</a> </li><li>  Laravel 5.5 features - <a href="">https://laravel-news.com/category/laravel-5.5</a> </li><li>  Laravel 5.5 Video - <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-5">https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-5</a> </li><li>  Laravel Queues - <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/queues">https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/queues</a> </li><li>  Introduction to Laravel Horizon - <a href="https://medium.com/%40taylorotwell/introducing-laravel-horizon-4585f66e3e">https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/introducing-laravel-horizon-4585f66e3e</a> </li><li>  Laravel Horizon - <a href="https://horizon.laravel.com/">https://horizon.laravel.com/</a> </li><li>  Horizon source - <a href="https://github.com/laravel/horizon">https://github.com/laravel/horizon</a> </li><li>  Introduction to Horizon - <a href="https://mattstauffer.co/blog/introducing-laravel-horizon-a-dashboard-for-your-queues">https://mattstauffer.co/blog/introducing-laravel-horizon-a-dashboard-for-your-queues</a> </li></ul><br><h2 id="den-2">  Day 2 </h2><br><h3 id="matt-staufferhttpsmediumcommattstauffer">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40mattstauffer">Matt stauffer</a> </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Laravel Setup </p><br><p>  Matt is so chattering that the joke about re-watching his performances on Youtube at a speed of 0.5 is not a joke. </p><br><p>  He spoke about the many basic and advanced techniques of customizing Laravel to customize it for the special needs of your application.  His presentation is available in the list of links below, so I will not repeat the material. </p><br><p>  What I was particularly hooked about in his presentation was his thoughts about the readability of the code: </p><br><ul><li>  When you work with a new application, the most difficult thing is to figure out ‚Äúwhere and how does this happen?‚Äù </li><li>  Write your applications so that anyone reading the Laravel documentation can figure it out. </li></ul><br><p>  I remembered the illustration that I saw in the book ‚ÄúClean Code‚Äù by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob): </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fcb/593/8ef/fcb5938ef7224f2a83b676df655ef60e.jpg" alt="clean-code"></p><br><p>  A source: <br>  <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m</a> </p><br><p>  I suppose a bad readability of the code will mean that the rate ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this ?!‚Äù per minute will be quite high. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/stauffermatt">https://twitter.com/stauffermatt</a> </li><li>  Speaker Deck - <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mattstauffer/custom-laravel">https://speakerdeck.com/mattstauffer/custom-laravel</a> </li><li>  Site - <a href="https://customlaravel.com/">https://customlaravel.com/</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="sean-t-larkinhttpsmediumcomthelarkinn-webpack">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40TheLarkInn">Sean T.

It integrates JavaScript modules (ES6, CommonJS and AMD) to run in a browser.  Engo has a modular architecture based on plugins.  80% of webpack is built on plugins. </p><br><p>  The rest of the report discussed plug-in components and ‚Äútapable‚Äù elements. </p><br><p>  Materials may be useful if you are developing plugins or if you are trying to debug a module, but in most cases it will cover Laravel Mix from all these problems. </p><br><p>  You can help webpack developers if you support them on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack">Open Collective</a> website. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/thelarkinn">https://twitter.com/thelarkinn</a> </li><li>  Github - <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">https://github.com/webpack/webpack</a> </li><li>  webpack Academy - <a href="https://webpack.academy/">https://webpack.academy/</a> </li><li>  Open Collective - <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack">https://opencollective.com/webpack</a> </li><li>  Awesome webpack - <a href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack">https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="mathias-hansenhttpsmediumcommathiashansen-i-michele-hansenhttpsmediumcommjwhansen-geocodio">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40MathiasHansen">Mathias Hansen</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/%40mjwhansen">Michele Hansen</a> , Geocod.io </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Running and scaling a third-party project </p><br><p>  This presentation was prepared by the founders of Geocod.io, who by special coincidence of circumstances turned out to be husband and wife.  In their report, they spoke about their experience in launching and scaling a third-party project. </p><br><p>  Many of the ideas that they voiced are quite obvious.  For example, solve your own problem, create a MVP, ratify your product, know your market, do not scale too early, etc.  However, in addition to such ideas, they shared their own experiences, so it was interesting to listen to them.  They also gave a couple of practical tips on how to transfer the company to the US, insurance and SaaS applications for customer service and analytics, which they used themselves. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/MathiasHansen">https://twitter.com/MathiasHansen</a> </li><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/mjwhansen">https://twitter.com/mjwhansen</a> </li><li>  Speaker Deck - <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/minicodemonkey/launching-and-scaling-a-side-project">https://speakerdeck.com/minicodemonkey/launching-and-scaling-a-side-project</a> </li><li>  Geocod.io - <a href="https://geocod.io/">https://geocod.io/</a> </li><li>  Founder Shield - <a href="http://foundershield.com/">http://foundershield.com/</a> </li><li>  Help Flow - <a href="https://helpflow.net/">https://helpflow.net/</a> </li><li>  Hotjar - <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">https://www.hotjar.com/</a> </li><li>  Intercom - <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">https://www.intercom.com/</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="laura-elizabeth">  Laura elizabeth </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Design Debugging </p><br><p>  Laura's speech contained the right message for the right target audience.  She led everyone to the idea that the redesign of the site should be approached from a developer‚Äôs point of view - to solve problems step by step.  This approach facilitates the work for someone who does not have a natural inclination to design. </p><br><p>  She showed how to choose the main color, the overall palette, typography (fonts, hierarchy, dimensions), indents, layout and how to shine at the end.  All materials were very practical.  For me, the bonus was the list of tools she used.

It may have overlapped a bit with the previous report on a third-party project, but the approach was different. </p><br><p>  Key thoughts of his report: </p><br><ul><li>  Create what people want, not what they need. </li><li>  Four actions that a potential client must perform: notice, want, do, and love. </li><li>  We should want your product, and not need it (something similar I heard in the course of Economics 101). </li><li>  People will pay money if your product solves their problems and makes their lives better right now. </li><li>  Focus on people, not ideas.  Solve the problems of a specific group of people ‚Äî ideally, you should know these people.  See what their difficulties are and provide them with a solution. </li></ul><br><p>  He also recommended a couple of books.

Judging by the comments to his videos on Laracasts, people are interested in IDE topics just like the code itself. </p><br><p>  Jeffrey sounded 9 reasons to kill the monster.  At that moment I stopped taking notes, and therefore I do not have a detailed presentation of his material.  The basic idea that I remembered (because he came back to it many times) is that all modifications of the code must be rude.  This means that if some part of the code has ceased to suit you, then redo it in the simplest possible way.  If after this your code is not better, do not be afraid to return to the previous version. </p><br><p>  He mainly touched upon those topics that were covered to a greater or lesser extent on Laracasts: cleaning up the internal api, using single traits, reducing the number of conditions in views, events / listeners and query objects. </p><br><p>  At the end, he gave a couple of interesting quotes.  I especially liked the quote about the killing code.  I found its source and added it to the links below. </p><br><p>  If you need proof of the future, then you do not need the Terminator T-1000.  You need Kenny from South Park.  We need a code that can be killed easily and fun. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way">https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way</a> </li><li>  Site‚Äî <a href="https://laracasts.com/">https://laracasts.com/</a> </li><li>  Proof of the future‚Äî <a href="http://kranglefant.tumblr.com/post/131808192355/future-proof">http://kranglefant.tumblr.com/post/131808192355/future-proof</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="jack-mcdadehttpsmediumcomjackmcdade">  <a href="https://medium.com/%40jackmcdade">Jack McDade</a> </h3><br><p>  <strong>Topic</strong> : Deep Impact </p><br><p>  The topic Jack was talking about was rather gloomy (at least the first half), but he still presented it quite easily and was able to convey his point of view.  The key idea was that at a certain period you need to allow yourself to deeply focus on your work, abandoning the constant entertainment of modern life.  We constantly walk around the edge and do not delve into real work, and at the same time we are very busy, but it should not be like this. </p><br><p>  Depending on the point of view from which to look at it, his statement was either completely inappropriate, or it just got to the point, because the hall was full of people who were buried in their laptops or telephones.  He also spoke about a learning model, which he called ‚ÄúPay Forward.‚Äù  With this model, you train three people, and each of them in turn trains three more, and so on.  The report sounded quite appropriate for the end of the conference: he did not cover any technical issues, and yet made you think about some things. </p><br><p>  <strong>References</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/jackmcdade">https://twitter.com/jackmcdade</a> </li><li>  Deep work - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/ref%3Dcm_sw_r_cp_api_QoIEzb3RH7N2T">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_QoIEzb3RH7N2T</a> </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Uploaded videos <a href="https://streamacon.com/video/laracon-us-2017">https://streamacon.com/video/laracon-us-2017</a> </p></div>
