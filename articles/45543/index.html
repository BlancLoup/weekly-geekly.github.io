For beginner web studio managers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>(2008, letter from the senior manager of the web studio to the younger one)</i> <br>  (pros are unlikely to find something new, it will be interesting to the young) <br>  Hey.  Here is a brief instruction based on personal experience.  So to say, the course of a young fighter. <br>  <strong>Our task is to earn as much money as possible, with minimal gestures.</strong> <br><br><h3>  So, we received a letter from the client </h3><br>  There are usually the following options. <br><ol><li>  the client is clearly promising and turned to us "selectively" for us - there is a high probability that the negotiations will be successful - then it‚Äôs better to fill the arrow and establish personal contact and figure everything out on the spot.  Although, it is better to find out the budget limits anyway. </li><li>  the client is interesting, but much is unclear from his letter (there is no TZ, there is no budget, he wrote in several studios, the site is potentially complex, the site is uninteresting, etc.).  It is important to send him a BRIEF to fill out, find out the timing and budget.  Agree on a budget deadline - only later to meet if everything suits. </li><li>  The letter is suspiciously short and does not "smell of interest."  For example, ‚Äúyou need a shoe online store, how much does it cost?  How fast will you do?  Vitaly ‚Äù- there is hardly anything that will burn out + probably it is probivon at prices from competitors. <br>  In this case, the price is said to be one and a half times more expensive, we are interested in ‚Äúwe fit into their budget‚Äù in the positive case - you can meet.  Otherwise - most likely a waste of time. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  we establish the first written contact </h3><br>  Answer as soon as possible - but this is not particularly important. <br>  we do not chase customers, damn it), but still it is desirable to answer during the working day <strong>in the first letter: we</strong> communicate as politely as possible <br>  ask brief questions on the merits: <br><br>  Is there a ready-made corporate style logo? <br>  Is there a technical task on the site or at least a brief?  (if not, drop the brief, let it fill) <br>  Does the site "burn"?  What is the timeline?  If it is on, we take into account their interest in pricing " <br>  Is the budget defined and in which framework? <br>  Are there sites that they like in terms of performance?  In technical terms and artistic.

    <br>  <strong>Sample letter</strong> <br><blockquote>  Hello dear Olga. <br>  Thank you for your interest in our studio. <br>  You have a very interesting project, but a number of questions arose that I would like to find out at the meeting. <br>  About your questions. <br>  &gt; There are a few points that should be clarified: <br>  &gt; Do you use standard, free, freely distributed admin panels or self-developed admin panels? <br>  We use our own admin part.  When developing we give it to you in clear.  We can show you the admin panel demo. <br>  &gt; Could you give links to the image sites that you developed <br>  - SPECIFIC EXAMPLES <br><br>  Olga, I will dial you closer to 12 - make an appointment. <br>  Sincerely, Alexey Serebryakov <br>  Head of Internet projects <br><br>  MyStudio <br>  <a href="http://xn--80aakapebkurd0bno1pf.com/">MyStudioDesigns.com</a> <br>  moesupermilo@myudustudiyadesign.com <br>  MOBILE <br></blockquote><br>  Notes: <br>  (our example of the demo admin panel is here - link to the demo) <br><br><h3>  Choosing a meeting place </h3><br>  A fat client is usually lazy and calls to his office. <br>  If the client is out of the office and wants to ‚Äúdrive up to you‚Äù. <br><ul><li>  There is an office - perfectly drag the office.  Direct the lamp in the face and lead the interrogation). </li><li>  No office?  Just say that you are not sure about tomorrow - many meetings have already been scheduled, but let's call in the morning - ‚Äúyou will try to cross with him in the center ‚Äî for example, in the center in the area after lunch ‚Äî when would it be more convenient for him?‚Äù.  crossed in a more or less decent place, had lunch / spoke </li></ul><br><h3>  At the meeting </h3><br>  Dress better to meet their expectations.  The costume is not necessary at all, but the main thing is not ‚Äúin raspisdyysky‚Äù.  Shaved, head clean, hands washed clean of blood.  Especially women always look at it.  With women, we look into our eyes and restrainedly demonstrate admiration.  We speak slowly, chest voice in mode number 2. <br>  We write with a beautiful pen - do not be too lazy to buy a good pen and a good notebook).  In principle, you can even turn on the voice recorder - but this clogs the client - because rabbits are not only valuable fur ... (you can show it, turn it on and hide it under a piece of paper - forget about it in the first minute) <br>  We look closely in the eyes and nod.  Nods work great.  Write down.  We write the maximum number of questions during the client's story.  It is always nice.  It makes sense to frown occasionally, depicting a thought. <br>  Trying to shoot what kind of person a client is, sometimes it‚Äôs much easier not to mess with even a big money <br>  Try to avoid giving accurate budgets: "I need to consult with technical experts, and I will send you the answer as soon as possible."  You can say the price "from". <br>  It is also very desirable to find out where the client came from, on whose recommendation.  To score in the estimate - at least 10% for the lead.  As Yamamato Jinjemon used to say - the main thing for a samurai - good companions. <br>  Rates somewhere such <br>  Corporate site - the minimum interesting _____ euro.  On average, firms are willing to pay about ____- _____ euros. <br>  Inet-shops - the minimum interesting price _____ euro. <br>  Graphic design - minimum _____ euro. <br>  Progging and flash and 3D - nada on assessment carry <br>  Here there is one thought - the price does not depend on the development, more on the client's solvency.  Accordingly, we must look for fat clients. <br><br><h3>  Basic about rollback </h3><br>  it is important to know here: <br><ul><li>  Who will oversee the project? </li><li>  Who will take the design? </li><li>  What does the person with whom you speak to the acceptance of the project? </li></ul><br>  In short, it is necessary to probe here, does it make sense for the ground to offer a rollback to this line?  When you decide that you can try - you can talk directly: I wanted to ask you - if you are interested - can we include your interest in the estimate?  Well, it makes sense if there is a tender and there are several applicants for the "bank" and it is necessary that someone drags on the tender or in case the firm is so steep that a couple or a dozen pieces over it will not strain at all.  If the firm is small - it can only damage the opposite, the director may change his mind after seeing the No. amount.  In general, look at the situation. <br><br><h3>  Questions at the meeting </h3><br>  And when the client finished telling about the project and yourself - it‚Äôs your turn <br><br>  During the story I usually mark in my notebook incoming questions <br><ul><li>  Is there a corporate identity? </li><li>  If they already had a website, we ask what they are not comfortable with. </li><li>  What are their visual expectations / ideas about the future project?  Let them try to describe with adjectives what a sensation the site should bring to the visitor. </li><li>  What kind of audience (if there is enough foreign accent, then you can say ‚Äútargeting group‚Äù) will the site have? </li><li>  What should the visitor see when entering the site?  By priorities?  (For example, first product image, then service # 1, then news, then service # 2) </li><li>  What is the amount of content.  Who will do the filling?  (there were cases when the work on the content took much longer than the work on the site).  If we are in what condition materials?  Are the texts adapted, is the translation needed, in what condition are photographic materials (is photo correction needed (most likely needed))? </li><li>  Support - do they have a specially trained live person who will be engaged in updating the site after the work is completed.  Here it must be said that ‚Äúbased on experience, all the same arise constantly after the site is commissioned, the client has questions, improvements that require professional intervention.  Therefore, we usually draw up a support agreement for a year, an inexpensive one - about __-___ euros per month, and then the client can extend the refusal at will. Naturally, technical assignment questions or errors are fixed free of charge.  " </li><li>  As for promotion, I usually don‚Äôt promise anything, we can say that we are conducting initial search engine optimization, we prescribe keywords, we register in about 300 directories, but we don‚Äôt guarantee the conclusion on which particular position.  If there is a promotion partner, let them work with it. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  The client usually asks questions about the studio.  These answers should be enough. </h3><br>  Stories about our Studio <br><ul><li>  work number of years </li><li>  first project - such </li><li>  From large projects - such </li><li>  Number of people - THIS IS MUCH. </li><li>  Office - Address </li><li>  Over your project will work 5 people.  Designer coder 2 programmers and me.  Or 2 designers and 1 programmer). </li></ul><br><h3>  Payment </h3><br>  Normal payment scheme 25% - 60% - 15% <br>  prepayment - 25% <br>  after accepting a design and signing an act of accepting a design - 60% <br>  at the end - 15% <br>  <i>The scheme is designed to ensure that at any time of the termination of the contract for any reason - we were not in the red</i> <br>  The scheme of work is as follows. <br><ul><li>  We coordinate the estimates / terms </li><li>  We prepare TZ, we coordinate. </li><li>  We sign the contract </li><li>  We take prepayment - 25 - 30% </li><li>  The design work is usually as follows.  We make the first basic layout of the site design (usually title) <br><ul><li>  If you like everything, but do not like something - we adjust it to the satisfaction.  Then we develop the rest of the page templates. </li><li>  In case you do not like AT ALL, we are doing a completely new layout with a new modular grid in a new style.  We hand over again. <br>  If the second layout does not pass, it means that the client is clinical and it‚Äôs easier to disperse here - we break the contract, we keep the prepayment.  If it does, see point one.  We put a deuce to the manager) - did not see the clinic, or he incorrectly explained the task to the designer. </li></ul><br></li><li>  After we sign the act of accepting the design, we sign the layouts. </li><li>  Layout </li><li>  Programming </li><li>  Testing and Filling </li><li>  Transfer to the customer's server. </li><li>  Registration in search engines and directories </li><li>  Support (above) </li><li>  After meeting <br>  It is highly desirable to write a letter to the client ‚Äúaccording to the results of the meeting‚Äù, where to summarize everything they were talking about so that no one would forget and distort anything.  A copy on the client and on themselves and on the studio, so that was something to remember. </li></ul><br>  Then we make an estimate and TZ - see the steps of communication with the client.  If you forgot something, write edits. <br>  <i>(until the end, actions are based on real events)</i> <br>  if you like it, I'll write further down the list and estimate <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45543/</a></p>
