At the time when this idea occurred to me, I studied the anatomy and physiology of the journals ‚ÄúThe Human Body.  Outside and inside, ‚Äùwell, at work I did stereo-vario photos (for those who don't know, there were Soviet-style calendar cards with a ribbed surface, where the picture either looked voluminous or changed).  So, one evening I had a great idea that I have been using for 4 years to maintain my vision. <br>  <b>I promise you will feel the effect right away!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Causes of blurred vision </h4><br><br>  There are 2 theories why a person's eyesight deteriorates.  In my opinion and in my experience both of them have a place <br><br><h5>  The lens of the eye and ciliary muscles </h5><br>  To begin, take a look at why vision deteriorates: <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Myopia</a> - corrected with a biconcave (reducing) lens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a7/258/167/1a7258167b22b03967b41e5191dd58db.svg" alt="image">

I want to say only one thing: due to the uneven load on the muscles, some of them spasm, and either change the shape of the eyeball (and even then, during normal operation of the lens and ciliary muscles, the same picture is obtained as in the images above) <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/9b8/031/6329b803197a6ccfc44dfecdcf780c2f.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  or simply ‚Äúlead the eye to the side‚Äù - when you look at the monitor screen, both eyes look at one closely spaced point, and therefore only that muscle (medial) works, which turns / slashes the eye closer to the nose bridge.  When you look into the distance, both eyes look exactly straight.  So when you try to look into the distance after a long work at the computer, your eyes can not look exactly right because of a spasm of the medial muscle. <br><br><h4>  Method itself </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/b72/2ed/1bab722ed62c8f49200d7cae2473a427.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  I don‚Äôt know if someone could have done something like this before me, but this is my idea, never looked at anything.  It looks simple: a plate with pairs of balls, a figure is written on each of the balls. <br><br><h5>  How to use </h5><br>  Download and print the <a href="">plate</a> .  There are 3 files in the archive.  One table is immediately ready for printing (table_done.doc), in another (table.doc) - a macro, by changing the parameters of which you can change the appearance of the table for specific needs (hereinafter - more) and the third (table_done.pdf) - pdf (very convenient use on tablet).  Print and hang the table on the wall at eye level.  Stand at a distance of about 30 cm from her and try to combine pairs of balls into one ball.  In other words, each eye should look at a separate ball.  The principle <a href="">is the same as in such pictures</a> .  As soon as you managed to combine the top pair into one ball - go down below.  So try to go down as low as possible.  With each new step down, relax the muscles of the lens, making the image blurry as ‚Äúin gauss‚Äù (to achieve this effect, look as if through a sheet into the distance), but not disconnected. <br>  So go up and go down a few times.  Recently, I have been using this tablet on my tablet - very convenient and always at hand.  The only thing - I turn down the screen brightness to a minimum. <br><br><h6>  Some clarifications and notes </h6><br>  There is a famous exercise of changing the focus of view when you look at a point on a window, and then you look at a point somewhere far away.  Here is the principle, BUT!  If you descend to the lowest pair of balls, your eyes will literally separate to the sides, relaxing the medial, and training the lateral muscle.  In addition, because of this force-relaxation, the ciliary muscle of the lens also reflexively relaxes. <br><br>  About the macro and its parameters.  I assumed that if the balls would increase or decrease with each new step, it would be more effective for short-sighted or far-sighted people, but I failed to test my hypothesis - there are no people willing to study regularly.  Try it!  It may be possible to fix the damaged eyesight.  It will not be worse for sure (I checked it on myself for 3 years - I never wore glasses, my vision is excellent, I sit at the computer for hours for <s>days</s> ) <br><br>  And finally, additional quick blinking in a minute, and circular eye movements will also be helpful.  Everything! <br><br>  <b>UPD1: Fixed a</b> bug: lateral and not lateral <br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Due to the fact that it turns out there is still a "cross-viewing."  The picture clearly illustrates.  In order to understand how you look, you need to combine any pair of balls into one and close your left eye.  If you look at the right ball with the right one, then you are doing everything right, if you look at the left one, then your ‚Äútechnique‚Äù is wrong!  The right eye should look at the right ball, left to the left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/991/604/1bb/9916041bb07c4712896abbda7a4293e7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> People with congenital myopia better not to be zealous.  Try it, but do not overdo it.  Congenital myopia or farsightedness is either the curved shape of the eyeball initially or something with a lens (shape, elasticity).  If congenital poor eyesight has deteriorated over the years, this could be partly due to muscle spasm, then this technique may be of some help. <br>  <b>UPD4: Perezalil</b> archive in zip and transliterated file names <br>  <b>UPD5:</b> There is an <a href="">application</a> for android (it was removed from the play market, because it was made on an outdated version of apache cordova, and there is no time to redo it) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142096/</a></p>
