  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little about the prices in freelance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It often happens that you need to make a website, many go to web studios, but some prefer to find a freelancer who does everything for cheap.  My conclusions regarding prices for work, which, of course, may vary from country to country, city to city, but the overall picture is as follows: <br><ul><li>  <b>&lt;$ 150</b> is a newbie who is trying to pull out a hack.  As a rule, a student, as a rule, he will not do the work.  Why?  Because it is not clear that the front of the upcoming work represents coordination and a bunch of nuances, that is why it will throw this thing halfway through.  The pros are dubious, the downsides are the loss of time and nerves. <br></li><li>  <b>$ 300- $ 400</b> for an uncomplicated project - a novice is more experienced, or a semi-pro.  Work is done, but languidly and slowly.  Often the sign is a rather impressive work schedule.  If time does not burn - the best option.  Pros - in principle, cheap (compared with the studios), cons - a long time. <br></li><li>  <b>&gt; ~ $ 1000</b> .  Here are sitting <s>pros intelligent</s> people, or scammers.  With such people it is necessary to conclude an agreement before you do the project, an intelligent <s>pros</s> - will sign without hesitation, throwing - will run away.  Work is done on schedule and rarely serious delays.  The TZ is compiled, the accompanying documentation and other whistles are written.  As a rule, the quality is high and even better than in studios for the same money.  Pros - quality, timing, responsibility.  Cons - the risk of running into a scam is relatively expensive. <br></li></ul><br>  The observations are made on the basis of the experience of communication with ‚Äúfree programmers‚Äù and personal practice of freelancing.  The multiplier to each price category increases in proportion to the approach to Europe (USA) in terms of living standards and to large cities.  Prices in the description roughly correspond to Minsk, in Moscow more expensive at least 2 times. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Judging by how my karma fell, many people did not like this kind of analysis.  Under the cat: <a name="habracut"></a>  I can add unless it is a purely subjective assessment, which is REALLY observed in practice, at least in Minsk and Moscow.  Many times I met with unscrupulous performers and almost all dumped prices for work exactly as it was said above.  Gentlemen, the principle is simple: if you value your time, work efficiently and in good faith, then you know the price for yourself and your work and you are unlikely to sit down to write a project for $ 150 including design.  This is unprofitable if you do not have specific reasons (for example, a student who is chronically short of beer).  In this post, I'm not talking about the principles of working with a client or about the personal ambitions of a performer who wants over 9000 money and quickly.  There is a market, there is demand and competition.  It‚Äôs possible to make hack-work for 100 bucks and disappear quickly and quickly, but correctly it takes time to paint everything, and a competent person will not work ‚Äúfor food‚Äù unless absolutely necessary.  Another question is how to recognize who is who?  The first assessment, as a rule, at the proposed cost of execution both in the store and in the development services market. </div>
