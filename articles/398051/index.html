      In order to find out whether a person can live longer than his ancestors, scientists at Albert Einstein College of Medicine from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">Yeshiva University,</a> under the guidance of Xiao Dong, analyzed data that was taken from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). <br><br>  Experts have suggested that if a person‚Äôs longevity limit has not yet been reached, then over time, with improved living conditions, the age of long-livers will rise.  Therefore, an analysis was conducted of the age of residents of several wealthy countries, including Sweden.  It turned out that in the last century, almost nothing has changed here.  In 1860, for example, the oldest person in this country died at the age of 101.  And in 1990 - in 108 years.  According to scientists, the maximum life expectancy in this country was achieved in the 1980s, and since then nothing has changed. <br><br>  In addition to Sweden, the indicators of the maximum life expectancy in countries such as Japan, the USA, France and England were analyzed.  These countries are leaders in the number of long-livers.  As it turned out, most of all other people lived Zhanna Kalman.  Her age at death was 122 years.  This is the officially registered maximum human lifespan. <br><br>  After additional analysis of the collected data, scientists found that the maximum life expectancy over the past 20 years has not only not increased, but even decreased.  So, from 1968 to 1994 this figure grew by 0.15 years each year.  But from 1995 to 2006, life expectancy decreased every year by 0.26 years.  ‚ÄúBiologists and other scientists are somehow convinced that there is no reason to think that we have reached the maximum life expectancy.  But our data suggests that this has already happened, and back in the 90s of the last century, ‚Äùsays <a href="">Jan Vijg</a> , one of the research participants. <br><br>  Scientists have shown that the average maximum life expectancy for a man of our time is 115 years. <br><br>  Gerontology tells us that the life span of a living organism is very different from species to species.  Inside the form, this indicator is always about the same.  Without diseases and attacks of predators, the life expectancy of a single species grows.  But this indicator does not increase infinitely.  For example, a mouse in calm conditions can live for about three years, dogs of different species live to 10-15 years.  People in different countries live up to 65-95 years.  The probability of exceeding the age of a particular person at 125 years old in any year is less than one per 10 thousand cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/644/376/ce5/644376ce5d548cc6b00ee3e35a68d7f1.jpg"><br><br>  "Further development of medicine and the fight against infectious and chronic diseases can increase the average life expectancy, but not the maximum," say the authors of the study.  ‚ÄúIt is possible that some new methods will increase this indicator, but this will require overcoming the‚Äú opposition ‚Äùof some genes.‚Äù  Jay Olshansky of the University of Illinois in Chicago <a href="https://books.google.es/books%3Fisbn%3D0393245888">says</a> that genetics is like a time bomb.  He compares the genes with explosives, which the manufacturer puts into the car so that the explosives destroy the car after it travels a million miles. <br><br>  Last year, researchers from the Buck Institute and the University of Washington completed a ten-year study.  The project was aimed at studying the issue of aging.  Studying yeast, scientists managed to get a list of 238 different genes, the removal of which, as it turned out, prolongs the life of cells.  The maximum increase in life, which was achieved by scientists - 60%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe study looked at aging processes in the context of the entire genome and gives us a more complete picture of what aging is as such,‚Äù <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-map-genes-that-extend-life-by-as-much-as-60-percent-if-deleted">said</a> Brian Kennedy, president and executive director of the United States Institute for Aging Research (The Buck Institute for Research on Aging). <br><br>  And this year, specialists from the University of East Anglia <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160330211029.htm">began a</a> large-scale project aimed at predicting the duration of human life.  Predictions are made after analyzing volunteer data.  To make a forecast, information is needed, in particular, on chronic human diseases. <br><br>  Scientists investigate not only the life expectancy of people, but also <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/airbnb/blog/242246/">try to understand</a> what consequences a gradual increase in life expectancy may have. <br><br>  An interesting fact <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277302/">is</a> that the types of aging in nature are very diverse.  There are many varieties of them, and this, according to experts, may indicate that nature can turn aging on and off and, consequently, death from old age.  Whether this statement is true or not - only time and additional research will show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398051/</a></p>
