      Intel engineers will hold <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-at-KRI-2010/">seven sessions</a> in which they will share information from Intel's first hands.  Says the company's engineer, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/69549/">Victoria Zhislina</a> : <br><br>  <i>In the report The SIMDsons talk about the future - I will tell you about the new, 12th version of the Intel compiler, which is just coming.</i>  <i>This is an extremely interesting topic - how to optimize your applications, especially without straining?</i> <br><br>  <i>My second session is about Intel's integrated graphics;</i>  <i>It's always interesting to talk about iron, because it‚Äôs a thing in itself, and visitors have a chance to ask me some burning questions.</i>  <i>This CWI will discuss our new Intel HD Graphics adapter, which allows you to watch high-definition video and accelerate hardware in it.</i> <br><br>  A substantial part of the reports will deal with the new mobile platform MeeGo, because MeeGo will be used as a basic platform for set-top boxes, portable Internet devices, embedded car electronics and so on.  Vadim Sukhomlinov will hold a seminar on developing applications for mobile devices on the Intel Atom platform: graphics, social networks, power consumption and various non-standard use of gadgets: <br><br>  <i>Just imagine if a person is driving in a car, he sees an electronic scoreboard with the words ‚Äúsend SMS and download a new movie‚Äù, sends an SMS, and the mobile operator understands that this is the subscriber who is connected to broadband internet at home where he has the prefix installed based on the platform of Intel, which pre-downloads this film in high resolution.</i>  <i>Then the user comes home, takes a tablet based on Intel Atom and puts it in the kitchen like a photo frame, and then quietly dines and watches a movie that has already been downloaded and transmitted wirelessly directly from the set top box.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/71512/">Philip Gerasimov will</a> present the highlight of the program, Intel Graphics Performance Analyzer 3.0: <br><br>  <i>Our main presentations will be about the new version of GPA and how leading developers use this product to optimize their applications.</i>  <i>In the new version, a tool appears that is designed not even to optimize the graphic parts of the application, but to optimize a multi-threaded algorithm on the central processor.</i>  <i>This is a rather revolutionary product that visualizes the work of threads across all processor cores and makes it very convenient to see how parallelized your application is and where you can increase parallelization.</i>  <i>In addition, we have real stories, including our developers, which we would like to tell you about - how this product really helped speed up the work of already released games.</i>  <i>One of our leading partners is the well-known company GSC Game World, the developers of Stalker, in addition, we will describe how the GPA helped to optimize such a popular game as Firaxis's Civilization V.</i> <br><br>  As you can see, GPA is used by such indisputable authorities as Firaxis and GSC Game World - it‚Äôs absolutely impossible to miss these sessions with Intel engineers!  But that's not all! <br><br>  A specially trained team of <a href="http://www.topmods.net/">TopMods</a> modders at the Intel booth will demonstrate a specialized version of the machine based on the Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition and hold a fun quiz.  Also on the stand will be the Asus Republic of Gamers laptop, equipped with the latest six-core Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition 980x processor and fully ready to reproduce three-dimensional images.  Explains Vlad Nikonov: <br><br>  <i>Core i7 EE processors plug into slot 1366, which is supported by the top-end Intel X58 chipset.</i>  <i>This is practically the only chipset that allows two video cards to operate in PCI-E X16 mode each.</i>  <i>In addition, it allows you to simultaneously connect two ATI Radeon video cards using Crossfire technology, as well as two NVIDIA video cards using SLI technology.</i> <br><img src="http://ru.asus.com/websites/global/products/8je5Ot4HBnKOdT81/P_500.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But that's not all!  Of course, visitors to the Intel booth are waiting for gifts, quizzes and prizes!  Follow us on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/intelrussia">twitter.com/intelrussia</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/intelsoftwareru">twitter.com/intelsoftwareru</a> , where we will be telling in real time what is happening in the Hotel Cosmos, as well as participate in a quiz and possibly a netbook provided by partner Asus, a gaming mouse or the Razer game pad will be yours :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb8/285/c4b/bb8285c4b2cb57e3636aa6ee87aaf67d.png" alt="quiz winner prize"><br><br>  Total: fantastic sessions from the very depths of Intel and the lips of beautiful young engineers, overclocking the latest processors, souvenirs and new useful acquaintances! <br><br>  The post is written by Chipman, a permanent resident of the Intel Galaxy, especially for habrahabr :) And I personally, I will be glad to answer questions and meet with you at KRI.  Come - it will be great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93252/</a></p>
