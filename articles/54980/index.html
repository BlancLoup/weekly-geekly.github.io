  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu 9.04 Alpha</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Browsing the Internet I came across the first reviews about ubuntu 9.04, and ext4.  I liked the reviews, so without hesitation, I downloaded the distribution, saved some spare time (ubunt is not a stable distribution at all, and then there is an alpha), and sat down to install. <br><br><h4>  first impressions </h4><br>  Installation, and setting up everything that I need for daily work took only 1 hour, although I mounted a ready-made home directory in which, as you know, configuration files are saved. <br>  Download as they say on the Internet has become much faster (personally, I have 2 times).  The truth for this was to put ext4, which I advise you not to put people who do not have a laptop or UPS. <br>  Work in general was also an order of magnitude faster, began to recall the speed of version 7.04, which pleased me even more than the load, because  the laptop is quite normal and the ‚Äúsmoothness‚Äù of version 8.10 annoyed me, although the same XP worked smartly. <br>  Stability is basically at the level, it is even surprising that the alpha, and even Ubunt, lives so well.  Although it was not without jambs, but more on that later. <br>  The translation was not complete (somewhere 80-90% translated) <br><br><h4>  Innovations </h4><br>  At a quick glance I noticed one new convenient and necessary thing: System-Administration-Computer Janitor <br>  (cleaning the system, from the old libraries) Convenient, but for some reason even the OpenOffice from Infra is highlighted, which I use <br><img src="http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/4700/janitor.png" alt="image"><br>  Worth openoffice 3.0 out of the box <br>  FS ext4 (during installation it is barely noticeable due to the fact that the only FS that is written in English) <br>  I didn‚Äôt notice anything useful = (

    <h4>  BUGs </h4><br>  1) I did not check Alpha 6, but I died on Alpha 5 when installing virtualbox-ose-guest hal <br>  2) On Alpha 6, after updating ubuntu-desktop, the gnome-panel has died.  and did not want to put, because  I demanded a new library, which is not in the repositories, I found it in nete, installed it, but still did not help, just deleted the new version of ubuntu-desktop and installed the old one. <br>  3) The sound from the built-in speakers still does not work, although everything is normal with headphones. <br>  4) There is no 3D acceleration on an ATI card (I have a Radeon HD 3450).  I tried all the firewood which I found in the repositories.  On the irc channel, ubuntu-ru suggested that ATI cards will work only in the release, I found confirmation of this on the Internet, so you just have to wait. <br>  5) Curve display of characters (including figures) in openoffice <br>  6) during the installation from the Alternative version disk (Not LiveCD), you can enter the name displayed on the network, the nickname and real name are the same, after that (I think) sudo did not work (sudoers did not have a record of my user), Edit sudoers did not lead to anything, the court earned, but the user remained not an administrator.  Helped reinstall the system. <br>  7) it was impossible to update orca, due to the fact that it could not connect to the repository via ip, it is strange that this only concerned this file.  I just deleted this package, so as not to suffer, the sense is still from him 0 for me. <br><br><h4>  ext4 </h4><br>  Good FS turned out to be true, although it does not tolerate interruptions in electricity.  Files running to write during system shutdown (power outages) are likely to be damaged.  That is why I do not recommend using it for those who do not have a laptop, or if there is no UPS. <br><br>  Conclusion: Fast, fairly stable, in general, a good version will be if they fix all these bugs. <br>  We are waiting for April and update boldly, you will not regret it;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54980/</a></p>
