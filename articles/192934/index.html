Everywhere there is something unimaginable.  Scandal for scandal, revelation for revelation, law for law.  The situation is only getting worse.  The masses rage.  The wave of discontent has come to an apolitical Habr.  We are discussing the hated law of arbitrary locks, copywriting of all stripes.  Heroes of Snowden, Assange and Navalny.  Dirty on hand intelligence and total surveillance. <br>  I hid for a long time, tried to keep silent, but now when respected people, childhood idols such as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/192852/">Bruce Schneier</a> , took part in this madness, I have to open people's eyes and discuss what is really important. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Flying red lights </h4><br>  For the first time the message about the mysterious red lights came from the small town of St. Augustine, Florida April 19, 2008.  Brandon Pakkett, 12, and his mother, Laura, said they saw two unidentified objects flying at the same speed over the coastline and disappearing.  The objects were shaped like balloons and glowed with bright red-orange light.  Several neighbors in the same area confirmed that they saw the same objects.  Skeptics claimed that a group of people were lucky to see Chinese lanterns in the sky.  The authorities enthusiastically hooked on this theory.  And they would be able to safely shut up this uncomfortable topic for them if the red lights did not appear again.

      On April 20, 2008, several residents of Deer Valley, Arizona, reported red lights in the sky.  Anne Ryman, a reporter for the Arizona Republic newspaper, who lives in Deer Valley, spoke about the observations of four lights, combined into a quadrilateral shape, which later became triangular.  The lights moved east and disappeared one by one.  Are there Chinese lanterns again?  Perhaps if the latter can perform aerobatics. <br><br>  Be that as it may, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stop up eyewitnesses.  One of the inhabitants of northern Phoenix said that he saw four or five red glowing balls, lined up, and then scattered in the side.  The lights slowly moved eastward, becoming dimmer.  He said that the last ball remained in the sky for a long time, until three jet fighters appeared from the west, following in the same direction as the red lights. <br><br>  Reports of strange red lights began to come from all over the world.  Mysterious red lights were seen in the skies over Germany, Great Britain, the Republic of South Africa, and of course over Russia.  On the same day, when a 12-year-old boy from St. Augustine and his mother became an eyewitness to an unusual phenomenon, residents of the town of Pushkino watched something similar to what was reported by the independent television channel NTV. <br><br>  From the above, a disappointing conclusion follows.  We, the inhabitants of the planet Earth, have long been under total observation.  And this observation is not carried out by the FSB, not MI5, and not even the NSA.  We are followed by a highly developed, alien race. <br>  All the actions of the governments of the world indicate that they are well aware of this and are trying to hide the facts from the civilian population. <br><br>  The wars in the Persian Gulf, the nuclear weapons of North Korea, the excesses of the special services, the restriction of the constitutional right to freedom of information, exposing individuals close to the special services.  All, all this is nothing more than a trick, a deception.  The sole purpose of which is to divert people's minds from something more terrible, something more incomprehensible. <br>  I urge you, yes, it is you <b>%% username%</b> , not to be led by the government.  Look at the world from a different angle, drop everything that seems so important now, and the truth will be revealed to you. <br><br>  Instead of angry discussions of absurd laws, I urge to prepare, perhaps, for the most important event in history.  Humanity needs you!  Tell the truth to everyone you know.  Because when THEY come, everyone will be important to the Earth.  We must unite, and no government will prevent us from doing so.  I urge you to be ready either to protect our world from invaders, or to welcome teachers who have returned to teach grown children. <br><br>  This is the League of Independent Humanity, there is no destiny except the one that we create ourselves. <br><br>  <i>PS I ask you to consider all of the above as nothing more than a call to treat life easier, and not to get upset over trifles.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>PPS just in case I remind you that on Habr√© there is no blog Humor for a long time and we lack it greatly.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192934/</a></p>
