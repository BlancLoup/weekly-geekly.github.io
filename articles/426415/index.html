And development is very poorly controlled, so the Central Bank decided to take control of the digitalization of the banking sector.  In order for the control to be real, and not for the sake of a tick, you will have to use new technologies, including big data analysis. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Digitalization of finance is a process that is proceeding very quickly, and we believe that those financial institutions that are not able to go through the digital revolution in time are at risk of being left behind.  The speed of this process is great - it's not 10 years, not 15, but about 5 years, </blockquote>  - Said Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank Vasily Pozdyshev.

      As for the robot, it will be a specialized service based on AI and big data analysis, which will monitor the conduct of various transactions, analyze model solutions in banks and supervise them.  In general, the transition to electronic interaction with government agencies, financial market participants and customers will continue. <br><br><h3>  We pay with bracelets and keyrings </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/bn/wk/lzbnwkihklr1ifghu_kidy59i3g.jpeg"><br><br>  The other day it became <a href="https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D3070297%26cid%3D7">known</a> that the Russians will be able to pay with ‚ÄúMir‚Äù cards using bracelets and trinkets.  The main role here is played by contactless technology, which provides the possibility of payment, for example, travel by public transport or shopping in a store without a PIN code.  True, the amount of such a transaction should be limited and not exceed 1 thousand rubles. <br><br>  You will not need to present the card itself - users will be able to use specialized accessories with an integrated payment system chip.  Bracelets and keyrings work in the same way as the contactless card itself. <br><br><blockquote>  Our task is to provide banks with proven technologies, and the choice of customer categories and the type of form factor [key ring or bracelet] will be decided by the banks themselves, </blockquote>  - Said the press service. <br><br>  According to the authors of the project, the use of bracelets and keyrings will significantly speed up the process of paying for purchases.  On the other hand, accessories can be lost, which will lead to their use by fraudsters. <br><br><h3>  Mining tax </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/zk/yy/phzkyympivf9myvqsdmunxbgauw.jpeg"><br><br>  According <a href="https://ria.ru/economy/20181004/1529949710.html">to the</a> deputy Anatoly Aksakov, mining is a profitable business, which means that a legal field is needed for this type of business.  At the same time, mining should be taxed as a special type of business, for which the term ‚Äúmining‚Äù will be prescribed in the law <a href="http://duma.gov.ru/news/27027/">‚ÄúOn digital financial assets‚Äù</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Mining should be taxed, because there is such a type of business, people earn money, many earn good money, taxes must be paid accordingly, </blockquote>  - Aksakov sure. <br><br>  The Russian association of cryptoindustry and blockchain has already managed to comment on this proposal.  According to experts, the taxation of miners should occur at the point of exchange of cryptocurrency for fiat money. <br><br>  Until now, there was no regulation of the blockchain industry in Russia.  The legal status of mining and ICO is not defined.  True, in June of this year, the State Duma adopted in first reading a package of cryptocurrency bills.  The second reading is scheduled for autumn 2018. <br><br><h3>  Wages in cryptocurrency - who is ready? </h3><br>  A few days ago, the Superjob Research Center <a href="https://forklog.com/issledovanie-1-rossiyan-hotyat-poluchat-zarplatu-v-bitkoine/">presented the</a> results of the survey, the topic of which is the readiness of Russians to receive wages in cryptocurrency.  As it turned out, such as only 1%.  The survey was conducted with the participation of 1600 respondents in 288 localities of Russia. <br><br>  According to representatives of the center, since the beginning of the year, the interest of Russians in cryptocurrency has significantly decreased.  In January, about 75% of respondents said that they would not want to receive payment for their labor in Bitcoin.  In April, 79% of respondents said this, in October - 83%. <br><br>  About to receive in the cryptocurrency of the salary, said 5%.  It is worth noting that in January, 18% of those surveyed under the age of 24 declared their readiness to receive part of their salary in Bitcoin; in October, the percentage of those willing to drop to 8%. <br><br>  In addition, the report showed a gradual increase in awareness of Russians in the field of cryptocurrency. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426415/</a></p>
