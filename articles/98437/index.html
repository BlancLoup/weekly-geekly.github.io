It would seem that one could continue to rejoice at this fact, as the outflow of users began, connected with the (real?) Threat to be those whom they are going to hand over to some authorities at any suitable moment. <br><br>  I, being already many years Premium user of Rapidshare, first thought about how to fold fishing rods and look for an alternative.  And I did not have time to deal with the new rules and tariffs, as this morning I received another letter from Liebe Kundin with the proposals of the newest rules for using the service. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Habrahabr had a lot of news on this topic and community representatives are watching what is happening.  For example, you can recall the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/89723/">news about the attempt to legalize the Rapidshare service</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/lenta/88785/">declare war on the pirates</a> or how Rapidshare destroys its satellites, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/domains/92074/">taking domains from them</a> , etc.

      All these news were interpreted by us at Habr√© almost unanimously, as ‚Äúapproaching the end‚Äù of such a powerful service, which, having grown rich on the transfer of illegal content, suddenly decided to legalize and voluntarily change all pirates into clients, and those who do not agree will ban them information about them (IP addresses, download history and account numbers) to the respective services. <br><br>  In this context, I especially like the phrase on the Rapidshare website, where it is written that ‚Äúa <i>magazine with IP addresses of users and information about downloaded and downloaded files is kept in case of possible legal proceedings,‚Äù the site management reports.</i>  <i>‚ÄúClients who want to challenge this decision can ask their lawyer for help</i> .‚Äù  It is like a pimp taking pictures of clients just in case he has problems with the authorities ... <br><br>  So what happens? <br><br>  I remembered here that the excitement and panic around the Rapidshare service has already happened more than once, however, I don‚Äôt remember something (and I can be wrong) so that they have a real development. <br><br>  Remember, a couple of years ago there was a drawing of a computer, something like Intel Core 2 Quad Extreme, good nVidia GeForce 8800 graphics, etc.?  I remember that I almost left my data and address in order to bring this outlandish device to my house. <br><br>  Then it went on the Internet here is this picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25c/fac/045/25cfac045102af9dc1e61a409d682fef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We read in the news that the fight against pirates began through the actions of drawing prizes.  It is one thing to identify offenders by IP addresses, another when the offender himself sends all his address data, etc.  They just need to look through your file storage and send pirated software agents to you to the house (at the address you specified), who will present you a fine for a tidy sum and not pay them to places not so remote.  Then the excitement was asleep and there was no information about whether there were raids or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec0/8f6/c66/ec08f6c66ca8ee98c2a8a653e7ecd2b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, we also watched another lottery, where it was proposed to participate, laying for tickets for 50 RapidPoints.  The more RapidPoints you have - the greater the chance to win.  I saw the news, where it was written about the same thing as in the draw with the computer, only in this case, especially large offenders were tracked, because  more RapidPoints for those who transfer content more.  In other words, not to waste time on trifles in order, on a large scale, to set up an exemplary demonstration of spanking, so that others would not be in danger. <br><br>  However, to be honest, I do not remember any continuation: neither the winners of the competition, nor raids, nor court proceedings with clients (excuse me, pirates) Rapidshare.  I sometimes read foreign press, but such information did not slip past me. <br><br>  And today we are again observing activity around this service, but I would not call it a rush, but rather a panic.  At least, a letter from Liebe Kundin confirms this in part: <br><br>  " <i>As a result of recent changes and adjustments to our services and pricing models, we received a lot of feedback from our users. There was also a positive response, but we want to be honest with you: most of the answers were negative. <b>With our settings, many users began to flow out</b> . As itself Of course, it wasn‚Äôt our intention. Our goal is to implement a system that gives you more flexibility. However, we welcome every user who sent the answer that we received, because this is the only way to know what</i>  <i>Our users want it. That's the reason why we have completely revised our policy and suggest that you once again make it much easier</i> . " <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.rapidshare.com/news.html">link</a> can be found with the next set of tricky terms, which, I think, the situation will not be corrected. <br><br>  As long as they have a warning on the site about their readiness to surrender their clients, no sensible client (pirate) will renew their accounts and develop a retreat plan so that, just in case, not to reprimand. <br><br>  And finally.  I have heard more than once the opinion that some groups of investors have specially launched such a project as Rapidshare, so that at a certain moment (when everything is ready), it should crash and punish an impressive part of the pirate community that is on the hook with it.  So they want to end piracy once and for all.  However, this opinion is not yet popular and can become another accordion, but what is obvious is that piracy will take on new forms, become more cunning and prudent to stay afloat. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98437/</a></p>
