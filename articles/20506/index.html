Relatively because there are thousands of recorders in the world.  On the other hand, only a couple of good dozens.  When I say good, I don't mean trouble-free.  Almost any registrar may seem that way.  It is more about reliability and services offered.  In any case, it is better to keep your investments (and the domains in my concept are investments, and often long-term is better where many other investors already do. <br><br>  And now about where I prefer to do it myself and why.

      <a href="http://zloj.com/moniker.php">moniker</a> - everything is simple here.  <strong>The best and most reliable recorder.</strong>  All that is more expensive than a couple of hundred dollars I keep from them.  Excellent service, reliability, very fast caliper.  In addition, most of the issues affecting amounts in excess of 5,000 are solved directly by their CEO, Monte Cahn.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAISE48hQhp8">Here</a> you can see who it is and to whom you trust the safety of your portfolio.  I already had problems with the domain, which cost 25,000.  And these problems were solved within 3 hours from the filing of the application to the support.  Recommend!  (In addition, they can register a lot of exotic extensions). <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/dynadot.php">dynadot</a> - My second choice among registrars. Partly because they can have IDNs (international domain names like <a href="http://www.xn--g1aefm.com/">www.block.com</a> ).  In addition, they have relatively nice prices + a great, very user-friendly interface and it loads everything very quickly.  If you use my - <em>7x8K7WB7o7451</em> code - get a discount. <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/godaddy.php">godaddy</a> is probably the largest registrar.  Since when I came to the magical world of earning on domains.  Actually, I am grateful to him.  But due to the fact that they are very big and thick, there is a problem of endless waiting for the response of the support to your requests.  In addition, there were several cases when people had to return stolen domains for half a year.  And only after numerous letters to the owner ( <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">Bob Parsons</a> ).  And in general, one should carefully work with companies whose owners wear brunettes in their ears.  :-) <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/eurodns.php">eurodns</a> is the only euro registrar I use.  You can register almost all domains in the eurozone (.nl, .de, .se, .dk, .fr).  Be careful, some countries require local presence, or other additional actions.  Enough reliable recorder.  Recommend! <br><br>  Perhaps these are all the recorders that you may need in most cases.  If you have additional questions - write. <br><br>  <strong>What mistakes you should try to avoid at the beginning</strong> <br><br>  When I started this business quite by accident in April 2006 (by chance, because I saw the start of selling domains in the .eu zone and registered one for an offline business. Before that, I bought domains for 1 per year for my projects, not more) and I registered about 200 .eu domains, and after that another 300-400 .com during the week, I thought I had made millions automatically.  And that my domains bestshoes.eu or youcars.com cost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars.  As it turned out, only I thought so.  :-) Subsequently, I simply did not extend most of these domains.  But I learned my lesson. <br><ul><li>  At first, do not register many domains.  No matter how confident you are in their value, in 99.9% of cases, they will cost you only for you, and those who are engaged in this business will not give for your domains and as much as you paid. </li><li>  Register on specialized forums and actively consult with those who understand this. </li><li>  Be sure to enter a budget for registration.  (Expensive domains are not worth buying for the first six months - a year without the help of investment specialists in this area). </li></ul><br>  What should be done: <br><ol><li>  Read a lot </li><li>  Study the market </li><li>  Think outside the box </li><li>  Search for generic domains (generic domains that make sense in sequential spelling, the domain must exactly repeat the word pronunciation sequence) for example: cars.com, exoticcars.com, usedcarsonline.com </li><li>  Get acquainted with people who have already reached the heights in this matter, and unobtrusively consult from time to time </li></ol><br>  What not to do: <br><ol><li>  Register anything </li><li>  Register keywords in narrow areas (the fact that ‚Äúcheap tickets‚Äù are very good words does not mean that verycheaptickets.fm has any value </li><li>  To think that you will sell the newly registered domain very soon. </li><li>  Trying to put up your fresh failed registrations on ebay for thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars (not a ride) </li><li>  Try to trick to sell domains on the forums (giving the left data on traffic and profits).  ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù a penny, but never restore your reputation. </li><li>  To be offended by specialists who destroy your dreams with their 1 dollar estimate of your domain, which you thought is worth 10,000.  Moreover, you should not be nervous and try to insult them.  :-) </li></ol><br>  <strong>Where to park domains, traffic types</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br><br>  First of all, I will make a reservation right away.  Parking without traffic domains is absolutely pointless.  Simply, no one will click on advertising, there will be no earnings.  It‚Äôs also pointless to click on the ad, because you will be banned for 1-5 days and you will not be able to register for this name anymore. <br><br>  Therefore, consider the cases with traffic.  Traffic can be of 3 types: <br><br>  <strong>type-in ‚Äã‚Äãtraffic</strong> (the highest-quality type of traffic, as well as the most expensive), the point is that people come directly from the browser.  They write in firefox'e - zloj.com and get to the page.  Passing search engines and other links.  A big plus is that the person came for information.  So its CTR (click through rate - the ratio of clicks to the number of visitors) will be much higher than those who have already come on the links.  In addition, most of these users are from America, England, Germany and Japan.  And this is the most expensive traffic, since competition among advertisers is much higher than other countries, respectively, the clicks are also higher (your percentage of advertisers' earnings). <br><br>  <strong>expired / link traffic</strong> (narrowly targeted traffic, mostly such domains receive traffic from older domains that have not been renewed) is a relatively inexpensive (when compared with type-in) type of traffic.  Suppose I had a domain paintballshop.com, and a store on it.  People were linking to me, there was a certain PR and so on.  Then I forgot to extend it.  At the expired auction, my domain was bought and parked.  There is traffic, there are clicks = good.  Traffic decreases with time, depending on the quality of the former resource (on forums and blogs very quickly), respectively, reduced profit = bad.  The projection of long-term profit = also bad.  That is, it earns such a domain until the traffic ends and the old links are removed. <br><br>  <strong>typo traffic</strong> (well, to be confused with type-in! typo (typo - translation from English) here everything is very simple and very difficult at the same time. Traffic comes from typos of already existing sites. That is, we take youtube.com website you register.com - and we get a lot of traffic that can be monetized.We get free traffic, we have the opportunity to make a good forecast of the site development on time and register the best typos, the opportunity to join the business called the threshold of the existence of a huge market depending on the number of traffic and profits = this is all good. problems  with the owners of the original sites and TM (trademark) up to the jurisdictional cases = very bad. <br><br>  And now about the parking options.  There are two ways: google and YPN (Yahoo Publishing Network).  The first is to use google feed (adsense ads from your parking attendant).  There are pros and cons.  Of the benefits - the best opportunities if your traffic is not from (America, England, Japan, Germany or Canada).  Google is developing very successfully in Europe, and indeed in the world, so they have enough contextual advertising in the user's language (in Russia in Russian). <br><br>  Google feed uses the following valet drivers: <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/sedo.php">sedo</a> - a veteran and the largest parking attendant.  Ideal for Russian domains.  They pay not to say that much, but in many cases (for example, if you have a domain with a huge number of Russian, Romanian, Polish, Latvian and so on traffic) they pay more than others.  Very well customizable interface.  You can specify different keywords, templates and related keywords for different regions, which is very convenient.  You can park IDN domains.  How your parked domain will look like can be viewed on blue.com <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/namedrive.php">namedrive</a> is one of my first parking drivers.  Great opportunities customization.  Excellent pay for commercial traffic.  By keywords related to banks, insurance and so on.  Also support the Russian interface.  In some cases, Slavic traffic is better than sedo.  There are several excellent templates on the subject: electronics, travel, real estate, finance, ringtones.  You can park IDN.  An example can be seen here pearlofqatar.com or handyvertrage.de <br><br>  Of course there are others, but personally I use these two as the main ones if I need google feed. <br><br>  Now let's talk about Yahoo feed.  Overall, Yahoo pays more.  But there is one "but."  Only for quality traffic.  They pay much less for Slavic traffic.  Although, again, for quality American much!  more (maximum so far 12 dollars for 1 click).  Again, the business of choosing the right advertiser and parking provider. <br><br>  In general, I use only one yahoo provider. <br><br>  <a href="http://zloj.com/parked.php">parked</a> - the main difference is that by default they have a 2-page interface, which means that the user will have to click once to select a category, and then once more for advertising (though they have an exclusive 1-page interface, which they only give premium domains and, as a rule, they are generic .com).  Because of this, the CTR is lower.  Accordingly, lower earnings.  Therefore, it is necessary to analyze different templates, keywords, etc.  to find the most profitable option.  They look like this: irak.tv or allinclusivefishing.com <br><br>  From myself I can only advise that you need to experiment with all your domains and parking attendants.  Only in this way you will have your own concept of what and where to do better.  Although, again, I still sometimes wonder at completely different results from my predictions.  Although rare, but it happens. <br><br>  I‚Äôll stop on this today.  Next time I will continue with examples of registrations and results.  :-) Good luck to everyone in this difficult task. <br><br>  via <a href="http://zloj.com/">earnings on the Internet</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20506/</a></p>
