This discovery at once rejected several theories of the occurrence of BR, while adding even more mysteries to scientists. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/244568/">Fast radio pulses</a> , single pulses of several milliseconds in length, were first detected by radio astronomers in 2007. Professor Duncan Lorimer's group, in search of pulsar signals, processed the results of observations of the Australian 64-meter 64-meter radio telescope Parks.

      The signal was single, powerful, but very short.  His inspection took about five years.  Since then, several such signals have been registered, and now scientists are convinced that they cannot be attributed to interferences, malfunctions in the operation of equipment or <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/250184/">microwave ovens, in which the staff prepares food</a> .  With very high probability, the signals originate from deep space. <br><br>  There were several explanations for the nature of origin: the merging of neutron stars, the last sigh of a black hole evaporated due to Hawking radiation, the transformation of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580">blitzar</a> into a black hole, etc.  But all these explanations were invented until the moment when scientists discovered that these signals are periodic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During 2015, Laura Spitler and her colleagues registered ten similar signals emanating from a single FRB 121102 point. This object was already registered as a BR source, and astronomers decided to check it again, just in case.  The results of these measurements and <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature17168.html">studied Scholz</a> , finding in them a repeating signal. <br><br>  Interestingly, six signals came from this source within a few minutes, and the rest were distributed over weeks.  The results of observations exclude single catastrophic phenomena such as collisions of neutron stars.  It is clear that the object emitting these signals somehow changes in time. <br><br>  Scientists are inclined to believe that BRs are emitted by magnetars or pulsars, and that processes occur with them that are still unknown to science.  In addition, it is quite possible that a large difference in the frequency of signals is caused by the fact that similar signals emit different objects.  After all, the gamma-ray bursts discovered in the 1960s were also a mystery at first.  After it turned out that they are of different types, since they can be generated both by processes occurring with supernovae and by collisions of neutron stars. <br><br>  Astronomers are not inclined to blame everything on aliens - but no one forbids us to imagine that long ago, in the distant galaxy, great events took place, the signals from which we receive only now ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391379/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391379/</a></p>
