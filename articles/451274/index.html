    </i>  <i>The hidden is twisted out.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After silence and lead fraction,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And a quiet mirror in red puddles</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Will not reflect anyone's face. ”</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Daniel Andreev, 1937</i> <br><br><h3>  Giant pillars </h3><br>  What I have always loved my enemies for is the irrepressible pursuit of the goal, the frantic desire to win.  Leaving the future - light and clean generations, to judge how much blood it was necessary and worth to put on it, it is interesting to talk not about the price, but about the victory. <br><br>  Victory is achieved with some weapons - fortitude, mark shooting, brilliant plan.  The perfect weapon brings victory "on your terms", naturally and unconditionally.  How you lived, what quality weapons developed - this will be a victory. <br><br>  On the example of countries: if the weapon is informational, then in other countries everyone will dream of your “way of life”, learn your language, dream of moving.  If economic - you will be the keeper and distributor of all economic resources.  If the perfect weapon will be power, then you will drop it on the cities of the enemy, and you will bow to their emperor on your warship. <br><br>  The information war gradually, but irrevocably, rebuilt its foundries to a type of new war - the War of Perspectives. <br><br>  How easy it is to operate with the terms “brainwashing”, “propaganda”, “neuro-linguistic programming”, how easy it will be for those “left after tomorrow” to talk about “impossibility”, “lagging”, “alien paradise”. <br><br>  “The War of Perspectives” is a new phase of the “creeping war” against human consciousness.  If yesterday we were afraid of "only" death, and today the fear of lack of freedom was added, then tomorrow people will be embraced by the horror of the lack of prospects.  Stagnation.  Global stagnation. <br><br>  Of course, like the physical and information warfare, there has always been a perspective war.  Since it is like a subset mechanism in the system of suppressing the enemy.  Its difference from informational is that there is no need for informational contact.  A person as if “himself understands and sees everything”. <br><br>  If today you still need to explain why you are rabble, then tomorrow between you and the person from Rolls-Royce, with a different passport and state of accounts - you will not need to explain anything, you will understand yourself.  What could not, was not born there, for a better life you need a different education, a different color of blood, and yesterday you just had to ask only humiliating, and then ... <br><br><h3>  Eagle claws </h3><br>  Now we will reformulate the topic: “The Perfect Weapon in the War of Perspectives”. <br><br>  It is clear that the main field of this topic is the state, and above.  But within the framework of this work, I want to see it in the context of a smaller one - a person at work.  We go into the armory, and try to pick something, consider.  And at the end of the work we will look into the future - is there what we need there - Perfect Weapon? <br><br>  It is important to remember this. <br><br>  When the problems of the field of Perspective Wars arise, we must go to the armory.  Yes, we are strong and independent, but even great warriors used a sword, and a spear, and strategy, and tactics.  Therefore, we must go to the armory.  The armory is a room devoid of time, internal and external burdens - it is in the heart, where wine, retribution, grief, and complexity are forgotten. <br><br>  You need to go to the armory.  We should not just want to get rid of the problem, talk about it, motivate it, ask for advice or read a book.  We must comprehend our enemy, go to the armory, choose the appropriate weapon and deliver a winning blow. <br><br>  It is necessary to comprehend the enemy in two main ways: internal and external.  Internal affairs concern only us, our “internal perspective”.  External affairs - all other external elements that life and situation offer us. <br><br>  We look at one case <i>(others have decided not to put it now, maybe I read a lot; if according to reviews the material comes in handy, I will write cases “Unrealized” - actually, about the feeling of unrealized; “Too much, too little” - just a lot, but I am small and stupid, and I do not know what to take, and others)</i> . <br><br><h3>  Melee art </h3><br>  <b>Case "Lack of prospects"</b> <br><br>  The context of manifestation: “in this company”, “in this country”, “in this sphere” is not so important. <br><br>  Inner feeling - isolation, constraint, anger, self-destruction, “I stand for more”, extinction, lowering of hands, resentment, especially personal - “do not appreciate me”, getting stuck, narrowing, feeling the ceiling, stopping ... I think the idea is clear. <br><br>  External events - “they refused to pay me more”, “there is no wage growth for the third year already”, “in the end, they didn't raise me”, “I work a lot, I get little”, “they don’t appreciate me”, “they didn’t let me realize my ideas "... In general, many similar and frequently encountered situations. <br><br>  And so, a person finds himself in a state of "lack of prospects." <br><br>  His enemy is external and internal circumstances that drove him to a stalemate.  But he is a strong man, and he tried to change both circumstances and himself.  He spoke with his superiors, colleagues, changed jobs;  I watched this way and that, I saw good things in events, I understood that it was time to change something in life. <br><br>  But still faced with this state of obstinacy in the ceiling and the impossibility of further growth. <br><br>  He realized that he could escalate the problem to gigantic proportions, changing the whole life context in general, the host country, the profession, his name - but he will remain with a sense of the ceiling.  Just now he will be broad, match his life experience. <br><br>  Zen masters, thinking about this problem, said "wherever you go, you take yourself with you."  Yourself, and your sense of the ceiling - the lack of prospects. <br><br>  And then it's time to find a real enemy who hides at the very sight. <br><br>  Lack of prospects is the enemy.  Not a feeling, not a circumstance.  The phenomenon itself, when you rest against a wall.  When you can’t and don’t want to start anything, everything goes down the drain.  A phenomenon in which you are no longer looking for yourself - you know that such prospects no longer exist.  Last frontiers have been passed, and on the treadmill in the deadly sprint you compete with the ever-winning Hussein Bolt.  Someone shot into your life, and it was over.  To the end, all.  And you still live, breathe, and absolutely do not know what to do with it. <br><br>  And you go into the armory of your heart.  Because the enemy has been found, and it remains for you to choose a weapon and strike your blow.  According to the karate system - one blow, one death. <br><br>  What will help in the fight against this stream, this "limb"?  In the fight against torn rope, a cliff in front of the abyss, lack of water in the middle of the desert? <br><br>  What weapon will be strong enough to finally win? <br><br>  And this answer is Transcendence. <br><br>  <i>I can say to any circumstances - "if you do not want to go with me, then I will go without you."</i>  <i>I can say to myself “everything, and this is my limit;</i>  <i>and above it - whatever I do here - I will not reach, ”and at that very moment understand that this is only a voice in my head — a vote given for time.</i>  <i>Out of rationality and experience.</i>  <i>The voice of reason, which understands the situation for obvious reasons.</i>  <i>The voice of a limb that has a beginning, has an end.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The end is cured only by the infinite.</i>  <i>The torn rope makes fall, but the Infinite within me is deprived of time and the shackles of my thinking, what I lived as a child — every ray of the sun, and every smile of my parents, friends, and my endless mischief.</i>  <i>The infinite inside of me continues to live, and without any effort, it wakes up, and I know - I have already surpassed all these torn ropes and strained demise.</i> <br><br>  And you are sitting with the joyful eyes of a child, although all the circumstances remain.  Now they are a dead weight, with which you will find what to do.  He no longer has a soul, he no longer knows how to frighten or shoot.  The finite recedes before the Infinity as the darkest shadow recedes from the smallest fire. <br><br><h3>  Perfect weapon </h3><br>  Previously, it seemed to me that the solution of all problems in the development of astronautics, the discovery of new horizons of existence.  I thought science would be the perfect weapon.  Will give the future, will start the Wheel. <br><br>  But now we see that if we have medicines for all illnesses, even if we conquer death and old age, all these benefits will not only not be available to people, but even if they are left behind, they will not help.  We will drown in comfort, being in an eternal celebration.  We will forget not only the periodic table, but also the multiplication table, because there will be no need to do anything else. <br><br>  Now I think that only children's dreams can change the future.  Eaten in every cell of the body.  In every spark of happy eyes.  The Eye of the Infinite - in the final. <br><br>  I think this is the perfect weapon. <br><br><h3>  To win </h3><br>  The war of perspectives is not just a term.  This is not the redundant essence of Occam, which shows some side of the "ordinary" information war.  The main thing in it - the lack of direct effects on humans.  It is like a war of conclusions and feelings, feelings and again conclusions. <br>  “We are bad, they are good,” “I am worse than others,” “so it’s possible with me, I don’t deserve more,” these thoughts and feelings are bombs that explode in the human mind on the battlefield. <br><br>  To lose in this war means to live the most dreary of possible lives, without faith, not only in the future - but in the present.  Become a zombie, scurrying back and forth and splashing out on all his own corpse. <br><br>  To win it is to be happy, especially in the face of a myriad of problems.  It means believing in yourself, no matter what.  To win is to reclaim your life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451274/</a></p>
