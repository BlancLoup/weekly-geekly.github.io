  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headset with PS3 Headset Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Unsurpassed sound quality in video games was originally one of the main conditions, subject to which the game project either climbed onto the pedestal of world game development, named by the proud name AAA and collected all sorts of prizes at world exhibitions, or squeezed out players and journalists for a long time, ‚ÄúWell ...‚Äù and he took a place in the second echelon, awarded a dubious epithet ‚Äúnot fully unleashing its potential‚Äù, or received a murderous verdict ‚ÄúCategory B!‚Äù and, to the shame of its creators, went to  swath in the literal and figurative sense.  Despite my rather extensive gaming experience, I can‚Äôt remember a single truly worthwhile game, the final score of which would be higher than 7 out of 10 when rated for 6 out of 10. However, no matter how great the sound is in the game, all its beauty will come together No, if the gamer will use the sound system of a cheap TV or speakers for the game - ‚Äúoffice option‚Äù.  This is especially true of online shooters, where it‚Äôs damn important for a player to hear the steps of a creeping enemy, locate the enemy by the sound of the rechargeable clip or on time and jointly (!))), Warn the teammates of the danger. <br><br>  In our today's review, we‚Äôll tell you about the best headphones with a built-in headset for playing PS3.  To our considerable regret, only ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù entered the short list of five nominees for the title of the best headphones.  Not in the sense, of course, that we complain about the absence of domestic producers in this segment.  Just all the heroes of our review are not available for sale in Russian retail.  However, for those who are interested, ebay and amazon will come to the rescue, and if it is reluctant and scary, you can always wait for the September release of Sony's proprietary 7.1 Bluetooth headset, which will definitely be honored with our individual material.  However, to the point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7293739d/0e886fd9/f408083f/9daa1c6c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Opens our review of the headset from the American company Turtle Beach, specializing exclusively in sound gaming devices - Ear Force PX 5. Those who have ever held (although, rather, put on the head) products Turtle Beach, hardly ever want use something from the category of "pipe lower and smoke thinner."  Despite the fact that their prices bite, every dollar out of the $ 279 that you pay for Ear Force PX 5 is absolutely justified.  The 7.1 programmable wireless surround headset will not only please the players with its aesthetic beauty, great sound, incomparable voice transmission, absolute clipping of extraneous noise and stunning bass.  All this, as it were, should by default be present in a top-class product, which Ear Force PX 5 is definitely.  This headset has the most useful function of locking all home Bluetooth-enabled devices, such as a mobile phone or MP3 player.  With this mega-device you will not need to stop the game and apologize wildly to the party members in Killzone 3 for ‚ÄúWait 2 minutes, mommy calls me!‚Äù.  If the call arrives to you during the game session, the sound in the game will be muffled smoothly, and you will be able to answer the call, not looking up from the console and not disturbing the details of your personal life to other players.  The possibility of listening to MP3-tracks during the game is a somewhat less obvious advantage, however, it can also appeal to fans of, say, monotonous races or silent games with non-Russian comrades on foreign servers.

      Ear Force PX 5 contains 18 programmable settings for playing, voice chat, listening to music, talking on the phone or your own voice.  In addition, they use an interactive warning system about a low battery level or the number of programmable tuning sets. <br><br>  There are no disadvantages to this miracle.  Solid advantages.  Most of the world's reviewers agreed that the minor shortcomings of this mega-device are so insignificant that they can be safely neglected.  For those who want to get acquainted with this headset closer, we post a video review of one of the best reviewers on the Internet, MLGSteggy.  Although in English, but everything is clear and accessible. <br><br>  Video review Turltle Beach Ear Force PX5 <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FxOaI8PHxw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlSjWRDzYWWhWDMwQ7PlXTwR-gdw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bf753be0/7fccc077/1609d7f3/13eaf7a5.jpg"><br><br>  Our next hero - Tritton AX Pro - representative of the prolific brand line Mad Catz.  In addition to excellent sound qualities in all aspects, these headphones are distinguished by the fact that each ‚Äúear‚Äù contains as many as four separate membranes: one for the center channel, the second for the front sound, the third for surround sound and the fourth for low frequencies.  Cool conceived, is not it?  The main thing is that listening to the soft velvety sound with perfect bass, you understand that all this is not the delirium of the inflamed consciousness of the PR people of ‚Äúcrazy pussies‚Äù, but the truth. <br><br>  The build quality and design of the headset also cause only positive emotions.  The d / y with LCD backlight and remote control built into the headphone wire provide the most comfortable control settings.  The disadvantages of the headphones are also, unfortunately, present.  Headphones are too heavy, not too ergonomic and require quite a lot of wires.  Also, some argue that for "purely specific" listening to music, these headphones are not very suitable, and are sharpened specifically for gaming battles.  However, an attractive price compared to peers (~ $ 170) and, as a result, a good price-performance ratio, yet allowed us to include them in our hit parade. <br><br>  Those who are interested in the device, we recommend to look at the analysis of the bones TigerDirectTV. <br><br>  Tritton AX Pro video review <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rnn0evOO7pg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhp59bJNpGmXoDNXkxQbdTgTdp-jQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4f6a8294/5441b769/b40835c1/b4f2e960.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the Astro A40 headphones, another American company, which is practically ‚Äúnot illuminated‚Äù on the domestic market, close our review.  These headphones are also a dream for the console gamer - a fan of shooters who are used to working in a virtual team.  These headphones are stunningly light and do not constrain your head at all, and the sound quality in them is about the same high level as in Turtle Beach Ear Force PX5.  They also actually have no drawbacks: unless the price (~ $ 280) could be a little lower, dollars, that‚Äôs, by 50, but, with this quality, whoever counts there ... <br><br>  MLGSteggy, already familiar to us, conducts defloration and dissection. <br>  Video review Astro A40 <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Di0Jex3qLec%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-rkzerWUV7GeX4MniIywC7F7yLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Summary: all the characters in our review are good and deserve to become a faithful companion of any gamer, however, we chose Turtle Beach Ear Force PX5.  Very much they are awesome)) In any case, we will use them until the native 7.1 Bluetooth headset from Sony comes up)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126787/</a></p>
