  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crocodile web</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa web service (well, or applications for a social network) for playing crocodile (one player shows the word with gestures and actions, the others guess).  It seems to me as follows. <br><br>  The site is going to a bunch of people.  They have webcams, microphones, sound.  They indicate the language in which they would like to communicate.  When recruiting a certain number of people who speak one language, a separate room is created for them. <br><br>  If the critical mass of participants is not recruited, those who wait are periodically invited to play with the composition that they have.  Also waiting can join already created rooms if there are places. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So, the room is created. <a name="habracut"></a>  One of the participants (let it be ‚Äúlead‚Äù) receives a word, which he must explain to the others with the help of pantomime.  The image from his camera is displayed to him (so as not to fall out of the frame) and to all participants.  The sound from his microphone is blocked, but he clearly hears the rest of the participants. <br><br>  When a diverse company plays a crocodile, there are always problems with the conditional gestures of the presenter.  Either the presenter does not know how to show that you need to sort out the synonyms already mentioned or that he will show the word in parts.  Either others do not understand his gestures.  Therefore, the leader has separate (service) buttons to comment on their actions and the participants' guesses. <br><br>  Not sure about the output video from the cameras of all participants (such as video conferencing).  While I did not meet free services of group video, for sure, this is not so simple.  But while we are waiting for the API ChatRoulette announcement, at least you can display the avatars of all the participants and indicate which of them is currently speaking. <br><br>  Accordingly, the leader theoretically has the ability to track who said what, and using the service buttons to signal which player is closer to the truth.  In the end, one of the participants guesses the word, and the moderator appoints him as the successor. <br><br>  Words for guessing in a random order are taken from the dictionary base, which is replenished by players.  For each participant, words are memorized, in solving which he took part, and this is taken into account when selecting the next word for the players' room. <br><br>  Each user can keep a list of friends and blacklist, so as not to fall into one room with inadequate players and have the opportunity to have fun with friends. <br><br>  I like to play crocodile (or crocodile?) With friends.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransferring it to the Internet can be considered by someone to be nonsense, it will be to someone's liking, and someone can even bring it to life in the form of a Skype plugin, an application for Vkontakte or a separate web service.  And what about this idea do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92415/</a></p>
