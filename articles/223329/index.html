      <i><b>That's how it was</b></i> <br><br>  The sun was rising over Shenzhen.  Funny bunnies played on the walls of the huge office of the President of Huawei on the 36th floor of the most beautiful skyscraper in the capital of the Chinese high-tech.  In the center of it in a respectful position for forty minutes was the chief designer of the young Liao, already accustomed to the fact that everyone <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/huawei-ascend-p6-podlinnaya-istoriya-sozdaniya-i-podrobnoe-issledovanie-samogo-tonkogo-kitayskogo-smartfona-v-mire_4242.html">calls him Sly Ive</a> . <br><br>  It took another twenty minutes.  A secret door opened silently and in a black suit with a bloody lining, shuffling with a tank gait, the great head of Huawei Richard Yu entered the office. A mysterious smile played on his tired face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96d/a42/ad5/96da42ad5ba52660a6ed209c6e3c94c4.jpg"><br>  <i>Richard Yu at the Huawei Ascend P7 Presentation</i> <br><br>  Contrary to custom, Richard did not sit in a chair trimmed with mammoth leather, but went up to the young Liao. <br><br>  - How is your great army of designers, Sly Ive?  Did you fulfill the order to double it? <br>  - Yes, Comrade Yu!  Now we have 180 thousand people.  Each of them draws one new smartphone or tablet per day.  As usual, most turn out iPhones and iPads, but we are fighting with this! <br>  - Here, Sly Ive!  That's what I wanted to talk to you about.  Tell me, what crafts of our unworthy competitors cause you a special indignation? <br>  - iPhone and Sony Xperia, Comrade Yu!  Sometimes they cause such indignation that rice chowder does not give the usual pleasure! <br>  - The ancient masters told us: repeat the demon, and his fame will fall.  So why do we repeat only one demon?  Is it time to strike at those who have humiliated the great Chinese nation for centuries?  Why do you think I'm in a black suit today, and not in jeans and a turtleneck, like all last year? <br>  - I can not understand this metamorphosis, Comrade Yu! <br>  ‚ÄúI learned all night thinking how my unworthy copy at Sony, Kazuo Hirai.‚Äù  I even spoke on the Xperia Z1!  And in the morning the thought came to my wise head to kill two sparrows with one shot!  Give the command to your subordinates, Sly Liao!  Let our next smartphone, the flagship Ascend P7, look like an iPhone from the side, and on the front and rear of the Xperia!  We use the energy of two images at once, and competitors will not have a single chance!  Let all the flowers bloom in one case! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/161/10d/7c0/16110d7c0cc9b9faee0e98b5cbd878c7.jpg"><br>  <i>Kazuo Hirai, Head of All Sony</i> <br><br>  - Brilliant, Comrade Yu!  Today we will develop one hundred thousand sketches! <br>  - Yes, let's do it.  And immediately proceed to the Ascend P8.  After all, last night I went in a blue T-shirt with Nokia Lumia! <br><br>  <b><i>From fairy tales to reality</i></b> <br><br>  Some will doubt the truth of the story told above.  And it is absolutely in vain!  When I showed my copy of the Ascend P7 to my friends, everyone expressed confidence that this is the Sony Xperia Z2.  The glass back panel with a characteristic location of the camera and flash, the outlines and especially the power button clearly hinted at - from which spoons drew inspiration.  At the same time, much remains of the iPhone.  At least, trays for a sim card and a flash card are uniquely from there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21d/c8c/a16/21dc8ca16603823733804995ec15f3ff.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/c4e/ddf/284c4eddf56a3a3dda5d1fa36e46976d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e0/205/9c2/0e02059c2135a9bab260996dab1ae4ea.jpg"><br><br>  And what is the result?  A person who is not very understanding of the primogeniture of design will say that the device turned out to be strict and simply beautiful.  Especially spectacular everyone likes the texture of the back cover, very beautiful shimmering in the sun.  For those who can touch the Galaxy S3 from the Galaxy S4 by touch, such a mixture of styles seems more amusing than annoying.  Personally, to me, a longtime Sony-style fan, it was even fun to carry Chinese Xperia in my pocket.  Moreover, the Ascend P7 is somewhat smaller than the Z2, and therefore it is better to fall into the pocket of jeans. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/articles/smartfon-sony-xperia-z2-opyt-ekspluatatsii_5182.html">The similarity with the Xperia Z1 / Z2 is</a> not limited to just the exterior.  Last year's flagship Ascend P6, like the iPhone, was assembled on cogs, with the first batch, allowing access inside, was hidden behind a semicircular plastic lining in the bottom of the case.  She, in general, and allowed at first sight to distinguish the P6 from the iPhone.  Using Sony products as inspiration, Huawei also adopted the fastening of the back cover on double-sided tape.  Why this is done is not very clear.  After all, Sony and Samsung use glue only in waterproof models, and the Ascend P7 is not.  Perhaps this is a hint about plans for the future, but so far we can only talk about the methodical approach to ... design. <br><br>  However, enough to look at the exterior, climbed inside. <br><br>  With the help of a soldering station, we slightly heat the apparatus and carefully remove the back cover.  She really glass.  An autopsy reveals some originality of the design.  Sony has sufficiently wide areas along the inner edges of the case, to which the tape is attached.  Here, the site is almost absent, and therefore the tape captures the battery and the motherboard.  Yeah, so at the expense of what was able to achieve compactness! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/1a3/328/3831a33283531663391e6932709f0ba3.jpg"><br>  <i>Contacts on the back cover is a sign that there is an NFC antenna inside it.</i> <br><br>  In principle, there is nothing wrong with such a fastener, the benefit of scotch doesn‚Äôt make any difference to what it is.  But due to the fact that the level of components inside the case is slightly different, it is not possible to achieve perfect dust resistance.  So, when opening my copy, we found a micro-slot in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera lens, where dust had already accumulated ... When reassembling, the flaw was corrected, but the sediment remained, as they say.  We'll write it down to some ‚Äúpre-nature‚Äù of a specific instance ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dd/8bc/7e3/8dd8bc7e3cf94c2b1826d1f3f5bfd24a.jpg"><br>  <i>Dust</i> <br><br>  Immediately after getting access to the motherboard, we were alarmed by the design of its lower part, where the charging connector and microphone are located.  In general, they usually prefer to bet this couple not on the board itself, but on the so-called.  bottom loop  So that in case of trouble, replace only it, and not the entire board.  In Huawei, the design was made monolithic, and the angular transition between the two parts of the board is so thin that it can easily break if the smartphone with the connected charger is dropped.  Yes, and the charging connector itself is not the most reliable.  Therefore, with the P7 you need to be quite careful to avoid the need to go to a service center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed0/515/f39/ed0515f39e977113a8ec06b711b8e5ed.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/018/827/a45/018827a4549be619fca652d1bb39eb9e.jpg"><br><br>  We climb further.  As usual, the processor is hidden behind the heat dissipating screens.  We remove them, smile at the unusually pink color of the thermal paste and find exactly the same design as in the recently <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/obzor-smartfona-huawei-ascend-g6-i-plansheta-huawei-mediapad-x1-70-dorogu-osilit-kradushhiysya_5193.html">disassembled Huawei MediaPad X1 7.0 tablet</a> .  The smartphone uses its own SoC HiSilicon Kirin 910T with 4 cores ARM Cortex A9, operating at a frequency of up to 1.8 GHz.  The graphics core is a quad core Mali-450. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/026/12d/5fe/02612d5fe07c49659e0d31ec672be0a1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/bbb/85b/89dbbb85b80e48f27287ae2357cc0751.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the transition to the 28-nanometer technology, the chip turned out to be rather large.  Noticeably more than a 2-gigabyte RAM chip.  Therefore, they are not placed "sandwich", as in the vast majority of smartphones and tablets, published in the last three years, and next.  In terms of cooling efficiency, this is of course the right decision.  Running a little ahead, I will say that even under a good load, the back wall of the smartphone does not feel hot and remains slightly warm.  Well, if there is enough free space on the board - why not? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/acb/fb6/b01acbfb6d5a90f9e3e64836fd0880fe.jpg"><br><br>  When analyzing, I was very interested in the design of the speaker, because its sound is truly outstanding.  It plays not only loudly, but with a sufficiently large frequency range.  No joke, even the bass felt!  It turned out to be an original design, and even with a built-in antenna unit (correctly, why should the place be wasted).  As for the sound in the headphones, it is also loud, but in terms of quality it does not reach the remaining LG G2 reference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe9/6fc/886/fe96fc886f2acd5780e72eb5df37f521.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41a/788/e62/41a788e62668143f9ef41d852624fea8.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera module on the background of fellow looks gigantic, and no wonder - because its resolution is as much as 8 megapixels.  In Huawei, this was done by one of the "chips" of the device: they say, if you like to make <s>bows</s> for selfies, there are no alternatives to Huawei Ascend P7.  Having made several self-portraits, I came to the conclusion that it‚Äôs not just megapixels, and, despite the marvelous resolution, the results of the P7‚Äôs camera work are not very different from what the iPhone 5 / 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4 and Sony Xperia Z2 offer.  But, on the other hand, and not worse, and this is an achievement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16e/4d5/10f/16e4d510f30237b1d79b384ed77e7e11.jpg"><br>  <i>Front camera on the left</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dba/37a/0fc/dba37a0fcf97678bd6ecf6342b0f6d51.jpg"><br>  <i>Interestingly, this is the same Sunny, which in the days of my childhood did the radio and second-class players, or some other?</i> <br><br>  As for the main camera, I really liked it.  At first, from the richness of shades just breathtaking.  I can not believe that life around is so good.  With a little more careful study of frames, traces of the work of miracle algorithms that enhance the shades are found.  However, they are quite tactful and do not bring the image to the level of a comic book, making it simply "beautiful." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f7/2de/45c/6f72de45cba33dd09a04bf8c6f9cb407.jpg"><br>  <i>At the presentation it was told that inside there is a special ISP of the ‚ÄúSLR level‚Äù.</i>  <i>He did not rush into the eyes, but we will believe</i> <br><br>  The background is blurred very effectively, good results are obtained when shooting in the flawed light conditions.  In general, the only thing I can find fault with is the impossibility of turning off the shutter sound when shooting.  Only along with all the other sounds of the smartphone.  In general, the photographic part of the Ascend P7 is a huge step forward compared to the predecessor P6.  The result is quite at the level of the flagships of Apple, Sony and Samsung.  By the way, perhaps one of the secrets of high-quality images was the rejection of attempts to squeeze files to the size of a chicken ass.  One frame, made on P7, weighs 5-6 MB, which is quite reasonable for a resolution of 13 megapixels.  Taking into account the fact that flash drives are now inexpensive, I use both hands ‚Äúfor‚Äù such dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66d/47d/d19/66d47dd190a081ca29e5f4c01f11d041.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2a/435/25d/b2a43525d57d7b0bb30b95a501523a43.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/129/0bb/26a1290bbaaa4a9e0f65d72313839b7a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac8/b44/0e6/ac8b440e6e05048a1138eb8ae6b03fa7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/c50/6bd/28ec506bd72ce6ba32ea1b30b45389ae.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a2/716/21b/0a271621b8626fc1f306ae3d72bfc4fe.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04d/a0c/5f4/04da0c5f49a0f4c7f07f9a03265aad63.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/a3e/0ad/57ba3e0ad5f4705c974fc307506acb5e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74c/82b/c83/74c82bc83f077e760bb88a80da336941.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a6/299/2b7/1a62992b7fa1e1af4f5e86291b0991ff.jpg"><br><br>  Almost all the frames in the original resolution <a href="http://files.mail.ru/274B7186A3EF4E12B4097F6F8EDDEA51">can be downloaded here</a> . <br><br>  Speaking of memory.  On board, the smartphone has 16 GB, of which the user is available 12. You can insert your own flash drive, but for some reason none of the 64 GB in P7 has worked, only 32. This is rather strange, because in a press release it says 64 GB support.  Perhaps it's not quite the final firmware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/904/4a8/9a0/9044a89a0c9c3604d6418dd27c656749.jpg"><br>  <i>As usual, under the board we are waiting for the mysterious letters.</i>  <i>And you can find out what this copy started to do at the end of March 2014.</i> <br><br>  The overall impression of the design is contradictory.  Compared to last year's P6, the progress is very big.  Everything has become stricter, headphone and charging connectors are located in places convenient to the user, and not where it happened.  At the same time, a fragile place in the motherboard forces the user to exercise a certain caution, and not very accurately copied from Sony mount the back cover in some cases can lead to the effect of "vacuum cleaner", and the stuffed dust can not be cleaned without a visit to the service center.  But never mind, they will practice on cats, and the P8 will be made neater and will certainly become waterproof. <br><br>  <b><i>User experience</i></b> <br><br>  The performance of the proprietary SoC Huawei is not a record.  In the Antutu benchmark, the device knocks out a little less than 25,000 points, that is, approximately at the level of the Galaxy S4, Xperia Z and other last year‚Äôs flagships.  If you buy a smartphone to run benchmarks, P7 is not the best option.  But, frankly, such a performance device with FullHD-screen is enough.  The shell works quickly, games of the Asphalt 8 level do not slow down - so what more could you wish for?  But the hardware was very energy efficient.  Even driving a smartphone to the tail and to the mane, I never managed to put the battery in a day by more than 50%.  And this is not bad at all considering its unreliable capacity of 2460 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86f/295/933/86f295933003f147bde98917870bcc07.jpg"><br><br>  True, Huawei went on one trick.  Diligently inspired by Sony's smartphones, the Stamina mode was dragged from P7 to it, for obvious reasons, abandoning the original name.  Only in Sony you need to enable it yourself, and in P7 everything is included by default.  And when the screen is off, synchronization with social networks and other energy-intensive processes do not work.  I noticed this immediately and immediately turned it off.  So, what is funny, it practically did not affect the time of work. <br><br>  I really liked the screen.  Right very much.  High-quality 5-inch Full HD IPS-matrix gives a clear picture with eye pleasing colors.  The only drawback is the frankly bad algorithm of automatic backlight control.  On the street, he copes with his duties well, but at home he constantly pulls virtual levers back and forth, and this is slightly annoying.  Therefore, when watching movies, I turned it off.  I hope this twitch is treated with firmware. <br><br>  The smartphone supports LTE.  I checked it on sim cards of MegaFon and MTS, and it really works, they did not deceive me.  My colleague, who also tested the P7, complained about the poor quality of voice in the MTS network, but I did not notice anything like that - and I was heard perfectly, and the interlocutor.  But on the Wi-Fi module, they clearly saved: it supports only the 2.4 GHz band, which is not very good at this time, when 2.4 GHz is littered to disgrace.  Leaders of competitors are able to connect to 5 GHz is not the first year ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d24/d0a/b01/d24d0ab0109bdc2ffa7eb6bd3a2f745c.jpg"><br><br>  About the shell Emotion UI 2.3.  I won't say anything bad or good.  When it was created, it was clearly inspired by iOS, adding the features that Android provides.  It turned out quite faceless, but quite convenient.  I immediately took down all the branded widgets, put my own - and it became good.  It comes with a dozen themes, significantly transforming the interface.  Over time, they promise the ability to download them from the Internet, but so far there is a void in the appropriate section of the Themes application. <br><br>  I passed with the smartphone for about a week and was quite pleased with it.  So what?  Everyone around thinks that I have a Z2 and are a little jealous.  The device works stably, all applications behave correctly and do not crash.  The screen and camera is excellent.  Sound - raise the dead.  The battery is long-playing.  So what more could you want? <br><br>  Probably only humane prices.  <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/huawei-ascend-p6-podlinnaya-istoriya-sozdaniya-i-podrobnoe-issledovanie-samogo-tonkogo-kitayskogo-smartfona-v-mire_4242.html">Ascend P6 last year tried to sell</a> at 19,990, and nobody wanted to buy something.  The starting price of the P7 seems to be promised at the level of 17,000, but I honestly doubt it.  In Europe, it will definitely cost 449 euros, and this is at the current rate of more than 20 thousand rubles ... So, most likely, again, the twenty at the start with a rather rapid decline to 17-18.  But they would have set 16 at the start, and the market share could have jerked ahead with a fast-moving jack.  After all, the very uncompromising Ascend P7 can only compete with last year‚Äôs flagship, and they are about the same.  Well, none of my business. <br><br>  At the presentation, Huawei promised to soon release a version of the P7, where the memory card slot will be universal.  You want to insert a card, and you want a second SIM card.  This is a very sensible idea.  In the end, if you don‚Äôt carry a large media library with you, 12 onboard gigabytes is enough.  But dvuhsimochnik this level but with such a camera - it is very interesting. <br><br>  <b><i>Intermediate Final</i></b> <br><br>  Finish this text will have a slightly bitter note.  Many of the flagships of different manufacturers passed through our hands with the master Levchenko, and after dismantling, they all felt fine.  But the Huawei Ascend P7 was an exception.  From the first time, we could not sufficiently reliably glue the back cover - the upper right corner went away.  And after another cycle of heating-sizing-heating, the screen went dark spots.  Master Levchenko suggested that the backlight reflectors had flown because the pixels themselves were burning as it should. <br><br>  It's nothing you can do!  Despite the fact that the device has not really gone on sale, eBay already has spare parts for it.  In particular, the screen assembly costs 2500 rubles with delivery, which is inexpensive for a 5-inch copy with FullHD resolution.  For comparison, the Xperia Z1 screen costs a thousand rubles more.  Ordered, we will change.  The device as a whole is painfully good; it's a pity to just throw it away. <br><br>  Honestly, this is the first Huawei, which wanted to use not only for test, but also for personal needs.  Taking into account the fact that the company takes the third place in the world in the number of sold devices and the fifth in terms of revenue, the prospects for the Chinese are not weak. <br><br>  It is time to strain not only Apple. <br><br>  <i>The author thanks Master Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">www.tech-town.ru</a> ) for his help in preparing this material.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223329/</a></p>
