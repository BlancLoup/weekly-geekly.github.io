      There is such a <s>party</s> system!  Let me tell you about the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.videosharp.info/%3Fpart%3Dhabr">Formula Programmer</a> ‚Äù project, which combines the mentioned advantages.  A student, an engineer, and a talented child can learn a lot of practical experience and get a lot of ready-made gaming and application programs, as well as improved programming skills in the popular C # programming language (C Sharp). <br><br>  Why at the head of the project put not the theory, and the experience of creating ready-made programs in C #?  Because the most effective way to memorize is not reading, not viewing, but specific actions that have a specific tangible result - a program created that you are not ashamed to place in your portfolio. <br><br> <a href="http://www.videosharp.info/6203/checking/game5%3D178"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/e9d/771/cf1e9d7711a01322cf4afcf0742b774d.jpg" alt="Nikolai completed the creation of the game Sokoban"></a> <br><br>  Have you ever wondered why novice programmers rarely reprint examples from books?  Because these examples, in themselves, are not practical.  Another thing is when you get a finished game program at the finish!  There is a desire and motivation to perform the task, to write the next block of the program, to proceed to the next lesson. <br><br>  Here is just a small list of game programs that are created on the ‚ÄúFormula Programmer‚Äù video courses: Labyrinth, Arkanoid, Memory Cards, Snake, Game of Life, Fifteen, Game 2048, Hanging, Tic-tac-toe, Solitaire Domino, Sokoban for two, Sea the battle.  Also there are lessons on creating application programs: Stopwatch, Chess clock, Keyboard speed, Working with Winapi, Pixel-by-pixel image processing, Talking clock, Graphing, Wallpaper change client-server, Archiver, Rating book and others.  Formulists are happy to create these programs, as evidenced by the mass of positive reviews and video reviews of the programs created. <br><br>  Look at your leisure 9-minute video review of Andrei Polyakov about the toys he created on the video game ‚ÄúGames with sprites‚Äù: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aLWpPHNhN8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxKGEvVziDTHrw9AEZ4yapam9AVw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The programmer's formula is not just a collection of video courses, it is a complex programming skills pumping technique, which includes weekly webinars of professional programmers, a collection of interactive console tasks, regular olympiads, video solutions for complex tasks, and an open communication platform for like-minded people: the formalists check each other‚Äôs reports, they see the statistics and decisions of other participants, can communicate, a friendly atmosphere prevails on the forum. <br><br><h4>  Why is such a project relevant today? </h4><br><ul><li>  First, C sharp language is one of the most popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor highly paid professionals.  With the support of Microsoft, this language is used to create a huge number of information systems and web projects. </li><li>  Secondly, today there are a huge number of various theoretical training courses, but there are very few courses with a practical bias, and in fact practice makes a novice programmer an experienced professional. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Interactive collection of console tasks </h4><br><br>  In the Console section there are several hundred tasks with video solutions.  All tasks are divided by topic, they must also be performed sequentially.  There is a section with Olympiad tasks. <br><br>  The correctness of each solution is checked automatically by robot Sharpe, who compiles a program written by a formalist and runs it through several tests, this is how it looks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c6/b24/c07/5c6b24c073a7b2dee5087930d7aff450.png" alt="Demonstration of an interactive collection of tasks"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúFormula for Programmers‚Äù project is a great opportunity to develop programming practice by solving console tasks and bringing the result to 100%. <br><br><h4>  The main advantages of teaching methods </h4><br><ul><li>  Video courses are strictly sequential, so the programmer‚Äôs attention is focused on one task.  To proceed to the next lesson, you must complete the lesson's task and send a report, which is checked by the organizers and other project participants. </li><li>  Each game and application program is created from scratch.  If you are a beginner, you just need to repeat all the actions for the lecturer on the screen.  If you are a more experienced programmer, there will be additional creative and technical tasks for you. </li><li>  The leveling up of skills happens unnoticed, as if by itself.  The formist simply moves from one lesson to another, and the quantity smoothly transforms into quality. </li><li>  Most video lessons have a short 15-minute format, which has a positive effect on the assimilation of the material and simplifies the implementation of an independent task. </li><li>  There is a section on the project. The console is an interactive task book in which the robot Sharp compiles and checks your programs using pre-prepared tests, this happens right on the site. </li><li>  Each task in the Console section has a video solution that covers the theoretical material necessary for solving each task. </li><li>  Project coaches regularly conduct training and motivational programming webinars. </li></ul><br><br>  To please the most varied tastes, more than 30 video courses have been developed for creating various programs using different technologies: animation games, artificial intelligence, work with the network and databases, graphics processing, etc. <br><br>  There is an interesting project for any beginner and continuing programmer, everyone can find something useful for themselves. <br><br>  Video courses are created by the project team and are recorded, as a rule, during practical webinars where each program is created from scratch. <br><br>  Practical webinars are an opportunity to communicate project participants and discuss various ways to create programs.  Here you can always get answers to your questions, charge with positive energy and positive, send them in the right direction.  This is a kind of emotional "doping", allowing to reach a new frontier of its development. <br><br> <a href="http://www.videosharp.info/webinar/start"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eef/b7c/3a2/eefb7c3a2cf24b36b7a71908576b0436.png" alt="Webinar schedule"></a> <br><br><h4>  What is needed to participate in the project? </h4><br><ul><li>  The desire to become an experienced programmer </li><li>  Several hours per week for training </li><li>  Installed Microsoft VisualStudio C # </li><li>  Finance for paid packages </li></ul><br><br><h4>  The amount of educational material </h4><br><ul><li>  11 video courses on creating game programs </li><li>  11 video tutorials on creating applications </li><li>  11 professional video courses on various technologies </li><li>  300 console interactive tasks </li><li>  3 years of weekly webinars. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Activity statistics </h4><br><ul><li>  8200 participants </li><li>  27500 video tutorials </li><li>  82700 console tasks </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Video course authors: </h4><br><ul><li>  Volosatov Evgeny (project founder) </li><li>  Vestskaya Elena </li><li>  Shmoilov Kirill </li><li>  Zhdanov Valery </li><li>  Black Constantine </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Project mission </h4><br><ul><li>  Immersion in the language of Sharpe </li><li>  Motivation to learn a language </li><li>  Pumping programming skills </li></ul><br><br>  Welcome to the " <a href="http://www.videosharp.info/%3Fpart%3Dhabr">Formula Programmer</a> " project address: VideoSharp.info. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304142/</a></p>
