  <section class="page js-page"><h1>12 points of growth conversion, or content that really sells</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet is an environment in which there is no opportunity to touch the goods with your hands, so photography plays a very important role when selling on the site.  That is why photos of goods on Amazon (one of the largest online stores in the world) occupy as much as 25% of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe first page screen.  How to make selling photos - will be discussed in the article. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f9/xo/rr/f9xorrya_txyybm1sxifjg1dt7k.jpeg"><br>  <i>Product photo on Amazon</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, some interesting information about the advantages of photos over other types of content: <br><br><ul><li>  Up to 90% of information a person perceives with his eyes ( <a href="https://www.braintools.ru/article/1305">Lindgren N.</a> , 1962); </li><li>  A skilled person (Homo habilis) appeared about 2.5 million years ago, and writing has existed about 5.5 thousand years (Sumerian language).  Therefore <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209776/">, the processing time of visual content</a> is 0.13 seconds.  And the time to read a text description from a few seconds to a few minutes </li><li>  40% of the nerve endings from the brain are connected to the retina.  Eric Jensen <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Based-Learning-New-Paradigm-Teaching/dp/1412962560">Brain-Based Learning</a> . </li></ul><br><h2>  How to increase conversion with photos </h2><br><h2>  1. Use photos on the site </h2><br>  It may sound strange, but there are still websites with goods without photos.  At the same time, products without photos are often ignored by users, they are perceived as uninformative and incomplete.  Therefore, the use of photography is a prerequisite, even for the most simple and understandable goods, such as a rope (image below).  This photo at once removes many questions and doubts: ‚Äúis it white?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat shade of white?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill it suit my tile color?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs it woven?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs it strong?‚Äù And so on.  Otherwise, most people won't even get to the text description without a photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zp/n6/k4/zpn6k42c3qbgrratnurhoowuwxk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Home Depot, Organization is prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation :)</i>

    <h3>  What to do if there is no photo? </h3><br>  In most cases, online stores resell products from various manufacturers.  Therefore, if your photo is not yet available, you can always take ready-made images of good quality on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.  He will not mind, because you are helping him sell his goods.  And in the future, change the photo on your own, if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/lr/us/kxlruse-1rp3em0gm7yyy6m0_hu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cenam.net (seller‚Äôs site on the left), Dream (manufacturer‚Äôs site on the right)</i> <br><br><h2>  2. Use multiple photos </h2><br>  In the offline store there is an opportunity to view the goods from different sides (twist in the hands or walk around).  There is no such possibility on the Internet if only one photo is presented.  Therefore, show the goods from different sides: front, side, back, top, bottom, at an angle, in the on / off modes and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h4/yv/hf/h4yvhfe7egbs7wol3xobk2gybjk.jpeg"><br>  <i>GoPro 7 black</i> <br><br>  But do not include duplicate photos, for most products 9-10 photos will be quite enough. <br><br><h2>  3. Use quality photos </h2><br>  As it turned out, people can interpret the definition of ‚Äúquality photography‚Äù in different ways, so I made a small description that, in my (subjective) view, corresponds to this definition: <br><br><ul><li>  Use pictures with good lighting and detail (not blurry and not dark); </li><li>  Size ~ 1000 x 1000 pixels (not less, for easy viewing of details); </li><li>  Depict large items (~ 80% of the entire image); </li><li>  Use clear images, photo processing can help (for example, ‚Äúfilter&gt; sharpness‚Äù in Photoshop); </li><li>  Weight ~ 100KB (at least, optimizing photos for the web); </li><li>  White or uniform background (so as not to distract attention); </li><li>  The format of any of the most popular for the web, such as JPEG (but without strong compression, without large grains and without explicit pixels); </li><li>  Without watermarks (large, not transparent, in the center of the photo). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/os/k6/taosk60ohj0lpfyzb4atvdgpsjm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Example: Poor-quality photo (left), high-quality photo (right)</i> <br><br><h2>  4. Use photo magnification </h2><br>  Enlarging a fragment of a photo (magnifying glass or zoom) allows users to look at the details, as in an offline store.  That is why I recommended the large size and weight of the photos in the previous paragraph.  In the example below, with the help of magnification, one can understand how well the watch dial and the seams on the plastic are made at the edges.  Without magnification, it is harder to understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v3/t0/gt/v3t0gthjua2_bn_-2v0fxabpxtq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Casio G-Shock watches on Amazon</i> <br><br><h2>  5. Show the texture on the photo. </h2><br>  If a person in an offline store can touch a thing, understand from which fabric it is, see the details.  So in the online store, this is not possible.  And that pushes many away from buying online.  To remove this objection, show the invoice.  Simply enlarging a photo from afar will not be enough here, you need to take a separate close-up shot (macro) on which you will see well: the texture of the fabric, seams, accessories, the flip side (wrong side, lining of clothes).  By the way, even the iPhone is able to make good macro shots, with sufficient light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/dw/am/_wdwamtvy2dge6l0fdwf9glz51k.jpeg"><br>  <i>Mango dress, the texture on the left is not clear, even with the increase, but the texture on the right is clear</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/nc/lc/nlnclcrxonooj6ro8oeev3q4xv4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Decorative pillow on IKEA website</i> <br><br><h2>  6. Show the size of the goods on the photo </h2><br>  The photo is not always easy to determine the size of the subject.  And even if the description indicates the size, it is not always and not everyone understands.  But even worse, it can also stop from buying, the user may think "this product is not too big / small?".  To better understand the size of the object, the brain needs familiar reference points on a photograph, for example, a person or some familiar objects.  In the images below, try to determine the size of the sculpture ‚ÄúMotherland Calls‚Äù from a photo without people (left).  And now according to the photo with people (on the right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/ot/bn/yvotbn1lxfuqk2yjjf3jfrrchjg.jpeg"><br>  <i>The sculpture "Motherland Calls" in Volgograd, height 85 meters</i> <br><br>  In this context (with people), users can easily determine the approximate size, and in the description they will already know the exact numbers, if necessary.  Example with sculpture exaggerated for clarity.  But perception works similarly for small items in an online store, only the scale is different.  In the photo below, try to close the right side and understand the size of the pouf.  Perhaps it is small and designed as a footrest, and perhaps it can fit several people.  With a person sitting on a pouf, understanding the approximate size and purpose is much easier and faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7m/f0/hb/7mf0hbor6gymj1l7ed82wxdv0h4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pouf Delicates on IKEA website</i> <br><br>  Perhaps, precisely because of such a scrupulous approach to trivialities at IKEA, everything is simple and clear.  And the company's founder Ingvar Kamprad was the richest man in Sweden during his lifetime. <br><br>  If the product is a complex composite structure, for example, furniture that needs to be entered in a narrow bathroom, then you can add a schematic image indicating the dimensions of each element.  This is much clearer than the numbers in the description: ‚ÄúSize, mm: 580x750x420‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3q/qf/dq/3qqfdqhf_l-rwstisbn5rrklg-s.jpeg"><br>  <i>Obi</i> <br>  If the goods are small, for example, earrings or headphones, then it is desirable to show them on the person‚Äôs ear.  The following landmarks will also work well with small items: a hand, a coin, or a smartphone. <br><br><h2>  7. Benefits and hidden features in photos </h2><br>  Does your product have competitive advantages or hidden features?  Show them.  In the example below, from a photo with water drops (on the right) it becomes clear that the camera is not afraid of rain and can be installed on the street.  If there was only a left shot, then doubt could creep in, ‚Äúplastic, holes, most likely this camera is for indoor installation, and not at all for the street.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/cr/il/lycrilbebjphvrcoxavh1q7deqy.jpeg"><br>  <i>Logitech</i> <br><br>  Apple used a similar technique when it launched the second series of watches that were waterproof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c_/by/9h/c_by9hbhizipjpgexaddk6grrqg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Apple Watch</i> <br><br>  The advantages of goods can be shown not only with the help of water, but for example with the help of movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/fn/rx/jufnrxx4ap-8gtqdl9x-p_lpfoa.jpeg"><br>  <i>Mystery Flying Snitch (Wow! Stuff Collection, Harry Potter)</i> <br><br>  In an offline store a person can touch, twist, move goods to understand the functionality.  And on the Internet, users can not guess about some features for 1-2 photos.  ‚ÄúDo the wings move?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDoes the sofa unfold?‚Äù.  That is why some people prefer to personally go to offline stores.  Show the product in action, expand the functionality and you will remove many questions and increase the conversion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/-b/su/wq-bsub6xudgk-3qtikavihs0by.jpeg"><br>  <i>Beige sofa on IKEA website</i> <br><br><h2>  8. Show different options on the photos. </h2><br>  If the same product has different versions (for example, color) - show it without leaving the product card so that you can quickly and visually compare. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r3/xg/pw/r3xgpws6b2jv2udmbm_kvqxiem0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gamepad options for Sony PlayStation 4 on Amazon</i> <br><br>  To do this, you must take photos of all versions (preferably in the same position).  It is not enough to specify the names of the colors in the text description, because different people can even name the same color differently.  Such confusion often happens, for example, with pink and purple flowers. <br><br><h2>  9. Show the product in action on the photo. </h2><br>  Some products are difficult to imagine from a photo without context, for example, clothes without a person or a sofa without a living room.  Separate photos are also needed, but add a photo in action and it will tell a lot about the product, for example: how this sweatshirt sits, how the material bends, how the light falls, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/hd/b4/iihdb4w7ipxeckjiwr5z3rynhrm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Svitshot "Kazan" from Gosha Rubchinsky on site KM20</i> <br><br><h2>  10. Accessories show with the main product in the photo </h2><br>  If an accessory is sold, then it is desirable to show it along with the main product.  This removes questions about whether this accessory fits or not, how it will look, what size it has, and so on.  In the example below, the flash for the camera.  The main product (camera) is slightly highlighted to focus on the selling accessory (flash).  At the same time the sizes, compatibility and a general view are clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/sq/vs/scsqvstbo-sprn5hfnw5urbwqag.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tolifo camera flash on Alibaba</i> <br><br>  Now imagine this flash without a camera.  It will take some time for the brain to understand: What is it?  Where is it set?  How it works?  Is this suitable for my camera?  I saw such a mount on an action camera, maybe it's for her?  and similar questions.  Do not make users think it reduces conversion. <br><br><h2>  11. Show emotions on a photo. </h2><br>  Philod Kotler, one of the world's most famous and reputable marketing experts, wrote (or more precisely quoted Theodor Levitt): <br><br><blockquote>  You sell no drill.  You sell holes.  Do not sell features.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãbenefits, results and value. </blockquote><br><br>  This technique is often used by toy manufacturers.  Because toys are bought by children in order to please them and make them happy.  It‚Äôs harder for parents to resist a photo with a happy child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/g1/bq/erg1bqzw8-p-snwib96qtd6de7i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Buzz Lightyear Toy on Disney Store</i> <br><br>  But it also works on adults.  In the example below, the photo shows the emotions when using virtual reality glasses.  It is for such emotions that these glasses are bought.  So these emotions and need to show.  But in most online stores in Russia, showing emotions and smiling is not accepted, unfortunately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lv/ab/p1/lvabp1wcfjucznul-kaw0zyizfa.jpeg"><br>  <i>Oculus VR virtual reality glasses</i> <br><br><h2>  12. Photo 360 degrees </h2><br>  360-degree photos allow users to view the product from all sides, rotating it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/hh/ul/n8hhul39joxpjg2_kpn_kaxtymo.jpeg"><br>  <i>Clubmaster Sunglasses on Ray-Ban website</i> <br><br>  Such interactive content increases loyalty and has a positive effect on conversion.  In 2016, a <a href="">study</a> was conducted in which it became clear that those users who interact with photos of products represented in 360 degrees, 14% more often make purchases.  Another confirmation of the effectiveness of this method is the fact that Amazon has recently begun <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ashley-Furniture-Signature-Design-Whitesburg/dp/B009CBP346/">to introduce the</a> possibility of publishing goods in 360 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vt/m2/7x/vtm27xuzhsfzt0bd_hxyngjcd3i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo 360 on Amazon</i> <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br><br>  By Edward Fayzullin, Founder of Conversant.me <br><br>  UPD: dear readers, which minus the rating of the article.
