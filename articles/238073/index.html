  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customs duties on the package still to be, and soon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Such a conclusion follows from the draft budget of the Russian Federation for 2015-2017, in general, already approved by the government.  According to RIA Novosti, due to fees for online trading, it is planned to replenish the budget in the amount of 60 billion rubles.  And they really count on this money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd3/22f/325/cd322f325ae94265b59dd43753fef503.jpg"><br><br>  Interestingly, the flow of funds is planned to be uniform - 20 billion a year.  This means that the duties are likely to be introduced in the near future, since only three months are left until the beginning of 2015.  And as we see above, the income for 2015 should not be lower than the income of 2016 and 2017. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      At the moment, the amount over which the duty will be introduced is still unclear.  However, the ministries of finance and economic development are actively communicating about the finalization of the law.  So, on September 11, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/retail/11/09/2014/948463.shtml">it became known</a> that the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade gave a negative opinion on the draft law of the Ministry of Finance providing for a limit on purchases in the amount of 150 euros.  According to the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance did not take into account the proposals received during the public discussion of the draft law and could not justify the requested limit.  Also, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce expressed its opinion, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/32189391/minfin-ne-otkazalsya-ot-poroga-besposhlinnoj-internet">proposing</a> to reduce the total duty to 500 euros.  However, whatever amount the ministries agree on, as we understand it, it must provide budgeted revenues. <br><br>  Therefore, if you planned to buy something expensive in a foreign online store before the end of the year, or combine several expensive packages into one to save on delivery, it is best to do so soon. <br><br>  Where do these duties come from?  Oddly enough, they talked about their domestic traders.  So at a meeting with the President of Russia, the general director of the Ozon holding <a href="http://ria.ru/economy/20140610/1011533214.html">said</a> that every year the country's budget loses about 98 billion rubles due to "the imperfection of legislation in the field of e-commerce with foreign countries."  Moreover, representatives of trade can be understood - <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/575237">according to Izvestia</a> , the same Ozon (which many people call the domestic Amazon) ended 2013 with a net loss of 620 million rubles.  A year earlier, the loss was 610 million, and in 2011 - 211 million rubles. <br><br>  At the same time, it is a mistake to think that only Ozon is not capable of making a profit.  As the same Izvestia writes, a similar story is characteristic of many large Internet merchants.  So Enter.ru - ended the year at a loss of 4 billion, KupiVIP - at 530 million, Sotmarket - at 70 million.  You all know what happened with the White Wind, and there is a feeling that others will soon join him.  So the duties are designed to revive almost the entire industry of domestic online commerce and they are likely to be introduced. <br><br>  In fairness, it should be noted that the same Amazon was unprofitable for quite a long time and in the second quarter of this year showed a loss of $ 126 million (4.8 billion rubles). <br><br>  <b>What to do and how to circumvent future restrictions?</b> <br>  1. As stated above: if you have planned expensive purchases within the old limit of 1000 euros, then it is better to do it as soon as possible.  Moreover, the growth dynamics of the dollar and the euro is clearly not in our favor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/844/df5/ec4/844df5ec4b914e93adfec4935f84bbfa.jpg"><br><br>  2. Send as an intermediary or mail forwarding service through Kazakhstan.  Unfortunately, an unpromising direction.  The fact is that on January 1, 2015, the agreement on the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), signed by Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, comes into force.  The entry into force of this agreement will result in the establishment of common customs limits on the territory of the aforementioned union, and this automatically negates the opportunity to bypass the reduced duty free threshold by delivering goods from foreign online stores through Kazakhstan. <br><br>  3. Send as an intermediary or mail forwarding service, but NOT through Kazakhstan.  We discussed all perspectives with representatives of Shopozz in Habr√©: <br>  - introduction of new types of services, where expensive goods will be ‚Äúsplit up‚Äù into several parcels; <br>  - duty-free delivery of goods from China, Germany, UK, Japan through Shopozz.  All goods pass customs clearance by a legal entity and, thus, the client of the above-mentioned service receives a parcel not from abroad, but from Russia.  Consequently, there are no duties, in addition to the standard delivery charge, which already includes the cost of customs clearance of a combined cargo of a legal entity.  I will add that the service representatives shared their plans to open another free mail forwarding direction in Germany by the end of 2014; <br>  - Duty-free delivery of goods from the United States through Shopozz.  At the moment, negotiations are underway with a number of hauliers, thanks to which it will be possible to clear the goods from the United States in the same way as the aforementioned method. <br><br>  I remind you that you read the blog of the company Shopozz, a free Mail Forwarding service from the USA.  With pleasure, at a low price and in guaranteed time, Shopozz will deliver everything that you want to buy in the USA and other countries.
