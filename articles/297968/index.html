  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In trend: Mail.ru Group has allocated work with big data into an independent unit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.Ru Group company</a> carried out a small restructuring.  Now work with big data will be a separate unit.  The company has accumulated a significant number of customers and tasks.  The new division will provide its clients with services for the creation of predictive mathematical models, marketing research, consulting in the field of infrastructure development and big data methodology.  The unit was headed by Roman Statiugin. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe company has been analyzing data from the moment it was founded.  The accumulated expertise and competencies allow us to provide big data analysis services to third-party customers, regardless of the geography of their presence.  First of all, these are projects that are aimed at improving the efficiency of marketing and sales processes, optimizing production, logistics, risk management, planning, personnel management, and other business processes of various businesses.  In this regard, it was decided to allocate this work as a separate unit, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-01-18_mailru_group_vydelila_v_otdelnoe_napravlenie">said</a> Dmitry Sergeev, Deputy General Director of Mail.Ru Group, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-01-18_mailru_group_vydelila_v_otdelnoe_napravlenie">to</a> CNews. <br><br>  Big data technologies can be successfully applied to optimize business processes. <a name="habracut"></a>  The analysis of large amounts of information from a limited amount of data reveals patterns that are very likely to hold for an unlimited amount of data.  The pattern thus obtained may serve as a model for predicting the occurrence of an event or help in decision-making.

      Examples include models of forecasting customer churn, response to proposals, and prediction of response to a call through a certain communication channel.  They allow you to make interaction with a potential client more personalized, taking into account the context of the situation, and thereby achieve an increase in the organization‚Äôs business performance, taking maximum care of the loyalty of its customers, explain the company's specialists. <br><br>  To implement their products, Mail.ru specialists used their own technologies (for example, Tarantool's NoSQL database) and other open source solutions (Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark).  To build predictive mathematical models, Machine Learning methods are used, including the company's own developments, for example, the Multiclass Look-alike model construction algorithm, which is a development of PU Learning. <br><br>  The demand and supply in the big data analytics segment are not structured: customers do not always know exactly what they want to buy, and suppliers can not always accurately articulate what they are selling, says Alexander Haytin, head of the design office of Yandex Data Factory.  According to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/245393/">YDF's</a> experience, the fastest ‚Äúbig data‚Äù is monetized in the banking, retail and telecommunications industries. <br><br>  In the framework of the development of competence and training in the direction of big data Mail.Ru Group cooperates with educational institutions of the country.  In 2014, an educational project ‚ÄúMail.Ru Technosphere‚Äù was launched on the basis of the faculty of the CMC of the Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov, in which employees of the company conduct courses in machine learning and data-mining. <br><br>  At the end of November 2015, Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21548/">wrote</a> that strategic investors of the Internet Initiatives Development Fund ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2">IIDF</a> ) had problems requiring analysis of big data.  In accordance with their wishes, IIDF is investing 0.5 billion rubles in the development of start-ups in this area.  FRIA will create the so-called ‚Äúbig data‚Äù laboratory, which will be engaged in the technological development of start-ups: help in hiring the right employees, purchasing and setting up equipment, and developing software products.  In the next few years, the fund is ready to invest in start-up projects up to 2 million rubles in exchange for a share of 7%. <br><br>  In November <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">, VimpelCom</a> (Beeline brand) and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> launched strategic cooperation in the field of Big Data.  The Yandex Data Factory department will develop services for predicting the outflow of Beeline customers, to increase the work of sales specialists in call centers and to optimize advertising costs. <br><br>  In the same month of November, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Rostelecom</a> bought Russian company <a href="http://www.iqmen.ru/">Aikumen Ibs</a> for $ 8 million and entered the market of unstructured data, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22126/">reported</a> Megamind. <br><br>  There are thousands of big data analytics projects in the US, and there are dozens of them in Russia, says Sergei Zolotarev, director of the American company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software">Pivotal</a> in Russia and the CIS.  He agrees that the Russian business does not fully appreciate the economic benefits of big data analytics and the domestic big data analytics market lags behind the leading countries by 3-4 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297968/</a></p>
