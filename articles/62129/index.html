At a certain moment, we realized that it became close to us in the existing conditions, it‚Äôs time to change the situation.  Considering that in Volgograd, in our sphere, career growth is almost impossible (it was not possible to change the awl of one studio for soap of the same reason) we decided to play our own business.  No sooner said than done. <br><br>  First you need to decide on the name.  During the brainstorming, we took into account three conditions: 1. Companies with this name should not exist.  Or in extreme cases there should not be many of them in the Russian Federation.  2. Free domain name in the zone ru. <br>  In the end, after a few days of searching, we had a whole bunch of weird and not-so-so-many names like: Muraka-Baraka, Nick Cave, Ogenry, Keitblansh, Magwai, Donnie Darko.

      We chose Magway.  At that moment I was unaware of the existence <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B_(%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC)">of the Gremlins film</a> , the other two simply forgot about him.  This is how the Magwei Web Studio - the <a href="http://magwai.ru/">creation of sites in Volgograd</a> . <br>  Our main activities: website development, advertising (seo, contextual, etc.), corporate identity + further creation and development of our own projects. <br><br>  <b>Office search</b> <br>  We were looking for an unsprained room up to 25 meters, with a reasonable price and not too far from the city center.  Some tips for those who are currently searching for what you should pay attention to: <br>  1. Price, layout, state of the office, the presence or absence of air conditioning, from which side the sun rises, where the blinds go - all you need to know first. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. Does the price include utility payments and electricity?  Sometimes include, sometimes not.  Does the amount include cleaning the room or the cleaner will have to pay separately?  What other services are included in the amount? <br>  3. Phones.  Usually connect for money.  If the phone number belongs to the landlord, then he will most likely take money to connect them to your office.  Sometimes a more expensive option - the number will have to buy from the provider, in Volgograd, it costs 6000-7000 rubles.  for every. <br>  4. Infrastructure.  Is there parking, tasty and for what money they feed in the nearest cafe and is there any at all?  Elevators or should I take the stairs?  In our building the elevator is turned off at 18-00, it‚Äôs good that we didn‚Äôt take an office on the 7th floor.  Is electricity cut off at night?  Toilets can also be checked.  The toilet is the face of an office building. <br>  5. Mode of operation.  Many office buildings do not work on weekends - for some it may be inconvenient. <br>  6. Internet.  What providers are available.  See their rates. <br>  7. Do they take a deposit?  Many landlords practice a mortgage in the amount of the monthly rental price.  In case you leave and leave the skinned wallpaper behind you or don‚Äôt want to pay for the phone.  If all is well, the money will be returned to you when you want to leave.  If you plan an office for a long time - in fact, this money is lost. <br>  We settled into the office with a view of the plant, good toilets, opening magnetic keys and a cafe where the same piece of pork is sold under five names.  We are happy, but we want to move out - tired pork. <br><br>  <b>check in</b> <br>  The question of LLC or SP was practically not.  There are three of us, in LLC it is easy to divide shares.  In addition, an LLC is generally accepted as a more reliable and solid form than an IP (although in fact reliability is not at all determined by this).  Significant minus of LLC difficulty with cash withdrawal from current account, IP cash out freely. <br>  With the option of taxation, there were no issues either - simplified, 6%. <br>  We decided that it is easier and faster to register using the services of a law firm.  Were not very satisfied with their work - somehow everything went unorganized.  By the way, before registering you should have an office rental contract or a certificate from a landlord.  The address specified there will become your legal address. <br>  Two weeks later we had a full package of documents in our hands: <br>  memorandum of association; <br>  minutes of the general meeting of the company; <br>  charter; <br>  the first few orders for appointment; <br>  extract from the register; <br>  certificate of registration of the insured in the compulsory health insurance fund; <br>  a letter from Rosstat on the assignment of statistical codes; <br>  certificate of state.  registration; <br>  certificate of registration with the tax authority. <br>  Plus printing in a cardboard box.  For all 7500 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Bank, accountant, hosting</b> <br>  The next step was to search for a bank.  Here, three factors were important for us: the location of the bank (not too far from the office), the cost of maintenance and the availability of the Internet bank.  Our choice fell on the bank Avangard.  After 3.5 months I will say that I am not disappointed.  We perform all operations with the help of Internet banking, I appear in the branch only to withdraw money for salary. <br>  After opening an account, do not forget to submit information about it to the tax office within ten days.  Otherwise, the fine - 5,000 rubles.  We, by the way, have forgotten. <br><br>  Hire a remote accountant immediately.  It is quite inexpensive (we pay 1500 per month), but it will save you from talking to the tax and you will always be with whom to consult.  This can be either a freelance accountant or a company employee. <br><br>  Hosting  Do you need or do not need your own web server?  Everyone decides for himself.  A license is required to provide hosting services, so for clients you only provide assistance in hosting, which should be noted in the contract. <br>  But my opinion is better to have than not to have.  Pros: all in one place, more individual approach, do not depend on server neighbors, reliability is often higher.  Our server in Holland, while uptime 100%. <br><br>  <b>Website development and corporate identity</b> <br>  What a web studio without a website?  What an Internet company site looks like is perhaps more important than what its office looks like.  We began to develop the site I will fight the same after they came up with the name.  No, I'm lying.  First, we developed a corporate identity.  Developed a familiar designer at a low cost (we are now working with him on an ongoing basis).  The site design was developed not by the designer who works on our salary, but by a freelancer, with whom we also sometimes cooperate. <br><br>  <b>Initial capital</b> <br>  In order to open a web studio a lot of money is not necessary.  Want numbers?  You are welcome. <br>  In total, we contributed less than 120,000 thousand. <br><br>  Here are some expenses for you to know about the types of expenses: <br>  hosting payment - 6900 rubles.  (for 3 months) <br>  corporate identity development - 3000 <br>  Registration LLC - 7500 <br>  Rent (deposit) - 11300 <br>  Website design - 8060 <br>  Opening a bank account is 1000 (it was not the bank that took it, but the company that registered us Ltd. We threw out the money ‚Äî you can open it yourself, everything is simple). <br>  notary - 2480 (when opening an LLC and a bank account) <br>  envelopes - 62 (I like to send letters) <br>  blue chairs (7 pieces) - 3354 <br>  hanger (cool) - 1500 <br>  Stationery from Metro - 888, the rest from the house. <br>  Tables (3 pcs.) -10070 <br>  dustpan, mat, garbage bags - 183 <br>  Radio Telephone - 1490 <br>  Internet payment (per month) - 2450 <br>  Fax and Consumables - 5206 <br>  XP Professional - 3590 <br>  Business cards - 1100 <br>  Mop (a very necessary thing, have never used it yet) - 144 <br>  Stamps (these are not drugs, they are postal) - 400 <br>  System unit, monitor, printers, scanner (all used, two founders contributed) - 13000 <br>  USB drives - 1248 <br>  network filters - 570 <br>  router - 2300 <br>  broom (also needed as a mop) - 48 <br>  Telephone sockets - 32 <br>  scanner - 2190 <br>  copies of keys for office - 500 <br>  blinds - 4280 <br>  cleaning lady (per month) - 500 <br>  kettle - 1366 <br>  1C- 3000 <br>  For the office we give 11,300 rubles.  per month, at 550 per square.  Two telephone numbers were connected for 5,000 rubles., 500-600 rubles a month for them. <br>  The programmer and project manager work on their laptops.  Headphones and a telephone set I brought from home myself.  Printer paper donated mother-in-law programmer. <br><br><h4>  Difficulties: </h4><br><br>  <b>Portfolio</b> <br>  An empty portfolio is bad.  It pushes customers away.  But what to put there, if the studio has just been formed?  Put the jobs that you did as freelancers.  These are almost every specialist.  <a href="http://magwai.ru/portfolio/site/">Our portfolio includes</a> works created by our designer and programmer, both individually and together, but not yet under the Magway brand.  Now there are already sites developed specifically within the studio. <br><br>  <b>Tax</b> .  Mess.  For three months of work, we had time to start an administrative case for the fact that we are not located at the legal address (although we are located) and block the bank account.  The reason for blocking the account is enchanting: ‚Äúfor failure to submit a declaration for 2008‚Äù.  This is despite the fact that we registered in 2009.  To unlock the account, you have to run and, of course, either the program has hung, the cartridge in the printer has run out, or there is no boss to sign the unblocking decision. <br><br>  <b>Low cost of</b> developing sites in the Volgograd region.  If the <a href="http://blog.magwai.ru/21/">average cost of developing a corporate website</a> in the regions of Russia (excluding Moscow and St. Petersburg) is 165,000 rubles, then in Volgograd the average price is around 35,000 - 40,000 rubles.  At the same time, the salaries of industry specialists are no lower than in other provincial cities. <br>  The situation is aggravated by the fact that one of the local leaders of the web, developing the most sites per year, often lowering prices, sets the price level too low, which is reflected in the entire market. <br><br>  <b>BY.</b>  It‚Äôs a pity for license money, but it‚Äôs hard to do without it.  I, as the ideological opponent of Linux (Linux, do not throw tomatoes!) I purchased Windows XP.  Find it is already very difficult, everywhere Vista is for sale.  My colleagues work on their laptops, where there is Vista.  Plus Linux is a programmer. <br>  For billing and acts bought 1C Enterprise 8. I got used to using 1C, in general of course, it was possible to save money.  Elementary operations can be done in free analogues or even just make a Word template and copy it. <br>  We first set up Open Office, but still it‚Äôs a bad nightmare.  I do not have the strength to rule when everything is crawling in different directions.  While installed the probe MS Office 2007, then we'll see. <br>  My keen desire to buy Kaspersky Anti-Virus was stopped, one of the free versions of Avast was installed.  Archiver free 7-Zip, Total Commander c "Please press button ‚Ññ to start this program!" <br>  A designer with a bunch of his software works at home. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62129/</a></p>
