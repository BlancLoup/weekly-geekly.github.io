  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flash vs HTML5. Our version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  Let's discuss the topic of whether HTML5 will be able to completely replace Flash and when the time comes to change the development tool smoothly. <br>  We did not bypass this topic and, taking the position of supporters of HTML5, expectedly ran into criticism from the flasher.  Say, and the language is ‚Äúraw,‚Äù and it is incredibly difficult to do something on it, and ‚Äúeats up‚Äù no less resources, and in general it is awl on soap ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's take it in order.  Flash is a wonderful technology that faithfully served us for 5 years and with which we made a lot of interesting projects.  Flash remains and for some time will remain a key format for our work. <br><br>  But let's face it - the life cycle of a flash in the form in which we got used to it is coming to an end.  HTML5 provides its service in a lighter form, it does not require the user to install plug-ins, updates and other things that this user is already fed up with.  And from the experience of the Pirogov Bureau, we can say that sales on some sites made in HTML are higher than on flash versions).

      Of course, no one talks about the instant death of flash, HTML5 and flash will get along normally and will coexist for a long time.  But if so far no browser has embedded a flash player in its distribution, hope that with the development of HTML5 the situation for flash will change for the better, only naive can. <br><br>  The main advantage of a flash is the wide visualization capabilities, including work with vector images, video streams, smooth animation of motion, etc. and so on.  And this is one of the shortcomings of today's HTML5. <br><br>  Indeed, HTML5 now does not have a tenth of the opportunities that flash owns.  But note for a moment: HTML5 is not a new programming language, it is familiar to the ears of every HTML user, in which script-based image processing capabilities have appeared.  The standard for working with code that previously needed a visual superstructure in the form of flash technology, got its own toolkit and now does not need to be ‚Äúsubcontracted‚Äù.  Third-party developers are already actively involved in adapting the code to fit their needs - this is how Mozilla creates Canvas 3D with accelerator support.  Everything speaks for the fact that HTML5 expects rapid development in the coming years, and all the shortcomings that exist now will be eliminated in the foreseeable future. <br><br>  Some write <br>  ‚ÄúIt hurts all optimistic about HTML5.  There are many animation moments that flash can realize, ‚Äù <br><br>  our answer is one - <a href="http://nouvellevague.ultranoir.com/">nouvellevague.ultranoir.com</a> <br><br>  What is there that could not be realized due to the "limited" technology?  Those who enumerate what ‚Äúcannot be done with a vskidku‚Äù with HTML5, sign in their own incompetence.  HTML5 allows you to do no less than it allowed to make a flash. <br><br>  Here are some more examples - <a href="http://lights.elliegoulding.com/">lights.elliegoulding.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.beetle.com/">www.beetle.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.citicles.com/">www.citicles.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://mugtug.com/sketchpad/">mugtug.com/sketchpad</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gabereiser.com/flickr/index.html">www.gabereiser.com/flickr/index.html</a> <br><br>  From the user's point of view, the advantages of HTML5 can be felt immediately: cross-browser and cross-platform will make the presentation of the site universal on the vast majority of devices used by the consumer.  HTML5 will put an end to the need for endless updates to the plug-in, since no additional add-ons will be needed for the animation. <br><br>  Of course, a full replacement for Flash in the near future HTML5 will not.  But in the perspective about which we speak, each of the technologies will naturally take its specific place.  And it seems to us that HTML5 will gradually push Flash out of the Internet, and Flash will completely move to other industries, for example, occupying a niche of the tool for creating interactive presentations. <br><br>  How soon this happens depends on Adobe‚Äôs readiness to adequately assess the new balance of power, on how quickly the W3C will approve new web development standards, and website developers will accept the new technology.  There is no doubt that this will happen in the foreseeable future.  Of course, you can take a principled position and deny the inevitable, but it is better to accept the new trend and prepare for it in advance. <br><br>  We have already mastered and actively use HTML5 in our new projects.  By the way, our new site will be on HTML5 :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132856/</a></p>
