Expansion of functions of integration with RSS + Push from Vkontakte groups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0be/313/a4d/0be313a4de4148fc9cad3f62a8b3b288.png"><br><br>  We have not talked about our innovations for a long time, it is time to tell what we have been doing lately.  We run a more detailed blog on <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog">Spark</a> , so the article will contain a brief description of the news + a link to the details. <br><br>  The main thing that we want to tell you is the advanced features of RSS and the connection of the VKontakte group (!).  You can push important news from Vkontakte with keywords and limit the size of messages sent in lines.  More under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Where did the problem come from </h1><br>  Let me remind you that in the process of developing the service, we are faced with the fact that many people do not know how to program, they have personal websites, blogs, etc.  but they don't know how to do the integration.  In some CMS, we managed to make small modifications to send notifications, but still it requires complex actions and at least access to the site itself.

      <br>
      Over time, we found that many make channels of foreign sites, that is, those that people read themselves in order to receive push notifications about news.  It is very convenient and adds utility to the service.  We also began to cooperate with the service of converting various social networks into RSS feeds, but a week ago we found that it no longer works, or it works with significant failures. <br><br>  Also, sometimes there are edits in RSS, we made a warning system for repeated pushing, by checking their similarity from the base. <br><br><h1>  Solving the problem of availability of notifications to ordinary people </h1><br>  We decided to integrate the aggregation of social networks directly into the system and additionally make the setting for filtering and selecting the number of rows. <br><br>  That is, you can take your Vkontakte group, enter ‚ÄúImportant news!‚Äù In the filter and select a limit of 3 lines.  In this case, PushAll will only push entries with this key phrase and only the first 3 lines.  You receive automatic notifications about the most important news. <br><br>  The most important thing that we realized: now any user, without any knowledge in programming, can send automated important push notifications to browsers and smartphones.  Without developing an application, without developing a server and client side, without using an API. <br><br>  There are a lot of news pushing all by hand, most often it is a streamer.  For example, recently we began to cooperate with the <a href="https://pushall.ru/maelstorm">eSports commentator Maelstorm</a> , also the less well-known <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D431">105TV</a> and <a href="https://pushall.ru/only_smiles">Only_Smiles are</a> also notified about <a href="https://pushall.ru/only_smiles">streams</a> .  Automatically via RSS feeds YouTube notify the <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D106">Rozetked</a> and <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D35">GoldenNik channels</a> . <br><br>  More than 20 channels notify about their news, new episodes, etc.  without any knowledge in the development, without using the API, someone manually, and someone through RSS-integration. <br><br>  One of the problems that prompted the development of filters and output restrictions was the <a href="https://pushall.ru/jaskier">Jaskier Studio</a> channel.  They do not have their own site with the release of voice acting, they only have a VKontakte group.  Previously, they wrote each release manually, but it takes a lot of time.  With the new system, their users will receive pushy only about the release of new series and only basic information, and not the entire post.  And posts VKontakte, not related to the output of voice acting will be discarded. <br><br><h1>  IOS application beta test </h1><br><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d6/61a/36d/3d661a36d0064e5fa209d82efa19202d.jpg"><br><br>  We have been testing it for quite a long time, you can request access to the mail, and receive it within 48 hours. <br>  Read more <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/10820/testirovanie-ios-prilozheniya">in the article on Spark.</a> <br><br><h1>  Inactive users, as we returned part of the past </h1><br><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a9/932/553/0a9932553f6dd963254acc92d3f362e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We improved the conversion to add a device by adding an additional hint and did a mailing to those users who forgot to add devices or subscribe to channels. <br><br>  We sent more than 3,700 letters, conversion to open 35%, to return the user 5%.  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/11072/kak-mi-vozvraschaem-15-ushedshih-polzovatelej-onlajn-statistika">Read more here.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/11077/chestnie-rassilki-cherez-pdd-yandex-kak-ne-popast-v-spam">We also told how we sent some of these letters through Yandex PDD and shared general tips on how to configure DKIM, SPF and headers.</a> <br><br><h1>  As statistics, you lose more than 50% of users. </h1><br><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/887/c7c/29c/887c7c29c41f489e818dc04891839c55.png"><br><br>  A month ago, we counted our audience, the number of notifications, the conversion of clicks, receptions of notifications, etc.  We found that in our system, 50% of users receive notifications through a computer, that is, if your notifications are focused only on the mobile platform, you lose 50% of the audience.  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/11207/konversii-i-statistika-kak-vi-teryaete-bolshe-50-auditorii">More in the article.</a> <br><br><h1>  Push notification system </h1><br><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/545/825/851/54582585118d4ae09a49ef96ec6d2c4c.png"><br><br>  We started the rally with the Maelstorm, the prizes are rather purely symbolic, totaling at a cost of somewhere between 600-700 rubles.  Rather, it is an experiment, how to draw a rally not using a classic random access to a VC, but using a competition for the speed of opening notifications. <br>  In more detail about ideas of such draws <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/11726/sistema-rozigrishej-na-osnove-push-uvedomlenij-prizi-dlya-lyubitelej-dota-2">we described here.</a> <br><br>  Also today or tomorrow we will start doing the rally with <a href="https://pushall.ru/metagame">MetaGame</a> .  There will be a random inside PushAll and filling out a special form with verification of the implementation of all items. <br>  The amount of investment turned out to be quite large, I hope it will bring profit, we even tried to recapture some of the costs <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2B%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%259E%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3/posts/6YQSvuYUc1m">by donating</a> <br><br><h1>  Monetization </h1><br>  We have introduced a small compensation for the additional load.  You can top up the balance via Yandex.Money and remove restrictions from RSS.  In this case, you can scan the channel at least every 10 seconds, regardless of the number of subscribers, or the visibility of the channel in the directory (hidden channels).  Also included in this function are named addresses. <br><br>  In fact, this does not give certain advantages and rather works as an additional method of donation.  As for interesting projects, we ourselves remove restrictions from RSS for their normal work and provide name addresses on request. <br><br>  We are currently developing a paid channel system.  If you have interesting content that can be packaged in notifications, you can create a paid channel and receive income from monthly user payments.  You will receive 75% of the money received, 25% of the system takes in the form of a commission for the volume of sent notifications and the provision of services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267589/</a></p>
