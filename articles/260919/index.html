I would like to get rid of the wires to the maximum and make the device independent of the PC.  Make an extensive range of sound, not limited to 7 notes.  Make a convenient interface so that the musician can quickly switch between different sounds.  And the most important thing is to make this thing accessible to musicians.  One of your boards would help me realize this idea. </td><td>  This is the most worthy idea from a humane point of view.

You are well done. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Boards will see their new owners soon!  We wish you a successful realization of your plans!  Well, we move on! <br><br>  Having received these two hundred applications, we thought.  Maybe we didn‚Äôt have some unnecessary circuit boards?  Maybe someone wants to follow our example, if they see an interesting project that can be supported? <br>  So we decided to expand our promotion: we publish a list of all applications, and we offer all masters to join the exchange and donation of boards!  If you want to give unnecessary electronics in good hands for interesting projects, you can either directly write to the authors of the applications, or contact the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sedovartem/">author of the</a> post if you don‚Äôt want to choose good hands yourself. <br><br>  In addition, if a project is of interest to you, you can join it by joining your efforts. <br><br>  We also offer the rest of the post readers to write in the comments what and for what they need.  This we will add to the list.  If you do not have the opportunity to comment on posts on Habr√©, then write under <a href="https://goo.gl/73HLC1">Facebook</a> .

Well, so if your hands itch buy 5 pieces of mini arduinok (+ uart controller for firmware) and what you get tired of from sensors and actuators, try to collect anything that is more complicated than the flashing LED and understand, but you really need it.
