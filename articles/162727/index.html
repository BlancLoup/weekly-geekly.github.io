So another week was over.  The time has come to tell you, our dear friends, all the most interesting and important things that have taken place in the last seven days in the gaming and IT industry.  For those who have not yet met us, we introduce ourselves: we are the editors of the <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/">Gamersweb</a> portal, and before you Logic is a weekly laconic selection of the most interesting news from the world of games and IT.  In general, enough of eloquent words, let's move on to the news. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Apple World </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/144/8f7/383/1448f73833ad8731c0b2d951f26d9559.jpg">

    <ul><li>  Finally <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/zapusk-prodazh-iphone-5-i-ipad-mini-v-rossii/">, the</a> official launch of sales of iPhone 5 and iPad mini <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/zapusk-prodazh-iphone-5-i-ipad-mini-v-rossii/">took place</a> in Russia.  It‚Äôs hard to say how many people were waiting for the official Apple products marked with a proud PCT badge, but it‚Äôs still nice.  We sincerely congratulate all those who waited, I want to believe that it was worth it. </li><li>  Apple <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/apple-snova-proigryivaet-v-sude-2/">loses</a> again in court.  Apparently, this time Apple lawyers did not have time to take anything (‚Äúsomething‚Äù is a light drug, if you remember this story), and the ‚Äúclean‚Äù organism somehow does not work well.  In general, the victory was on the side of MobileMedia. </li><li>  While in Russia there are only official PCT shnye iPad mini tablet computers, within the walls of the company from Cupertino, <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/22378/">they</a> have already <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/22378/">begun</a> work on improving the display quality of these babies.  And rightly so, the Retina would definitely not hinder them. </li><li>  Perhaps the argument between Apple and Samsung fans is a great example of infinity.  However, Samsung‚Äôs top managers <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/produktsiey-apple-polzuyutsya-dazhe-menedzheryi-samsung/">made</a> their choice: Yang Song, who is responsible for the strategic development of the South Korean company, said that he uses Apple technology at home.  There you have it, gentlemen. </li><li>  All of us have been waiting for the moment when Google returns its maps to iOS devices.  They waited for a very long time.  And most recently, it finally happened.  They waited.  It turns out that we waited so long for a reason: Google Maps for iOS <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/google-kartyi-dlya-iphone-luchshe-chem-analogichnyie-ot-android/">came out</a> much better than similar cards for Android. </li><li>  Regular information about Apple TVs <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/televizoryi-ot-apple-zavtra-kotoroe-nastupit-segodnya/">swept</a> the Web like a tumbleweed across the desert.  Tim Cook himself adds fuel to the fire, who in his interview stated that this market is not of such small interest to the company from Cupertino.  Well, it remains only to wait. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  "Zhelezyaki" </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0a/f70/422/e0af70422c3bc8bb7a80d59204bbce32.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  It is time to say goodbye to S Pebble and <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/proshhay-s-pebble-zdravstvuy-galaxy-muse/">greet</a> Galaxy Muse.  It seems that the miniature mp3 player S Pebble from Samsung, presented to the public in May this year at the thematic exhibition in London, is becoming a thing of the past, giving way to its successor, Galaxy Muse.  Apparently, the South Korean company likes to call their products "space". </li><li>  If Samsung releases something new, then Dell, on the contrary, leaves the market.  But don't worry, it's not about computers.  Dell finally <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/dell-okonchatelno-pokinul-ryinok-smartfonov/">leaves</a> the smartphone market.  And, admittedly, he is right. </li><li>  Recently, the entire Internet is littered (in a different way and you will not say) all sorts of rumors about Valve.  But finally, one of them received an official confirmation.  Valve confirmed that they <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/valve-rabotayut-nad-sobstvennoy-domashney-konsolyu/">are working</a> on their own home console, which will be based on their own digital distribution service Steam. </li><li>  Japan has always been a very important market, especially when it comes to games and, accordingly, game consoles.  And now, just the other day, it became known that Nintendo 3DS <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/nintendo-3ds-prodaetsya-luchshe-chem-playstation-3/">overtook</a> the PlayStation 3 in terms of sales. Yes, there‚Äôs definitely something wrong with this world ... </li><li>  Yota Devices promises <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/yotaphone-rossiyskiy-smatrfon-s-dvumya-ekranami/">to release</a> its new product in the fall of 2013.  Russian smartphone YotaPhone will get as many as two screens: one from the front and the other, respectively, from the rear.  In general, we have finally invented something that has long been sold on the domestic market of the previously mentioned Japan.  As they say, better late than never. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  And we would just have to play ... </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f6/fa3/e27/8f6fa3e27473328de452a2e721434e01.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Funcom <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/the-secret-world-teper-bez-mesyachnoy-podpiski/">said</a> that the main MMO about conspiracies, Masonic lodges and the mysteriousness of our world with you, called The Secret World, lost its monthly subscription.  Now, all users who buy the game will immediately have access, at least until the end of their days. </li><li>  There are <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/playstation-all-stars-battle-royale-2-nahoditsya-v-razrabotke/">rumors</a> in the network that the continuation of PlayStation All-Stars: Battle Royale is in development.  That's just interesting: how many of us are waiting for this sequel?  And is it a bit early? </li><li>  Good news for Nintendo fans.  The user of the social network Reddit <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/zhitel-ogayo-prodaet-kollektsiyu-igr-super-nintendo-za-24-999/">sells a</a> collection of games for Super Nintendo, which includes all 721 (!), Released in the United States, Mexico and Canada for only $ 24,999.  Do not miss your chance, as they say. </li><li>  THQ has <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/otkryityi-predzakazyi-limitirovannogo-izdaniya-metro-last-light/">opened</a> pre-orders for a limited edition Metro: Last Light.  All those who pre-order the game will receive a disc, a special mode ‚ÄúRanger Mode‚Äù (from Metro 2033) and ‚ÄúRanger load-out‚Äù, which includes special bullets for the purchase of weapon upgrades, and a bonus machine, AKS 74U.  It is worth adding that quite recently THQ distributed the first part of the series, Metro 2033, completely free of charge in exchange for likes of its Facebook page. </li><li>  Microsoft decided to please their adult users by going to meet them: the company from Redmond said that games with a PEGI 18 rating would still <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/v-windows-store-budut-igryi-s-reytingom-pegi-18/">appear</a> in the Windows Store.  What else can you say: triple ‚ÄúHooray!‚Äù, Friends! </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Some news for dessert </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f1/1db/af4/5f11dbaf4aee840384b53e7b7465d05e.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  The European Football Union and HTC have <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/uefa-i-htc-partneryi-navsegda/">entered into a</a> partnership agreement.  Now HTC becomes the official partner of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League in the field of tablet computers and smartphones.  The agreement will enter into force early next year. </li><li>  The Xbox 360 team is pleased <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/v-blizhayshee-vremya-v-xbox-live-poyavyatsya-karaoke-skydrive-i-deezer/">to</a> announce new entertainment services that will appear on Xbox LIVE in more than 40 countries until the spring of 2013.  The following offers will be available to Russian Xbox LIVE users in the near future: Karaoke, SkyDrive and Deezer. </li><li>  Valve <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/news/valve-kupili-novuyu-studiyu/">acquired</a> Star Filled Studios, which has a staff of only 2 people - Jeff Gates and Tod Sempl.  They worked on projects like Diablo 3, Plants Vs.  Zombies and Spore.  It also became known that this ‚Äúcouple‚Äù will head the new Valve office in San Francisco. </li></ul><br><br><hr><br>  On our <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/">site</a> you can find news, blogs and podcasts on gaming and IT topics!
