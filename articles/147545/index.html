  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linguistic problems in computer science</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is not a secret to anyone that in the modern world over the past few decades there have been significant technological changes that inevitably have an impact on the social sphere and education.  A significant (possibly dominant) role in the development of these changes is associated with the development of information technology. <br><br>  Without going into the definition of theoretical prerequisites, I state the fairly obvious fact that computer science has particularly close synergistic links not only with mathematics, but also with linguistics (for this reason I was always surprised by the fact that within school education computer science was long positioned in a single block with mathematics, and the linguistic aspect, and in the study of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand in the analysis of learning problems was not actually considered). <br><br>  Historically, a significant part of the tasks solved in the field of information technology is connected with the use of English: in this subject area, the English language has assumed the role of an ‚Äúinternational language of science‚Äù, just like in medicine, biology and other sciences the role belonged to the Latin language.  And if in the English-speaking countries the problem of language adaptation in the subject area under consideration is hardly essential, then in the Russian education system it is defined and requires effort to overcome.

      Consider alternative solutions to this problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It would seem that the replacement of English concepts with Russian-language equivalent concepts makes the threshold for entering the subject area much lower and facilitates the process of learning and teaching (including due to lower requirements to the level of teacher competencies), however, taking this approach as a model, should have abandoned the Latin and in the periodic system of the chemical elements of DI Mendeleev, and accordingly in the writing of chemical formulas, and in the writing of trigonometric functions, and in physical formulas.  It is obvious that the shortcomings of this approach will be associated with the isolation of the student within the framework of a certain educational paradigm and the limitation of the level of accessibility of the world information and communication resources in this subject area. <br><br>  My opinion is that computer science, as a subject of a comprehensive school, clearly lacks the active support that could be laid down in the educational standard of the English language. <br><br>  I will cite a fragment of the codifier of content elements and requirements for the level of training of students who have mastered the basic general education programs of basic general education, for conducting in 2011 a state (final) certification (in the new form) in the ENGLISH LANGUAGE: <br><br>  <b>Subject content of speech</b> <br><ul><li>  A (Interpersonal) Family Relationships </li><li>  B (Interpersonal) relationships with friends and at school. </li><li>  The appearance and characteristics of a person </li><li>  G Leisure and hobbies (sports, music, reading, going to the cinema / theater, discos, cafes).  youth fashion </li><li>  D Shopping.  Pocket money </li><li>  F School life.  Subjects studied and attitudes towards them.  Vacation.  School exchanges </li><li>  3. Problems of choosing a profession and the role of a foreign language. </li><li>  And Country / countries of the target language and home country.  Their geographical location, climate, population, cities and villages, attractions </li><li>  K Country / countries of the studied language and home country.  Their cultural characteristics (national holidays, significant dates, traditions, customs) </li><li>  L Outstanding people of the native country and countries of the language being studied, their contribution to science and world culture </li><li>  M Travel in the countries of the studied language and in Russia </li><li>  H Technical progress </li><li>  About Global Problems of the Present </li><li>  P Media (press, television, radio, Internet) </li><li>  P Nature and problems of ecology.  Healthy lifestyle </li></ul><br>  Only in points Z, N and P, the mentioned subject matter may be indirectly affected, but for qualitative support of the subject ‚ÄúInformatics‚Äù a methodically systematized educational complex of specially prepared materials is required. <br><br>  Perhaps the development of a specialized course in the framework of a foreign language study program is a more universal and effective way of reducing the adaptive threshold of perception of the terminological base in the process of studying computer science? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147545/</a></p>
