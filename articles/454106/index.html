As for me, there is no easy life at all.  But in recent years I have learned something, and it changed everything. <br><br>  Our life is determined by how we think.  But thinking is difficult, so we try to do it less often.  Helen Keller put it very well: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPeople don't like to think.  To think is to come to conclusions.  And the findings are not always pleasant. " </blockquote><br>  I will express 15 thoughts that will forever change your lifestyle.  Ready?  Go.

      <b>Transferred to <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D15ideas">Alconost</a></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Think big, act locally </h3><br>  Want to create a big company?  Change the lives of people?  Make your own contribution to the well-being of the world?  Earn a million dollars? <br><br>  If an idea comes to mind - do not restrain yourself, let it turn around.  You might think: <br><br><ul><li>  "This is too difficult." <br></li><li>  ‚ÄúSomeone else is already doing this.‚Äù <br></li></ul><br>  So what?  Nobody forbids marking high - there‚Äôs nothing to lose.  However, you need to act little by little.  Invest, try and do not lose your head.  All you need is one big win.  But if you aim low, the result will be low. <br><br><h3>  2. Problems are unanswered questions. </h3><br>  I don‚Äôt understand why people are afraid of problems and nervous: ‚ÄúOh, this is the worst thing that could happen!‚Äù Every time, worrying about a problem, you are essentially sabotaging your own life.  To be afraid and nervous is completely meaningless. <br><br>  Remember: a problem is just an unanswered question.  So keep calm and look for the answer. <br><br><h3>  3. Build relationships on a solid basis. </h3><br>  Reasons to enter into relationships may be different.  For example, these are the bad ones: money, fear of loneliness, moral violence, the need for attention.  If the relationship does not stick, you have tried to fix them several times - it means it's time to disperse. <br><br>  Love has no opposite, "dark" side: you cannot love and hate a person at the same time.  The basis of all relationships should be love, respect, support, trust, patience, good pastime, laughter, sadness and more support. <br><br><h3>  4. nothing happens for free </h3><br>  Anyway, you have to pay for everything: money, time (and it‚Äôs the most valuable thing you have) or other resources. <br><br>  Life is a business, and smart businessmen spend resources wisely.  How to do it?  Calculate your costs and do not waste resources (especially time). <br><br><h3>  5. Do not be afraid to make decisions. </h3><br>  It may seem to you that if a decision is not made, then there will be no harm - but this is not true.  The worst thing that can be is not to make a decision at all and stay idle. <br><br>  To wait, postpone, doubt, study the question for too long is all useless.  If you need to make a decision, get together and do it.  And if it turns out to be wrong, apologize and make another decision. <br><br><h3>  6. Become a leader today. </h3><br>  Sometimes you find yourself in the role of a master, sometimes in the role of a slave.  You can be a boss at work and a slave at home - this is completely normal.  Leadership is not related to the official position. <br><br>  Do you know what's abnormal?  When everyone looks at each other and no one wants to take responsibility for themselves.  Therefore, decide that the responsibility will be on you - and so you will become a leader. <br><br><h3>  7. Results gives productivity </h3><br>  The only thing that helps to get something out of nothing is work, and no matter how intelligent it is. <br><br>  <a href="http://dariusforoux.com/know-thy-time/">Learn to appreciate efficiency in everything</a> .  The most important thing is the result.  Do business and go to the next. <br><br><h3>  8. Imagine you are a seller. </h3><br>  We all sell something all the time: on a date you sell yourself, on an interview you, too. <br><br>  When selling yourself, speak openly, honestly and accurately.  Do not waste your time on those who still do not like you.  It doesn't matter how many people don‚Äôt want to work with you or use your product.  The main <i>thing</i> is to find those to whom you or your product are <i>interesting</i> . <br><br><h3>  9. To increase self-confidence, develop your skills. </h3><br>  If you do not believe in yourself, do not try to gain confidence in motivational articles, speeches or books. <br><br>  <a href="http://dariusforoux.com/build-self-confidence-need-win-life/">You can increase self-confidence only by learning to do something well.</a>  How?  Learn, try, get results - and learn again, and so for many years in a row.  Self-confidence will slowly grow every day. <br><br><h3>  10. Appreciate friends </h3><br>  People are social animals: remaining alone, we quickly wither.  It may seem that you personally do not need friends - but you are mistaken.  So be kind to each other and respect your friends: remember that they have their own lives. <br><br>  This is especially true when you get older and more responsibilities appear (and time becomes less).  Everything changes around, people - too.  But the connection between them remains. <br><br><h3>  11. Do not believe everything you see. </h3><br>  We live in a world where everything around requires attention: ‚ÄúLook!  Look at me! ‚ÄùEveryone wants to be famous, and therefore they tend to flicker more often into the attention of others. <br><br>  Do not believe all success stories in a row.  YouTubeers, Instagram models, millionaire entrepreneurs ... they seem perfect - but only from the outside.  It is not necessary to become a cynic - it‚Äôs enough to rely on facts, not on appearance. <br><br><h3>  12. Learn to love criticism. </h3><br>  If someone finds the time to criticize you, that person should be thanked.  ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù - you ask.  Because criticism is your fuel. <br><br>  Criticism helps to improve yourself, your product, your services.  And if she doesn‚Äôt have any good grain, it can make you angry - which is also good, this kind of anger is useful: ‚ÄúWell, I'll show them all of them!‚Äù <br><br>  Do not be a mattress - take criticism as a champion. <br><br><h3>  13. First of all, take care of your own body. </h3><br>  No matter how unpleasant it may sound, you cannot fully control your own health - you can only influence it: eat healthy food, do physical exercises and not put all sorts of rubbish into your body. <br><br>  Raise your lazy ass - and go!  It is necessary not just to hold on for a week or two - every day should be the day of a healthy lifestyle.  After all, if you can not do it, then <i>what can</i> you do?  Consider that you train for the future - because the stronger you are, the better. <br><br><h3>  14. Happiness is a choice. </h3><br>  <a href="http://dariusforoux.com/stop-spending-time-in-your-head/">Your own thoughts are controlled by you.</a>  This means that it is you who decide what to do with your life.  If you are unhappy, angry, or disappointed - the reason for you. <br><br>  I always thought so: ‚ÄúI will never be happy.  You need to become rich, have a luxury car and buy a big house. ‚Äù <br><br>  But I was wrong.  You can be happy with what you already have - you just need to make the appropriate decision.  And when it gets better, you will still be happy. <br><br><h3>  15. Create </h3><br>  When you create something (no matter what exactly), you are actively doing something - solve a problem or entertain people. <br><br>  So instead of consuming mountains of information, products, and entertainment produced by others, spend some of this time and create something for yourself.  You don't have to do it alone - you can do it in a company. <br><br>  It doesn‚Äôt matter what you are doing - do something useful. <br><br>  No need to sit and read another article - go and do something. <br><br>  Are you still here?  Well march to create! <br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/game-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D15ideas">localization of games</a> , <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D15ideas">applications and websites</a> in 70 languages.
