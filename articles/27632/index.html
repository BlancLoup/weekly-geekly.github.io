  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Adobe Air - stick them in your desktop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet eats into our lives like salt in our boots on a cold winter day, and we just continue to rejoice about it.  Daily opening these networks of evil like classmates, VKontakte, tweeter, facebook, and what the hell is not joking - habr, we eagerly opened our eyes looking for updated information.  But on the way of the misguided social Internet wanderer, his browser majesty always invariably accompanies.  Yes, let it be firefox or opera, it does not matter - the browser remains a browser with all its limitations.  To get to the Internet to start, you have to run it.  One of the most interesting developments of Adobe - Adobe AIR allows you to get rid of ‚Äúbrowser tyranny‚Äù and get direct access to your favorite web services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>What is Adobe AIR?</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR</a> is, in simple terms, a tool for porting Web applications to the desktop.  This is an attempt by Adobe to combine such concepts as the Internet and the desktop into a coherent whole.  This is exactly what the Mozilla guys should have done instead of the <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D275">Prism</a> already mentioned.  Agree, it is much more convenient to read the tape of friends on twitter or friendfeed, and also to leave comments not through the browser, but with the help of some softly sitting for a while in the tray or just read RSS, view mail and videos from YouTube as if - in an ordinary player, all this will help you to implement AIR, as well as a number of ready-made applications for it. <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/airwallpaper.jpg"><br>  The advantages of this platform can be singled out, cross-platform - the developers assure that AIR will work equally well for both <a href="">Windows</a> and <a href="">Mac OS</a> and naturally for <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air_linux.html">Linux-systems</a> (which I honestly doubt a little, in such moments I am especially glad that you are the owner of a proven Windows XP time <img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)">  ) Among the shortcomings, it is possible to distinguish that the applications on the AIR even moved to the desktop, but in my heart these are all the same small utilities for working with Internet sites; therefore, in most situations, the functionality of the programs could be completely realized site.  But let's not get hung up on the little things.  It‚Äôs better to see once than to read five times, especially for toys like AIR, so you should better look at the screen ... <br><br>  The first application on which I appreciated the capabilities of Adobe AIR was the notorious <a href="http://alertthingy.com/">Alert Thingy</a> - the client for working with the social aggregator <a href="http:">friendfeed</a> (I recall that when, I already talked about it in the <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D133">evolution of blogging</a> , as well as talking about the <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D302">facebook</a> application <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D302">for friends</a> ).  To my surprise, I saw a really full-fledged reference client.  It had everything that was needed to work with friendfeed: it was not only a ribbon of friends and a form of comments - Alert Thingy skillfully folded into a tray, filled with bells when new messages arrived, and also reduced links using the TinyUrl.com service, and in addition supported it working with twitter and flickr, and all this is wrapped up in several beautiful templates for the client himself - what else do you need for social happiness ?? <br><img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/2.jpg" alt="undefined"><br>  For alternatives, too, is not stagnant.  Didn't like Alert Thingy?  Try <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">twhirl</a> !  Initially, he was conceived as a client for <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> microblogging service, but now with the help of it you can also connect your friendfeed account.  Not hooked one or the other?  Please alternative to alternative to <a href="http://mysocial247.com/air">mysocial24 √ó 7</a> .  In general, microblogging lovers will not remain offended - it would be time to try and choose the best for themselves. <br><br>  But not a microblogging valuable AIR.  The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/readair/">ReadAir</a> application is a desktop client for the well-known Google Reader service.  As in the case of Alert Thingy in the program window, you can do everything that you would have done on the site itself.  Of the features of the program, the developers highlight full synchronization with your Google account, search for your feeds, the ability to edit tags, auto login and auto-update.  I think every Google Reader user dreamed about such a program - after all, keeping a tab open with him is really troublesome, but an open ReadAir is just right, an ideal desktop RSS client, naturally, if you are satisfied with Google Reader.  Among the shortcomings - the program completely refused to work through a proxy, so for now the developers will not understand this problem, for me there is a big fat cross on it. <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ddf3pb2d_84c9wbhwdf_b.gif"><br>  <a href="http://www.doominow.com/">Doomi</a> is another great application for Adobe Air with its help, you will always have a tool at your fingertips to work with so-called to-do lists.  The program is simple, there are no settings there in principle, only the most necessary and quite suitable for daily tasks, probably for this and the task execution interval starts from one hour to one day. <br>  In the future, the developers plan to add skins to the program and do what the program lacked from the very beginning - Offline / Online synchronization, so I think it‚Äôs worth keeping track of the updates for this little crust, perhaps for many it will become a real solution to the problems. <br>  Video services were not left without attention either.  for example, the <a href="http://www.riaforge.co.uk/go/flvplay/">FLVPlay</a> application is, if you can put it that way, <a href="http://youtube.com/">youtube</a> home delivery.  It is enough to enter a keyword or username on youtube and the program will carefully sort the videos according to the specified parameters, and, if necessary, play them in the same window.  Unlike your colleagues in the workshop, about which I wrote above, FLVPlay does not have advanced functionality, therefore you can only find, play and download the necessary video from youtube in flv format in the program, and besides it does not support Russian at all.  But the developers of another AIR application have gone further than their colleagues.  Their <a href="http://www.mooflair.com/">mooFlair</a> program allows <a href="http://www.mooflair.com/">you</a> to view videos not only from YouTube, but also from <a href="http://www.blip.tv/">BlipTv</a> , <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion</a> , as well as from <a href="http://www.metacafe.com/">Metacafe</a> .

    <img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/ddf3pb2d_87qdfsvthq_b.gif"><br>  In <a href="http://www.mooflair.com/">mooFlair,</a> you can create your own playlists, regardless of the account on the site, view the video in full screen, convenient sorting of the videos found, and a more advanced interface - this is what distinguishes this player from its predecessor, but as is the case with FlvPlay - Do not wait for the support of the Russian language, the search is carried out only in English. <br>  If you are satisfied with watching videos on youtube itself, you also want to download videos to your computer - the tiny <a href="http://theflashblog.com/%3Fp%3D363">AIRTube</a> application will help you, after installation, you just need to enter the address of the video on YouTube and AirTube will give you a link to the FLV file. <br>  This is only a small part of programs written using Adobe AIR.  The rest you will find on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm%3Fevent%3DproductHome%26amp%3Bexc%3D24%26amp%3Bloc%3Den_us">official site</a> , as well as on the site <a href="http://freshairapps.com/">freshairapps</a> . <br>  As you can see, most Air programs have an attractive interface, but in terms of functionality they are not much different from their Web ancestors.  I hope that soon Adobe AIR will somehow solve this problem, but program developers will not stagnate.  For now, it remains for us to use even small, but moderately convenient utilities, the number of which is growing every day. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D386">AD28</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27632/</a></p>
