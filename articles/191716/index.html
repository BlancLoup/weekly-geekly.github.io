Thanks to testing, it was possible to improve the project, as well as to purchase the necessary power equipment for its own data center.  <i>Below is a case about testing.</i> </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>About the project:</b> <br>  <i><a href="http://yopolis.ru/">Yopolis</a></i> is a politically neutral platform for community initiatives.  One of the main functions of the project is to increase the level of public and political consciousness and to solve key problems in the field of interaction between the state and society.  In the social network, which opened at the end of 2012, today there are already almost 110 thousand participants who hold an active civil position from 1075 cities of the Russian Federation.

      <b>Tasks:</b> <br>  The launch of a new project is always preceded by a series of preparatory stages.  Large-scale initiatives can not enter the market without thorough testing and confidence of the performers in the performance of the solution.  By launching the Yopolis project to the market, the Svyaznoy Tsentr company set a task for the team of Roman Musin, at that time the technical director of the Svyaznoy TsR company *, to choose a platform and conduct a comprehensive testing of the system's performance. <br><br>  <b>Platform Selection:</b> <br>  During the period of choosing a platform for testing, Roman, who previously worked in a well-known Russian project to develop cloud platforms, approached the issue as an expert who knew all the technologies from the inside and considered the leading foreign and Russian platforms. <br><blockquote>  Roman Musin said: ‚ÄúAmong overseas cloud providers, we reviewed the American Amazon and GoGrid.  Amazon was almost immediately removed from the list.  The EC2 platform needs to be individually customized for each project, and these are large time and labor costs.  The GoGrid turned out to be the most promising and powerful, but it also didn‚Äôt fit due to the peculiarities of the Internet project and the duration of the pings to the server located in the USA. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Since the Yopolis web project is focused on the Russian audience, it is important that the user gets access to the system without delay due to the response time of the remote server.  The site should be updated promptly, respectively, its hosting should be in Russia.  Coordination of documents and financial statements should also be consistent with the standards of the legislation of the Russian Federation. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI began to look at Russian‚Äú clouds ‚Äù.  Top 5 "cloud" providers in Russia is well known.  It was only necessary to carefully analyze the site, i.e.  those technical components on which they work.  As a result, we chose ActiveCloud.  This provider is different from the others in that it uses a conservative ‚Äúcloud‚Äù solution, ‚Äùadds Roman Musin.  Roman explained that by ‚Äúconservative‚Äù he means a ready-made, time-tested solution with good reviews - the CloudStack * platform from Citrix, which underlies ActiveCloud's ‚Äúcloud‚Äù. <br>  ‚ÄúCloudStack is a well-known and proven solution, it is used throughout the world.  I prefer the proven tools.  In my opinion, judging by the reliability of the solution used, it is one of the leaders of the Russian ‚Äúcloud‚Äù market, ‚Äùclarifies Roman Muchin. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>Implementation:</b> <br>  Selecting the "cloud" ActiveCloud, a team of technical experts deployed on it a model of their system and began testing.  For this purpose, such tools as Tsung were chosen, which allows to simulate the load according to a specific scenario, and QRator, which is responsible for generating external traffic and system loads. <br>  As part of the creation of a future web project in the ActiveCloud cloud, load testing was conducted.  The load was checked taking into account 1 million users per day with the following tools: Tsung, database, configuration, PhP, balancers, QRator.  Servers in the cloud were duplicated, 18 basic subsystems were tested - balancers, databases, binary data storage, storage, etc.  The testing process was as follows: 2 weeks tested the entire system and collected errors, the next 2 weeks corrected errors, then 2 months analyzed the result.  At the end of the work, it was possible to simulate the system, identify the bottlenecks in the code, determine the required number of virtual machines. <br><br>  <b>Results:</b> <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe system turned out to be balanced: from whatever side the load comes in - it is distributed over different nodes, there are no overloads.  The metric we were guided by is the peak traffic load on the system (about 1 million users).  And this project has successfully passed the test, Roman sums up.  - Thanks to ActiveCloud staff for help with system startup.  Thanks to the flexible and scalable ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of the provider, we were able to identify a number of errors at the initial stage and improve our project before release, as well as purchase the necessary equipment for its data center. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúCollaboration with experts from Svyaznoy TSR showed how high the level of IT specialists is in Russia now.  This is a good trend when companies use pilots before starting a project.  They provide an opportunity at an early stage to assess financial and labor costs, analyze errors and prepare for launch.  We are very pleased to receive a good assessment of the Svyaznoy professionals and the fact that they chose our cloud solution, ‚Äùnotes Anton Gavrilov, head of the ActiveCloud sales team by Softline (AktivHost RU). </blockquote><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/917/86b/271/91786b271f9eaff8eefa89b6b1e681e6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <a href="">Test CloudServer</a> <br><br><br>  - <i>CloudStack</i> ‚Äî The <i>Citrix platform</i> is a key component of the cloud product portfolio.
