For almost 3 years, I and a couple more people have been <a href="http://www.gadgetblog.ru/">blogging</a> about various electronic devices, fetishes and nishtyaks.  We like it, we do it for ourselves, we write with love for what we write about. <br><br>  At this point, thousands of bloggers will look at me, who are essentially no different from me.  And I completely agree with this - today only the lazy does not write about what he really likes.  Only there is one "but." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúGetting started is half the battle!‚Äù Says one clever proverb.  In our business to put Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla or any other engine easier than ever.  In ten minutes everything is ready, the first test post is set up and sent.  After a couple of months, the fuse disappears and you have to look for sources of income - banner or contextual advertising, custom posts, sales links, finally.  If lucky and well-done author, the blog "survives."  But even in this case, after n-months, a year, one and a half, a moment comes when the flow of visitors becomes stable, and you realize that you can hardly get out of your ‚Äúdiary‚Äù anymore. <br><br>  Practically the same happened to me.  In 2006 there were not many websites about gadgets, and blogs were becoming more and more popular.  It was in this wave that I decided to start running my own <a href="http://www.gadgetblog.ru/">GadgetBlog</a> .  The site quickly gained momentum, the search engines loved it, everything went well.  I found first one author, later another.  Advertising revenue paid for all the costs of the blog, but no more.  After 2 years, I realized that I could hardly squeeze more, but I did not want to invest huge money in a hobby.

      After a bit of thought, I saw the reason - the similar blogs became dark, some of them were abandoned, some frankly merged content from each other, some try to stand out from the general heap.  Wordpress has become the ideal. <br><br>  That is why I decided to write an engine that would completely satisfy my needs.  The plans were ease for the server, simplicity for the user, digestibility for search engines and so on.  First they helped with the design, but then ‚Äúpainted it myself‚Äù.  There were more ideas, after the realization of one, two more appeared from her, I liked them all.  Layout and programming on their own.  All about everything for 2-3 months.  And even at the moment, ideas appear in my head and unrealized ‚Äúchips‚Äù are occasionally remembered. <br><br>  What he is now suits me.  Writing to the blog again was nice.  Who is interested - please evaluate the merits and point out the disadvantages.  Always happy to criticize. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63700/</a></p>
