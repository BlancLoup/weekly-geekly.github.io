  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ICANN privatization postponed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On September 30, 2006, the next two-year contract between the US Department of Commerce and ICANN expires.  Apparently, the Americans still extend this contract, so the privatization of ICANN is again postponed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, the US government controls the root DNS servers and the entire domain name registration system on the Internet through the US Department of Commerce, the non-commercial Internet Assigned Name and Numbering Corporation (ICANN) and <a href="http://www.verisign.com/">VeriSign</a> .  ICANN oversees the allocation of domain names internationally, and VeriSign has a tight contract with ICANN.  No major changes to the domain name system can be made without the approval of the Commerce Department. <br><br>  Representatives of the world community have long appealed to the American authorities with a proposal to voluntarily give up control over the Global Network.  This greatest de facto invention has already become a world heritage.  The Internet is now playing an increasingly important role in world commerce, global communications, the organization of social life and even the personal life of hundreds of millions of people around the world.  Therefore, many countries are already thinking about creating their own DNS systems as an alternative to the American system (this has already happened in China). <br><br>  Americans do not want to allow the collapse of the World Wide Web into separate fragments and have long since planned the privatization of ICANN.  But how privatization will take place and when it will happen - these questions still remain unanswered.  On Wednesday, the US Department of Commerce organized a <a href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/news/BF2189B3D34E4B89CC2571B800199ECC">hearing</a> to discuss one question: did the renewal of the next two-year contract with ICANN on September 30, 2006, or permanently give up Internet control?  Apparently, the Department of Commerce again tends to the first option.

      It must be said that the privatization of ICANN is not postponed for the first time.  This organization was founded in 1998 and immediately began to act under the supervision of the US Department of Commerce.  It was originally planned that in 2000 this supervision will be abolished and ICANN will receive complete freedom, but upon the occurrence of the deadline, the officials decided otherwise.  The same story repeated in 2002 and 2004.  Apparently, the same thing will happen now - the two-year contract will be renewed again. <br><br>  Americans doubt that ICANN can exist without government oversight.  It may come under the too strong influence of foreign governments, which the Americans cannot allow.  Thus, ICANN privatization is postponed.  Obviously, this will cause a new wave of indignation among the world community, but, in fact, no sensation has occurred.  Six months ago, the Americans made it clear that they are unlikely to give up control of the DNS system in the near future, "because they do not want to risk the stability of the Internet." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4216/</a></p>
