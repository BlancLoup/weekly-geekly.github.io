  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Robotics, as one of the aspects of the formation of a non-monetary economy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Economic development throughout human history has made a major contribution to the progress of civilization.  The economy today continues to play a dominant role in competitive social development, both at the intergovernmental level and within each country.  But the futurologists added another problem to the well-known problem of slowing growth: according to their forecasts, after 15 years, robots can become equal and even surpass people with intelligence.  What could be the economy in the near future?  What is waiting for a new community of people and robots: war or peace? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once upon a time, the thought of robots that had firmly entered our lives was breathtaking and promised incredible accomplishments.  "Forget the trouble, stopped running."  We dreamed of a brave new world in which robots are faithful servants, and man enjoys the fruits of his scientific achievements.  So, in the 1970s ‚Äì 1980s, a lot of hope was associated with robotics.  At that time, the triumph of the car over man seemed real, at least in the production process.  Industries predicted the future on the basis of electronically controlled machine tools, lines of robots and other wonders of human thought.  However, the ‚ÄúChinese with a screwdriver‚Äù won a victory over the revolutionary technologies. <br><br>  The 1970s were very hard for world capitalism.  Not only oil, but also many other goods rose in price.  The capital of North America, Europe, and Japan wanted profitability growth, not tax growth and social expansion.  And the neoliberal economic model was rescued by free labor in the peripheral countries.  Capitals were able to find markets for cheap and socially unprotected labor, rushed from North to South, and in most industries, robots had to be forgotten. <br><br>  The energy of human muscles was much cheaper than the power for new machines, the introduction of which has become limited.  The industry, with the exception of the production of computers, telephones and other electronic devices, entered the era of thirty years of stagnation.  Vehicles and industrial enterprises have changed little.  But now this era is coming to an end.

      Before the 2008 crisis, talks about the imminent triumph of robotics were most often pointless.  ‚ÄúSerious economists‚Äù every time upset dreamers with axioms like limbs of oil and an excess of cheap labor.  However, in 2008 the situation changed.  The model of neoliberal capitalism has fallen into a severe crisis.  The abundance on the planet of uneducated powerless and inexpensive workers has ceased to seem a reliable base for economic growth.  It became obvious that a cheap worker no longer provides for cheaper goods and at the same time cannot consume as much as Europeans and Americans do.  The economy needs to maintain demand; a new policy is needed to regulate and create it.  And including for this, labor must remain expensive: employees need to buy manufactured goods for something. <br><br>  At the same time, it should not be underestimated that the introduction of efficient technologies can threaten capital gains: the prices of some goods have fallen so much that their production in terms of capital growth becomes unprofitable.  Hence the actions of monopolies that slow down the development of the economy: companies, with the help of monopoly power, more and more extort rents from capital.  As a result, there is excess wealth and growing inequality.  Revenues are often received not by those who produce, but by those who own the patents.  There is a new class of people receiving technological rent. <br>  However, the question is not only that the classic term ‚Äúunemployment‚Äù will begin to lose its adequacy.  The problem of market competition in the conditions of mass robotization did not receive a serious discussion.  According to the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and his colleagues Kenett Rogoff, there will be even fewer jobs than now, everyone will live on credit, and the world will be ruled by several monopolist companies with a small number of employees and a large number of robots <br><br>  P. Krugman "sees signs of a revolution of robots and does not expect anything good from it."  Cheap Asian labor will become less and less needed.  Profit from the sale of goods will receive those who own the capital necessary for production.  Capital will turn into the only growth factor - unlike human labor, which will depreciate and no longer affect growth, since its share in the economy (the share of wages in the value of production) will steadily decline (Fig. 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f32/68e/162/f3268e162420f13f5d341a9e8b085d68.gif" alt="image"><br>  Figure 1. The reduction in the share of labor in industrial products <br><br>  According to P. Krugman, it is less and less important that the worker is able.  Benefit gets the one who owns the capital.  And therefore, recognizes the Nobel laureate, the theory of Karl Marx on the struggle of labor with capital becomes quite real.  In fact, the concentration of capital contributes to the strengthening of monopolies.  Monopolies are invested in new technologies that contribute to capital increase.  The circle closes. <br><br>  Thus, traditional recommendations ‚Äî retraining personnel, opening new industries where the use of robots is not very effective, encouraging labor migration within the country and abroad, etc. ‚Äî in changing conditions that are increasingly different from modern ones, will work worse.  Because the competitive, market relations of people will inevitably be replaced by the logic of interacting robots. <br><br>  The emergence of new cars in itself does not change the society.  Robots can provide an abundance of cheap and better products, and maybe even help orient their production to individual requests. <br>  However, social conflicts can not do.  Goods need consumers, and in the conditions of a revolution in robotics and power engineering, many old professions will be under severe blow.  Without addressing the issue of stimulating consumers, providing them with work and livelihood is necessary.  The problem will not be supplying consumers with the necessary goods, but rather how to provide the mass of products with a sufficient number of consumers. <br><br>  Therefore, one of the most important problems for the global economy will be employment policy.  What awaits workers whose professions will be unnecessary due to the automation of production and services?  One will have to look for places in the social security system, others will have to learn.  Over time, it will be difficult to get a janitor, seller or waiter.  The factory worker will be required to control the lines of robots, and not to compete with them in the speed of operations. <br><br>  But jobs will need a lot.  Therefore, in the new conditions, their creation will have to deal primarily with the state.  The driving force of employment can - at least for a while - be the state sector and the social sphere.  There are reserves.  The school will start moving from factory-type training to individual or group mentoring, which means that the need for doctors, researchers, teachers and educators will be enormous.  Many jobs will be created in the spectrum of "man for man."  And maybe many people who ruin their time in the office routine will switch to work in science, which will receive priority in the eyes of society. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf your work is not connected with creative thinking, analytical thinking, as well as relationships with other people, and you work in the office or in the service sector, you are at risk,‚Äù said Professor Ed Hess, noting that, according to his data, robots will replace people in about 66 percent of US jobs. <br><br>  Most likely, the need to shorten the work week.  To maintain the economy will require a more developed average worker, as well as more jobs.  Enterprises will probably have to hire more workers under the new laws, rather than overload a small staff.  Due to this, the workers themselves will receive time for development, recreation and consumption.  And this will not be the first time in history when scientific and technical progress will lead to a shorter working week (although nothing has ever happened without class struggle). <br><br>  Perhaps even for the sake of stable employment, the state will have to move from raising the retirement age to reducing it.  Although the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãretirement for people engaged in creative and interesting work will seem strange. <br><br>  One of the ways out of the current situation is the model of a nonmonetary economy, its main theses are as follows: <br><br>  1. Meet the needs of the entire population. <br>  It is achievable with an increase in production volumes due to the involvement of the majority of the population and technical means in the industrial and agricultural sector, the attraction of science and technology, the introduction of new technologies and innovation programs.  All this is possible only after the abolition of the monetary system. <br><br>  2. Equitable distribution of the products of labor. <br>  It is achievable, subject to the abolition of the monetary system, the abolition of capitalist institutions, the introduction of the institution of public property, the introduction of measures for the use of resources and products of production. <br><br>  3. Automation of production and agriculture. <br>  It is achievable after the abolition of the monetary system, the creation of a long-term program of resuscitation and modernization of strategic industrial enterprises, the introduction of new technologies of cybernetic type, including informatization and dispatching of production modules. <br><br>  4. Reduction of the working day. <br>  It is achievable after the abolition of the monetary system, the transfer of the entire population from the trading sector to the production sector and then after the gradual automation of production and the introduction of innovations. <br><br>  5. Disposal of manual labor. <br>  Achievable only after the abolition of the monetary system.  For profit it is profitable to use cheap labor. <br><br>  6. Increase the free time of each person. <br>  Achievable after bringing into production of most of the population, and the modernization of production processes. <br>  Principles perusal help in the formation of a non-monetary economic model in society can be formulated as follows.  The need for goods produced in those countries that do not use non-monetary economic Madele can be covered by selling their goods for money to these countries and then buying the required goods from them.  The quality of the work performed during the day should be noted, if the work does not meet the "standard" for a certain period of time, then the person should be excluded from the system for a certain time.  Quality of work should be determined without human intervention. <br><br>  In a non-monetary economy, the system of employment, employment and incentives will have a complete database of all workers in the country and possess information about where there is a rise in production and an improvement in product quality.  Conscious workers will be promoted to governing bodies, poor workers will be transferred to more primitive places.  A bad employee will be required to upgrade their qualifications and receive training.  The society will be interested in that all people understand the meaning of their work and the degree of responsibility.  In the initial stages of economic development, in special cases, society will create special gifts for the best workers and deprive a poor worker of any material benefits.  However, the main goal of society will still be to free production from the human factor, so that all the work is done by machines.  The working day of a person in a non-monetary economy will decrease in the first year by an hour due to the transfer of the entire working-age population to production areas, and the working day will decrease every year and work will be optimized so that the best result is achieved with the lowest labor costs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362057/</a></p>
