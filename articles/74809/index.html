First, volunteers who teach our grandmothers for free, almost everyone knows only Windows (XP +).  Secondly, children and grandchildren of grandmothers, who give them computers and set them up and help them in case of something, are also known in the overwhelming majority of Windows.  Thirdly, Windows XP is fairly fast and easy to install and configure, and it is fast on Pentium 3, and even more or less adequately works on Pentium 2, and it is these computers that are overwhelmingly for us and give to our project.

      However, we do not intend to pirate, and therefore, in early 2009, negotiations were held with a representative of Microsoft in Russia, Leonid Klyuev.  Of these, the following information became known - for non-profit organizations (NJCs) there are two possibilities to obtain software. <br><br>  The first opportunity is to join the <a href="http://www.infodonor.ru/">Infodonor</a> program (this is not a Microsoft project), and get software for about 4% of the regular retail price.  You see, the discount is quite substantial :) The conditions for receiving overshadow the joy of discount - first, you still have to pay, although not very much, and second, you can get only 80 licenses of one software product under the Infodonor program , and only once every two years.  That is, after the expiration of two years, you can apply again and get another 80 licenses, but two years is a period.  And the quantity may not be enough for us - 20 classes are planned for the opening of the _minimum_, and in each one - from 4 to 8-10 computers. <br><br>  The second possibility is the Cybergrants program from Microsoft itself.  If I understand correctly, then you can get any number of licenses _free_, but also only once every two years, and - only on the existing real technology.  Given that computers and parts come in gradually, and classes open in stages, this option is also not quite suitable. <br><br>  Thus, the question of holding additional negotiations with Microsoft to solve this problem is being addressed, as well as hesitating thoughts about switching to OSS. <br><br>  <b>Oss?</b> <br><br>  As for the use of Linux in training, this question is interesting in itself.  On the one hand, we have a software and hardware complex, donated by the company ‚ÄúArutek‚Äù, and it consists of one powerful system unit, four monitors-clav mice, and Ubunt is spinning on it.  The experience of training on this complex showed that Linux and other open-source software‚Äôs grandmothers are completely over the teeth / artificial jaws :) There is an obstacle in the other.  First, the volunteers - they need to be taught to Linux first by themselves, so that they can teach it to grandmothers.  Secondly, it is necessary to rewrite the manuals.  Thirdly, it is necessary to solve the issue of optimizing the kernel / OS for the third Pentium (I heard that it slows down the linux).  Fourthly, it is necessary to collect training materials (manuals, videos) so that the grandmothers can continue self-education after our courses.  Fifth, we also need technical support, which is understood in Linux.  Sixth, we need a person who organizes all this :) <br><br>  In fact, we don‚Äôt have enough normal responsible organizers for different directions - we can't pay money, but it‚Äôs difficult to find responsible people for free. <br><br>  Such is approximately the situation with the software.  Who has any suggestions / tips / comments - welcome to the comments :) <br><br>  Well, traditionally, the project accepts as a gift any computer and laptop components and parts, dead or alive, in any quantity :) <br><br>  See also in my blog: <br>  <a href="http://inskin.habrahabr.ru/blog/56358/">1.
