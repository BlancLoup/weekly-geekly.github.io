This simple, technically, way my traffic is analyzed.  And it shows me targeted, and therefore more expensive advertising of things that I <s>have already bought,</s> I want to buy. <br><br>  Omnibox search and ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù of suspicious sites, supported by all sane browsers, leveled the questionable amenities provided by the bars.  Search engines want bars, but what can they offer from what is not integrated into the browser?  Games, social networks informers, <s>porn</s> news?  I am not interested. <br><br>  But there are a couple of things for which I would not refuse to "spy" on me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  First of all, let there be a bar not like a bar </h5><br>  I am not against anonymous surveillance and targeted advertising.  The first are Facebook, Vkontakte, and also mail.ru and the same Google, if someone puts their likes-informers on sites where I am ‚Äúwalking‚Äù.  The second is often useful, I spend a decent part of my salary on online purchases and sometimes the shown banner helps me save money.

      But for 30 pixels of browser space, I‚Äôm hanging out, especially on a laptop.  Therefore, I will install a ‚Äúspyware plugin‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt add brakes, isn‚Äôt going to be updated frequently, loudly and hangs up, doesn‚Äôt take up ‚Äúusable space‚Äù and ... if I'm interested. <br><br><h5>  And how to interest me? </h5><br>  Make me comfortable.  For example. <br><br><h5>  Button "This is bueeee" </h5><br>  The simplest is the black list search. <br><br>  SEO is such an SEO that you constantly come across in search of something painfully familiar and not particularly necessary.  Give the opportunity directly in the search to click the button "do not show in the search. <br><br>  I am pleased with the "this is spam" button in the mail.  Yes, spam comes.  But I rarely see it, when, for example, I climb up to see a letter about an order on a site, whose advertising is easier to add to spam than to disable.  No, I have not ceased to be their client, but I need a product, not advertising.  And it would be nice for them to reduce the number of announcements and simplify the subscription and, most importantly, the formal reply. <br><br>  In this case, the store has not lost a client, since their advertising does not bother me.  And I do not need to spend energy on finding another store.  But such a small but convenient button.  Yes, and sellers thanks to her became "polite".  What pleases inexpressibly. <br><br>  Why this is not in the search - I do not know. <br><br><h5>  And this ad is superfluous </h5><br>  Similarly, give me the opportunity to manage advertising.  For example, I was looking for the rules of a three-card herd (from the Card, Money, Two Barrels) and for three months I was shown advertising poker sites.  But the point is not that it is an advertisement of a gamble, but that this advertisement is shown at work.  I certainly do not care, although the questions were.  But if I worked in a bank?  Or the management thought that I was a gambler (I work for a betting company and a game programmer, this is not their dream).  Cleaning cookies is not a convenient option, besides, I am not sure that IP does not matter. <br><br>  Give me the opportunity to exclude keywords from the ad pool.  At least the network that monitors me.  Or simply exclude certain advertising, at least the one in which they pay for hits.  It seems to be in your interest.  As if you already know what interests me, and now you will absolutely surely find out what is of no interest to me. <br><br><h5>  By the way, I do not mind discounts </h5><br>  Or other cash assistance.  You know something about me.  You know where I go and maybe <s>you</s> know what I‚Äôm buying.  Why do not you sell ads where customers are not only fighting for the price of the word, but also for delicious customers.  The second column of the price will often suit me. <br><br>  Again, I‚Äôm looking for lower prices before purchasing.  So the opportunity to sell me at a discount is good for me and for the seller, I will not go to the discount company, and the seller will not ‚Äúfall‚Äù at prices before the main audience.  And for such advertising will pay willingly, at least I think so. <br><br><h5>  And also ... </h5><br>  And also think that this can be offered to me ... I don‚Äôt even know myself from what I will not refuse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152577/</a></p>
