If you would like to be there, but you can‚Äôt be present in person, the free online broadcast will help you in part to fix the situation, and under the cut we have written what exactly falls into it.  And if you are going to the conference - from the post you will find out what things will be there that will not be in the broadcast. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What will be in the broadcast </h2><br>  On YouTube, on May 17 (on the first day of the conference) we will conduct a <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">free broadcast</a> with the reports of the first hall. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  10:30 <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/5bp2z7mmi4wutjtvsrgwo6">Neal Ford - Building evolutionary architectures: Fitness functions</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9q/ge/-h/9qge-h8lrq-st6_cnlcb8iwmzji.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  The opening keyout is the time for the overall picture and unusual perspective.  So in this case, the audience will not yet dive headlong into the subtleties of a specific instrument for testing, but will consider general issues.

      Architecture is often considered static: well, a large project needs one, the small one.  But something constantly happens in dynamics: small projects become large, tasks change, industry changes.  And all this leads to a number of difficulties - including from the point of view of testing.  How to make, that did not result? <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h3>  12:00 pm <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/1rbzooshkfwclrj9rcflyb">Andrey Lushnikov - Modern web testing and automation with Puppeteer</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e-/_w/wc/e-_wwc2rvsbqxurvzcu1flqarmq.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  But now comes the time to deal with the nuances of specific tools.  How does the <a href="https://pptr.dev/">Puppeteer</a> library provide the Chrome management API?  What makes her so fast?  What are some interesting scenarios for its use?  How does it fit with clouds and Docker containers? <br><br>  Andrei Lushnikov believes that the future of web testing automation for Puppetter will answer all these questions.  And who knows the answers to them, if not him: if you open the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/graphs/contributors">list of</a> contributors Puppeteer on GitHub, you can see Andrew on the first line. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h3>  14:00 <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/4ka1g2ajalg1sxavpker1q">Yury Dymov - Move fast and don't break things</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s5/5i/6t/s55i6tjww0vczkuhewd0zml3usy.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  A few years ago, the global failure of Uber systems for two hours cost the company more than $ 25 million.  This incident forced to restructure the development and testing processes at all levels, in particular, the backend was sawn into microservices, and iOS and Android applications were rewritten from scratch based on the Presidio architecture.  The attitude to testing changed, the SLA "99.99% crash free sessions" appeared.  In the report, Yuri will talk about the processes, approaches and tools that are related to iOS development. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h3>  16:00 <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/2in1stqnxglqv5izpjexxq">Kirill Tolkachev, Elena Sharova - Team testing: how to stop worrying and start getting results</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-n/bv/rc/-nbvrc58rwqz7i53wk7pqbv3xs8.jpeg" width="200" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/pp/xr/zqppxrxfd27okl8-a2af99sx9si.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  There are suggestions for testing that everyone can agree with: do not test the same thing several times, simplify the support of the test code, get rid of the lock on specific technologies in testing, make the tests increase the visibility of your system. <br><br>  How to combine tools and testing approaches to achieve all this? <br><br>  Kirill and Elena will try to understand the real example of testing interconnected services, show the evolution of code and tests in the components of the system and get a through report on them.  Consider the result obtained for correctness and optimality, discuss strategies for testing systems with related components. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h3>  17:30 <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/3uit5e0atsqwixcmcuhjqh">Nikita Sobolev - Test Testing</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2c/iz/3d/2ciz3dwzaofl0sulxa97nzqftk0.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  It happens that tests do not really test anything, but we learn about their insufficiency only after a drop in sales. <br><br>  Is there really no way to fix the situation?  Sure you may.  Just need to test the tests! <br><br>  In his report, Nikita will explain the theoretical basis: how and why to test the tests, show what tools there are, using the example of Python, will honestly tell you about the problems of implementation. <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h3>  19:00 <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/2019/spb/talks/6v96tve0i1biuzsftv7it1">Jim Holmes - Changing your organization's testing culture</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/s3/lf/jms3lf90v-bm1djpe9gydfm0jmg.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  The final keyout is, like the opening, about common matters.  You can study specific tools and techniques as much as you like, but if a large company has global problems with a testing culture, this will not help.  What then do?  Could this be influenced by an ordinary tester who does not head the company? <br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br>  Between presentations, we take long breaks when viewers can ask speakers and talk to each other.  So that during the broadcast all this time the boring stub ‚Äúcontinue later‚Äù did not hang, we‚Äôll take video interviews with some speakers especially for online. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  What will happen only at the conference </h2><br>  And what will not get into the open broadcast, having got only the audience of the conference? <br><br><h3>  Other reports and discussion areas </h3><br>  The conference is held for two days, the reports will be in three halls, and only the first hall and the first day will be in open broadcast.  If you want access to all reports, but are not ready to come to the conference, for this there are special <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/buy/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">online tickets</a> with broadcasts from all rooms.  Of course, you will not watch three live broadcasts at the same time - but after the conference, ticket holders will also receive all the videos. <br><br>  Another important part of the conference is discussion zones.  After his speech, each speaker does not just answer questions from the audience for five minutes, but moves to a specially equipped place where it is convenient to answer even the most detailed interviews.  Here online tickets will no longer help - in order to benefit from this, you must be present in person. <br><br><h3>  Lightning talks </h3><br><br>  This year, as an experiment, we are trying a new format for ourselves.  In the evening of the first day, when all the reports from the main program are already over, the main hall will be given under <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/party/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">lightning talks</a> : short five-minute speeches from any interested persons.  It is suitable when you want to share something with the community, but it departs from the strict format of the conference or is not ready to engage in a ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù report (here preparation does not require months of work, and the audience will not judge too harshly).  Basically, applications have already been collected, but if you have an idea, it‚Äôs not too late to connect: there will be a board on the conference where you can enter yourself. <br><br><h3>  BOF sessions </h3><br>  But a more traditional format for the evening of the first day, already proven in previous Heisenbug.  Speakers and viewers are going to discuss pre-defined topics, and there is no hard obstacle between speakers and spectators, everyone can be heard (the main thing is not offtopic).  This time the topics will be: <br><br>  - ‚ÄúHow to choose testing tools and language‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhy don't the conferences say what I want to hear?‚Äù <br><br>  If you think that the format of the Heisenbug program would be worth adding or changing something, there you can convey your position to the program committee. <br><br><h3>  A party </h3><br>  If you do not want any strict formats, and you just want to communicate with the community, there will also be suitable conditions for this.  Music is playing, there is beer - you can relax and start communicating more freely. <br><br><h3>  Stands and demo stage </h3><br>  And, of course, when you watch the broadcast, you cannot go to the stands of the participating companies - to learn something about them, solve problems, participate in the rallies, get stickers.  And there is also a small ‚Äúdemo stage‚Äù scene where companies make their own mini-presentations and sum up the draws. <br><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br>  In general, you have three options: <br><br><ul><li>  If there are enough reports of the first day from the first hall, the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">free translation</a> is perfect for you. </li><li>  If you want access to all the reports of the conference (both live and recorded), but do not want to go to the conference - you have <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/buy/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">online tickets</a> . </li><li>  And if you want to get everything from the conference, starting with the discussion areas and ending with the party, it‚Äôs still not too late to buy a <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/buy/standard/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451766">regular ticket</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451766/</a></p>
