  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning JavaScript programming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time! <br>  We have a replenishment of the collection <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/head-first-oreilly">"Head First O'Reilly"</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec8/dd7/02e/ec8dd702e5614e6ea292a2edd43443de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Through this book you will learn everything about JavaScript language: from variables to cycles.  You will understand why different browsers react differently to the code and how to write universal code that is supported by all browsers.  You will see why with JavaScript code you never have to worry about page congestion and data transfer errors.  Do not be alarmed, even if you have not written a single line of code before, thanks to the unique format of the presentation, this book will easily guide you through the whole learning path: from writing a simple script to creating complex web projects that will work in all modern browsers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Who is this book written for? </h5><br>  - You want to learn, remember, understand and learn how to program in JavaScript, using advanced development techniques and modern standards. <br>  - You are trying to learn, not an experienced developer. <br><br><h5>  Main principles of the Head First series: </h5><br>  <b>Visibility</b> .  Graphics are remembered better than regular text and significantly increase the efficiency of information perception (up to 89% according to research).  In addition, the material becomes more understandable.  The text is placed in the drawings to which it relates. <br>  <b>Conversation style</b> .  Recent studies have shown that with the conversational style of presentation of the material (instead of formal lectures), the improvement of the results on final testing reaches 40%.  Tell a story instead?  to give a lecture.  Do not take yourself too seriously.  What will attract your attention: an entertaining conversation at the table or a lecture? <br>  <b>The active participation of the reader</b> .  Until you begin to strain the convolutions, nothing will happen in your head.  The reader should be interested in the result;  he must solve problems, draw conclusions and learn new knowledge.  And for this you need exercises and tricky questions, which involve both hemispheres of the brain and different feelings. <br>  <b>Attracting (and maintaining) the reader's attention</b> .  A situation familiar to everyone: ‚ÄúI really want to study it, but I fall asleep on the first page.‚Äù  The brain draws attention to the interesting, strange, attractive, unexpected.  Studying a complex technical topic doesn't have to be boring.  Interesting is learned much faster. <br>  <b>Appeal to emotions</b> .  It is known that our ability to memorize largely depends on emotional empathy.  We remember what we care about.  We remember when we feel something.  No, sentiment has nothing to do with it: it is about such emotions as surprise, curiosity, interest and ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm cool!‚Äù Feeling when solving a task that people consider difficult, or when you understand that you understand the topic better than know-all Bob from the technical department.

    <h5>  Note </h5><br>  This is a tutorial, not a reference book.  We deliberately removed from the book everything that could interfere with the study of the material on which you are working.  And when you first read a book, you should start from the very beginning, because the book assumes that the reader has certain knowledge and experience. <br><br>  We describe the good side of javascript and warn about the BAD. <br><br>  <i>JavaScript</i> programming language was not born in academic circles and did not pass the stage of enlightened peer review.  He came to this world out of necessity and grew up in the harsh environment of early browsers.  Be warned: JavaScript has a lot of advantages, but there are other, not so remarkable sides.  But in general, <i>JavaScript</i> is a great language for those who know how to use it intelligently.  In this book, we will teach you how to effectively use the good sides, and also point out possible pitfalls and advise how best to get around them. <br><br><h5>  We are not trying to describe in every detail all aspects of the language. </h5><br>  <i>JavaScript</i> is quite an extensive topic.  You should not consider this book as a reference;  This is a tutorial that does not explain everything you can learn about JavaScript.  We want to teach you the basics of JavaScript so that you can take any old directory and do whatever you want with JavaScript. <br><br><h5>  This book teaches the use of javascript in browsers. </h5><br>  The browser is not only the most typical environment for executing JavaScript code, but also the most convenient (everyone has a computer with a text editor and a browser, and to get started working on <i>JavaScript,</i> nothing more is needed).  Running <i>javascript</i> in the browser also means instant response;  to see how your code works, just reload the web page. <br><br><h5>  The book encourages writing well-structured, readable code. </h5><br>  The code should be written so that it is well read and understandable to other people, and also works in browsers that will come out next year.  It should be as simple and straightforward as possible for you to do your job and be able to move on to other matters.  In this book, we will teach you to write simple, well-structured code that can adapt to future changes ‚Äî code that you can be proud of, frame out, and hang on the wall. <br><br><h5>  We recommend using different browsers. </h5><br>  We teach you to write <i>JavaScript</i> based on standards, and yet you will most likely encounter minor differences in the interpretation of <i>JavaScript by</i> different browsers.  Although we made sure that the code in question worked in all modern browsers, and even show a couple of tricks that support the code with these browsers, we advise you to choose a couple of browsers and test <i>JavaScript</i> in them.  So you will learn to see the differences between browsers and create <i>JavaScript</i> code that will work well in different browsers with stable results. <br><br><h5>  Examples were made as compact as possible. </h5><br>  Our readers don‚Äôt like to look at 200 lines of code in the examples to find two really important lines.  Most of the book‚Äôs examples are given in the smallest possible context so that the part you are studying is simple and intuitive.  Do not expect that all the examples will be well debugged or completed to the end - they are made for educational purposes and do not always have full functionality.
