  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Development and testing of software in the "clouds"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to statistics, a large enterprise usually allocates up to 50% of the resources of its internal technological infrastructure for developing and testing its own software.  At the same time, up to 90% of these resources remain untapped.  On the basis of this, we can talk about the low efficiency of this process and increased costs.  How to avoid it? <br><br>  As one of the options you can suggest the use of technology Cloud Computing.  Taking advantage of this technology in development and application testing environments can help reduce labor costs by half, improve application quality and dramatically shorten the time-to-market for software products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was with this option that IBM came out to its customers, which, in other matters, is not surprising.  The company has long been delivering cloud-based solutions for software developers and it was only a matter of time when customers would be given the opportunity to develop and test software applications in their proprietary IBM Cloud cloud environment. <br><br>  In early March, this happened.  A new <a href="http://www-180.ibm.com/cloud/enterprise/beta/dashboard">IBM Smart Business Development and Test on the IBM Cloud was</a> introduced, which enables corporate customers to expand their internal software development and testing processes with instant access to computing resources through IBM's secure scalable model for delivering cloud services, as well as using software IBM product lifecycle management capabilities.

      The new IBM offer allows customers, first, to shorten the cycle time for preparation and provision of work (provision cycle) from weeks to minutes;  secondly, to eliminate up to 30% of errors of the new software;  thirdly, to reduce the time required for application testing and quality assurance;  and fourthly, to rapidly deploy environments across multiple IT projects. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks08-6lRE1c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj2Ytt_zHwRrB5abY4wO9H4jR38Bw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  IBM offers cloud services in the form of three flexible delivery models: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ IBM CloudBurst for Development and Test ‚Äî a pre-integrated suite that includes hardware, storage devices, virtualized resources and network infrastructure, and an embedded intelligent service management system;  allows customers to quickly deploy an internal / private cloud environment. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ IBM Smart Business Development and Test Cloud - a private cloud-service within the client's firewall;  created and managed by IBM.  This service now includes advanced collaboration capabilities in a cloud-based environment using the Rational Software Delivery Services for Cloud Computing solution. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ IBM Smart Business Development - Software development and testing solutions that include full-cycle software delivery services Rational Software Delivery Services for Cloud Computing through a secure and scalable IBM cloud environment. <br><br>  IBM understands that not every kind of computing task will be transferred to the ‚Äúcomputing cloud‚Äù environment, so the company helps customers identify their capabilities and resource needs for Cloud Computing, based on workload requirements.  Some workloads will continue to operate on the basis of internal computing resources of enterprises, while other workloads are already ready for external cloud environments, including application development and testing processes. <br><br>  For customers who need help choosing a model that best matches their workload with the computational power delivery method, IBM offers Cloud Infrastructure Strategy and Design Services.  Based on proven methodologies and intellectual property, developed in the process of implementing more than 100 client solutions and unique in its kind Cloud Computing projects, these integrated services provide customers with a ready-to-use framework model for creating corporate strategy and ‚Äúcomputing cloud‚Äù projects.  Cloud Infrastructure Services Strategy and Design Services integrates into IBM private cloud environments optimized for workloads. <br><br>  The IBM Cloud Smart Business Development and Test on the Cloud is managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (a solution based on KVM technology from Red Hat's acquired Qumranet).  The enterprise's cloud-based environment allows customers to work with their own software, as well as with pre-assembled software images from IBM, thanks to the support of a whole range of software technologies such as DB2, WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere sMash, IBM Mashup Center, Lotus Forms Turbo, WebSphere Portal Server, Lotus Web Content Management, IBM Information Management, and WebSphere, configured by client selection. <br><br>  The Smart Business Development and Test on the IBM Cloud solution will be available in the second quarter of 2010 in the United States and Canada, and later, during the year, in other countries around the world, including Russia and Ukraine. <br><br>  <a href="http://www-180.ibm.com/cloud/enterprise/beta/dashboard">Smart Business Development Solution Site and Test on the IBM Cloud</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89335/</a></p>
