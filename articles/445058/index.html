A recent update has added two new features ‚Äî detecting stoplights and detecting another car‚Äôs changing lanes.  In the latter case, there may even be an implicit intention that the autopilot recognizes. <br><br>  If another car changes a lane change, the autopilot reduces the speed of the electric vehicle.  All in order to make room for a car that changes lanes and does not create emergency situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previously, the autopilot could behave a little strange in a busy track.  So, the driver could be stumped, deciding why the electric car slowed down - because of the car ahead, because the other car seeks to change lanes on the current lane or there is some other reason.  These maneuvers were called "phantom" braking, the driver simply did not understand why the electric car slows down.

      Now Tesla has <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/03/23/tesla-autopilot-red-light-warnings-lane-changes/">taught Autopilot to help other motorists</a> .  So, if an electric car "sees" that a nearby car seeks to change the traffic lane to the one on which Telsa is moving, then the latter slows down to make room for the lane-changing car. <br><br>  As evidence, you can cite a video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/privaterbok">in which everything happens exactly</a> as described.  Video posted by user Reddit with the nickname privaterbok.  This person is the owner of Tesla with the latest autopilot version 2019.5.15. <br><br>  The video shows a Mercedes with turn signals on.  The car changed lanes to the lane to the right of Tesla.  Then he pauses and starts to go to the place in front of the electric vehicle.  The latter in this case demonstrates to the driver the situation on the road and begins to slow down. <br><br>  As far as you can understand, Tesla taught their electric cars to react to the turn signal or the speed of the neighboring cars.  Previously, the autopilot could react using the method described above, it was only possible to speculate.  But now fans of electric vehicles have reliable evidence. <br><br>  And this is in addition to the fact that Tesla began to distinguish the markings on the roads without any special problems.  Ilon Musk relatively recently announced that the electric cars of the company will soon learn to work in conditions of active traffic on the roads.  With the update 2019.8.3, the company added a note about the update of the function ‚ÄúWarning about the stop-signal of the automatic rotation‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d90/67a/d31/d9067ad319bf7b10c00ee2cccebd02b8.jpg"><br><br>  The new feature allows the car to independently respond to one or another external factor (for example, a car driving ahead that changes the lane).  As far as one can understand, Tesla not only increases the safety of driving in an electric car, but also allows motorists to be more polite, so to speak.  In principle, the company continues to follow its principles and pay close attention to various situations on the road. <br><br>  According to Ilona Mask, Tesla electric cars will become leaders among electric cars.  All thanks to the price and the desire of drivers to try out the "car on electricity", which, in addition, is able to protect its owner. <br><br>  This year, he plans to launch a fully autonomous electric vehicle, which he announced earlier.  But almost all experts in the field of robomobiles state that the probability of the appearance of cars with the fifth level of autopilot autonomy by the beginning of 2020 does not look too plausible. <br><br>  In general, the current Autopilot is in fact not a true autopilot.  Yes, Tesla advertises a ‚Äúfully autonomous system‚Äù, but it has not yet appeared on sale and is unlikely to appear soon.  There are some developments in the company (in terms of creating a full-fledged autopilot), but all of them are either in the state of testing, or are awaiting the approval of the regulator, or both. <br><br>  Some experts doubt that Tesla will be able <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/411585/">to create a</a> real autopilot without hardware modifications to its system.  The problem is that there is no lidar in the system.  It is in Waymo robots (it is a subsidiary of Google), Uber, GM.  But Tesla has no lidar.  According to Ilona Mask, it was necessary to abandon this element for a number of reasons.  So the engineers left only the radar and cameras. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445058/</a></p>
