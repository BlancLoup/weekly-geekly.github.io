Today we‚Äôll tell you about the place that is sore with many web services, but without exaggeration we don‚Äôt have with us - technical user support. <br><br>  There are always a lot of questions, complaints and suggestions, which is why there are several support channels for <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">TeamLab</a> and among them both interactive: a user voice form, emails, a user feedback page, online chat, TeamLab accounts in social networks, and reference: Help Center, FAQ and blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/554/e1e/f7e/554e1ef7e0f49dfadafd0dbfc785a58f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Where to write more </h5><br>  So, a user can contact <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/">TeamLab</a> support not only via email, but also using the Feedback &amp; Support form, which is called from any portal page.  In addition to requests and suggestions from the form window, you can also go to help articles and search for the necessary information yourself.

      The diagram below presents a summary of calls to the TeamLab support system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52e/88c/e1c/52e88ce1cf625f4ecb146417ebc2d3f6.png"><br><br>  As we see, 67% of the requests came by e-mail, and 33% via the Feedback &amp; Support form.  18% of users who used the form, found the answer to their question in the articles and did not send a message to the support service.  This, of course, works only with the most frequently asked and simple questions.  All questions, unfortunately, cannot be foreseen and described in articles. <br><br>  It should be noted that most users traditionally prefer email.  One can only guess about the reasons for this, because, it would seem, it is easier and faster to contact the form, but, apparently, a request by mail still seems to them much more reliable. <br><br><h5>  What "hurts" users </h5><br>  Top hits (as probably on almost any other product) always consist of questions from beginners by type: <br><br><ul><li>  how do i register / get password; </li><li>  where do i find instructions; </li><li>  what are the minimum system requirements supported by the browser and device; </li><li>  ... and when will the salary be? </li></ul><br>  Yes, yes, do not be surprised, sometimes it happens.  On any portal there is a link to support, and periodically support specialists receive letters from users who, clicking on this link, think that they are sending a message to their administrator. <br><br><h5>  Vote or you lose </h5><br>  Suggestions / ideas / wishes page, where each visitor can post a new idea or vote for existing ones - an inexhaustible source of useful information for us.  The most popular section of the module offers is <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/project-management.aspx">Projects</a> .  Let's go through the top five requests for the moment: <br><br><ul><li>  Gantt Chart - 538 votes </li><li>  The appointment of several responsible for one task - 487 votes </li><li>  Subtasks - 385 votes </li><li>  Related tasks - 205 votes </li><li>  Task Priorities - 199 votes </li></ul><br>  We are pleased to announce that three requests, namely: the <b>assignment of several responsible tasks, subtasks and priorities, will be fully closed in the upcoming release of the new ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù</b> .  As for the Gantt chart and task dependencies, this functionality is still at the design stage, because it is closely related to all components of the module, and its introduction should not violate the integrity and simplicity of the entire solution, not to mention the significant resources required for implementation. <br><br><h5>  Help Center </h5><br>  All documentation of the TeamLab Help Center is divided into <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/gettingstarted.aspx">getting started</a> - general descriptions of modules and add-ons, user and administrator basics, <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/guides.aspx">user</a> and <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/administratorguides.aspx">administrator</a> guides - step-by-step instructions on how to perform one specific task, <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/tipstricks.aspx">tips and tricks</a> - useful little things that you just can‚Äôt find simplify life on the portal, as well as <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/video.aspx">video instructions</a> (so far only in English). <br><br>  Recently added guides, articles and videos created by our users - a full multilingual <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru/help/contributors-guides.aspx">section</a> . <br><br>  Appears and more elements of interactivity.  Previously, users could vote if the documentation was useful, and the overwhelming majority always answered positively, but it was not always clear what the dissatisfied minority did not like.  Now users can leave a comment if something is unclear and needs clarification. <br><br><h5>  Peculiarities of the National Hunt </h5><br>  TeamLab support is provided by our specialists in English, German, French, Russian, Spanish and Italian.  Experts support on their own experience know which national stereotypes are completely true, and which are exaggerated.  Here are briefly the distinctive features of users from different countries. <br><br>  <i>German speaking users</i> .  They are characterized by quite informative, polite, unemotional messages that are convenient to process and enjoyable to read.  As one of our support employees says, ‚Äúthere is no better exercise in logic than correspondence with a German.‚Äù <br><br>  <i>French speaking users</i> .  A polite and at the same time rather restrained form of address.  But at the same time they are very meticulous, require more attention to themselves and are capricious.  Although, if a user gets a long-awaited solution to a problem, then emotions can overwhelm him and he can show what his eloquence is capable of.  The use of the English language should be avoided, they do not like it very much. <br><br>  <i>Logging users</i> .  More focused on making personal contacts.  Even in more or less official correspondence, the Italian will first of all try to establish human relations, invariably calling you by name and turning to "you."  The Italian's letter to the support will be long and most often emotional, but he will not understand the deep technical difficulties if this is not necessary. <br><br>  <i>Russian-speaking users</i> .  There are both quite civilized and adequate, and those who seem to have no idea about the norms of official communication.  Perhaps due to lack of experience of formal correspondence.  They can rush to extremes: either they are being too familiar, or they write in such a non-humanly stilted way that it is extremely difficult to understand the problem. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  Although competently organizing technical support is not an easy task, which proves the negative experience of many modern companies, with successful practice all costs will pay off twice as much.  After all, good and multi-channel support is the best word of mouth and a guarantee of user confidence.  And for the sake of such reviews, I would like to work with enthusiasm further: <br><br>  - ‚ÄúTeamlab has a full partnership for the company of big or small!  The support is the top notch, the guides are brilliant! ‚Äù <br><br>  - "Great show of support for customers not only respond but also work on the problem" <br><br>  - ‚ÄúParticularly impressive is the design and thoughtfulness of the interfaces, and of course the technical stuffing.  Your designers and programmers are just gods!  Respect to them and uvazhuha :-) It is very pleasant that you respond so comprehensively to the letters of users, even those who are not yet ‚Äúpremium‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144263/</a></p>
