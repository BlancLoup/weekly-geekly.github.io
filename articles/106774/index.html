  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work day for 3 hours. Analysis and sorting of information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The tools of the time management system described in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/106172/">last post</a> , make it possible to bring all the affairs occurring in your life and requiring participation into one place.  This is, as is probably understandable - to-do lists, divided into categories DAY, LATER, CONTROL.  Working with lists is preceded by working with drives. <br><br>  With the help of accumulators (see last post) we reduce all information flows passing to us and from us into one place.  We collect, in order to analyze, to throw away the unnecessary, to leave what we need and decide what to do with the left.  The network has many schemes for sorting information.  This scheme is most popular. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/73d64529/f8f7fa4e/3064ac1b/f5416cc4.jpg"><br>  Despite the obvious simplicity of the depicted process of analyzing information from the drive, I simplified it even more. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Sorting algorithm </h4><br><br>  1. What is it, what is the content? <br><br>  2. Is it necessary? <br>  No ---&gt; throw away! <br>  Yes ----&gt; leave. <br>  <i>Before you decide where to put, ask the following questions:</i> <br><br>  3. Are there any actions connected with this? <br>  No ----&gt; we put in the Vault, in the MUSEUM / <br>  Yes -----&gt; <br>  3.1 Can the action be performed immediately and quickly *? <br>  Yes ----&gt; we do! <br>  No ---&gt; enter the action in the list of actions. <br><br>  4. How often * will I contact this? <br>  Often ----&gt; we put in the Vault, in the folder REFERENCE materials. <br>  Rarely ----&gt; to the MUSEUM folder. <br><br>  <i>Everyone defines for himself what ‚Äúfast‚Äù, ‚Äúoften‚Äù and ‚Äúrarely‚Äù mean.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut how to delegate or postpone?  Or mark in the calendar? ‚Äù- you ask. <br><br>  They are not specifically highlighted because they are related to <b>actions</b> .  All actions, as we have already decided, are stored in the list of actions.  If the action that was determined during the processing of information from the drive cannot be performed immediately, you will have to add it to the list.  Whatever else it has gone. <br><br>  Let's now look at a couple of examples. <br><br><h5>  Example 1 </h5><br><br>  An email arrived. <br>  What is this and what is the content?  - an automatically generated letter from the host, a reminder of the need to pay for hosting. <br><br>  Should I leave it?  - the letter itself does not contain valuable data, so feel free to three (or ‚Äúarchive‚Äù in Gmail), but a little later. <br><br>  Are any actions related to the letter?  - obviously, yes.  Write a memo to the accounting department about the need to pay for hosting. <br><br>  Can this be done immediately and quickly?  - it is possible, but I am busy with other work that I do not want to interrupt.  Therefore, the ‚ÄúTo-do list <i>//</i> account is <i>assigned to the</i> to-do list <i>for hosting payment.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Feel free to destroy the letter. <br><br><h5>  Example 2 </h5><br><br>  Wife sent SMS. <br><br>  What is it and what is the content?  - SMS with a request to buy products on the way from work. <br><br>  Do I need it?  - if you transfer the list of products in the description to the task, no. <br><br>  What action is associated with SMS?  - enter the store and buy groceries. <br><br>  Can this be done immediately and quickly?  - not. <br><br>  We put a task in the to-do list in the format ‚Äú <i>I // enter the store and buy groceries</i> ‚Äù.  In the description of the task copy the list of products from the SMS.  SMS itself is deleted. <br><br><h5>  Example 3 </h5><br><br>  After the meeting with the client, there were several sheets with records of the necessary changes in the product that appeared during the discussion of the project. <br><br>  What is it and what is the content?  - customer requirements for the product being developed. <br><br>  Do I need it?  - yes, it needs to be left. <br><br>  What action is associated with this?  - a whole range of actions.  We put them in the list of actions. <br><br>  Where to put sheets of records?  (How often should they be accessed?) - in the Vault (once a week - for sure), in DIRECTORY.  We put them in the folder HELP. <br><br><h5>  Example 4 </h5><br><br>  What is it?  - Again, we have on hand a list of client requirements for the project. <br><br>  Do I need it?  - No, the project makes a subordinate, so you need to give it to him. <br><br>  Are any actions related to this?  - Yes, you need to give the documents. <br>  Can I do them immediately and quickly?  - yes, you just need to put them on the table to a slave or scan them and send them to e-mail. <br><br>  Following this algorithm, you seek instant response to external stimuli.  You will not lose sight of anything.  Do not forget any instructions and do not miss a single idea.  Everything that passes by you will be identified, properly processed and executed at the right time.  Subordinates will be in full confidence that you are aware of everything.  The bosses will be respected for complete concentration and clear execution. <br><br><h4>  Projects </h4><br><br>  In example 4, we are faced with a set of actions united by one theme.  Anything that requires more than one action is called the term ‚Äúproject.‚Äù  The meaning of this word is different from the usual one.  In the context of GTD, a project is just a combination of two or more actions to achieve one goal. <br><br>  Projects are revolving and ordinary.  Revolving differ from the usual in that the actions in them can be performed only consistently.  In normal projects, actions can be performed in parallel.  It's pretty simple.  How does this relate to the sorting of information from the drive?  Very simple. <br><br>  If several actions are associated with the item being processed, a project is created. <br><br>  In the list of actions, REFERENCES a folder with the name of the project is created.  For example, a project may be a current order, because it requires constant exchange of information at least between the customer and you.  In addition, during discussions (meetings or correspondence) material is accumulated to be used in the work.  For this material, a subfolder is created in the REFERENCE folder, for example, Security Server, Horin.  The category of the same name is also created in the to-do list.  This is necessary so that you can view all materials or tasks on this project at a glance, without a long search.  And it is convenient. <br><br>  Combining in one place all the tasks (to-do lists), materials necessary for their implementation (folders REFERENCE or MUSEUM), we achieve: <br><ul><li>  instant determination of a specific action for each individual receipt of information (we do not allow our consciousness to ‚Äúcloud‚Äù anything that happens in our life - you will not miss anything and will not let laziness be fooled) </li><li>  quick and effective response (we learn to immediately do what can be done instantly and quickly - you get the reputation of a highly organized person) </li><li>  exceptions to the risk of forgetting something important (all actions are put on to-do lists and done at the right time - this brings respect and income) </li><li>  saving time on finding the necessary documents (they are only in well-defined places - all activities become faster) </li></ul>  Next time I will tell you how to organize lists of actions for the greatest efficiency and speed of work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106774/</a></p>
