  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 5 Fun Gift Online Stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  New Year is coming, and the problem of gifts is becoming more and more acute.  We have to wrestle with something to give, go shopping, crowding in queues and still choose boring and banal gifts. <br>  Fortunately, there are several online stores where you can buy cool, truly original little things as a gift and for yourself, without taking your ass off the chair. <br>  I would like to introduce you to the Top 5 of such stores (none of them paid me anything, unfortunately): <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">Thinkgeek.com</a> <br><br>  This is the undisputed leader of my hit parade.  This overseas store sells stunning trinkets for every wallet.  The disadvantage of this store is that it is for geeks and nerds, although for me it‚Äôs rather a plus;) <br>  Here you can buy a bunch of all sorts of things, ranging from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/6708/">soft toys in the form of bacteria</a> , <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/6708/">Tarzanian</a> <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/plush/8f00/">monkeys</a> , <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/cellphone/8928/">old-school bluetooth handsets</a> and ending with a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/keyboards-mice/8193/">laser keyboard</a> or <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/collectibles/b72c/">lightsaber</a> , although you can continue, attention, my favorite is <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/kitchen/ba37/">whiskey stones</a> .  Just look at the assortment to see why this particular store is headed by Top.  And what would you like from what is sold there? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since Thinkgeek is a foreign shop, delivery to Russia and other CIS countries is carried out by international carriers such as DHL because of what, on the one hand, purchases are brought quickly, on the other, it is expensive.  For example, I ordered a lightsaber, which cost $ 100, I was brought to him for 3 days from the date of order, but they took another $ 100 for delivery.  True, it came out all the same cheaper than buying the same in Russia (especially if we consider that it is not for sale).  Also, the fact that the store is foreign is the need to pay by credit card.

      2. <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/">Dumka.ru</a> <br>  This is a domestic store where you can buy funny gifts.  I recommend, the <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/category74.html">designer, where the balls roll</a> , for some reason it is called perpetual motion, although it runs on batteries.  This design looks gorgeous during work, you can see this by watching the <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/product461.html">video on the store page</a> .  Also there are sold <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/category92.html">cubes, Rubik of</a> different forms, <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/category95.html">fancy designers</a> , well, the hit of all times and peoples is <a href="http://www.dumka.ru/category107.html">neo-cube</a> . <br><br>  In principle, delivery is carried out worldwide by the same DHL, but on holidays the store serves only residents of the capital. :( You can pay either in cash to the courier, or about a bank card or Yandex.Money. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://www.superheroes.ru/">Superheroes.ru</a> <br>  This is a shop for fans of fiction and cartoons.  Basically, superhero figures are sold here, for example, <a href="http://www.superheroes.ru/p3576-DC-Classic-Superman-Head-Knocker-Series-2.html">Superman</a> or <a href="http://www.superheroes.ru/p2659-Futurama-Gender-Bender-WindUp.html">Bender</a> (I also have a super hero), but you can also find any other stuff, such as <a href="http://www.superheroes.ru/p3202-Lord-Of-The-Rings-Gimli-Axe.html">Gimli's ax</a> , that looks great on the wall next to the lightsaber.  Toys tend to end, for example, before it was sold there with 5 different Bender figures, but now many have bought it, and I managed to find only one. <br><br>  Purchases are delivered worldwide by EMS, and in Moscow by courier, you can pay whatever you like. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/">Evoi.ru</a> <br>  In this store, not things are sold, but impressions, that is, you give a person the opportunity to <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/citem_28.htm">feel like a climber</a> , <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/citem_186.htm">ride a tank</a> , <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/citem_157.htm">make the best cocktail in the world</a> , <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/citem_54.htm">make a family portrait</a> , <a href="http://www.evoi.ru/citem_170.htm">spend an evening at the spa</a> with your soulmate and the like.  This store has two advantages over similar ones: firstly, the gift itself is a beautiful box with booklets, which is a pleasure to give to a person, secondly, a selection of good partners, I made such a gift to several people, and I used it myself, and for now no one was left disappointed. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the store works only in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, only in these cities there are partners who carry out all these events and holidays. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://boomboomroom.ru/">Boomboomroom.ru</a> <br><br>  This is a cool shop, mostly designer trinkets.  It will appeal to lovers to please themselves and friends with all kinds of <a href="http://boomboomroom.ru/product/199.aspx">lamps from Mr. Pi</a> , <a href="http://boomboomroom.ru/product/273.aspx">interactive mugs</a> , <a href="http://boomboomroom.ru/product/454.aspx">bowls of spilled milk</a> and the like stuff.  It is worth noting that the assortment of the store is quickly updated, many things are brought in a small number of copies that are quickly bought up, so it makes sense to periodically look there to see what's new. <br>  To the minus of the store it is worthwhile to take its prices, I think everything is very expensive there, but for the sake of a good gift it is sometimes possible to fork out :) <br><br>  Delivered around the world, you can pay as convenient. <br><br>  I hope this little Top will ease your pre-New Year shopping rush.  I apologize for posting just a week before the New Year. :( <br>  I would be glad if you share links to other stores where you can buy cool things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79099/</a></p>
