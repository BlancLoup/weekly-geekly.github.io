He belongs to Folgers;  She has been using it for 12 years.  And I can‚Äôt look for more coffee code.  This has already been done.  This disclosure, and as soon as you receive the code, suddenly, everything makes sense, and we begin to understand why Americans behave in this way and not otherwise.  Now we understand why coffee works in this case and does not work in the other.  I understand why not selling a little Cadillac for $ 29,000.  I understand - because he has no code. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How does Folgers look at its right to own this thing?</b> <br><br>  This is a very good question, because at first they told me: ‚ÄúCoffee is a commodity.  How can we own something that others do not own? ‚ÄùMy practice shows that when it comes to code, the problem must be addressed comprehensively.  The code should appear absolutely in everything.  Whatever you do should work on code enhancement;  The code should not be only packaging or related communication.  Leaflets, booklets, all must carry the code.  And if for the first time you take on this business, well-versed in all the subtleties, you have a serious competition.  They may try to copy you, but they will not know the formula;  they will not know the code behind it.

      For example, it is the fragrance that plays the decisive role.  Why?  Because, first of all, we are impressed by the flavor, not the taste.  Associations with aroma arise at very early age, somewhere in 2 years.  ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù, And now it forever means home, mother, feeding, love, and so on.  The absolute majority, about 90 percent of Americans, love the aroma of coffee.  Only 47 percent like its taste. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if you remember this ad, here it really consisted of code.  A young guy in military uniform is returning home from the army.  His mother is still sleeping upstairs.  He immediately goes to the kitchen, ‚Äúchik‚Äù, opens the coffee and inhales the smell - in fact, we specifically do the packaging so that the smell spreads instantly.  He makes coffee;  it boils;  the smell goes up;  mother is still sleeping;  but she wakes up;  she smiles.  And we already understand what she wants to say now, since the code for this smell is ‚Äúhouse.‚Äù  That is, she wants to say: ‚ÄúAh, he's at home!‚Äù She rushes down the stairs and hugs her son.  And when we experienced this video, the people cried.  Why?  Because, we correctly caught the logic of emotions. <br><br>  <b>"Home" is a signal for reptilian.</b> <br><br>  It was a signal for reptilism, because there is a blood connection.  If it was a neighbor, it would not have such an effect.  It was her son.  He came back from the army, where he could be killed.  This is another key element of reptilism - namely, the struggle for survival.  He returned home, which means he survived.  He is the blood that returns home, returns to the womb.  That is what her embrace symbolizes.  She doesn't just say to him: ‚ÄúHi, how are you?‚Äù.  She embodies his return to her roots, the source of her life.  This is pure reptilian. <br><br>  <b>What about the people who created the script for the video?</b> <br><br>  We constantly worked in the same team.  They opened the code with me. <br><br>  <b>They understood what mother meant.</b> <br><br>  They experience more than simple understanding;  they feel it on a deep level.  This is the most beautiful thing that I do, if I may say so, its essence is that I don‚Äôt tell them the code.  We open it together.  I need people to feel it at the instinct level: ‚ÄúThis is it;  now it will change my life;  it will change my mind;  it will change my product. ‚Äù  And since they open this code with me, they open it, right?  - he immediately begins his direct action. <br><br><img align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5" src="http://www.autogazeta.com/n/200209/__jeep_logo.jpg">  For example, when I was working with Chrysler, we found that Jeep should not have square headlights.  This is a very specific thing - no square headlights.  Why?  I do not want to give out not whose secrets, just let us imagine that the code for the Jeep is an animal like a horse.  It is unlikely that you have ever seen a horse with square eyes.  Of course, those who are interested in Jeep will not say this directly;  they will say: "I want round headlights to make it look more like a face."  And as the Jeep logo, we use a stylized Jeep face with grille.  And when I discovered this, it was obvious that this was a completely reptilian problem.  And since then, the Jeep Wrangler no longer has square headlights. <br><br>  How does good marketing research differ from bad?  The fact that it works.  Good marketing research works.  When we say that it works, we mean that marketers have been able to understand the real needs of their customers ‚Äî sometimes without any words ‚Äî and satisfy them.  Now we have a whole industry - the aviation industry - which does not understand its customers at all.  They make a big, big mistake.  They still do not understand anything.  Why?  Because their marketing research is when they approach people and ask: ‚ÄúWhat do you prefer?  When is it cheaper or when is it more expensive? ‚Äù  And, of course, people say that when cheaper.  And then marketers say: "Now, now you see - they want it to be cheaper, so we have to make our airlines cheaper, cheaper and cheaper again."  And here is what it looks like from the point of view of a reptile, in the sense that it is hidden behind the word ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù:  I can not move;  they don't let me eat. ‚Äù  It's terrible, isn't it?  No, that's enough for me, no more flights.  I will drive my car.  Why?  Because they do not care about my reptilian.  And therefore, emotionally, their behavior towards me is perceived as if they are holding me in some kind of prison. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know if you know, but in a few years, 35 percent of all American airlines will fly in small planes, because it‚Äôs cheaper.  Anyway, this is hell, right?  99 Dolar to Los Angeles?  I do not care - hell remains hell, even if it is cheap.  And therefore, all these air carriers are immersed in a coma, although they still breathe, because we still feed them with budget money, but their days are numbered. <br><br>  <b>Does the marketing department have a bad attitude to your work?</b> <br><br>  Yes, they just hate me.  It happens all the time: ‚ÄúWho is this guy?  What did he say? ‚ÄùAt first, it was pretty hard for me.  Today, due to the fact that I already have a quite decent portfolio with cases like Folgers, PT Cruiser and others, they can‚Äôt just shoot me off.  So, at first, they usually hesitate a lot.  But in the process of work, when they take part in everything that happens, on a par with me and we make some discoveries together, then at the end I already like everyone.  If I manage to do all the work with their participation, they say: "Wow, this is just fantastic, great, we adopt".  For P &amp; G alone, I conducted 35 such studies.  For GM more than twenty. <br><br>  <b>That is, roughly speaking, do you think that people can be calculated by the formula?</b> <br><br>  The essence of my theory is that in the human world nothing happens by chance.  When you see that people are doing something, there is always a reason for it, there is always code.  I do not pretend to know all the codes, but when I work with a client, I try to penetrate the code and then we understand why people are doing something.  In the human world, nothing happens without a reason.  It's so exciting to try to understand, try to penetrate the code. <br><br>  I do not want to say that all people are the same.  This is not true.  Each is unique.  Even the twins are, in fact, different.  Everyone is special.  But we all have common structures that are rooted in biology.  For example, we are all human beings;  a woman gave birth to all of us - this is what I call a biological scheme.  It is a woman, not a man.  And this is the structure.  But besides this, we acquire things that are reproduced by culture.  And even further, on the third level, is your own structure, your identity.  And you are unique.  Each is unique. <br><br>  So, we have three structures: a unique cipher, which I call the personal cipher;  then, cultural archetypes;  then the biological scheme.  Now suppose you live in harmony with all three levels: it means you are happy, right?  That is, problems arise from the fact that these scripts cannot synchronize - in the way you manifest as a person - due to the conflict between culture and biology.  That's the whole point.  But human behavior is absolutely understandable.  I think that if you understand the power of the code, then you can decode.  If you have code, all human actions will make sense to you. <br><br>  <b>And codes can be translated into practical marketing strategies.</b> <br><br>  Yes, and, of course, this can be expressed in how we meet the real needs of consumers, that is, in marketing practices and strategies.  For example, if I know that cheese, which is sold in America, is usually dead, that is, pasteurized, and that we do not want any cheese that would be alive, then I must bear this in mind, first of all.  I must clearly state that this cheese is safe, that it is pasteurized, wrapped in plastic.  I know that plastic is a shroud.  It can be put in the fridge.  I know that the refrigerator is a morgue;  the place where the dead are put.  And if you know all this, then you know exactly how to promote cheese to the American market. <br><br>  I started working with a French company in America that tried to sell French cheese to Americans.  And they could not understand what was the matter, because in France the cheese is live, that is, you can buy it young, old or old, and therefore, when you buy cheese, you read its age.  In addition, you check its smell, touch it.  If you need cheese for today, you buy adult cheese.  If next week, you buy young cheese.  And when you buy young cheese to eat in a week, you go home, but you never put it in the fridge, because you don‚Äôt put your cat in the fridge.  This is the same;  he is alive.  We are very afraid to be sick because of cheese.  And by the way, the French more often die because of cheese than the Americans.  But we have different priorities, different logic of emotions.  The French prefer the taste of security.  Americans safety is more important than taste. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30970/</a></p>
