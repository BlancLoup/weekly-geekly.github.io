And, secondly, the tips below will not be able to significantly help if you have a low-quality product.

      So, the essence of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprogressive simplification is that the usability is not at one particular point.  Over time, the user begins to better navigate the application, so the product interface should be changed for this user. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  "Hold the handle" </h4><br>  User interface developers have the notion of ‚Äúhand-holding‚Äù, which means literally ‚Äúlead the user by the hand‚Äù, for example, to familiarize him with the user interface, or with functionality.  To do this, use various methods, such as large icons, captions under them, tooltips, color accents, and so on. <br><br>  Sometimes designers neglect the need for hand-holding and develop user interfaces immediately for advanced users, visually simplifying the design as much as possible.  But if you overdo it, it can lead to failure.  Some designers, as long as the product is on the market, gradually change the user interface, focusing on advanced users.  On the other hand, an alternative strategy for blindly following basic usability heuristics would be better to position the interface to new users. <br><br>  In the case of the progressive simplification method, we focus not on a group of users with a certain experience, but on the fact that the experience of each user tends to change.  Therefore, with progressive simplification, our interface will gradually change, adapting to each individual user, guiding him from onboarding to more advanced use of the product. <br><br><h4>  Practical application </h4><br>  When a person uses any function of the application, after several times he will know exactly what a particular button is doing, and he will not need hints.  Over time, the user remembers what the icon on the button means, which he uses, and later remembers its location.  Therefore, as the user interacts with different functions, the application interface must adapt to his user experience. <br><br>  To implement this idea, your application must track the interaction of users with its elements and save the data in the ‚Äúproficiency profile‚Äù, which will be created for each individual user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c99/da8/aff/c99da8affeec5d2369bec918345f9218.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The example above shows the ‚ÄúSignpost‚Äù button, which is first implemented as a large icon with a caption.  When a person uses it a certain number of times, the inscription is removed from the button.  When the user demonstrates his ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, in the interface this button generally ceases to stand out.  You can also use other options for simplification, be it a change of icon, size, contrast, colors, and so on. <br><br>  The main goal is to make it easier for the inexperienced user to understand the interface, and for the experienced user to unload the interface from unnecessary elements, which will ensure a more comfortable use of the product. <br><br><h4>  Fading experience </h4><br>  In addition to the concept of simplification, no less important is the so-called "fading experience" (Experience Decay).  The point is that returning to the interface that we have not used for a long time, it‚Äôs difficult for us to immediately start using it as quickly as before.  This is due to the fact that over time, our user experience is forgotten. <br><br>  So after a long absence of interactions, it becomes necessary to re-introduce (in an unobtrusive form) the user with the interface.  To do this, we reduce the "advanced" interface to a more understandable. <br><br>  For example, it looks like this: let's say, for the action ‚Äúupload a photo‚Äù we have a set of icons, each of which is assigned a user experience level at which it should be displayed.  Then, if we had a second-level icon, but the user did not upload photos for a certain time, we return the first-level icon. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãextinction of experience is very important, as it helps to balance the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprogressive reduction, which reduces the risk of a bad impression from your product. <br><br><h4>  Space for growth </h4><br>  Most often, the implementation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprogressive simplification is found in video games or social networks, and less often in more serious applications. <br><br>  It is likely that the concept of progressive simplification will contribute to the emergence of user interfaces with a high level of customization, elements of which will be customized to suit the person who uses it.  One of the next steps could be placing accents on the interface components that would stimulate interaction with certain functions, or vice versa - introducing a function that would hide unused elements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304192/</a></p>
