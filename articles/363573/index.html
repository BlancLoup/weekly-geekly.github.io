Commander Keen, Dangerous Dave, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake - a series of games that live in the hearts and minds of many gamers.  Id Tech engines have long been the coolest among first-person shooter engines, and also served as a source of ideas for others.  And the Source Engine also grew out of it.  Unfortunately, the latest developments of the company have not received such an unequivocally positive assessment among the players.  But the text that I used in this video was written in the mid-90s, in the years of the company's former greatness. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QzuBY4twg8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhig6BgS9ArRVy7sNcw_yhWIzmagAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The offscreen text in the video is not mine, it was written in 1996-1997 by a man named <b>Nikolai Komarkov</b> .  Initially, this story I met back in those years, on the website 3dstyle.ru.  At the moment the site does not exist, the e-mail address specified by it - too.  So alas, I could not contact him.  But what if he now reads this text or receives a link to it?  It would be nice‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_3D-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">I saved the</a> text <a href="http://www.old-games.ru/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_3D-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">here,</a> so that descendants would not lose it. <br><br>  The text itself is like controversial points, for example, it states that the Unreal Engine is a modification of the Quake engine, or that the publisher Descent was 3D Realms (they actually planned this, but did not grow together).  There are some very strange moments, like the fact that ROTT (Rise of the Triad) was a serious competitor to Doom.  This could be in principle (after all there are interesting pieces there), but I did not find confirmation in the form of press reviews of those years, for example.  Or maybe looking bad?  I am pleased to read if you find the source of such information!  Footnotes with my comments are controversial points on the link above. <br><br>  Now about the preparation of the video.  Comments to my releases periodically write that diction is far from ideal.  Well, there is such.  But alas, it‚Äôs not possible for me to agree on a voice acting with someone else.  Periodically there were some individuals who threatened to raise the quality of transmission to a new level.  I sent them the text for voice acting - after which I heard nothing from them.  Their enthusiasm was enough only for waving a banner with the words "I will definitely do better!"  So, in desperation, the voice acting, I decided to prepare myself. <br><br>  Video of all games that I recorded independently (most) was written either through DosBox (does anyone need an article about all the tricks of launching old Dos / Win 3.1 / Win95-98 / Glide-games? Write about it in the comments!), Or through source Ports like GlRott, GlQuake or Zandronum (Doom / Heretic / Hexen).  This allowed the image to be immediately rendered in high resolution, such as 1024x768 or even immediately at 1280x720, so that, on the one hand, it does not frighten the viewer with large pixels, and, on the other hand, it does not spoil the image with artificial filtering. <br><br>  Perhaps the video idea itself was not very good.  But in any case, I will soon find out from the comments and ratings.  Thanks in advance for the feedback! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363573/</a></p>
