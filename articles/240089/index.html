The subject as a whole is ‚Äúhow to implement open source software‚Äù, ‚Äúprospects for import substitution‚Äù, ‚Äúopen source software in all types - from government portal to CAD systems and Instant Messengers‚Äù, the intricacies of developing complex open source, chips of domestic Linux distributions.  Speakers - ALT Linux, Red Hat, ROSA, Institute for System Programming, etc.  Unfortunately, it turned out that a few people gathered - autumn illnesses mowed the participants and speakers (one of them was in a half-dead state and managed to record a remote report ...), well, it is difficult, despite being free, to gather people for a conference not in the city transport hub.  As a result, only a half dozen reports, and they are looking for the audience - I made good-quality video recording (editing from several cameras and a screen, sound from microphones, animation technology, etc.) <br><br>  Pikreleted - minute review video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/106435790" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      And under the cut I offer a brief review-classification with links to videos and additional materials (‚Äúslides, abstracts, contacts of the speaker‚Äù). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The actual topic of "Import Substitution" on the one hand is very vague, because a lot of weakly confirmed rumors are sucked up by discussions here and everywhere, on the other - the movement in this direction goes, we must determine not only with positions, but with the definitions themselves - and then you can listen to what the ALT Linux executives, members of the FPA, the DRAsO say on this topic ... and a representative of the Ministry was very much expected for the discussion, he promised, but unfortunately, he did not come.  ‚Üí ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/86256500">Import substitution and the role of open source software in it</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140926-01">dopmaterials</a></sup> - In <i>my opinion</i> , a brief squeeze is ‚ÄúOK preferences, you need to clearly understand what domestic software is, but whether it is open source is not so important,‚Äù but of course, does not convey the completeness of theses, need to look if the topic is interesting. <br></p><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435704">Practical experience of overcoming the limitations of the national OS</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-02">dopmaterials</a></sup> is a very honest and cynical position that the introduction of open source software can only be <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-02">done</a></sup> systematically and from above, with political curators of the ‚ÄúZhirinovsky level‚Äù, and employees motivated at the ‚Äúapartment in Moscow‚Äù level, and everything else is children's garden. <br></li></ul><br><p>  As for the kindergarten, to a point, the guys from Chelyabinsk wrote down an excellent open source queue to kindergartens (well, anywhere, in general), and without a hard implementation from the top, no one needs transparency in the field: <br></p><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429988">Electric line - a free system for the implementation of public services</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-05">dopmaterialy</a></sup> <br></li></ul><br><p>  But if on the ground there are suddenly enterprising and honest officials (ay!), Then you don‚Äôt have to wait until the suffering state services are 100,500 times redone, there are already not only electronic lines, but also ready-made portals of the regional level: <br></p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúA <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435715">free open source automation platform for state and municipal services (a typical solution for municipalities)</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-04">additional materials</a></sup> <br></li></ul><br><p>  Well, there is always an interesting topic of monetization of open-source ‚Üí ‚ÄúHack for getting money from GPL-works in small business‚Äù (although it is called differently): <br></p><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435809">Commercialization of open source software under the GPL license</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-01">additional materials</a></sup> - Russian hacked GPLv3 (Stallman knows and resents), found a way to legally kosher hide sors, opening them only to the buyer.  This is the author's third report on this topic, which I am recording (I was at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/92202996">ROSS-2014</a> , and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/106435846">LVEE</a> ), but the critical discussion is always interesting - programmers attack for depriving them of motivation, freedoms and patches from the community, distro builders do not understand what the key is to close and sawing the fork alone (and Stallman does not prohibit "making distributions"), integrators - what is the point of making money on several clients, ethically savvy at all ... But here we must understand a niche - small-scale customized solutions in a barely alive SMB, where such a hack can cope with so that p  it is useful to know about the cost of finalizing the basic GPL-platform for a dozen other customers, well, in general, about this hack. <br></li></ul><br><hr><br><p>  ALT Linux-specific reports: <br></p><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429999">Package</a> <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-06">Maintenance</a></sup> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429999">Automation Cluster</a> <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-06">One</a></sup> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429999">Year Later</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-06">dopmaterials</a></sup> is just about the feat of the dedicated self-maintainer of automated package updating in alto, who recorded a remote report in exhausted condition.  Yes, automation of taxis, but the productivity of the maintainer has increased 100 times, the cluster of Autobot scales and pulls another 100 times more, but the man is one, and there is no more strength, you need help.

Research continues, because the full-fledged timemachine-functionality (‚Äúreturn when everything worked!‚Äù) Is what is missing in Linux distributions, and perhaps this is what is holding back from widespread distribution. <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435709">Qucs - Using open source software for modeling electronic circuits</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-03">Additional materials</a></sup> - excellent software, tearing commercial analogues by their features, they are suitable for training, dopilivaetsya by the author of the report. <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435773">Xabber is an XMPP client for the Android platform</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-10">additional materials</a></sup> - <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-10">Oooh</a></sup> ... what hopes were pinned recently on the XMPP triumph, and why it didn‚Äôt take off, why everyone betrayed it, why the issue of normal Instant Messaginga is still not resolved - with multidepartmental message synchronization , with adhoc-chats, with an easy transition to voice and video communication ... Around one "vossapp" and "yo", on their background, even Skype looks like an ideal.  One hope is that the authors who drank a great android Xabber, will be engaged in the desktop version, and finish up some Gajim.  Waiting for! <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435742">Rodin is a platform for developing and verifying models for Event-B</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-12">dopmaterials</a></sup> - Here we must read not Rodina (oh, this is a discussion of import substitution), but Rodin, for it was clearly named after him.  This software is from insane French logicians for verification of formal event models (Kripke structure and other temporal matane).  Specialists from ISPR, who have long been involved in testing / verifying models / static analysis, were hired by a company that had previously seen holes in the rights system - and the guys formally investigated and tested the new system, proving its correctness.  Yes, if you are very tense (the work is dreary, software does not support teamwork, etc.), you can prove the correctness of some limited models ... And if you generate software from these models, then there is also error-free software (an example of software for the Paris metro was cited - ‚Äú16 years without a single mistake ").  But if you do not generate, and write with your hands, mistakes, of course, will be.  And if you generate ... who knows, maybe there, in Paris, for 16 years now they cannot add a single feature.  Yes, and it still does not save from accidents (I googled, fully, with victims). <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435747">Apache Hadoop 2.0 (YARN).</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435747">Recent trends in big data processing (BigData)</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-08">additional materials</a></sup> - Apachhadup disappointed everyone with its stupidity - why do we need scalability, if we can only consider elementary arithmetic, and some company writes Yet Another for a couple of years, and it seems like something good happens. <br></li></ul><br><hr><br><p>  Here, I hope the dear reader will find something interesting (Sunday is the same), write comments, or follow the links to contacts (usually there are reliable links on social networks and, at worst, mail), and contact the authors. <br></p><p>  By the way, these are still beta versions of the video, they have ‚Äúdebug information‚Äù embroidered in them - for example, red time markers of the true time.  So if all of a sudden, you find some critical bug in the video (the sound is gone, you need to make the screen bigger in order to read something, or vice versa, remove the screen to see the laser pointer) - write <a rel="nofollow" href="">me</a> , or comment to the video, or BOS, in general, as you please - specifying this very range of time and problem - as long as (a couple of weeks), you can still fix it. <br><br></p>  Bonus: here are the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/stas-fomin/album/153021/">pictures</a> from there, here are the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.altlinux.ru/fileadmin/news/kaluga-xi-2014.pdf">pdf theses</a> , here is the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.rosalab.ru/ru/index.php/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3:%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%258B/OSSDEVCONF-2013">report from the photo-video</a> about last year's OSSDEVCONF. <br><br><br><p>  I hope that next year someone who reads will come to listen or tell. <br></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240089/</a></p>
