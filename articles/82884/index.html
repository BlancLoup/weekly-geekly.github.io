  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where does the creative come from?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>‚ÄúCreative‚Äù</b> is the most popular adjective in the design world.  Everyone wants to be creative, to find a creative solution for any task.  The word ‚Äúcreative‚Äù has many synonyms: innovative, gifted, inspired, inventive, original.  But what does this super popular adjective really mean?  And how can you ‚Äúturn on‚Äù creativity? <br><br>  In Latin, the word <em>"creatio"</em> meant <em>"to create,"</em> but was applicable exclusively to the affairs of God.  Only in the Renaissance, when a person fully realized his ability to create and bring something new to the world, did this word start to be applied to people. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCreative‚Äù always includes finding new ideas or trends, be it a fresh solution of perennial problems, a new object of art or form.  In other words, a creative thing is always something original and necessary.

      Often, a person‚Äôs personality traits speak of his creativity.  For example, without self-confidence, you are unlikely to succeed in creating something new, as well as without looking at things and simple curiosity different from most. <br><br>  Anyway, even with a whole list of positive personal characteristics and an excellent working environment, you cannot count on a 100% creative result. <br>  There are 3 ways to awaken a creative: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Brainstorm </h1><br>  The term first used by Alex Osborne in his book, Applied Imagination.  Brainstorming is best used in small groups, but you can apply one-on-one with yourself. <br>  Brainstorming is as follows: <br><br>  To begin with, the task must be explained and clearly stated to each member of the group.  Someone from the group is selected to write down all general ideas on the board, so that they can be seen all at once and objectively compare / combine / select. <br>  Brainstorming involves the nomination and recording of even the most obvious decisions.  Criticism of the proposed ideas is not permissible, every, even the most, at first glance, idiotic idea is accepted and recorded along with the rest.  Next, participants must develop all the ideas of each other. <br><br>  Jean - Michel Basquiat, an American artist who became famous at first as a graffiti artist in New York, and then, in the 1980s, as a very successful neo-expressionist, in search of inspiration used and put together objects and symbols in brainstorming Haitian, African and American culture.  Starting with the simplest, colors and shapes, he added more complex elements and combined the resulting. <br><img src="http://h1h1.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Jean-Michel-Basquiat.jpg" alt="Jean-Michel Basquiat" title="Jean-michel basquiat"><br><br><h1>  Thinking outside the box </h1><br>  ‚ÄúNon-standard thinking‚Äù or ‚Äúcomprehensive approach‚Äù is a creative way to get really fresh and unexpected ideas.  It consists in an extraordinary approach to the solution of the task and the generation of ideas that it would be impossible to invent with the traditional step-by-step method.  In other words - this is a way to solve the problem in "workaround" ways. <br><br>  Edward de Bono, the man who coined the term ‚Äúthinking outside the box‚Äù <em>(Lateral Thinking)</em> in English, gained fame as one of the most respected figures in the field of creative thinking, innovation, and teaching thinking as a science.  Edward de Bono considers it very important to avoid the traditional, embedded in the brain, ways of thinking.  Here is one of its definitions of the term ‚Äúnon-standard thinking‚Äù: <em>‚Äúnon-standard thinking consists in changing the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe task and views on it instead of diligent attempts to solve the problem using traditional views and ideas‚Äù</em> <br><br>  As a demonstration of the use of this way of thinking, we take a simple task, for example, opening the door.  Try to come up with an alternative to using the doorknob.  It makes you look for some creative way to open the door.  It may be associated with the traditional solution with the door manual or, conversely, radically different from it.  Reflections on this make you think outside the box and come to really interesting solutions. <br><br>  Albert Einstein, whose name has become synonymous with the genius of originality and creativity, once said: "Modern problems will be solved in the future using an approach that has nothing to do with today's approach, which led to the emergence of these problems."  It is clear that Einstein used the method of non-standard thinking to circumvent the traditional principles in solving problems.  Also, he used this method of thinking in formulating his theories and theorems in order to explain the world of physics to us. <br><br><h1>  Inversion </h1><br>  In his book ‚ÄúWhat a great idea,‚Äù Charles Thomson suggested that the only way to fully understand this world is to look at things from both the positive and negative sides.  For example, yin - yang, summer-winter, day - night. <br>  The inversion method is based on considering the problem in reverse.  Make a negative statement out of positive, try to look at the problem from the reverse side.  This can help you come up with unexpected solutions. <br><br>  Rene Magritte, the famous surrealist from Belgium painted this picture, which depicts a pipe. <br><br><img src="http://h1h1.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/26-05_magritte_pipe.jpg" alt="magritte_pipe" title="magritte_pipe"><br><br>  And under the picture Magritte wrote - <em>‚ÄúCeci n'est pas une pipe‚Äù (This is not a pipe)</em> .  With this unexpected inscription, Magritte makes the observers of the painting ask themselves the question: If this is not a pipe, then what is it? <br>  The answer to this question is the picture.  Magritte used the inversion method in order to emphasize the object of her labor - the picture, and not what is depicted on it. <br><br><h1>  Finally </h1><br>  Sir Ken Robinson, a famous thinker of the 20th century, argues that most of the children, by the time of his growing up, are losing the ability for creative thinking.  They are afraid to make a mistake, they are unlearned to be creative. <br>  Why is this happening? <br>  To support creativity in children means to support them in contrast to society, a violation of existing norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãof society.  To be creative means to cast doubt on the old methods and ways of solving problems and invent your own, more convenient, and this is not always correctly perceived by society, especially in childhood.  Similarity with society and creativity are becoming mutually exclusive concepts. <br><br>  People whose daily work is to invent creative solutions are well aware of how difficult it is sometimes to explain to society what you do and why it is all necessary.  But do not let them break themselves.  Impress everyone with your creative decisions to make society support dissimilar views on things. <br><br>  The creativity hidden in you is already breaking free.  So let him out! <br><br>  <s>A translation of this article can also be read on <a href="http://h1h1.ru/kreativ-where-is-creativity/">h1h1.ru.</a></s> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82884/</a></p>
