  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Working with a GSM module using the example of SIM900D</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not long ago, a friend offered me a job related to creating firmware for a microcontroller, which was supposed to communicate with the server using the GSM-module <a href="http://www.gsm-gate.ru/product/gsm-modul-simcom-sim900d/">SIM900D</a> .  Previously, I didn‚Äôt deal with programming microcontrollers, and I also programmed with C for the last time in student days, but curiosity outweighed me and I set to work.  Documentation for this piece of hardware is <a href="http://www.microchip.ua/simcom/%3Flink%3D/GSM-GPRS-GPS/SIM900/AppNotes">present</a> on the Internet, but no good examples of working with TCP / IP were found in the code.  There was nothing left but to lay down the documentation, stock up on cigarettes and tea and start maneuvering between the rakes.  And there was a lot of rake.  Actually, that's why I wrote this article - so that it would be easier for others. <br><br>  Further there will be a lot of AT commands, not too much code and a lot of letters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What was needed </h4><br>  It was necessary to write code that could initialize the GSM module, establish a connection with the server, receive and send arbitrary data, check the connection status and work without failures.  And also be compact enough to fit in the limited memory of the microcontroller and leave space for the main functionality and a little more to spare. <br><br><h4>  What happened in the end </h4><br>  It turned out the code in C, which can all that was needed.  Because of the requirements of compactness, it was necessary to parse the answers and generate the lines with the help of my code, which is even a shame to show honest people.  Therefore, I recommend everyone to use regular expressions for these purposes.  I am also going to translate my code into a lightweight regular expression engine, but after creating a fully functional firmware.

      The code requires functions / macros for working with a serial port, as well as the presence of memset and memcpy functions.  So it can be transferred with relative ease to another platform without hooking a bunch of libraries along the way. <br><br><h4>  And how does it look? </h4><br>  Programming and testing was carried out under Windows 7. The code obtained as a result became the main material for this article.  I will not give the code completely and comment it, but instead I will show the algorithm for setting up and working with the GSM module. <br><br>  Functions required by the code: <br><ul><li> <code>uint16_t init_serial_port(char *port_name)</code> This function configures the specified serial port.  Under Windows. </li><li>  <code>uint16_t puts_serial(uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t size)</code> And this one writes a string of bytes to this port. </li><li>  <code>gets_serial(uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t size)</code> This, respectively, reads a string of bytes from the serial port. </li></ul><br>  The functions that the code provides: <br><ul><li>  <code>init_gprs() &amp; stop_gprs()</code> The GSM module is initialized and cut down accordingly. </li><li>  <code>uint16_t connect_gprs(uint8_t index, uint8_t mode, char *address, char *port)</code> Establishes a connection to the server.  It is worth noting that the module can work with TCP and UDP protocols both as a client and as a client.  A maximum of 8 simultaneous connections is supported. </li><li>  <code>uint16_t close_gprs(uint8_t index)</code> Closes the specified connection. </li><li>  <code>uint16_t send_gprs(uint8_t index, uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t size)</code> Send a message through the specified connection. </li><li>  <code>uint16_t recv_gprs(uint8_t index, uint8_t *buffer, uint16_t size)</code> Receive message.  Non-blocking function, which means it will not wait for data to appear in the stream, but will return control if there is nothing to receive.  It is worth noting that this behavior is easier to implement than blocking. </li></ul><br><h4>  How to work with serial port </h4><br>  It is quite simple.  Under the target microcontroller, there are macros for sending / receiving data via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter">USART</a> , but since it is easier to debug such code from a stationary computer, I was provided with a bundle of USB &lt;-&gt; USART adapter and GSM module.  It only remained to learn how to work with a serial port under Windows.  It turned out to be simple.  In short, the serial port is represented in the OS as a regular file, information transfer is performed by the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365467(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">ReadFile</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365747(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">WriteFile functions</a> .  You only need to set some parameters using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363437(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">SetCommTimeouts</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363436(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">SetCommState functions</a> . <br><br>  Here is the port initialization function: <br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> init_serial_port(<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span></span> *port_name) { COMMTIMEOUTS timeouts; DCB parameters; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> result; serial_port_handle = CreateFile(port_name, <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// "\\\\.\\COMx" GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, 0, //         NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, 0, NULL); if (serial_port_handle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) { printf("Error opening a serial port!\n"); return 1; } //        timeouts.ReadIntervalTimeout = 100; //          timeouts.ReadTotalTimeoutMultiplier = 0; //     ,      //   timeouts.ReadTotalTimeoutConstant = 1000; //   ,      ,     . timeouts.WriteTotalTimeoutMultiplier = 0; timeouts.WriteTotalTimeoutConstant = 1000; result = SetCommTimeouts(serial_port_handle, &amp;timeouts); if (result == 0) { printf("Error setting timeouts for serial port!\n"); close_serial_port(); return 1; } //        -   // ,   , 1 -. memset(¬∂meters,0,sizeof(parameters)); parameters.DCBlength = sizeof(DCB); GetCommState(serial_port_handle, &amp;parameters); parameters.BaudRate = (DWORD)BAUD_RATE; parameters.ByteSize = 8; parameters.Parity = NOPARITY; parameters.StopBits = ONESTOPBIT; parameters.fAbortOnError = TRUE; parameters.fDtrControl = DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE; parameters.fRtsControl = RTS_CONTROL_DISABLE; parameters.fBinary = TRUE; parameters.fParity = FALSE; parameters.fOutX = FALSE; parameters.fInX = FALSE; parameters.XonChar = (uint8_t)0x00; parameters.XoffChar = (uint8_t)0xff; parameters.fErrorChar = FALSE; parameters.fNull = FALSE; parameters.fOutxCtsFlow = FALSE; parameters.fOutxDsrFlow = FALSE; parameters.XonLim = 128; parameters.XoffLim = 128; result = SetCommState(serial_port_handle, &amp;parameters); if (result == 0) { printf("Error setting serial port parameters!\n"); close_serial_port(); return 1; } return 0; }</span></span></code> </pre> <br><br><h4>  How does the communication with the GSM-module </h4><br>  After the serial port is configured, AT commands can be sent to it.  The first command must be the sequence <code>"AT\r"</code> , which allows the module to automatically adjust the baud rate on the serial port.  The answer that can be obtained after this from the port will look like <code>"AT\r\r\nOK\r\n"</code> . <br><br>  The command is a simple string of ASCII characters.  In order for the command to accept the module, at the end of the command you need to put the carriage transfer character <code>"\r"</code> .  In response, the module will transmit a string of characters consisting of two parts ‚Äî a command to which the module responds with a response separated by the "\ r \ r \ n" characters, terminated by the characters <code>"\r\n"</code> .  To make it easier to parse the answers, I created a macro that sets a pointer to the beginning of the response in the receive buffer.  If you want to output the answer to the console, you need to add a null character to the end of the received message. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">at_send</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(</span></span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">char</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> *cmd, </span></span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"> size)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> result; cmd[size - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'\r'</span></span>; result = puts_serial(cmd, size); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span>; } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> at_recv(<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint8_t</span></span> *buffer, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> size) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">uint16_t</span></span> result; result = gets_serial(buffer, size); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> result; }</code> </pre><br>  Something like this and support functions for sending commands and receiving a response. <br><br><h4>  Module initialization </h4><br>  The largest function in the code is responsible for configuring the module.  During initialization, many AT commands are sent.  I will describe them in the order of sending the module.  I do not specifically list the arguments and answer options in detail, for they can be found in the documentation. <br><ul><li>  <code>"AT+CPIN=pin-code"</code> As it is easy to guess, this command unlocks the SIM card by entering the pin code.  To check if a pin is required, you can use the command <code>"AT+CPIN?"</code>  . </li><li> <code>"AT+CREG?"</code>  This command returns the registration status of the module to the network.  It is necessary to perform it until the module answers that it is registered on the network. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CGATT=1"</code> Forces the module to connect to GPRS.  To check if it is connected, use the command <code>"AT+CGATT?"</code>  . </li><li>  <code>"AT+CIPRXGET=1"</code> Enables manual retrieval of data transmitted over a connection.  By default, this option is disabled and data is transferred to the serial port immediately after it is received.  This is not very convenient, although not critical - you can configure the module so that, along with the data, it also sends IP headers by which you can determine who the packet was from.  I decided that it was easier to get data manually and I was not mistaken.  As I understand it, this command is perceived only by GSM-modules SIM.COM. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CIPMUX=1"</code> By default, the module can establish only one connection.  This option enables the ability to create multiple connections.  Sending and receiving data will differ by only one parameter - the connection index. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CSTT="internet""</code> APN - Access Point Name, the name of the access point for GPRS.  For my provider it looks that way. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CIICR"</code> Establishes a GPRS wireless connection.  It may take some time, so you need to run it in a loop and check the answer. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CIFSR"</code> Returns the IP address of the module.  I use it to check if the module is connected to the Internet. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CDNSCFG="8.8.8.8","8.8.4.4""</code> This command sets the DNS servers that the module will use. </li><li>  <code>"AT+CIPSTATUS"</code> In addition to connection status data, this command provides information on whether the module is ready to establish connections.  So you need to check her answer. </li></ul><br>  After executing these commands, the module will be ready for operation.  Well or not.  Then how lucky. <br><br><h4>  Installation and disconnection </h4><br>  Creating a connection is done with the command <code>"AT+CIPSTART=index,"mode","address","port""</code> . <br><ul><li>  <code>index</code> indicates the serial number of the connection, can take values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 0 to 7. </li><li>  <code>mode</code> defines the protocol to be used by the connection.  May be ‚ÄúTCP‚Äù or ‚ÄúUDP‚Äù. </li><li>  <code>address</code> specifies the server address.  If the DNS server was specified during the configuration, then you can use both the IP address and the domain name. </li><li>  <code>port</code> specifies the server port to connect to. </li></ul><br>  I note that when using the UDP protocol, the datagrams will be sent and received only from one address by default.  In order to use UDP to the fullest and send / receive data from any addresses, you can use the so-called extended UDP mode, configured by the command <code>"AT+CIPUDPMODE"</code> .  For details, refer to the documentation. <br><br>  In response to the command, you can get several answers.  If everything is good, then after the standard <code>"OK"</code> after a short period of time, you can get one of three answers: <br><ul><li>  <code>"index,ALREADY CONNECT"</code> this means that the connection with the specified index is already established and it is worth looking for it. </li><li>  <code>"index,CONNECT OK"</code> everything is obvious here. </li><li>  <code>"index,CONNECT FAIL"</code> means that there are problems with establishing a connection. </li></ul><br>  You can break the connection with the command <code>"AT+CIPCLOSE=index"</code> .  To disconnect all connections and deactivate the GPRS interface, use the <code>"AT+CIPSHUT"</code> . <br><br><h4>  Data transfer </h4><br>  The data is transmitted by the command <code>"AT+CIPSEND=index,length"</code> , where <code>index</code> indicates the connection over which data is to be sent, and <code>length</code> specifies the length of the data packet.  By the way, you can find the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTU">MTU</a> for each connection using the command <code>"AT+CIPSEND=?"</code>  . <br><br>  If all is well, the module in response to the command will display the <code>"&gt;"</code> prompt, after which you need to send data to the serial port.  As soon as the module receives a number of bytes equal to <code>length</code> , it will say something like <code>"index,SEND OK"</code> .  In general, you can not use the <code>length</code> parameter, however, in this case, the end of the data packet should be indicated explicitly with the <code>0x1A</code> symbol, in the terminal the combination Ctrl + Z.  This option is obviously not suitable for transmitting arbitrary data. <br><br>  As you can see, data transfer is not a very complicated process.  Therefore, we turn to the most interesting - data reception. <br><br><h4>  Receiving data </h4><br>  As soon as the GSM module receives data, it signals this by sending a string like <code>"+CIPRXGET:1,index\r\n"</code> to the serial port.  I honestly do not know what unit means, because this function of the module is documented rather weakly, but in my case it appears in all messages about the reception of a packet. <br><br>  I wasn‚Äôt happy about the thought of having to monitor the module‚Äôs messages one way or another.  However, after playing a little with the debugger, I found out that the module does not send any other asynchronous messages, and also that after executing any AT command, this message appears at the beginning of the buffer.  Since I made a macro to separate the response from the command by searching for the substring <code>"\r\r\n"</code> , this did not bother me in any way.  So the data reception function was implemented quite simply. <br><br>  So, you can receive data with the command <code>"AT+CIPRXGET=2,index,length"</code> .  Two means reception mode, in this case the bytes are simply poured into the serial port.  You can also set to receive data in the form of HEX-text, apparently for the sake of preventing conflicts with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XON/XOFF">software flow control</a> .  I did not need this, because I do not use flow control at all.  The <code>length</code> parameter specifies the size of the data packet that we wish to receive at one time. <br><br>  In response, we get something like <code>"+CIPRXGET:2,index,received,excess\r\n__DATA__\r\nOK\r\n"</code> .  The <code>received</code> field will contain the number of bytes in the <code>__DATA__</code> data <code>__DATA__</code> , and the <code>excess</code> field will contain the number of bytes waiting for their turn in the module's buffer.  So if the <code>received</code> field is zero, you can declare with a clear conscience that there is nothing to receive.  Actually, using this, I implemented a non-blocking function for receiving data. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  I strongly recommend before writing code to get comfortable in AT-commands using <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> , which works fine with the serial port. <br><br>  I hope the information from this article will help someone to write the code for your SIM900.  It is possible that the principles of working with the GSM module described above can also be applied to modules of other models, and, possibly, manufacturers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119030/</a></p>
