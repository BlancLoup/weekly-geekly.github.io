We use educational methods to select the best specialists for business tasks.  We collected and typed vacancies of large IT business players, created courses on the basis of the received requirements.  We have concluded agreements <a href="http://otus.ru/">with these companies</a> that our best students will be interviewed for relevant positions.  We connect, as we hope, the best employers with the most motivated professionals. <br><br>  Now we are doing a pilot, we are launching the first Java course.  Four more courses are on the way, plans are about 40. But at this stage it is important for us to test our educational technology, to make our product of high quality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Who are we?</b>

      We are a startup, but we are not starting from scratch.  Our team has extensive experience in preparing students for work in IT production.  We passed on our own experience that we gained in successful commercial projects: knowledge about truly loaded servers, truly fault-tolerant solutions, combat-tested security systems and user interfaces that were used by millions of people. <br><br>  Our graduates successfully work in the best IT companies around the world.  Many of them also teach. <br><br>  In the requirements for a job seeker, a senior developer often writes: work experience from 5 years.  We have experience of 5 years in education in IT.  And we are going to move to a new level of training of specialists. <br><br>  <b>Employment?</b> <br><br>  What does the specialist expect from education?  We think of opportunities.  More opportunities to create.  A programmer is a profession about creating a new one.  And in order to write better and more, you need to know how and what to write.  On the other hand, to participate in the creation of really big products, conditions are needed.  If a programmer wants to create great products, he needs a good company. <br><br>  Otus.ru is a project that brings together companies, professionals and education.  We work for professionals.  We collect the requirements of companies and create educational programs for specialists on their basis.  We work for the company.  We prepare for them employees who are interviewed through knowledge and experience, rather than by training for interviews. <br><br>  Our task is to help you create projects that you will be proud of.  And help you find a company that will appreciate you for it. <br><br>  <b>The first set?</b> <br><br>  The first set is always special.  All the most interesting is happening at this time.  The course program for the first set is always the freshest.  The teacher is most attentive to the audience.  Listeners ask the most unexpected questions. <br><br>  Of course, you need some courage to decide to participate in something from the very beginning.  And this courageous act can bring very positive results.  We decided on this.  We invite you to join us and get the most attention, the freshest material, the most possibilities. <br><br>  <b>Group?</b> <br><br>  We planned to recruit 20-30 students.  We came up with tests that we had to check for those who wanted to join the course and skip only those whom we can prepare to work in partner companies.  We expected 100-150 specialists to pass the test. <br><br>  At the moment, more than 300 people have successfully passed the test.  And it's not a test.  We just have 3 times more registrations, compared to what we expected. <br><br>  We are still planning to recruit students before the start of classes, as promised in posts and letters.  We are very pleased that you are interested in our initiative.  Now we are thinking about attracting more teachers and seminarians to the work, about increasing the group, or recruiting two groups. <br><br>  <b>As it will be?</b> <br><br>  The first lesson of the course will be held on April 1st.  And we are sure that this is a great date to start a good business. <br><br>  Course format - webinars, which will be conducted by the teacher of the course.  Based on the webinar material, you will receive homework assignments that will be checked by the course instructors and seminarians.  All webinars will be recorded, you can refer to the records at any time. <br><br>  You can at any time contact the teacher and other students with a question on the material and practical work in the group specially created for the course in slack. <br><br>  Classes will be held twice a week.  At the weekend, a lecture and on weekdays - practice. <br><br>  The first four months you study the <a href="http://otus.ru/lessons">materials of the program</a> and during the fifth write a project work under the guidance of a teacher. <br><br>  The top five students of the course will be interviewed by Otus partner companies.  All students receive a certificate with an indication of progress in learning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324658/</a></p>
