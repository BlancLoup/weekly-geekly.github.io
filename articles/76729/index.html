  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MediaMarkt Discovery, Lemmings and Consumer Protection Act</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until recently, I have never had the pleasure to visit MediaMarkt stores.  Recently I saw an advertisement about the ‚Äúgrand opening‚Äù in Moscow of two new supermarkets.  I am not fond of sales and other promotions.  Rather, it coincided that I had to choose something from home appliances, and the opening was scheduled for 12 nights - exactly at the time when I was driving without work from traffic jams.  Especially my friend was traveling with me, who was also interested in attending this event. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the very beginning, my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis discovery came down to the following: we will arrive at 12 at night and in a calm atmosphere we will see everything.  Still, it was Thursday, and not everyone can afford to come to work the next day for dinner.  As it turned out - I really underestimated marketing.  According to subjective estimates, about 3,000 people arrived there.  We arrived somewhere to 12.30.  Inside is still not allowed.  They looked around at the whole crowd and realized that getting to the store in a reasonable time was not realistic.  Therefore, we went to a nearby store for groceries that also needed to be bought. <br>  After about 1.5 hours after slowly everything that was needed was bought, we decided to go and see how it was there in Mediamarkt.  We were very surprised that the store was still a line, but not very big.  Approximately 20 minutes. The desire to turn around and leave disappeared after we noticed a lot of happy owners of new TVs, microwaves, computers, etc.  happy out of the store.  Thousands of lemmings can not be wrong ?!) <br>  Inside, we got even much faster than expected.  We must pay tribute to them - everything was arranged in such a way that you can buy it willy-nilly, even if it really is not needed).  And apparently, most were guided by this when making purchases and not wanting to remain empty-handed, since they still arrived.  Since the general analysis of prices did not show any special and grand discounts.  True, a friend noticed a Lenovo laptop, the market price of which is about $ 60,000, and there the price tag called for a happy owner for a little less than $ 28,000.  A tempting offer.  Here are just a friend, the sales assistant said that the laptop is not for sale.  Since the price nakladochka out.  Like, many have already approached and wanted to buy ... But, sorry, I can not help you.  Just an annoying mistake. <br>  And in such cases, knowledge of the law on consumer protection is very useful.  There is a product, there is a price tag, which means they must sell.  After this simple thought was brought to the manager, they without any problems found the box, packed it and handed it the cherished laptop.  That's just according to their statements, he was, unfortunately, one and no such second in stock. <br>  Do you think this is really a ‚Äúmistake in the price list‚Äù or the action of MediaMarkt, whose employees decided to use it and purchase this laptop for themselves?  Especially if you consider that its price in the database corresponded to the one indicated on the price tag.  And why was he only one? </div>
