  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For beginners ubuntuvodov. My mini FAQ</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do not worry: this is not just another manual for beginners, which describes the basic principles of working with Ubuntu and its settings.  No, I don‚Äôt want to repeat myself at all, so I‚Äôll write about all sorts of trifles and questions that might interest the ‚ÄúNeophyte of the Cult of Ubunt‚Äù :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The transition from Windows can be very painful when you do not know where the familiar things are in the new system for a long time.  This is what usually makes you return to the usual as home slippers, OS.  My goal is to show those newbies like me that Ubuntu has it all and more!  In this case, I honestly try not to repeat those manuals that already exist in this blog. <br>  Considered <b>Ubuntu 8.04</b> with <b>Gnome 2.22.1</b> <br><br><h3>  Installation </h3><br>  Ubuntu can be installed on a computer in three ways: a text installer, installation from live-cd, installation as a win-application using <a href="http://wubi-installer.org/">Wubi</a> .  I highly recommend using the second method - installation from live-cd, and here's why: you have the opportunity to configure the network even before the start of the installation process.  Thanks to this, you will not have a problem with a half-localized interface - even during the installation ALL necessary language packs will be downloaded, as well as possible updates.  This will save your time. <br>  If you have no desire to configure the network, then it is better to disconnect the network cable altogether - Ubuntu can search the network for a very long time, and unknowing people get scared and think that the installation is frozen. <br>  There can be no installation instructions - everything is so simple, but nevertheless you can find even a <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubuntu710DesktopSetupRU">step-by-step installation guide in pictures</a> on the Internet.  The only thing worth noting is the choice of the ‚Äúwinkeys‚Äù layout in the third step.

    <h3>  Network and Internet Setup </h3><br>  I will express my extremely subjective opinion: without the Internet, installed from a usual Ubunt CD, it is practically useless.  And it's not just the absence of many media codecs and limited functionality of standard programs, but also the fact that without the support of the community and Google, your acquaintance with the new OS can drag on for a very long time.  If there is a connection with the global network, any issues are resolved in a few minutes.  So let's try setting up a network. <br><br>  The detailed configuration process is well described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ubuntu/34467.html">here</a> and in the ‚ÄúHelp and Support‚Äù, so I‚Äôll focus my attention on just one little thing: after changing the settings of the network interface, don‚Äôt be in a hurry to ping nodes and crawl to websites, since  it may take a couple of minutes to apply the configuration settings. <br><br>  I want to note that setting up a home network occurs without any problems!  All that needs to be done is to enter the name of the working group.  Everything!  Now all files, printers and other resources controlled by computers running Windows XP are easily accessible!  The network environment works fine, network resources are mounted automatically.  You may have to configure administrative security policies on your computer (s) with WinXP, disabling authorization for computers on your home network there. <br><br><h3>  Switch Layouts </h3><br>  The first inconvenience that I encountered was the absence of a layout indicator at its usual place.  Only later I learned that by default in linux, the indication of a change in the layout is Scroll Lock on the keyboard. <br>  Ubunt also has the ability to put the indicator in its usual place.  To do this, call the context menu of the bottom panel, select ‚ÄúAdd to panel‚Äù in it.  In the list that opens, we find the ‚ÄúKeyboard layout indicator‚Äù and safely add it.  You can even change the boring inscriptions "USA / Rus" to the icons of checkboxes. <br><img src="http://upimg.ru/i/28/121010460148874820bb1907609.gif"><br><br><h3>  Automatic switching (a la Punto Switcher) </h3><br>  As it is not regrettable, but there is no worthy analogue of Punto Switcher in Linux.  The only thing I know is <a href="http://xneur.ru/">xneur</a> .  But he did not suit me for the reason that the processor was loaded at 100%, and according to the opinions of people, the thing is quite buggy and raw.  By the way: on forum.ubuntu.ru an active discussion of this program is being conducted, including with the participation of the author himself. <br><br><h3>  Fonts and anti-aliasing </h3><br>  In my opinion, the question "... how to make fonts like in Windows?"  - one of the most popular.  The fact is that by default, ubunt uses very bold anti-aliasing and increased resolution (96 dpi) for fonts.  This is pretty cute, but very strange and completely unsuitable.  I must say: there is a solution.  You can do it like in Windows, namely: install all standard fonts, lower resolution, disable unnecessary anti-aliasing. <br>  Here are the links that will help you: <br>  <a href="http://forum.ubuntu.ru/index.php%3Ftopic%3D4462.0">Installing standard win-fonts</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.ubuntu.ru/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1377.0">Customize fonts in opera</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.ubuntu.ru/index.php%3Ftopic%3D25413.0">‚Ä¶ and further</a> <br><br><img src="http://upimg.ru/i/165/121010628196304820c1a9ed2bc.gif"><img src="http://upimg.ru/i/19/121010642453964820c238e940f.gif"><br><br>  If you use Gnome with KDE programs, your font settings may not affect them.  The solution to this problem: install the <strong>KControl</strong> program from the standard repository.  There, on the appearance tab, the font settings for KDE applications change. <br>  The only problem I didn‚Äôt solve was how to remove anti-aliasing for fonts with small size, and enable for fonts with large.  Just page titles without smoothing look a bit scary.  If anyone knows the solution, please unsubscribe here. <br><br>  <font color="gray">PS This is my first habratopik.</font>  <font color="gray">If the community approves of this post, then it will not be the last - I still have a lot of ideas.</font>  <font color="gray">And to tell the truth, it turned out not very informative, but for the first time it is enough, because</font>  <font color="gray">it's a bit of an introduction.</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">I ask all the minuses to justify their disadvantages - for me it is very important.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24912/</a></p>
