A rather cheeky way of presenting a theory, inappropriate jokes and stories from the lives of artists will help to make this publication useful for those who just want to relax while absorbing new information.

      For those experienced specialists who sooner or later will come here without fail to lynch me (at least for a similar manner of presentation and attitude to the subject), I apologize in advance.  I repent, a sinner, but I can‚Äôt do anything with myself, and I intend to continue to promote graphomania to the masses. <br><br>  The curtsy party is made, the rear is covered, the freak show can be considered open. <br><br>  I am sure that the bare theory you need nothing more than a dog fifth paw.  I also confess that all the times when I came across a naked theory ended in a sound sleep.  Once upon a time, when I was just beginning to study the first package of three-dimensional modeling, buying a couple of thick books and ignoring the well-known position that size is not important at all, amazing things began to happen to me.  On the very first pages.  I fell asleep.  Shameful.  In the poses in which the devil's book flushed me.  Everywhere.  Even in the subway. <br><br>  I do not want the same for you.  I want the story to be interesting, and therefore - down with the tedious theory, down with the rules, the lecturing tone and the useless aplomb.  No graphs, tables or comparisons.  Only emotions and fun, if possible, like this work.  One of the artworks I produced during the company in support of financing the development of the game Wasteland 2. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLTO4RtiFlI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxRLNTb2etg9iYg1E5leXPzWiZMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What will remain in the article, if you remove the technical information especially - you ask? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this article, I will tell you in a very free way about what concept art is, why there is so much of it in the network, why a project without it is doomed to failure, why it is needed in reality, I will tell you about the torments of conscience, about the ethical side of developing concepts. .  The fact that a successful concept is not necessarily done by a recognized master of the brush, and how these concepts can suddenly become a benchmark for all artists of the planet.  The case is not without visual examples, which are designed to draw boring text into a fascinating blockbuster about the adventures of a lion and a plunger. <br><br>  The promise is not bad, the peacock has fluffed up the tail.  But how well I coped with this business is that it is you and your expert assessment that will determine the fate of my future publications. <br><br><h4>  Chapter I - Theoretical Dances </h4><br><br><h5>  Small introductory </h5><br>  Many artists around the world draw hundreds of thousands of concepts daily.  The best digital galleries are crammed with diverse graphic content.  While I was writing two previous sentences, at least ten works were posted on one of the popular CGHUB resources.  This is a stream.  River.  Element. <br><br>  Let us ask ourselves the question - what makes all these people generate an insane army of concepts for something?  What is all this for?  Who needs it? <br><br>  For some artists, this is the breath, without which they cannot live.  They need to speak out, and a sheet of paper for them, which is a stage for an actor.  For others, this is a challenge, a challenge in which the artist is trying to prove to the rest of the world how cool he is, and how original his proposed concepts are.  Someone - PR.  For some, this is a routine work, where there is a task to generate at least five sketches per hour of work, so that someone else can choose the best one.  Someone is just a vacation.  There are more types of these artists than you can imagine, but ... <br><br>  ... All of them are united by one thing - they create quick concepts that can enable us to determine at an early stage whether it is worth developing the chosen direction or not.  Does the author or customer like it or not?  Should I use any piece of the image or should I throw it in the trash and start all over again.  Did you catch the thought prancing in your head? <br><br>  In this small they capture a lot. <br><br>  I want to draw your attention to one of these concepts.  This is not my work, but the work of the artist, whom I respect, a few words which, by the way, uttered at the right moment smoothed out the consequences of the blow that the game industry has inflicted on me in the face of ‚Äúvenerable daub masters‚Äù (hereinafter referred to as MMM). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09f/538/2b6/09f5382b65fbf6c382c102ec0c1cfeb3.jpg"><br>  <b>Author:</b> Leonid Kozienko <br>  <b>Source page:</b> <a href="http://agnidevi.deviantart.com/art/Samurai-Landing-76145704%3Fq%3Dgallery%253Aagnidevi%252F974741%26qo%3D102">link</a> <br><br>  Careless brush strokes and rough forms in no way affect the quality of work and the feeling of it, the viewer immediately understands what is in front of him, feels the dynamics of what is happening and can understand what the author was trying to convey to him.  This is the concept.  I would compare the concept with a curse or slap in the face.  Both the first and second quickly reach the goal.  Both that and another determines the further intentions of the person who carried out the action.  Both are just a sketch, a concept of a catastrophe that will break out with the received message in the form of a conceptual cuff if it does not heed it. <br><br><h5>  Purpose of concept art </h5><br>  The history of that concept art, which is known to us now through a variety of digital portals, as usual, has its roots in the deep past.  Far beyond the 30s of the last century, when the term concept art was rumored to be first voiced by Walt Disney Feature Animation.  Straight through the days of the first artists.  Not those who painted on the rocks of mammoths, but those who turned the art into a separate profession. <br><br>  Artists at all times made sketches anticipating writing paintings, and, of course, without these sketches it was impossible to grow, because daily practice and study is what makes growth possible, and what makes possible the subsequent transition from quantity to quality to meet new lessons and the unknown. <br><br>  Thus, under a beautiful term, as it often happens, the old as a world of truth is hidden.  Similarly, around us there are a variety of entities, covered with catchy terms, being, moreover, ordinary, ancient, for a thousand years like open bicycles. <br><br>  We will not try to cover what cannot be covered in this article and will pay attention only to concept art, which can be associated with games and movies, in other words, concept art of the entertainment industry. <br><br>  The main purpose of concept art is the creation in the shortest possible time of an outline or model of an object, which can then be put into production.  With minimal time loss, you can choose the best concept, thereby saving time and money.  Because if the concept is approved, the ‚Äúflywheels of machines‚Äù of other specialists are launched, and in the case of the gaming industry, models, locations and other game entities are created based on the concepts. <br><br>  In the case of the film industry, mockups or prototypes of real objects, such as the Titanic model or the ghost ship of Davy Jones, used in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean are starting to be developed.  An error at the level of the concept of incorrectly approved and put into production can result in multimillion-dollar losses.  In addition, a second equally valuable resource, time, will be lost. <br><br>  Besides the fact that concept art saves time and allows you to cut off the unnecessary at the earliest stages, it is a powerful tool for creating the world.  Without it, people creating this world will not get a holistic view of what is being created.  Because the concept in the head, and the concept on paper - not one, and too.  Yes, we see pictures in our heads every day, we present something, but our head thinks in images, but we need specifics.  And when this specifics is transferred by us to the canvas, we suddenly realize that not everything is so perfect, and that what was good in words, is not at all impressive in the form of a finished concept. <br><br>  The development of concept art is an integral part of developing something, from building a house to launching the development of a new car.  Or maybe a new popular mobile device, which is designed to bring the world to its knees.  A special case of such a concept art will long remain in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/24/technology/steve-jobs-patents.html">library of patents</a> , recalling the fecundity of Steve Jobs. <br>  I‚Äôll make a reservation right away - I‚Äôm not an Apple fan, I don‚Äôt even have touchscreen devices, but I respect those who go ahead and achieve their goals.  This man fully deserves it.  The only thing that such patents are is a very fragile field.  Having in hands of one artist it would be possible to patent the whole world, describing objects and potential objects existing in it, span by inch, the most important thing is to have fantasy. <br><br><h5>  Concept Art Technologies </h5><br>  Without any doubt, I will devote a number of articles to this topic, because the method of its development can be very different.  Whatever I do and whatever ways of creating it would be described by me, more than a bucket of snow from the top of the iceberg will not be able to be removed. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  The concept can be transferred using any materials existing on the ground.  Even sand from the beach can serve as material for creating concept art.  Let's leave the classic ways of creating it, put off pens, pencils, pens and brushes for an instant and turn our eyes on cinema. <br><br>  There are iconic people and iconic products that are always on the cutting edge of existing industries.  There are several such people in cinema, and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">Ridley Scott</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581">James Cameron</a> come to my mind first.  Today, more, I would like to mention the latter.  James Cameron is famous not only for sinking on the piano of De Caprio, and not even for global shots of the sinking giant ship.  In this case, his contribution to the cinema would not be so obvious.  "Avatar" with all its entertainment and a wide range of modern technologies used in it is also not the goal of my strike. <br><br>  I suggest you go deeper into the history of cinema, focusing on the movie "Aliens" 1986 release.  It is known that James Cameron during the shooting applied his hands to the project wherever possible, and none of the details of this landmark film was left without his attention. <br>  He was different and different today in that he always knows what he needs.  He always knows how what he is creating and why should look like.  And, if the concept artists working with him fail to fully realize what he needed, he takes on the task himself.  Namely ... for children's models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea7/32e/702/ea732e70280cf87e65bd0863d063d4c7.jpg"><br>  <i>James Cameron‚Äôs Sketches for Aliens.</i>  <i>It should be noted that among other things, he draws excellently, which gives him the opportunity to convey to his subordinates his ideas with maximum detail, both logical and visual.</i> <br>  <b>Image source:</b> <a href="http://worlak.net/%3Fp%3D1348">Link</a> <br><br>  There is a known case when James was never able to receive equipment of interest from his employees.  Without thinking twice, he went to the children's store, bought models of prefabricated equipment and collected from their fragments what he needed initially.  Thus, the samples of science fiction technology appeared, which are still relevant today.  Which, to this day, can be cited as an example to other designers. <br><br>  I must say that the technogenic style developed by him for ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù, I mean not only the technique, but also the elements of the environment, including the design of architecture, for many years became a reference and was used to create many Sci-Fi films, games , comics and pictures.  This style has been successfully operated so far by various offices.  Of the latest games that come to mind can be called Doom 3. <br><br>  It makes no sense to try to identify the main elements of Cameron's style, because this is not the task of this article, but we can mention that artists often hear tasks in the style: <br>  ‚ÄúMake me such a station, well ... how about Aliens, remember ?, - or <br>  - I would blind such crap as in Aliens, so that with mucus and so sick. <br><br>  ( <i>by the way, someone</i> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2584">Giger Hans Rudolph</a> <i>is responsible for nausea,</i> <i>he is still a character, bordering on insanity on genius, which no one denies. I will not give here his illustrations because I do not want Habr to be persecuted for advertising violence. Unfortunately, in our country it is possible all</i> ). <br>  <b>Giger website:</b> <a href="https://giger.com/gigerframeset.php">Link</a> <br><br>  When we move on to the next chapter, we will definitely try to go the classic way by creating a simple and fast concept, and at the same time, in addition to the classics, we will repeat the path of James Cameron with his shopping models. <br><br><h4>  Chapter II - Applied, where we ... apply </h4><br><h5>  Sign of four </h5><br>  These lines, my friends, are accompanied by thunder.  Somewhere on the horizon of my universe, I see lightning.  The flashes of light and the subsequent crash I tend to interpret as heralds of the coming criticism.  ‚ÄúReal Folders‚Äù will come after me and publicly challenge each of my provisions.  But, fear of lightning - do not walk in the rain. <br><br>  So feel free to go interpret the classics in their own way.  As in any other article, we derive a basic thesis - everything should be simple. <br><br>  Where does any sketch or concept art begin?  With a stain.  With blots forming the future image.  As it was rightly noted in the comments to the previous article, this is the principle of underpainting (although this term, being official anyway, does not please me, when I pronounce it, I see completely different things). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/896/fd4/c80/896fd4c80fce014d7fe87d4b84baba80.jpg"><br>  <i>In this example, I simply put a ‚Äúblot‚Äù with a pen, and began to think in order to turn it.</i>  <i>A very fun exercise that resembles a child's game when a person looks at the clouds and explains to the second person what he thinks the selected cloud looks like.</i> <br><br>  This principle is concluded that the artist, or any other person who loves to draw, moves from the whole to the particular.  The most common mistake of newbies is the drawing of one unnecessarily detailed part of the object, which they then do not know where to fit, and when they fit the object, everything in total looks like a hodgepodge. <br><br>  This happens because the person who draws such a collage does not see the final of his drawing, and by creating a fragment, he begins to tinker with the entities in the style - I thought so.  What can be done here?  To accept the fact that there is a thousand-year experience of mankind, polished by the hands of millions of creative people. <br><br>  As a true renegade, I resisted all the classic, refusing to draw pots and flowers.  And, if I still refuse to accept the latter as part of the training, then the concept ‚Äúfrom simple to more complex‚Äù should have been perceived by me.  If I accepted this reality right away, I would not have lost a few years of my life on a stubborn search for my path.  What is done is done.  Since I‚Äôm a finite person, let's try to make sure that I couldn‚Äôt take you to the depths of a dangerous heresy. <br><br>  The theory of drawing and other classical nonsense will be omitted by focusing on several important things.  The form.  Shine.  Shadow.  Colour.  All four are gods of my world.  They are based on every object that I create.  Sister and brother, bearing the names of Light and Shadows, I emphasize.  My favorites.  Without them, there will be nothing.  Dark.  Darkness.  Mordor  You can deprive the work of color and it will remain her.  You can give work terrifying forms, but they will.  But there can be no work without light and shadow.  Malevich's square?  Sorry, but I will never understand the depths of this object. <br><br>  We start with the form.  You, probably, saw such silhouettes here on a number of concept-art.  It is not just that, and not just because the artist loves silhouettes.  Depriving them of color, light and shadow, he studies the form for the right to life.  Any object in the game or in the film should have a good, and most importantly, an interesting form.  There must be some kind of stuffing in it that will make it memorable, there must be some sort of trick. <br><br>  Now imagine that in the world at the same time with you now work two hundred thousand artists and they do too.  How not to get lost in the background of two hundred thousand works?  Search.  Search form.  Search raisins.  Invent.  Do not be afraid to experiment.  After all, this situation is relevant for all possible industries.  They also have their own specialists, day and night trying to make something of their own. <br>  As a result, a special cheese appears in one of the provinces of Provence, somewhere it is possible to make special truffles, and some respected winemaker finally kicks ass to his opponents by creating a new, not yet repeated sort of wine, mixing it together that has not been considered incompatible before.  Ah ... yes.  Someone else will make Angry Birds with a highlight of other people's flash games, and someone will collect $ 3,336.371 million dollars on Kickstarter, contrary to common sense, and will become a catalyst for the golden era of the golden renaissance in the gaming industry. <br><br>  And it does not matter that 99% of all inventors will remain behind the scenes.  That is the law of life.  This article can also be lost somewhere in the storerooms of Habr, and I, perhaps, will not make the game of my dreams.  What can you say?  Fool himself.  It was better to have to work. <br><br>  Let us return to our ‚Äúblots‚Äù, not to the one that served as the first example, but to the new one.  Suppose we have reached the form that we like.  Next we should indicate the volume of this form.  The volume of this silhouette.  At the expense of our twins.  Light and shadow.  Let's start with the sister, she, come on, prettier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb7/991/c89/fb7991c8975995c363cf277e1fe671f8.jpg"><br><br>  Bam, boo, clap ... there are spots of light on our silhouette, indicating the volume of the object.  How to achieve this?  The first time?  From the first time, little is obtained.  Practice is required.  And the objects of practice, by the way - everything that surrounds you.  A pack of cigarettes, a mug of coffee, your hand, her hand.  Yes, we are all so different, but still we are together - coffee, pizza and cigarettes. <br><br>  It's time, "brother."  We add shadows where they are relevant.  And with the shadow of the work becomes more and more.  The light at this stage, of course, is not good enough.  It is necessary to work everything in several passes.  At first, we kind of carved out the main mass of stone.  Outlined the main accents.  But after all, if we look in the mirror, then on our face, we accidentally find our lips, eye sockets and other objects that become visible due to the fact that the volumes of our face are illuminated with light and form a shadow in turn.  It is vital for us to designate this volume on our cob. <br>  Let us imagine that the light falls from top to bottom as if the sun was at its zenith, or as if someone had lit a light bulb above us.  The light will be brighter than the one that was scattered.  And that's what happens when we finish adding it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fc/51b/c95/3fc51bc9565349ba8d13a678fcd77b65.jpg"><br><br>  Why not add a second source of coverage?  So far, he seemed to be hitting from above, but after all, lanterns, lamps surround us, and the reflection of light from the surface also contributes to the lighting process.  The light reflection of our brother reflexes.  And this is not about the reaction rate, but about the reflected light. <br><br>  Call it a backlight source.  Exactly the same technique is used in every second Hollywood film, where on one side a warm (red or yellow) light source beats, and on the other a cool blue one.  We have a black and white picture, as if to prove that the head of everything is - Light and Shadow.  But nevertheless we can use reception with light. <br><br>  Now ... it's time to make the second pass.  Fix those shoals that we already have, add small parts, add more light and more shadows.  The most delicious moment when you realize that what has already happened is completely fine with you.  I deliberately save all my mistakes so that you can see how often a person is mistaken (if he is like me, not a pro) in the drawing process.  So let's before the start of the second pass quickly fix the silhouette and the places where we frankly did door jambs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b5/c22/269/7b5c222691bf686cd745b9b157386568.jpg"><br><br>  Then color is added.  Color could be added initially, but then the work of light and shadow would not be so revealing.  A person who knows how to interfere with the ingredients at the same time, like a skilled bartender, and you absolutely do not need to drink vodka, washing it down from another container with tomato juice.  A good bartender will give it as it should, in the right proportions and with preservation of the position of the layers of liquids. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87d/569/0cb/87d5690cb231190f50e6b04667a6373c.jpg"><br><br>  After the global color scheme, we can start a local division into materials, additional colors, etc.  Add a gold tie, detail trifle, here and there we tear up the light.  In general ... quite an interesting job.  This stage is the longest.  It can take any amount of time.  At a certain point we say stop to ourselves, because we don‚Äôt want to waste time, what if the character is not approved at the concept stage? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96f/e32/a4c/96fe32a4c75d5ec67eaa2053eaccab73.jpg"><br><br>  Here is our sketch and ready.  We made a sketch.  Now we can give the go-ahead to his life or throw him in the basket of what will never be published and start all over again.  At the initial stages it is necessary to begin often. <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>I deliberately did not load you with the size of the brushes, the settings of the package in which I draw, and the package is not mentioned anywhere.</i>  <i>Because in the introductory article we are primarily concerned with the principle.</i>  <i>Not knowing the chords melody is difficult to pick up, unless of course you do not have a hearing from God.</i>  <i>Continuing this analogy and knowing that a lot of people without hearing are also playing guitars - I can say - you will succeed in drawing too.</i>  <i>The main thing to learn and practice.</i> <br><br><h5>  Himself Gordon </h5><br>  Making concept art, you should not be ashamed of anything.  Even well-known concept art masters use photographs in their works, offhand you can immediately call Greg Malins (Craig Mullins) and Feng Zhu.  In fact, they, of course, more. <br>  The thing is that often concepts need to be prepared quickly.  If you draw them for weeks - it just does not pay off, and nobody will need you like that.  The second reason lies in the very limited life of the concept artist.  And not an artist, either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c9/abc/fd0/9c9abcfd07ed9cb175b3ce2811572af3.jpg"><br><br>  If you don't believe me, study the samples.  This is concept art for Fallout 3 by Greg Malizna.  This is not just a "dad" - this is a digital daddy (and not only it) of painting.  Nevertheless, the network can easily find information about how to create the first art to Fallout 3 <a href="">as well as where the photos were used</a> .  However, this in no way diminishes the value of this art.  Not a whit. <br>  <b>Greg Malinsa website:</b> <a href="http://www.goodbrush.com/">Link</a> <br><br>  The point is not to prove that the artist was able to paint Aivazovsky without resorting to tricks and keeping the pace of work of Aivazovsky himself, who is famous for his phenomenal speed.  The point is to give an adequate result, in adequate time and at the same time to have time to draw ten thousand works more in my life than if everything was painted with my own hands, not using collageing, digital painting, 3D blanks, but at the same time would be done classic in a lively way. <br><br>  I am not against live equipment, on the contrary - only for.  It would be more - it would be better.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But nowadays traveling in the wild and writing living pictures is a high-budget vacation, which either a rich person, a devilishly enthusiastic person who is not afraid of deprivation, or ... a person who draws during his free work can afford. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, if the use of photographic materials, textures, fragments of other images (certainly not falling under the concept of copyright objects, or allowed for modification) speeds up the work - this should be used. If a person does not know how to draw well, but knows how to make good compilations, this should also be used. If a person needs to prepare references to objects or characters for other people - why not make a collage, if you clearly know what you need?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will answer honestly the question ‚Äúwhat about myself?‚Äù In about ten percent of cases, I use photographs for poses because I do not have sufficient knowledge of anatomy, and if the work is important and I am afraid to make a mistake, I get up in the right position myself, take a photo and then look "what and where to stick." In about thirty percent of cases I use 3D blanks to speed up the work process, and in order not to be mistaken with the prospect. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this place I can be suspected of hypocrisy, and this suspicion will be absolutely legitimate. Offering others to use photographs, I myself am stunned by this and tell myself that I cannot afford this for ethical reasons. Well, is it disgusting, eh? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let me give a few words in my defense. Not everyone shares my point of view.</font></font> And this is very good.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone determines how to live and work. Moreover, I believe that none of us have the right to condemn the other for such actions.</font></font><br><br>  Why?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, because if you yourself drew a ball for several weeks, and someone else took this ball from a clip art - it absolutely means nothing. The fact that you painted it for a long time is your problem. The fact that you painted him for a long time is certainly not his problem. It was not his fault that he had sold off this ball for five hundred coins, but you were left with a broken trough. He doesn‚Äôt have to do this for you, and you don‚Äôt have to sit back and whine ‚Äúhere is a son of a bitch, he is now Berezovsky, well, I, an honest ball-maker, are stranded.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, please, our problems, first of all our problems, and only we are guilty of the fact that something is not working out. Do not hang your "merit" neither on God nor on any of the living.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general ... let's leave Berezovsky and the Unspeakable alone, let's not focus on me - let's move on to a practical example. We set ourselves a task at two o'clock to make a poster for Half-life 3 using all possible methods, including photographs. Put? Now you can look for a bearded man with glasses to use as a reference. I understandably cheated already at the stage of task generation for myself. This bearded man is myself.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We take a camera, iPhone or any other device that can capture you and take a photo (either we find it on the network, or we photograph a friend, or an enemy). Something like that. The photo is not given because I need to advertise and dream to get in the program ‚ÄúMarry it immediately.‚Äù You just have to see and understand two things - the photo can be of the most disgusting quality, you have nothing to be ashamed of your own foolishness, if you do not roll it now, then it may happen that your children or grandchildren will roll it - and you will enviously groan in rocking chair lamenting about missed opportunities.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I could take a full-length photo and build a composition, but ... in this case there would be much more work. And when a wife comes into my office and sees that I am drawing myself ... the right word, she begins to doubt my ability to act. We will try to complete this example as soon as possible. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So ... the challenge. This morning they called you from Valve and said that you were selected for the artists tournament. The task of the tournament is to build a poster for the Half-Life 3 advertising campaign at two o'clock. If you win, you get ... you can stop reading. The competition is fictional and there will be no prizes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We act quickly. Make a photo.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b49/bba/8c2/b49bba8c251602b259ff3cbab40442c6.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We process the photo with filters so that it looks more drawn. And we begin to turn it into a ‚Äúpanache‚Äù. We add small parts, we hypertrophy those that are and also, we add threatening red color on the right. Reception, as in the previous case (see the concept of monk) Hollywood, but in color. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1d/45c/bd2/b1d45cbd248b03387d99c4fbf040c733.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next is added blue light. The hair is processed and the operation of toning is performed. All the sharp transitions of light and shadows are replaced by smoother ones. Likewise, photoshoots of film and television stars are processed in Photoshop so that there are no signs of riotous life on their faces. Finally, we enhance the cold and warm colors, and add a sketch of the spacesuit so that the head finally stops hanging in the air. And we give Gordon finally his crowbar.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c42/8fa/6b1/c428fa6b1be8efa09411bf06b61b269e.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We add the atmosphere due to the cubes of dust left and right. "Atmosphere" is applied in the color that is closest to the virtual light sources. On the left, the dust is highlighted in blue, on the right, yellow. Gordon without lambda is not Gordon.</font></font> Little advice.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Text and logos always ennoble any mediocre picture if you pick the right colors and place them in the right places, just as well, even medium-sized armor with engraved patterns looks orders richer than if they were not. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After completion of the work is usually made fitting the contrast. Experienced artists immediately draw in the desired light range. But people like me put up a contrast after. </font></font><br><br> <i><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Necessary digression:</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I must confess to you that the doctors recognized me as color blind. Therefore, if I say blue, most often it turns out that it is purple. "My" brown is rumored to have a soft green tint. "According to rumors" because I have no opportunity to verify this.</font></font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9c/06c/2ce/e9c06c2ceb979cd8eac5e24f3b890134.gif"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To show the process of converting photos into art I made an integrated GIF example with recorded stages. And yes, I almost forgot. Like all I make mistakes. Perhaps even more often than all. My wife once again passed by asked what kind of stick "I have" in my hands. I retorted indignantly that only a blind can not recognize the mount. However, the worm of doubt was seeded. Immediately googling, I vysnil that my crowbar is not the same as the crowbar in the rest of the world. Need to redo it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, I told you that in the head and on the canvas everything is different. This is a good example. As if specially got into this work. I imagined the nail catcher like this, and until I was poked at my ‚Äúlies‚Äù, I did not notice. And noticing - was terrified. This stub of steel can be found only if it is signed "Freeman's squeeze."</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/169/e43/8d5/169e438d5136a4df366580c5fca2344e.jpg"><br><br>  That's all.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This method, unfortunately (like the previous one), is not suitable for people who cannot draw. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, for them, who do not know how, and if they have not yet fallen asleep, there is a third way.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the footsteps of Cameron </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, I was talking about James Cameron? His turn came. This morning I saw another toy broken by my child. Another of his many tractors. It was impossible to fix it, and I threw it on the table near the system unit. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want to retreat a little to the side of the microphone, and tell you that almost all of my strength and resources are left to create my own game. Unlike previous games that I did (or participated in), this would not be casual, social, or online, I was so fed up with trying to please all types of gamers that I forgot about what I needed first of all - just to make games, investing in them what you yourself want to invest, and not what others are saying to you.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So now I draw a lot of concepts in order to understand and see the world I am building, and which will then cease to be a concept, turning into reality. Objects of this world seem to me everywhere. I am constantly looking for any details that I could distort and transfer to my ... fictional world. One of these elements became airships. After this retreat, you can go back. To the broken tractor.</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> I got a pencil case from my glasses, and my hands reached out for him and fitted the cabin from the tractor on top. Then everything went like clockwork. Taking another part of the tractor and fitting it back, I imagined that there could be a crane arm, and adding a piece of children's toy to the nose of an imaginary zeppelin, I got an air intake.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5e/6b6/7ec/a5e6b67ec4b0996a1a7a13ebf7c8ffe1.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you have a good imagination, then the cork will become an air intake. But if the imagination is less developed, then pieces of prefabricated models that are sold in toy stores will be very helpful. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this example, I still draw the outline, although I could collect the concept of the model from the pencil case. But firstly, I am damn sorry for the pencil case (this is a gift that I am not ready to put on the altar of graphomania), secondly it will take a lot of time. I bow to those people who for a month or two are able to assemble a model of an ancient frigate using not only purchased parts fragments, but also developing their own fragments, introducing their own know-how.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/27e/13e/b80/27e13eb80f1a579a464ef661ed69efcb.gif"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This time I will not burden your tired mind with the details of what I am doing and just present this canvas to the world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With stages from the very beginning to the very end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The beginning was a pencil case with a piece of toy - the final - a piece of the world that I am building, a small loading ship hovering.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Chapter III - In which we sum up </font></font></h4><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> About what was not said </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This review article, as I said, is very superficial. Unfortunately, and perhaps fortunately, it did not occur to me at this stage to create several tutorials, and I confined myself to general provisions and very general examples. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I have already said, it is absolutely useless if readers open the article, twist the wheels of mice with a sigh, rolling their eyes to the sky in anguish, and gradually fall asleep, trying to master the unfriendly material. It can even be said, in the context of this article, that this was the concept art of future articles. If it seemed interesting to you, the topic can be continued and developed. Just as a warhead is divided, carrying in its body several small missiles, which are then beaten each at its target.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among other things, I would like to indicate in the form of a short list a number of things that I have not mentioned, and which may be important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just as the points in the sentence are important.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Points </font></font></h5><br>  <b>Concept art doesn‚Äôt have to be fast</b> , and the artist doesn‚Äôt necessarily spend an hour to two hours on it.  The concept can also be considered as a concept or a concept of future achievements.  If someone is given the task of making a concept of a general plan in a movie, then the artist will devote him sufficient time, sometimes substantially exceeding the working day. <br><br>  <b>Fine art is a fundamental topic that cannot be addressed in a similar article</b> , so all the definitions of such things as lines in space, perspective, strokes and other entities that make up fine art are words of Semen Altov "thrown out of England."  I am not a teacher, and you are not students in class, I am sure that we can be satisfied with the informative and entertaining program. <br><br>  <b>Art itself is a very voluminous topic</b> , and the boundaries of such concepts as concept art, production art, art, sketch are very blurred.  The authors themselves clearly know where and to which category they belong, but the marketing department often has a different opinion about it.  For example, on a large number of Internet resources you can see beautiful pictures that are issued by these sites for concept art, however, in fact, they are produced-art and perform its functions.  There may be situations on the back.  Incorrect interpretation of art type definitions is possible. <br><br>  <b>The author of the article did not graduate from universities</b> , did not attend courses, and was not familiar with classical art schools, classical techniques and drawing techniques.  He is self-taught, who tried to reach the handle in her own way.  In this regard, the author can not be considered the truth of last resort.  I think that also can not be considered true at all. <br><br>  <b>The article reflects the subjective opinion of the author</b> , multiplied by the personal experiences of the author due to familiarity with the gaming industry. <br><br>  <b>The usefulness of this article is defined by habrchanami independently</b> , the author does not claim the title of Prometheus or Columbus.  I will not give you my liver for it and will not agree to discover America. <br><br>  <b>To understand what the abyss is hidden under the term art, the author recommends that</b> you visit the largest online resources dedicated to artists.  You can find there articles much better than this, interviews with prominent representatives of the industry, and just relax, looking at a great many wonderful works. <br>  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">www.deviantart.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cghub.com/">www.cghub.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.render.ru/">www.render.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/">www.conceptart.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/">forums.cgsociety.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://conceptships.blogspot.ru/">conceptships.blogspot.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Any concrete MMM is not mentioned</b> - because Habr is not a place for personal fights. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  One more thing.  At the end of letters, texts and other scribbles in the west it is customary to write - Thanks for your time.  I don‚Äôt like many Americanisms, but many things cause a rare affection.  You have spent your time reading this article, giving me your most precious resource - time.  And I thank you for it. <br><br>  Thank you for your time. <br><br>  Have a good New Year, excellent table, comfortable chair and no sick goals in the morning.  Transfer Bukhabr calmly, with dignity and without loss. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164451/</a></p>
