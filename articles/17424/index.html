  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the use of social networks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last Forbes read an entertaining article.  Somebody Daniel Lyons from the American edition of the magazine writes: “Facebook ... does not solve any of my real problems ... I can’t get rid of the feeling that I was lured into some kind of carnival tent and forced to perform tricks ... and all this in order to enrich Facebook sellers of unnecessary goods and founding fathers. ” <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And really, what is the real benefit of prolific social networks for their members?  How do we benefit from the communities in which we are registered?  And is it worth the time spent on networks? <br><br>  Take me, for example.  I am an active participant in three communities: Odnoklassniki.ru (succumbed to the herd instinct), Habrahabr.ru (I’m really interested in this) and Imhonet.ru (it would be strange not to enter the community in whose construction I participate). <br><br>  Odnoklassniki.ru: despite the wave of skepticism (in which I myself partly participated - see the article <a href="http://imhosubb.habrahabr.ru/blog/31503.html">“Wraps and the Internet”</a> ), the service is certainly interesting.  Thanks to him, I found several of my classmates with whom I had not spoken for about fifteen years.  Exchanged a few phrases in ICQ ... and that's it!  It was not possible to meet with any one: everyone has business.  But at the same time, my “friends” were filled with a lot of people who had a distant relationship to my school.  Those who are in my ignore and anti-spam filters.  Those whom I would not like to see at all.  But here their conscience did not allow their friendship to reject me - after all, they will immediately see it (“thanks” to the creators of classmates).  As a result, my account turned into a trash bin, which I enter only once a week.  In the end, I received information that one of my former classmate had recently given birth, and another married an oligarch.  I do not know how much this will be useful to me in life, because I saw both of them last time in the last century.  I don’t see any monetization of benefits in Odnoklassniki.

      Habrahabr.ru is a combination of the pleasant and the useful: it helps in work and broadens the mind.  Such concepts as “social network”, “WEB 2.0” and “tag cloud” I came to know here.  Communication is different: it’s one thing to say “about the weather and nature,” and another about pressing issues that help you do something useful and make money from it.  I don’t dare to monetize the benefits that Habr brought me, but intuition tells me that it does exist.  If this were not so, then thousands of smart people would not waste time here. <br><br>  Imhonet.ru is a social service that we are just starting to build.  And in scale, he still loses much to the first two.  However, it’s easiest for me to monetize the benefits.  Thanks to the cinema advisory service, I avoided visiting three films, whose predicted scores were below average for me (these are “Hitman”, “1612” and, in my opinion, “The Servant of the Sovereign”).  And, as it turned out, I did the right thing - my friends (real, live, not networked) who saw these films, in a single opinion sent them to crap.  However, having believed the recommendations, I looked with the child “Bee Movie”, “Enchanted”, and my wife and I went to the “Testament”.  And not once in three cases did I regret it.  Thus, over a month and a half, I saved 600 rubles, 6 hours and a lot of emotions that were not wasted on Hollywood junk.  What is not monetization benefits? <br><br>  Perhaps I exaggerate Imhonet’s merit, for I’m a somewhat interested person.  Therefore I ask Habra-people to express: what is the real benefit of social networks in which you participate?  And please, more conretics.  I was tired of hearing about “expanding the boundaries of communication” and “friends cannot be measured with money”.  We can do without demagogy: is there a benefit and how is it measured?  (Preferably in hard currency). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17424/</a></p>
