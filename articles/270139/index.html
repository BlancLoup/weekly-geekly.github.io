      When looking with my glass eyes on this link ‚ÄúEARN‚Äù, the mere thought that in the internet you can not only spend, but also earn (!) Shook me.  And I, frantically turning over the buttons on my old greasy keyboard with my bony, dried fingers, searched for where I could make money. <br><br>  I wanted to find a place on the Internet where money is simply given out.  To pick them up and put in a WMR / WMZ-purse, following the expanded pupils for the daily growth of the cherished numbers.  To store them, save them, wither over them. <br><br>  But all the sites described in the webmoney client turned out to be earnings like "viewing the site on a timer with captcha at the end."  And these timers were so tedious, debts, with such kopecks at the exit - that I did not want to suffer so much.  I wanted to press a simple button and get money! <br><br>  But there was another source of money, then it only developed - ‚Äúwebmoney bonuses‚Äù.  Owners of some sites make a field like ‚ÄúEnter the WMR wallet number‚Äù somewhere in the corner of the site, next to the ‚ÄúEnter this captcha‚Äù field and the ‚ÄúPick up bonus‚Äù button.  Then, at the dawn of bonuses, some sites did not even have a captcha.  The people went to such a site, increased the attendance of this site, received their legitimate bonus, at the same time read the information on the site. <br><br>  And the thought was born to me - as if to collect these bonuses culturally and accurately, having made that treasured button, on pressing which money will come. <br><br>  It was about the third year of the institute, 2004 (-5) year <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Past</b> </h3><br>  With small greedy rotating eyes, I read the HTML-code of the pages, wiping sweat from my forehead with my sleeve, trying to understand how to get bonuses without all this burden.  I saw and understood with my little school brain recently that when sending, the contents of the fields are passed as parameters somewhere in the script.  And for the first time I was jerked to make a program that would have a table of such sites, and that it would automatically go through them all, send the parameters, collect bonuses. <br><br>  And now I‚Äôm sitting behind the monitor, collecting a superprogram, without knowing the correct spelling of the word ‚Äúofficial‚Äù in Russian, simultaneously using any TBitBtn in the interface with dollar-denominated badges, but it didn‚Äôt matter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbf/fbc/c63/fbffbcc63d2a178e405dbb5cd366d2b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The template% WMID and% WMR are replaced with the identifier and wallet numbers and sent to the site via TWebBrowser in the right part of the window.  In response, the result is visible in the browser, and money comes in the Webmoney client!  It was a triumph, I pressed the buttons, collected money.  You could do it at least every day. <br><br><h3>  <b>The present</b> </h3><br>  Years passed, and I found out that the sites are closed from time to time, the distribution of bonuses is stopped or resumed.  Yes, and training at the institute all the more demanding and time consuming.  And then also work, and graduate school, and protection, and again work ... <br><br>  And in 2015, I was drawn again.  The situation was such that the captcha was included everywhere.  It seems that it was not too easy to farm bonuses from different IP to different WMIDs and different wallets.  A new program for collecting bonuses had to be done not on the transfer of ready-made parameters to scripts, but on a simple viewing of sites with bonuses in the browser.  Almost everything is done by the user, and almost everything for this is made easier by the program. <br><br>  The program turned out this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e28/f65/d33/e28f65d3303667b99096efa1e7eb3d39.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I prolazil many sites with bonuses, with links to bonuses, with links to sites with links to bonuses.  I collected a table of sites.  I wrote off the minimum and maximum bonus amount (for those bonuses that are issued randomly within certain limits) and the bonus currency (on some sites the currency is different every day, then rubles, then Belarusian rubles, then hryvnia, such currency is designated in the program as ‚ÄúWM ? "). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fae/d83/927/faed839274ab000618ca774fb51ad71e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I already learned when developing the Bro browser for PaintCAD ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/202606/">geektimes.ru/post/202606</a> ) that <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/202606/">TWebBrowser</a> ‚Äôs built-in browser plow with wild restrictions (Windows cares about user security).  Therefore, some sites, those that are simpler, can be used in the TWebBrowser hole in the middle of the form.  But some others, at all jQuery, swear, do not want to work and give bonuses - then they have to run in a separate window.  This can be done both through the usual IE, and through the "default browser" button "Open in your browser." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb2/0b6/6af/cb20b66aff2a77254bf0b8eaf56317a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Because  Auto-guessing captcha for a bonus is a tricky business, then I left this task to the user. <br><br>  But in order to simplify the receipt of the bonus - I decided to roll the bonus field directly to the user.  To do this, I only needed to set the X and Y locations of the bonus field for each site in the table and after the site loads (after a certain time on the timer), the bonus fields roll out directly to the middle of the browser hole.  And you can, without seeing other elements of the site, without confusing, enter the number of wallets, captcha and get bonus money.  If the site is loaded for a long time, the transition timer to the bonus field may not work, and then you have to manually click the "To bonus field" button. <br><br>  Some sites with bonuses set the conditions "Look at the three pages on the site, lingering on them for at least 15 seconds."  For these sites, the buttons ‚ÄúTo the very top‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo the bottom‚Äù were made (in order to pull the link three times above from another page of the site) and the timer, which counts the hapless 15 seconds and the call number (1, 2, 3). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fae/d7c/b27/faed7cb27b6302e3363d50aacedaa50e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To make wallets easier to enter - you can simply copy them from the ready-made fields (by analogy with the above screenshot of the old program).  And the fields with the numbers of purses should be saved once in the settings of the program at the first launch.  At the same time, from the second launch, the fields are blocked (in order not to change accidentally) and they can only be unlocked by the ‚ÄúUnlock fields to change details‚Äù checkbox. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15f/9f7/ae3/15f9f7ae30599fafb12968778c233976.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Because  sites die and come to life, give out and do not issue bonuses - it would be good for a table of sites to enter a rating system, marking suspicious sites (in yellow) and those that have stopped issuing in general (in red).  And it was done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/d90/439/0e9d904395363264aaa69ad8a9df7224.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To go from the bonus site to the next one, the ‚ÄúNext Bonus‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrevious Bonus‚Äù buttons were introduced.  At the same time, sites marked in red are automatically skipped.  Thus, the user forms his list of sites for which he enters and feeds bonuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/90d/b2d/0e990db2df970637a50ce3862d097d43.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And of course, having a table of sites with bonuses, I wanted to calculate what is the profit for one daily pass.  Statistics on the database is displayed on the tab "Settings and Updates." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/163/df8/438/163df843859f3f7fe3b4e8e4f9784d25.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Total in the base 51 sites with bonuses, 29 sites open in the internal browser (and roll directly to the output field, it remains to enter the wallet and captcha and get the bonus), and 22 sites with complex scripts open in the external window. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the missing 7 sites in the database</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The 7 missing sites are from the category ‚Äúchoose any 3 sites per day‚Äù, so these seven are turned off by default, and the other three from the same category are turned on and will not be skipped when iterating through the entire table.  For more details, see the Additional Conditions column in the table opposite the sites that were skipped (marked in red) by default. <br></div></div><br><br>  And depending on luck, the user can now earn up to 3-5 rubles every day.  Of course, this is not 30 or 300 rubles (or 3,000, well, or 30,000).  But it is a steady income.  For a month, some kind of poor young man, without a stable income, from a distant province, with internet paid by his parents, can raise 100 rubles for a phone or buy some things in an online game.  And all that is needed is only 15 minutes a day to run through all the sites in the table, insert a wallet from the buffer, enter a captcha. <br><br>  Many sites update bonuses at midnight according to their local time, so the best time to harvest bonuses is somewhere from 00:00 to 4:00.  There all the sites are still fresh and the bonuses for them have not yet ended.  And in the afternoon, half the bonuses on the most popular sites are eaten up by the local public of the bonus collectors and it remains to eat the crumbs after them on other, less popular sites. <br><br>  If everything goes well and the user comes in at night, the process goes something like this (and even faster in time, because it was debugged with fixing the coordinates of the bonus fields on the sites, deleting non-working sites from the database, etc.): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/5eb/a9d/cab5eba9daaa8001ed9ff35222ce33f0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>FAQ:</b> <a href="http://blackstrip.ru/hwmfaq.htm">blackstrip.ru/hwmfaq.htm</a> <br><br>  <b>Version history:</b> <a href="http://blackstrip.ru/history.htm">blackstrip.ru/history.htm</a> <br><br>  <b>The program itself:</b> <a href="">blackstrip.ru/hyperwm.zip</a> <br><br>  Now you can farm 100 rubles a month out of thin air! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270139/</a></p>
