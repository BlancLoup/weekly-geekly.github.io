In practice, the following manufacturers "implemented" this (at least somehow documented): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.acer.ru/acer/service.do%3FLanguageISOCtxParam%3Dru%26miu10einu24.current.attN2B2F2EEF%3D3848%26sp%3Dpage15e%26ctx2.c2att1%3D21%26miu10ekcond13.attN2B2F2EEF%3D3848%26CountryISOCtxParam%3DRU%26ctx1.att21k%3D1%26CRC%3D1984885342">Acer</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://support.asus.com/service/service.aspx%3Fno%3D575%26SLanguage%3Dru-ru">Asus</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com/europe/microsoft/ru/os_return_policy.html">Lenovo</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/support/compensation/CompensationforWindowsOS.html">Samsung</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.sony.ru/article/id/1237476049588">Sony</a> </li></ul><br>  If someone forgot - correct with a link.  The rest makes sense, perhaps, to write to the support service individually.  Require. <br><br>  And now, I will share on the example of my own experience how things are in reality. <a name="habracut"></a>  So, I decided to purchase an Acer laptop.  Carefully read the <a href="http://www.acer.ru/acer/service.do%3FLanguageISOCtxParam%3Dru%26miu10einu24.current.attN2B2F2EEF%3D3848%26sp%3Dpage15e%26ctx2.c2att1%3D21%26miu10ekcond13.attN2B2F2EEF%3D3848%26CountryISOCtxParam%3DRU%26ctx1.att21k%3D1%26CRC%3D1984885342">terms and conditions of</a> return on the official website.  What do we offer?  You can use the return program only if: <br><ul><li>  less than 30 days have passed from the date of purchase; </li><li>  you did not touch the pre-installed Windows; </li><li>  did not accept the license agreement that occurs after the download. </li></ul><br>  This is basic, and in practice it means, in fact, that if you decided to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the OS, then you have to do it right after the purchase, otherwise you will not be able to fully use the laptop and not violate the conditions. <br><br>  Well, right away, right away.  How can I do that?  To do this, contact: <br><ul><li>  to an authorized partner at the place of purchase; </li><li>  to an authorized service center. </li></ul><br>  Well, at first glance, not bad, I thought.  At the place of acquisition and refuse.  Began to call stores with acceptable offers, which are also authorized partners of Acer.  And here came the first disappointment.  It turned out that in reality no one is involved in this (participation in the OS return program).  Please note, there below, at the end of the text in small print it is indicated, I quote: " <i>for Acer authorized retail partners, this Program is <b>voluntary</b></i> ."  In other words, the first option (at the place of purchase) can be discarded immediately, it is so, formally.  Need to contact the service center, great.

      Service Acer laptop in Moscow is engaged exclusively in the company R-Style.  I call them interested.  I naively thought that I would bring a laptop, delete the Windows with me, remove the stickers, for everything for a maximum of 15 minutes.  The girl on the phone told that the laptop is given "for repair" by the standard procedure, and usually comes back after 3 days, depending on the current workload of the master.  O-ba-na, I still can not use the laptop after the purchase for three days.  He is taken away from me just like that!  And during this time it can be scraped, scratched or dropped. <br><br>  Well, I sighed, and put up with it.  I recorded on the USB disk an image of the fresh Sabayon Linux with KDE in the kit, as well as a number of pictures and video for tests.  I went to the store, gave me a laptop to check, didn‚Äôt even download Windows, immediately plugged in my disk and booted it in, checked everything I could, paid for it, went to the nearest R-Style service center.  Moscow, the day, the heat is terrible.  And here is the next disappointment.  In the service center queue aka ‚Äúwho is the last?  ask there at the end of the hall ... ‚Äù, a small stuffy room, a lot of people, and no air conditioners.  The queue is all the same, and a couple of sluggish guys, without haste, melancholically accept broken equipment or give out repaired, studying each device in detail for scratches and other things.  For two and a half hours that I sat there all wet, obmateril to myself everything and everyone, and resolutely ceased to feel like a man with a new beech.  As a result, the turn came to me, another 20 minutes of clearance, a sore head, an employee of the SC, when filling out papers, confused one digit in my phone number and confused the laptop model, which accepts "for repairs".  I already found this on the way home, when I got more or less okle, in the same place I just checked the correctness of the serial number and my full names. <br><br>  So what at the moment.  Instead of a new laptop on the hands of a piece of paper, killed the whole day.  When will the laptop be unknown for sure (hope for the next 3 days), whether it will be the same new, clean, serviceable (hope that yes).  And yes, the whole minus 810rub of the cost of beech.  It seems to me that this situation is not only with Acer. <br><br>  And what the hell?  Why should I just sponsor small software, and if I don‚Äôt want to sponsor them, do I have to voluntarily trade with SC? <br><br>  And then the joyful marketers in their reports will say that they say that the program for the return of the pre-installed OS has been entered, the result is none, few have used it.  Yes, indeed, few people want additional adventures on their own.  Few people know that the OS in the kit can be waived.  Few people know about the existence of other operating systems at all.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">The system</a> works, hamsters havat.  Fuck. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linuxnotforall/98936/">This is how it should be</a> .
