First of all, a significant increase in attendance and an increase in citation by serious online publications.  By experience, if your news gets into the TOP - it can give an increase in attendance by several orders of magnitude.  Even if your site is not news, but the site news covers the target audience of the users of your services - the benefits of this are certain.

      Publishing news on your own website shows potential consumers the seriousness of your attitude to their work, provides additional convenience to visitors, and gives a significant increase in search results. <br><br><h5>  How to become a partner of Yandex. News </h5><br>  <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/">Yandex.News</a> is the first in Russia service of automatic processing and systematization of news, according to official data, attendance is 1-5 million per day, and a significant portion of visitors are purposefully looking for news of a certain subject. <br><br>  The site displays headlines and news annotations (full texts of the news are involved in the search), links to the full text of the news lead to Yandex.News partner sites. <br><br><h6>  Registration procedure in the Yandex.News system </h6><br>  1. Read the <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/cooperation.html">Media Information.</a> <br>  2. Prepare at least 10 news items.  Please note that Yandex.News is very sensitive to the following points: <br><ul><li>  news should not contain advertising of your site and the goods and services you provide; </li><li>  news must be unique, no copy-paste, it may be translated materials; </li><li>  If your site already has an RSS feed, for example, internal site news, select a separate channel for Yandex.News that does not contain this information; </li><li>  It is recommended to publish news at least two or three times a week; </li><li>  news headline should be attractive, for example, instead of ‚ÄúDjango 1.2‚Äù, it‚Äôs better to write ‚ÄúNew features of Django 1.2 are announced‚Äù; </li><li>  exclude from the channel news, older than 8 days, they can not be processed by their robot; </li><li>  the &lt;yandex: full-text&gt; tag should contain the full text of the message; </li><li>  It is necessary to remove information from the message that does not relate directly to the topic of the news, for example, signatures, ‚Äúmore‚Äù, ‚Äúaccording to materials‚Äù, etc .; </li><li>  The source of the message can be specified in the context of the message, for example: ‚ÄúAccording to the official website (link), a new release of Django 1.2 RC1 has been published.‚Äù; </li><li>  information should be purely news, announcements of upcoming events, press releases, as well as news posted by users of the site are not allowed to be published. </li></ul><br>  3. If the channel is prepared, write to info@news.yandex.ru in free form, be sure to specify the contact person and his position, the name of your publication, which topic your channel is dedicated to, and also provide your Yandex account login (you can use an existing box) . <br><br>  If everything went well and there are no questions from the employees of Yandex.News, you will get access to <a href="http://partner.news.yandex.ru/">partner.news.yandex.ru</a> - the partner interface within 1-2 days, and your news will automatically be retrieved from the RSS feed. <br><br>  The partner interface contains conversion statistics, a form for your publication, a duplicate search service, and legal documents (Information Cooperation Agreement).  Please note that the documents to sign and send by mail is a must. <br><br>  Using the duplicate search service, you can always check who reaped the benefits of your work on their sites. <br><br>  If there are problems with the technical side or you are politely refused, eliminate the comments and contact again.  Attentive employees work in Yandex (and this applies not only to this service) - and if you have fulfilled all the requirements - your RSS feed will appear with the name <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/smi/%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">news.yandex.ru/smi/ channel_name</a> <br><br><h5>  How to become a partner Rambler </h5><br>  Even easier.  The format of the News is the same.  Detailed requirements for news sources are published at: <a href="http://help.rambler.ru/article.html%3Fs%3Dnews%26id%3D47549">help.rambler.ru/article.html?s=news&amp;id=47549</a> <br>  Rambler does not provide any additional services for the media.  It is enough to leave a request with the indication of the channel‚Äôs address and the name of the publication via feedback: <br>  <a href="http://help.rambler.ru/feedback.html%3Fs%3Dnews">help.rambler.ru/feedback.html?s=news</a> <br>  And the next day you will receive a message from Rambler: ‚ÄúYour site has been successfully added to the database of news sources.‚Äù <br><br>  Unlike Yandex.News, Rambler does not provide a separate page for each media, duplicate news is acceptable. <br><br><h5>  Google.News </h5><br>  Requirements for the content of news on Google are similar to the requirements of Yandex. News.  Google currently <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D40394">does not work with RSS and Atom</a> and performs site scans. <br><br>  Detailed instructions for Google media: <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/%3Fhl%3Dru">www.google.com/support/news_pub/?hl=en</a> <br><br>  Unfortunately, our experience turned out to be negative, maybe it will help you.  A small quote from the correspondence: <br><pre>  Google&gt; We‚Äôve looked at your site, but we‚Äôre currently unable to add it to Google News.  Currently, we only include sites that contain articles about recent events.  This means that we do not include informational articles, instructions for use and tips for readers.
 KOMTET&gt; The news channel does not contain informational articles, instructions for use and tips for readers; only unique news about the latest developments in the development of CMS, virtualization tools, programming languages, DBMS, etc. is published.  (examples of publications)
 Google&gt; We are currently unable to provide specific information, we will note your site for consideration in the future.
</pre><br><br>  Please note that you need to carefully consider your appeal to Google, you should show that you publish only original materials, indicate the target audience of this information, you can give examples of publications and be sure to link to the news section of the site (not RSS).  It is recommended to prepare in advance the articles on the site: <br><ul><li>  About edition </li><li>  About the authors </li></ul><br>  If your experience with Google has been more successful, share it in the comments. <br><br>  The application is sent via the form on the website: <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dsuggest_content%26hl%3Dru">www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/request.py?contact_type=suggest_content&amp;hl=en</a> <br><br><h5>  News.LiveInternet </h5><br>  LiveInternet is more familiar as an excellent statistics collection service, however there is <a href="http://news.liveinternet.ru/">News</a> . LiveInternet.  At the time of writing the article LI. News contain 905 sources. <br><br>  To add your channel, you must <a href="http://news.liveinternet.ru/%3Fsources">register</a> by entering your email address. <br>  You will receive a login and password for access to the section for partners: <a href="http://news.liveinternet.ru/partner/">news.liveinternet.ru/partner</a> <br>  The section provides the ability to add RSS feeds, view conversion statistics and get the code to place on your LI.News site. <br>  If you have prepared channels for Rambler or Yandex.News, they are perfect for LiveInternet. <br>  The main requirement - the publication of full-text news edited news publication.  That is, if your site is not a news resource - your application will be rejected. <br>  But!  From the second attempt (the first was made last year) we received a short one: ‚ÄúApproved the tape‚Äù: <a href="http://news.liveinternet.ru/%3Fsources">news.liveinternet.ru/?sources</a> <br>  It frankly surprised me, because there really is only the media, only now 905 media + 1 company. <br><br>  The possibility of broadcasting your news is also provided by specialized sites, for example, if your activity is directly related to CMS - write to <a href="http://www.cmsmagazine.ru/">CMS Magazine</a> , you will be allowed to.  Perhaps other "friendly" sites themselves will take your RSS feeds for publication. <br><br>  It is recommended to create several news channels on the site, dividing them, for example, by tags, for example: CMS, Django, Zope, PHP, Plone, etc.  In this case, your channels will be able to use various specialized sites. <br><br>  If you have your own experience of integrating your materials into well-known news sites I will be happy to add material and thank you all for helping me write this article! <br><br>  UPD: Adding to the site <a href="http://www.novoteka.ru/">Novoteka</a> is easy: you need to send a free-form letter to info@novoteka.ru.  RSS feed for Yandex.News is fine.  The rules for writing a letter are approximately as described above. <br>  Here is the result: <a href="http://www.novoteka.ru/sid%3F100413">http://www.novoteka.ru/sid?100413</a> .  A positive response was received two days after treatment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92843/</a></p>
