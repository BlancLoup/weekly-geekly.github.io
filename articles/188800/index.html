  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile application developers - the key to success for Russian business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is not a secret for anybody that for 6 years since the entry into force of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúOn the development of small and medium-sized businesses in the Russian Federation‚Äù, the business community has made a huge leap forward, and made a kind of revolution in the direction of start-ups.  And above all, this concerns the IT market segment, which has long remained a mystery both for the Russian consumer and for company executives.  Today we can see the opposite picture; young Russian entrepreneurs have not only mastered the market of IT technologies and mobile applications, but are also able to compete with foreign companies.  The popularity of mobile applications as a tool for business promotion and as a base for startups demonstrates the interest of large investors in these projects, as well as the growing number of specialized conferences and forums of mobile application developers.  We offer the reader of the Habrahabr portal the digest of the brightest and most successful events in Russia over the past year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>FIRST SAINT-PETERSBURG PRACTICAL CONFERENCE AND TOP MOBILE 2012 MOBILE SOLUTIONS FESTIVAL</b> <br>  St. Petersburg, DECEMBER 18, 2012 <br><br>  Industry experts discussed the latest trends in the field of mobile technologies and provided examples of successful techniques for implementing mobile strategies.  At the same time, the most debatable were the issue of mobilization and the concept of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), which is inextricably linked with it.  In addition, advanced achievements of companies providing mobile services were demonstrated and prizes from participating companies were raffled off.
