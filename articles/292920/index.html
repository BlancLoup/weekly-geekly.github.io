Let's get a look. <br></blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Viewability</b> is a metric in online advertising that is designed to track only those impressions that were actually <b>seen by the user</b> .  For example, an advertisement placed at the bottom of the page, the user who did not flush the page down enough to notice the advertisement, simply does not see it.  This ad has no viewability.  Viewability is designed to ensure that advertisers are confident that they will pay only for the advertisement that the user sees.  This is true because 54% of ads are not viewed by users. <br><br>  This problem is missing in the <b>mobile</b> - the advertiser's banner will not go unnoticed by the user.  Growth in the cost of companies for mobile advertising and an increase in the volume of this market only confirm its effectiveness.

      According to IAB, marketers are concerned that they pay for impressions in the desktop that no one ever watches.  In general, the industry aims to move from providing impressions to providing views that will compensate for the budgets spent on empty.  Some ad networks have already begun to offer this service, such as Google, Undertone and others.  It will cost a little more, but the cost will be about equal. <br><br>  At the moment, it is difficult to switch to viewability, since there is no universal mechanism for tracking the viewability of the show.  The IAB defines a ‚Äúwatchable view‚Äù as a show that was <b>viewed at least 50%</b> , at least for one second.  But providers of ‚Äúviewable‚Äù solutions use different methods to make their ads fall under these criteria.  In general, the Media Ratings Council advises not to go over to the ‚Äúviewability‚Äù metric, since its contradictions are not yet fully understood and understood. <br><br>  It is difficult to predict what impact the market will have in favor of viewing.  In theory, advertisers interested in performance will be placed more, because now they will only pay for impressions viewed by real people.  As a result, the price for such placements will increase, as was stated above. <br><br>  Site owners are seriously worried about the transition to viewability, and the blow that their incomes will incur because there will not be so many impressions for sale.  You will have to double the cost per placement to cover the lack of viewable impressions.  As for the design, then most likely the site owners will simply have to place ads higher on the page, so that there is a one hundred percent probability of viewing. <br><br>  No one knows for sure what effect the arrival of ‚Äúviewability‚Äù will have on the market.  But it certainly promises changes in the methods of selling media online advertising. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292920/</a></p>
