In the shops you can see a variety of systems of this kind: large and small, expensive and not very creative and simple.  Not so long ago, there was one project that I wanted to tell about separately.  This is a lamp Heng Balance Lamp, which looks nothing, and works well. <br><br>  But the main thing - this lamp is equipped with an unusual switch.  In order to turn on the lamp, it is necessary to connect two elements of the switch, made in the form of wooden balls.  As soon as these balls are next to each other, they hang in the air, and the lamp lights up.  If you want to turn off the light, you just need to dissolve the balls, and all - the lamp goes out.  Actually, there are no technological wonders here, the whole project is tied up with magnets and stylish appearance of lamps.  But the project is interesting to many, as evidenced by the excess of the amount of the collection by two orders of magnitude. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/945/29b/82b/94529b82b4674b3d90c084d3818ea61a.jpg" width="800">

      Inside the balls, which were discussed above, magnets are hidden.  They are pretty strong, so it‚Äôs worth bringing them to each other, and the trigger that is hidden in the wooden frame of the lamp is triggered.  The circuit closes, an electric current begins to flow through it.  All the time, while the lamp is working, the balls will hang in the air. <br><br>  The developers decided to present several varieties of design.  They are bounded by three shapes ‚Äî an ellipse, a circle, and a square with rounded corners.  The main body material is wood.  The developers claim that they wanted to add coziness to their homes and offices.  At the same time, Heng Balance Lamp can surprise colleagues, employees, friends and relatives. <br><br>  In general, this lamp is an excellent example of how something new can be built on the basis of familiar technologies.  Probably, there are similar projects, but the same Kickastarter users liked this lamp very much, as mentioned above.  The lamp was also presented at this year's CES, where it deservedly attracted a lot of attention from visitors. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSxHjYTo1pg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to the developers, the lamp can be used both at home and at work - it gives good lighting, plus it serves as a decoration for the desktop, bedside table, etc.  Now, from 10 thousand euros of planned fees, the campaign has already collected more than 250 thousand euros.  There are still 11 days left to complete the campaign, so you can definitely say that the lamp will soon be on sale. <br><br>  At first, the developers planned to put on the market only lamps in the shape of an ellipse, but now, thanks to the large amount of funds raised, round and square lamps will be put on the market, as mentioned above.  The color scheme may also be different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/461/462/065/46146206571dedd1b6309e4eb2168949.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  Of course, one could also add here all sorts of buns, such as the ability to control via Bluetooth, connect to a wireless network, etc.  But the developers decided not to fence the garden, using a minimum of functions.  In addition to the method of inclusion and design, the lamp is absolutely standard. <br><h3>  Invitation to test dadzhetov </h3><br>  The dadjet invites authors interested in testing our devices ( <b>we do not have Heng Balance Lamp, we</b> <u>offer our own devices for testing</u> ) and write an objective review, for cooperation.
