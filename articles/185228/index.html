      <b>Windows Server 2012 R2</b> <br><br>  The new Microsoft server operating system allows you to quickly and easily switch to using the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù model in the local infrastructure, integrate it with the Windows Azure public cloud or the service provider cloud, and at the same time keep the investments already made in IT development.  In addition to the additional and improved technologies and features offered in Windows Server 2012, it includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Modern virtualization platform: a dynamic platform with shared architecture allows you to go beyond traditional virtualization and provides maximum flexibility in the provision of services: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  High scalability due to support up to 320 virtual processors, 4 TB of memory per virtual machine;  1024 active virtual machines per host, up to 8000 virtual machines per cluster, 64 TB virtual disks with the ability to dynamically change the volume. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Virtual machine mobility, including the ability to compress VHD / VHDX files during real-time migration and performing this migration using RDMA technology, which significantly increases the speed of the VM.  The new Windows Server 2012 R2 also improves migration technologies without shared resources, multiple migrations, virtual machine storage migration, public cloud migration, network virtualization (SDN), and their isolation. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Dynamic Memory technology, which is used to automatically re-allocate memory between VMs, now fully supports Linux-based guest environments. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Simple management and cost efficiency: the new Windows Server 2012 R2 has improved technologies that help reduce the cost of storage systems, for example, due to the ability to create low-cost, productive and highly accessible file storage resources for server applications and critical services such as SQL and Hyper- V, based on conventional storage systems.  New technology Windows Azure Hyper-V Recovery Manager extends the capabilities of Hyper-V-Replica and ensures application continuity.  A new set of API and interfaces allows you to centrally manage a variety of storage systems from one panel. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Any application on any platform: Windows Server 2012 R2 provides the flexibility, scalability and compatibility of applications in the local infrastructure and in the public Windows Azure cloud, and also provides the necessary tools to ensure the interaction of these applications.  As a web platform, the new server operating system increases the density of sites and allows you to effectively create multi-user environments, track and manage them.  This ensures compatibility, supports open standards such as HTML 5, and open source applications. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <br>  Modern work style: Windows Server 2012 R2 provides the necessary flexibility in providing users with access to corporate data and applications from any location and from any device.  It offers a new concept of device registration (Workplace join): a certificate is installed on the user's device, which allows registering it in Active Directory without entering the domain and thereby providing the necessary access to corporate information in accordance with the user's rights.  Another new feature of Windows Server 2012 R2 makes it easy to access a corporate network from a personal device with an automatic VPN connection. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWindows Server 2012 is a modern and highly demanded operating system for our customers to build IT infrastructure in data centers.  Windows Server 2012 OS is the most convenient for operation by the customer's IT service.  Four editions, each of which is focused on a certain size of the organization, and wide functionality allow you to quickly activate the necessary services and build a scalable, reliable core for the operation of business applications.  We expect even greater reliability and functionality from the new version - Windows Server 2012R2, ‚Äùsaid Igor Malyshev, Director of System Solutions at KROK. <br><br>  <b>System Center 2012 R2</b> <br><br>  System Center 2012 R2 provides comprehensive management of Microsoft Cloud OS.  As a continuation of the development and improvement of System Center 2012 technologies, the new Microsoft portfolio of infrastructure management products provides full management of all the features of Windows Server 2012 R2.  Among them: launch copies of VM;  dynamic resizing of VDMX and data storage volumes;  Preparing and managing multi-tenant VPN gateways, which allows you to quickly expand your data center capacity;  management of heterogeneous data centers, including Linux-based environments.  System Center 2012 R2 is a key tool for managing hybrid infrastructures that provides, for example, a live migration of workloads from the local infrastructure to <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/virtual-machines/">Windows Azure Virtual Machines</a> and back. <br><br>  Together with the Windows Intune cloud service, the System Center Configuration Manager configuration solution provides a unified environment for managing various devices ‚Äî PCs, laptops, tablets ‚Äî based on different platforms, meeting the requirements of the BYOD concept. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFamiliarity with the new products of the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 line and System Center 2012 in our company began at the Preview stage.  That is why, as soon as they became available for order, they became the basis of our proposed infrastructure solutions.  Innovations in the network subsystem and the data storage subsystem in Hyper-V 3.0 made it possible to use Microsoft virtualization in projects where previously there were no alternatives to VMWare.  We were able to significantly reduce the additional costs of third-party software, directing the savings to increase computing power in the data center, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Yushkov, Technical Director, GC Integral Siberia. <br><br>  <b>SQL Server 2014</b> <br><br>  Like other Microsoft Cloud OS products, the next version of the Microsoft SQL 2014 data and application management platform was created in full compliance with the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/06/03/leading-the-enterprise-cloud-era.aspx">Cloud in Focus</a> strategy.  It offers fundamentally new opportunities for information processing, use in cloud and hybrid information environments, as well as data analysis. <br><br>  One of the key innovations in SQL Server 2014 is the new built-in Hekaton functionality.  By processing in-memory transactions, it offers a qualitatively different level of performance, availability, and manageability of mission-critical applications. This increases transaction processing speed by 50 times or more and increases the efficiency of using equipment resources.  Along with the progressive improvements in business intelligence, SQL 2014 opens up new opportunities for managing mission-critical business applications and more in-depth analysis of information and data, including Big Data (Big Data). <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs members of the program of early familiarization with new Microsoft products, Baltika and Monolith companies are actively testing the preliminary version of Microsoft SQL Server 2014. In the new version, it is very important for us to increase the number of AlwaysOn replicas from 4 to 8. We are also interested in the appearance of support Azure Storage and analyze the benefits of using Hekaton in-memory transaction processing technology in our applications, ‚Äùsaid Ilya Sivov, chief engineer of Monolit-Info. <br><br>  SQL Server 2014 also provides new disaster recovery and backup capabilities to the Windows Azure public cloud. <br><br>  Additional information about the strategy and the Microsoft Cloud OS platform can be found at: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/server-cloud/windows-server/2012-default.aspx">www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/server-cloud/windows-server/2012-default.aspx</a> .  Preliminary versions of products are available for download on the Microsoft website: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx%3FCR_CC%3D200236802">Windows Server 2012 R2</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx%3FCR_CC%3D200236803">System Center 2012 R2</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/sql-server-2014.aspx%3FWT.mc_id%3DPR_Blog_TechEdEU_General">SQL Server 2014</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185228/</a></p>
