The competition here is very high, which makes it difficult and expensive to promote your applications. <br><br>  However, there is a trick that will improve the position of the application in the American App Store, using keywords for the Spanish version of the App Store.  We in <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3DSpanish_keywords">Alconost</a> translated the whole article about it - welcome under cat. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/245569/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/9a6/748/91b9a67480f741a586a2b8375cb712f5.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Surely your application has many good relevant high-frequency and mid-frequency keywords.  It is a pity that you can not ‚Äústuff‚Äù all of them in the name and list of keywords on the page in the App Store. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      However, if your application is aimed at the US market, you can get a chance to use another set of keywords, thanks to a little-known fact: the American App Store indexes keywords from the Spanish version of the App Store. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúAmerican App Store searches for Spanish keywords‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br><h4>  Stor and languages </h4><br>  Let's take it in order.  To avoid confusion, you need to understand the differences between the App Store in different countries and locales that you can choose in iTunes Connect. <br><br>  In each of the 155 countries in which Apple is present, there is its own App Store.  The parties are not connected to each other in any way - in the App Store ranking algorithm, only the internal data of a particular country is used.  If the application takes first place in one country, it will not directly affect its position in the ratings of other countries.  But it can have an indirect effect: the application, which turned out to be in the first place of the App Store rating, will definitely be discussed online, and because of this, users in other countries will also want to download it. <br><br>  In addition, each page is obliged to comply with the laws of their country and limit the content accordingly, whether it be music, movies, TV shows, books or applications. <br><br><h4>  One language, several storov </h4><br>  Try quickly changing iTunes for PC or Mac, and you'll notice that some of them use the same language as in the countries for which they were created.  And if people in these countries speak the same language, what's the point of creating different metadata for applications? <br><br>  You can try to download five screenshots for five screen sizes, and so 155 times for each country.  That is why when placing an application in the App Store there is an option locale by language, not by country. <br><br>  There are exceptions: when a dialect speaks a really large number of people or a country, they have a common language, but a completely different culture.  One of the most obvious examples is Brazil, where the Portuguese language has so far gone so far from the European version that Brazilians will no longer use the content in this dialect. <br><br>  The letter is the same language, but it sounds completely different.  If the application developer offers Brazilians content in European Portuguese, they may decide that they are treated as <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JanWerkmeister/20131125/205598/Making_great_games_better_for_emerging_markets.php">‚Äúsecond-rate‚Äù consumers</a> .  In addition, in different dialects, some nouns have different meanings, so your keywords in Portuguese in Brazil may have completely different parameters (and relevance!). <br><br>  For such countries, Apple created a special option for selecting locales by language.  These languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude the already mentioned Brazilian Portuguese, Australian English, Canadian English, Canadian French, Mexican Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and British English.  For all other countries, you can choose one of the main languages ‚Äã‚Äãused. <br><br><h4>  Spanish keywords in the American App Store </h4><br>  You may have noticed that iTunes Connect has two versions of the Spanish locale: (European) Spanish and Mexican Spanish.  The first is used in Spain, and the second in Mexico and Latin America. <br><br>  In the US, Spanish is native to more than 40 million citizens, and they use content in Spanish.  In a broader context, this means that the United States is one of the five ‚Äúmost Spanish-speaking‚Äù countries in the world. <br><br>  Apple paid attention to both this and the likelihood of searching queries in Spanish from these users.  Therefore, they decided to link the metadata from the Spanish locale with the search queries made in the USA, that is, the queries of the Spanish keywords in the American App Store.  It is curious that users choose Spanish localization instead of Mexican Spanish, although the majority of Hispanic US residents are from Mexico. <br><br>  It is in this choice that there is a unique opportunity for application developers: you can enter keywords in English in the field for keywords in the Spanish App Store.  So you will receive <b>twice as many English-language keywords indexed by the American App Store</b> .  And this is great!  It turns out that in the American App Store, where the toughest competition in the world, you have an advantage in the form of an ‚Äúextra‚Äù set of keywords. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c3/f94/57f/8c3f9457fd2c4c05aba96deb970ea586.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Restrictions </h4><br>  Naturally, this method has its drawbacks. <br><br>  <b>No more optimization for Spain</b> <br>  The first and most obvious drawback is that you can no longer optimize your application for Spain.  Thus, if you plan to promote it in Spain or get a good stable income in this country, then the use of English for metadata will play a cruel joke with you. <br><br>  <b>Keywords from English and Spanish locales are not combined into key phrases</b> <br>  Be very careful when using keywords, otherwise it may be that between your keyword phrases lies the whole Atlantic Ocean.  For example, if you need the keywords ‚Äúincredible red car‚Äù and ‚Äúgorgeous red car‚Äù, I strongly recommend leaving ‚Äúincredible, gorgeous, red car‚Äù in one language, be it English or Spanish. <br><br>  Otherwise, if you, for example, leave ‚Äúincredible‚Äù in the Spanish locale, App Store users will not be able to find you on the request ‚Äúincredible red car‚Äù.  To avoid such situations, you must either move the word "incredible" to the English version, or repeat the words "red, car" in the Spanish version. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>‚ÄúKeywords from the English and Spanish versions are not combined into key phrases‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br>  <b>Spanish, not Mexican Spanish</b> <br>  I have already spoken about this, but I repeat, since this is extremely important.  If you choose the wrong locale and use Mexican Spanish for English keywords, you will not only not increase the coverage of users in the United States, but also destroy the optimization for dozens of Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. <br>  In fact, this is precisely the expediency of this method.  If the American App Store is looking for keywords in the Spanish locale, you risk losing only Spanish users, but not 600 million Latin American. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Now you probably think: ‚ÄúHmm, it sounds somehow hacker-like.‚Äù  Personally, I have never heard of negative reviews or complaints about this method (despite the fact that blacklisting of keywords, etc., is a common thing).  Perhaps this is due to the fact that we do not break any rules, because all applications benefit from using English keywords in the Spanish locale. <br><br>  From the translator: we have been <a href="http://alconost.com/services/software-localization/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3DSpanish_keywords">localizing mobile applications</a> for quite a long time, but we have only recently learned about a loophole with Spanish keywords.  And how do you get the idea to improve the position of the application in the American App Store due to this simple trick? <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3DSpanish_keywords">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
