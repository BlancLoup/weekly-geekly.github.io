Among the top ten winners there were many interesting projects, including ambulance dispatching systems, collection management for an ATM network and optimization of retail prices.  And the jury was so interested in the monitoring service for shipping goods that the phrase ‚Äúalmost bought‚Äù sounded in the hall. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The competition was held from April 3 to June 28, the participants had about a month to create a prototype business application based on the SAP Cloud Platform cloud platform.  You could offer your task or take one of the three proposed areas - mass recruitment, sales promotion or management of refrigeration equipment. <br><br>  In the final, for the victory in each of the two nominations (for independent developers and for development companies), 3 participants competed.  The event took place on the territory of the Lexus Dome, located in Moscow City. <br><br>  Rolf Schumann, our vice president of platform and innovation, came to the finals.  He not only headed the jury, but also spoke about the changes taking place in our daily life thanks to high technology.  So, Rolf came to the final in "smart" sneakers.  Using a mobile application, he was able to find out the distance, the number of steps and other parameters of his movements.  The Internet of Things is closer than we think.

He showed how, based on an array of data on penalties, the system allows to predict the goal sector, which will be hit, and its result depending on external conditions.  And when everyone practically believed in the power of predictive analysis, he demonstrated in practice that unpredictability is still a strong side of humanity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/92c/b6c/d1b/92cb6cd1b1dd49f18a9d74656fefee92.jpg"></div><br>  Natalia Parmenova, Executive Director of SAP CIS, spoke about the work on launching the SAP Cloud Platform in the Russian data center.  The launch is scheduled for autumn 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e13/ad0/8e4/e13ad08e47f343ce8b17fba0b27b88c3.png"><br><br>  Then another foreign guest spoke - S√∏ren Jens Lauinger, director of sales and services innovations at B.Braun.  He demonstrated the use of the SAP cloud platform and the Internet of Things technology in ... surgery.  The company has created for its customers a convenient application for monitoring the status and accounting of surgical instruments, the formation of sets for operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b15/7f7/b80/b157f7b809354934ba06a562d6f01a20.png"></div><br>  Participants listened with interest about new technologies, but the tension did not subside - everyone was waiting for a denouement. <br><br><h2>  Nomination for independent developers </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/36f/5a9/946/36f5a99467644438888b60328c464b65.jpg"></div><br>  So, brief performances of the first three finalists - individual participants.  <b>The third place was</b> taken by the project ‚ÄúBypass and Control‚Äù from the TNT development team: Igor Dochiev and Alexander Petrochenkov.  They proposed an application for mobile devices, which automates the process of setting and recording tasks for inspection of instruments and equipment.  The prototype was implemented on the SAP Cloud Platform and brought to a fully operational state.  But the jury gave preference to other finalists.  TNT developers got iPad Pro as a prize. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b5d/346/f82/b5d346f82956452d86f40b63b0b5fe0b.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/586/aba/633/586aba633abb4337b541690fc8b18d25.png"></div><br>  By the way, about the jury.  The competition was evaluated not only by our Rolf Schumann, Andrei Goryainov and Denis Savkin.  They were also joined by Alexander Talalykin, director of information technology at Euroset, and Alexey Lafitsky from Kaspersky Lab.  So our competitors were not easy under the serious views of leading IT experts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/20f/d5d/3e2/20fd5d3e2167415d82437c5b28e1cf88.png"></div><br>  <b>The second place was</b> taken by Oleg Demyanyuk, who proposed his own implementation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù.  A business decision based on SAP CP allows you to control the availability of goods in refrigeration equipment, it is easy to add new refrigerators, and keep records.  The matter did not come to the realization of the physical prototype, and, probably, this did not allow Oleg to win.  As a prize, he was able to choose a course of study in SAP or 150,000 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/50b/5dc/cfd/50b5dccfd37642058c8eb75df4c2311f.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8c6/59f/f32/8c659ff3233548298de097d6d44e34db.png"></div><br>  <b>The</b> Belozerov family became the <b>winners in the individual event</b> .  Ilya and Tatyana presented the virtual trading assistant V-Saler.  This is a cross-platform solution that gives recommendations on what else can be offered to the buyer, based on the processing of big data collected by the store. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bit of a developer in another area.  Recently I decided to do web development, I just began to study it, as I was sent a link to this contest.  It became interesting, this is a good motivation, there is something to strive for and what to study, ‚Äùsaid Ilya Belozerov. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fed/240/651/fed240651d4b4b468a5d882fb3d03eb0.png"></div><br>  According to him, the main part of the solution is a predictive analytics service, one of the components of the SAP cloud.  The engine is written in the framework SAPUI5.  Data for testing the system we provided, this is the depersonalized information of a real store, 12 million records.  Ilya compared the work in the cloud with the designer, in which you just had to configure all the links and add your own algorithm. <br><br>  The guys made a very bright presentation, added nice pictures, a funny example, and the jury appreciated it.  The result - the first place and a trip to Las Vegas on SAP TechEd (or 300,000 rubles). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/859/d14/715/859d14715a7049e3ba42bd805ab86abe.png"></div><br><h2>  Nomination for development companies </h2><br>  The finalists from the number of development companies also launched a serious battle. <br><br>  <b>Third place</b> went to IBA IT Park.  The developers chose the task of managing the ‚Äúsmart refrigerator‚Äù and made a serious system that takes into account the loading of refrigerators, the shelf life of stored goods, and can take into account the change in content in real time.  The solution uses the Internet of Things service, RFID tags and the HANA platform for storing and processing information. <br><br>  Surely, if the contestants brought the fridge and demonstrated live, how a bottle of kefir and polbuton with RFID-tag, getting inside, immediately appear in the system, it would have impressed the jury. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ce1/a1b/87c/ce1a1b87cab842f9bb45ea514b0057a5.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f91/219/f35/f91219f35f034230a23d75d3a02e96ab.png"></div><br>  <b>The second place</b> went to representatives of the Minsk branch of EPAM Systems.  The developers presented a solution IACube (Yakub) - a virtual assistant recruiter.  The application performs an intelligent search on multiple sites and selects the most relevant summaries by experience, skills and tasks.  It uses the components of SAP HANA Text Analytics and Text Mining.  IACube may well soon begin to take part in the selection of personnel in the EPAM itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/57e/f52/3cc/57ef523cc69a48019e46283aa49ffb54.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/423/968/3eb/4239683eb73546fcaf2305eaf5038f2f.png"></div><br>  Finally, the <b>first place was</b> won by the TeamIdea project - moTIon service for controlling the shipment of goods, monitoring transport and picking planning.  The solution takes advantage of the cloud application and the Internet of Things on the SAP CP platform. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy did we decide to participate in the competition?  By that time, we were already doing development on this platform, we were actively studying it, there were some thoughts.  And we perceived the competition as a test of our strength against the background of other competing companies, as an opportunity to see what we stand, where we have moved and whether we are moving in the right direction as a whole, ‚Äùsaid Pavel Malko, Head of SAP EWM / TM at TeamIdea . <br><br>  According to him, this was essentially optional work, for which it was important to find additional motivation.  Prior to participation in the competition, the logic of the decision was worked out by no more than 20%.  In a month she was brought to a working prototype. <br><br>  The moTIon service was so interested in the jury that even the phrase ‚Äúalmost bought‚Äù was sacred for many startups.  And as a result - winning the competition. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7c9/577/064/7c957706428340f0a0000691980786a5.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a84/ea8/702/a84ea870257d4f4fb2ad57c8ed3abf15.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6ec/e94/c70/6ece94c7025a4ded93ba90024cbf24fe.png"></div><br>  As a reward, all three winning companies received annual access to the SAP Cloud Platform and the opportunity to promote their solution at the SAP App Center and SAP Forum 2018 sites. <br><br><h2>  Special nominations </h2><br>  Among the participants of the competition there were a lot of those who already had a finished product and transferred it to the SAP Cloud Platform within the framework of SAP Coder.  We have noted three contestants. <br><br>  This is an IPG company that has transferred a system for centralized ambulance dispatching to the cloud. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/652/d4b/62e/652d4b62e5af44fe89351f0bed4425e5.png"></div><br>  The company "Service Model" with a service for cash management and collection for the ATM network. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9bb/533/e77/9bb533e77ea04f559dcdc468432a4c9c.png"></div><br>  And SAPRUN with a solution for price optimization and KPI management in the trade network.  About this decision tell a little more.  Interestingly, the main algorithm of this application was implemented in Python and connected to the cloud solution via Cloud Foundry. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/671/e94/efc/671e94efc3944717898441710af21cd6.png"></div><br>  ‚ÄúWe rewrote the entire interface to SAPUI5, the Python part that worked for Foundry, adapted for working with HANA, plus another application for HANA that gave the data in the right form,‚Äù said a company representative. <br><br>  According to the developers, there were some temporary difficulties with the transfer, due to the lack of documentation on the existing capabilities of the cloud platform.  ‚ÄúBut there was support from SAP, we asked questions directly to SAP, our colleagues supported us, explained,‚Äù said Ruslan Zaripov, executive director of SAPRUN. <br><br>  All three companies also received annual access to the SAP Cloud Platform and the opportunity to promote their solution at the SAP App Center and the SAP Forum 2018. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aa7/97e/3b4/aa797e3b4aff448284f94b327f6696c2.png"></div><br>  The special jury prize was awarded to another contestant, Ekaterina Lyapina, who participated with the OpenBanking API project.  This solution implements the PSD2 directive for banks, provides services for connecting to the banking system, taking into account the new rules.  During the work, Ekaterina did not write a single line of code, the product was assembled on the basis of the standard components of the SAP cloud - API Management, which allows you to set up access policies for services and maintain their billing.  The prize for the finalists was the iPad Pro tablet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b5c/7e3/c22/b5c7e3c229604cccb722d3d0d4933de7.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dcb/bbd/3f8/dcbbbd3f831f4b5ca1cfbb67dd773c83.png"></div><br>  The competition ‚ÄúSAP Coder‚Äù showed that even in a short time programmers can create advanced solutions.  This requires a promising idea, self-motivation and a modern cloud platform with a wide range of functions - for example, like our SAP Cloud Platform. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/45d/f4c/793/45df4c7937f74d7b9ec3be9d55fa9caa.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332794/</a></p>
