Already, 70,000 payment system terminals installed throughout the country will shelter the kiwi bird, which has become the symbol of a new brand - <a href="http://qiwi.ru/">QIWI</a> .  Recognition of QIWI ‚Äúautomata‚Äù among countless fellows of other systems should increase.  And the reason why people will carry their bills precisely in their gut will be an opportunity to pay with their help a variety of services: from the usual mobile communication to fines and taxes. <br><br>  During the last months, several pilot projects were conducted in Moscow, within which a limited number of terminals could pay for the traffic police‚Äôs ticket receipts, buy tickets to the theater (musical ‚ÄúMama Mia!‚Äù) And to the train.  The experience seemed OSMP successful, and now by the end of the year all these innovations will be available through each terminal. <br><br>  In an interview with RBC-TV, OSMP President Andrei Romanenko said that the existing terminal park works only at 50% of its capabilities.  This means that without adding new points, it is theoretically possible to double the turnover of the payment system - if only people would carry money into it.  However, payments for cellular communication - the main source of injections into the system so far - is already 95% passing through the terminals, so it became impossible to expand at its expense.

      For this, new areas of work are being introduced, which, of course, are unlikely to ever overtake payments for communication in terms of the number of transactions, but they can easily be equal in terms of volumes, since the same utilities services, for example, are much more expensive than the average resident on the link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a67/06b/427/a6706b4279c1911c7f62b51c4d66dbe5.gif" width="213" height="335" alt="QIWI Birdie" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  The new brand is designed to draw the public‚Äôs attention to new terminal features.  The brand will also apply to the system of payments via the Internet and through a mobile phone. <br><br>  Half a million euros was spent on the development of the brand, its promotion in the first two months will cost the company about $ 1 million. The promotion will be carried out through advertising in the metro and on bills for utility services and Mosenergo, promotions in universities and shopping centers, etc. <br><br>  The main competitor of OSMP, CyberPlat, declined to comment on the launch of the QIWI brand, citing its corporate policy. <br><br>  To access the system through any interface, the user is offered to create one account in which he can store the history of past payments and plan future ones. <br><br>  (technology of payment through the Internet and tel) <br><br>  Micropayments are an extremely promising line of business.  And their development throughout the world is traditionally taking place in an atmosphere of support from both users and government agencies.  In this light, OSMP investments in the brand look more than worthwhile and quite timely.  Especially against the background of rather dirty methods of competition among players in the payment system market in Russia, with the actual absence of business communication with its customers - millions of people in the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24086/</a></p>
