At the same time, the company tries to do everything with its own hands and with its own mind.  Employees themselves come up with ideas for the holidays, organize and hold events.  Perhaps that is why every holiday in Tutu.ru does not look like the previous one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is the reason? </h4><br>  In early October, the travel service Tutu.ru celebrated a special holiday - IT Day, combining the sysadmin day (July 28), the day of the tester (September 6), the programmer's day (September 13), the Internet day (September 30) and several others. <br><br><h4>  Why do you need it? </h4><br>  The event is a great way to increase the motivation of the team, conduct training workshops and just have fun. 
      <br>

      <br>
      During the holiday, you can introduce parts of the team to each other, understand what colleagues are working on, and get ideas on the development of the company and the product. <br><br><h4>  How to prepare a holiday? </h4><br>  About two weeks before the day of IT, we sent out letters in which we invited everyone to take part in the preparation of the holiday.  The newsletter allowed us to put together a team for the first brainstorming, during which we had an understanding of the holiday scenario, the first ideas of contests and other activities appeared.  The final list of entertainment chosen by vote. <br><br>  Employees of 4 divisions, including front-end and back-end managers, took part in the preparation of the IT Day. <br><br>  From among those who were ready not only to generate ideas, but also to take up their implementation, they appointed a person responsible for each activity.  At the same time, the script and mechanics of the competitions were worked out together.  For example, the quiz was prepared by the head of our front-end, but the questions we tested all together. <br><br>  Steep technical quest came up with the head of the system analyst Anton Ganyushkin.  He had a completely ready idea, he was engaged in its development and the creation of a special video. <br><br>  Although this time we all had time, next time it makes sense to increase the time of preparation for the holiday, to do everything at a quiet pace. <br><br><h4>  What have we got? </h4><br>  1. In the morning a festive postcard and a delicious gingerbread were waiting for the employees on the tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s-/8s/tz/s-8stzemgjnnegadftn7ixisjiu.jpeg" alt="Gingerbread and postcard"><br><br>  2. Vintage set-top boxes were installed in the conversations. <br><br>  3. A link to the video from Doctor Bad Code was sent to all tutushniki to corporate mail.  In the video, the villain threatened defenseless cats *.  To save them, you had to go through a quest - to find 6 pieces of code scattered around the office, make them in the correct order, compile and run.  The resulting key was required to enter on a special page. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WaYqQu4POM8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Like any decent villain, Dr. Bad Code wrote his code in Pascal.  The one who coped with the task the fastest of all was received with honors in the department of bugs and crutches. <br><br>  The quest was pretty hardcore, but the winner appeared in half an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/7i/gc/zy7igcu4qqesfdttbigk28nhoru.png" alt="Quest poster from the quest"><br>  <i>One of the tips in the office</i> <br><br>  4. Competition on coloring white t-shirts - it was necessary to create the most IT drawing.  Zhdun, Bill Gates, cup holders from railway cars, error 404, crutches and bugs and other heroes of our daily working life appeared on them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ze/oj/2p/zeoj2pfls_0llhh0konmf_upqaw.jpeg" alt="Php developer t-shirt"><br><br>  The winners, whom we determined by voting among the employees, received valuable prizes.  For winning contests during the day, we were given sets of Lego Technics, the designers of Marble Mania (balls rolling down the gutters) and the droids from Star Wars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/pa/in/capaincsryf-ti28sjink7yekeu.jpeg" alt="T-shirt kostyl system"><br><br>  5. Evening quiz from Dr. Funtastic.  After the end of the working day, the team gathered in the stand-up space for general meetings. <br><br>  The quiz required ingenuity and dexterity, it was necessary to quickly guess the decoding of abbreviations from the world of web technologies, to solve historical riddles, to navigate the history of the Internet.  The winners are gone with gifts. <br><br>  6. The final pizza party with board and video games <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/sn/uc/qvsnucdiyb3zyjxuylzi6vvthp4.jpeg" alt="Board games"><br><br><h4>  How much is it? </h4><br>  The budget for gifts: 61 thousand rubles.  These are gingerbread for all employees, 3 sets of Marble Mania, 2 sets of Lego Technic, 2 droids from Star Wars. <br><br>  The budget for food and beverages: 69 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The budget for board games: 0 rubles.  In Tutu.ru there is a collection of board games that we sometimes play after the work day. <br>  The budget for video games: 0 rubles.  Prefixes were found at our employees at home. <br>  The budget for entertainment: the photographer - 12 thousand rubles, T-shirts with markers - 27 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Total: ‚âà 170 thousand rubles or &lt;500 rubles for each tushushnik. <br><br><h4>  Who participated </h4><br>  During the day, in a variety of activities, one way or another, almost all the employees working from the office took over.  Most of the people gathered at the evening part of the holiday, when we held a quiz and organized a pizza party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/at/9q/jdat9qc_poc2n4be-t0smnalvik.jpeg" alt="Photo of our kitchen"><br><br><h4>  How affected the workflow </h4><br>  We tried to ensure that all our activities did not greatly distract employees from work.  All tasks could be performed, for example, during the lunch break, and it took a short time to complete any of them. <br><br>  Most of all distracted from the work of the competition T-shirts.  However, he was distracted, of course, not stronger than the usual trip to the kitchen for tea. <br><br><h4>  How did the company's employees react </h4><br>  After the holiday, we asked the staff to rate the event: 90% gave IT Day 5 points, another 10% - 4 points, 3, 2 and 1 did not give marks to anyone. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFrom 9 in the morning until leaving the office in the direction of the house - everything was unforgettable, I would repeat‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was great to remember the student years and Pascal‚Äôs syntax‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt would be great to make such t-shirts anywhere in the production.  To have the opportunity to buy a T-shirt in quality performance and branded.  They were really cool! ‚Äù <br><br>  * - <i>development and support development team or ‚Äúcats‚Äù, as they are affectionately called them in the company.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342628/</a></p>
