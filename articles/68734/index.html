This is a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2581">darts</a> game.  In our office, this is a very emotional team game that gives rest to the head and eyes.  Perhaps it can be played more boringly, but this is not possible with us.  But first things first. <br><br><h4>  Why darts? </h4><br>  It is well suited for the office.  All you need is a free wall and a place to throw.  Interesting darts make games, more about them below.  Changing the distance to the monitor / to the dart board gives rest to the eyes.  It can be used both in the company of friends, and in order to reflect on the next task of throwing darts alone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How to play darts </h4><br>  There are a lot of sites devoted to the game of darts, so I will talk about the rules and inventory only briefly.  There is a target, hung on a wall, the center of which is located at a distance of 1.73 meters from the floor.  And the distance from the front side of the target to the line from which players throw darts is 2.37 meters.  After this line, you need another half a meter somewhere to set your feet for a comfortable throw. <br><img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/7459/2itdartsdartboardmap.jpg" align="right" title="Darts sector pattern" alt="  "><br>  The board is divided into sectors from 1 to 20. Usually it is the alternation of yellow or white and black colors.  Sectors are located cleverly, usually with the largest ones and the smallest ones.  For example, a 20 is surrounded by a unit and a five, and a 19 is surrounded by a triple and a seven.  In the game, this adds complexity.  There are two rings, outer and inner.  The inner ring is tripling, the outer ring is doubling.  Those.  hitting a tripling of 20 and we get 60 points.  In the center is a bull eye - 50 points and a green ring around - 25 points.  At one time, the player throws 3 darts, the maximum possible number of points - 180, this is 3 tripling 20. <br><br>  The appearance of the dart with a description of its parts is shown in the figure. <br><img src="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/937/3itdartsdr.gif" title="Dart scheme for darts" alt="   "><br><h4>  Games </h4><br><h5>  Ladder </h5><br>  The simplest game.  It is required to knock out in a row all sectors from 1 to 20, to finish 25 and / or 50 by agreement.  Getting into the sector of doubling or tripling - immediately throws 2 or 3 sectors ahead.  For example, once in tripling 1, it is considered that 2 and 3 are also knocked out, and the next throw must be made already in 4-ku.  If all three darts hit the target in order, the player rolls again.  This is a pretty fast game, well suited as a warm-up.  You can play one and the campaign.

    <h5>  301 </h5><br>  You need to score 301 points.  The game starts with 301, each throw charges off the number of points scored from it, and continues until zero is reached.  The last throw must be a doubling of any sector.  To make the game easier, you can end it with a single sector.  The number of initial points may vary depending on the available time or the level of players.  We played both 501 and 1001. The meaning is the same - to knock out the necessary number of points in total.  The optimal number of players for us was 4-5 people.  With more, it is a very long time to wait your turn. <br><br><h5>  Five </h5><br>  Also, the meaning of the game is to score points (100/200/300), but at the same time, only those throws are taken into account, in which a sum is collected that is divisible by 5 without a remainder.  For example, if a player knocks out 20-20-1, then such a throw is not counted, but by knocking out 15-6, you can fix the case by knocking out the last dart 14 or 9. <br><br><h5>  Order / Minus 5 </h5><br>  She was born from the well-known yard basketball game.  The first player orders a digit of 21 or higher.  Tries to knock her out with three darts.  If knocked out, then all subsequent players must knock out the same number by any variations of the darts.  For example, 19 + 19 = 38 was ordered and knocked out. You can knock out the same amount as 20 + 18 = 38.  Anyone who could not confirm - gets a penalty point.  Usually the game goes up to 5 penalties.  Those who get them out of the game.  The winner is the one who will be the last.  The tactics of the game can be different - this is an order and knocking out large numbers, and an attempt to catch an opponent on a small number. <br><br><h5>  Lotto </h5><br>  The goal is to be the first to knock out the next row of sums: 30, 45, 60, 70, 85, 95, 110, 120, 125, 135. As in the lotto that knocked out in one move (3 darts), it eliminates the sum from the row. <br><br><h5>  Killer / Padla </h5><br>  One of the most exciting and emotional games.  The challenge - the first to score 301 points.  The game starts from scratch.  But the trick is that if you scored the sum of points, which is equal to the opponent, then it drops to zero.  For example, after 4 moves someone has 145 points and after the first throw of a dart you get the same amount with your previous throws - you can stop and record the result, your opponent will have 0. Then you can follow it and approach to 301 to cut down an opponent with a well-aimed blow, but then after you, others are following you, who will also hook you up.  Therefore, you can trail in the tail and at the end begin to "wet" opponents.  It is possible when trying to "fill up" an opponent - to sort out and be higher, then only hope that you will not be overwhelmed due to the proximity of other players.  You can try to break away from the first shot.  In general, with 5-6 players, this turns into a real slaughterhouse or a clever hunt for everyone behind the leader and a showdown at the end of the finish.  Emotions usually go off scale, and the second name of this game becomes clear in the case when you were cut just before the finish.  The winner will be the one who scores 301 and the one who walks last in the game, i.e.  also pick up exactly 301. <br><br><h4>  Notes </h4><br>  <b>Target</b> - we use a good brand of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">sisal</a> with a thin separating wire.  But at first they used simple cheap multi-layer cardboard, for the first time this could be enough.  It will only be necessary to make the protection of the wall, for example, of cragius glued together in two layers, this one does not penetrate, it is checked.  Provided that if you play every day several times - the board will be enough for a year or two.  The thin separation wire on the board is important - it does not allow arguing over sectors and reduces the number of darts bounces.  It is better to remove the thick wire immediately, safety is more expensive. <br><br>  <b>Darts</b> - you need good ones right away, just like in the picture above.  These will fly steadily and enough for a long time.  And also keep in mind that darts are a consumable material, especially without metal or aluminum shank protection.  Plastic at the first hit of a dart in a dart - usually breaks. <br><br>  <b>Games</b> - many of those described by me go for one, two people, but we in the office adapted them for a company of 5-6 people, in places we slightly changed the rules.  So together turns fun and gambling. <br><br>  <b>When to play</b> - we play 2 times a day, in the first and second half of the day.  It also happens in the evening after work.  Duration on average 15-20 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Calculation of points</b> - someone likes to count in the mind, but most prefer to relax from the calculations and make the computer do it.  We ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù at one time made several templates for MS Excel, you can use them ( <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/12789961000/PublicDartsForms.zip.html">http://narod.yandex.ru/</a> or <a href="http://drop.io/DartsForms/asset/publicdartsforms-zip">drop.io</a> ).  The <i>PublicDartsForms.zip</i> archive contains: 301.xls, 5 (five) .xls, Lotto.xls, Padla (Killer) .xls.  Almost all files contain macros for re-sorting and clearing fields.  The most sophisticated is the template for the Killer game, he knows how to predict the next victim and count the number of those killed. <br><br>  <b>Electronic darts</b> - there is still such, it is usually more expensive than a simple board.  Some contain programmed games and automatic calculation of points.  If anyone uses this, tell me, interesting. <br><br>  PS Merry you game and accurate shots! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68734/</a></p>
