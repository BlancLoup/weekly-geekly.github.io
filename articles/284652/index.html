    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The level of the event immediately turned out to be blurred by the fact that at the parliamentary hearings - an open event in essence - there were some lists of invitees, so those who were interested had to overcome cordons right on the spot.  On the other hand, the level of speeches by Ukrainian officials was set by the head of the State Agency for Science, Innovation and Informatization, Vladimir Seminozhenko, who directly stated the following: <b>"" By 2015-2016, the export of Ukrainian software can be equal in volume to the export of the metallurgical industry ","</b> which caused at least a surprise to the competent part of the audience, and this passage was also reprinted by some Ukrainian resources (though not without a twist of irony), who position themselves as IT publications  .  For reference: the volume of exports of Ukrainian steel and rolled abroad at the end of 2010 amounted to 12.7 billion dollars, and according to the deputy‚Äôs (?) Estimates, the gross income of Ukrainian companies is about 10.9 billion UAH. <br><br>  As you can guess, the result was not the same: the deputies promised to vote for the bills before the end of this year, receiving not only the deputy head of parliament as lobbyists, but also the younger son of the president of Ukraine.  In this regard, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpublishing Comments.ua looks much more definite and unambiguous: <br><blockquote><br>  After all, now Ukraine is a country with a pronounced "raw" economy, which does not contribute to the development of the nation's mental potential.  But in place, there are big concerns about the fact that legislative changes will be used by just a few large domestic IT companies that produce little, but mostly resell, or work on orders from Western corporations. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Read more about the event <a href="http://ht.comments.ua/tech/2011/12/15/309559/ukraintsi-gotovyatsya-pokorit.html">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284652/</a></p>
