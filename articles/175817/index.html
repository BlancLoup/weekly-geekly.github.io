Today we look at the HP T410 All-in-one thin client and its capabilities in VDI networks.  Let's start with the interesting, with the infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>VDI</b> - <b><i>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</i></b> - involves using a powerful server with reliable storage and virtually ‚Äúhelpless‚Äù clients, the only purpose of which is to connect to the server via the network, access the virtualized workplace and allow the user to do what he came to work with. <br><br>  We have already told in general terms what <b>VDI is</b> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/175213/">how it differs</a> from <b>RDS</b> .  It is time for a close acquaintance with the software and hardware complex!  As a device that will demonstrate the work with <b>VDI</b> - our <b>Smart Zero</b> thin client, made in a candybar. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all - we look at its specification:

A micro-OS is stored on the flash drive, which is responsible for the initial setup and storage of some service information, we call this technology Smart Zero - this is not fully Zero-client, our operating system is slightly more complex and functional, but up to monstrous (by the standards of thin clients) Windows Embedded her very, very far. <br><br>  You can connect this kid's virtual workstations to the server in a variety of ways, from connecting via <b>RDP</b> to a regular workstation or a server running Windows Server 2012 to a full connection to the <b>VDI</b> server, say, through <b>Citrix ICA 12</b> . <br><br>  <b>A simple and convenient wizard is responsible for the initial setup:</b> <br><img alt=" ,    , " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b7/8c0/663/2b78c066343d496d72350631a5074292.png" title="Hp configuration manager"><br>  There is nothing difficult in it, and connecting a new workplace takes 15 minutes, 10 of which are to get the new T410 out of the box and connect it to the network (power supply, optionally), and the mouse and keyboard are included. <br><br>  <b>Connecting and working in the future is also as simple and fast as possible:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8b/f99/cd0/d8bf99cd079af444a9071b14a287d783.png"><br>  And again inside nothing supernatural.  Delivery of settings, environment configuration, reservation of disk space, if specified in group policies.  Just for the administrator, transparently and absolutely not to the user. <br><br>  What is HP T410 now capable of?  Depends on what is spinning on the server for "virtualok".  If there is Windows 7, then all the software available to it, from an office suite and a web browser to 1C and other accounting applications.  If Linux is convenient software development tools that are not demanding on the power of the client machine at the time of writing the code, but actively consume all available at the time of compilation and debugging. <br><br><h4>  Service cost </h4><br>  A nice bonus to these opportunities is reduced maintenance costs.  Several years ago, Russia paid little attention to this item of expenditure, many companies were worried about the starting cost of implementation.  They took the cheapest system managers on Celerons, put the cheapest hard drive with the cheapest power supply from <em>the Liao Chashkaris Company</em> at 300 watts (with the corresponding efficiency, noise, and reliability), all this was degraded by Windows XP or Windows 7, the first case pleased the sysadmin with regular ‚Äúand it broke, I didn‚Äôt touch anything‚Äù, in the second - ‚Äúeverything slows down‚Äù (they saved on pieces of iron).  As a result, the fleet of buzzing, regularly failing due to penny savings ‚Äúat the start‚Äù, consuming an impressive amount of electricity, computers, a system administrator (or even a few), who regularly swears and runs from the accounting department, which has hung up to 1C, to managers who have Windows asks to send SMS, and then delete all the data.  And at the crucial moment, a cheap RAID controller burns at the server to which the network printer is connected and on which everyone stores shared documents. <br><br>  Now many have revised their attitude to the cost of maintaining a computer park (after all, it is necessary to update it regularly, and some have changed four sockets during this time, for example, the long-lived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_775">775 has</a> almost completely disappeared from the market, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1366">1136 has</a> fallen into oblivion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1156">1156 has</a> followed it and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1155">1155</a> is not a long time left, it will turn into a pumpkin this summer).  Thin clients practically do not fail (they simply have nothing to break - all the electronics are primitive, consume little electricity, generate little heat, and do not carry any heavy loads), and server equipment with proper maintenance spends much less administrator nerves, is more reliable and "buzzing" in a separate room, leaving the office quiet and cool. <br><br><h4>  The reliability of software and hardware </h4><br>  The most important thing is that <b>VDI</b> allows you to build a completely independent infrastructure in which the fall of one virtual machine (there‚Äôs little in your office there is a user with the tester‚Äôs karma, dropping Windows into the BSOD even with a notebook) doesn‚Äôt affect the work of others. <br><br>  The downside of this solution is the cost of powerful server hardware and, possibly, a separate storage system that will support the smooth operation of several dozen people, flexibly providing access to the necessary computing resources and reliable data storage system that provides uninterrupted access to information and is not afraid of failure. multiple carriers. <br><br>  <b>UPD from 22 Apr 2012:</b> We launched a special project on Habr√©, which was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/175211/">described</a> in the zero post of this season.  It is located at: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/hp/commercial/">habrahabr.ru/special/hp/commercial</a> and there is a lot of interesting information, the form of feedback we promised, as well as a test of knowledge in the field of virtualization.  We are waiting for you and your questions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175817/</a></p>
