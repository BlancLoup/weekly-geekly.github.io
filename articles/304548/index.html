They asked about our barbaric features of IT.  So I told a couple of tales.  Chukhna did not believe it, she says, I was lucky, and this is all a statistical outlier.  For some reason I don‚Äôt think so - everyone has similar stories with a suitcase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/850/1cd/702/8501cd7023a04cdfae303fb1606fb559.jpeg"><br><br>  Once a colleague from the L2-support says: take the purse to the object, since you are going to the same city.  Ok, I say, no question, of course I will take.  I come to the office with a briefcase, and there are three guards and this friend from L2.  They have with them a black sports bag, hefty.  It opens with difficulty, but I still open it, I look in - and there is one-to-one ram of RAM for threshing servers of one company, conditionally ‚Äúthree letters‚Äù.

      I think about the value of the ‚Äúhandbag‚Äù: I say, friend, thousand three hundred dollars here, right?  No, he says half a million.  Come on come on.  Here you guys spend to the entrance to the airport, and then you already yourself.  I did not leave the airport of arrival until the person meeting took the handbag. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One university in the region had an expensive pulsed laser, and everyone knew that it was the most valuable thing there.  One day, some comrades unclenched the grille on the window (they made a loop between the rods, inserted the armature and twisted it like a lever until a sufficient hole was formed).  And the programmer was stolen instead of a laser, because it looked much more impressive, it was connected to a computer. <br><br>  The cost of the programmer is cheap, but this is no longer the case.  He's there almost since the days of the Soviet CNC machines, which are on punch cards.  And the laser is backward compatible with it and with new expensive systems.  Then the scheme was this: they modeled the part on the computer, gave it to the programmer, he gave it to the laser.  We came to set up a direct link.  Drawn circles, squares and more complex shapes, reverse-engineering format.  The result was, but still not completely good.  As far as I know, the stolen programmer never emerged, and as a result, they got somewhere the same after a couple of years after upgrading one of the industries in the area. <br><br>  There was also such a case: on a large storage system, two disks from the RAID immediately flew out.  The manufacturer suffered 4 days, and then stated the loss of data.  The administrator of the injured insurance, having received freedom, carried these discs to the recovery laboratory and received one corrected back, and then using the chisel method and some mother, ignoring the warnings, still made a rebuild and collected consistent data.  That's it in this case, our Chukhna and offended, by the way.  They say - we are all professionals there, this could not be. <br><br>  Another friend of mine had a similar case - a Hindu from global technical support broke the array, and when the local team started asking what kind of idiot did it, they were faced with a fact.  I must say that they admitted their mistake, but they could not help them and, of course, there was no compensation.  They believed in the Hindu, they know the Hindus well. <br><br>  Or here: one of my friend admin had this story.  He came to a large state-owned company (in the region), began with an inventory.  I found a flash storage system that is not listed anywhere.  The array is fresh, 3 years from production, 2 years from purchase.  It is worth as a fairly large piece of aircraft.  Somehow they raised the story, found out that the previous specialists either did not buy support, or simply forgot something, and as a result of the transfer from balance to balance to another city, the piece of iron remained unaccompanied.  They couldn't raise a backup to it, they just didn't even announce LUNs.  As a result, the backup went to gugloservisy (this is a Russian state-owned company), and a lot of taxpayer money was quietly standing idle in the server room. <br><br>  In another state-owned company in the hot southern region they didn‚Äôt want to pay for the backup service.  Just physically, we could not explain to their manager why one should pay for the work when there is no breakdown.  Here, like, there will be a problem - he will pay these unfortunate 3,750 rubles a month, but for now he does not believe that this is necessary.  Naturally, according to the law of the genre, they hook up a virus through the accounting department, put their RDP farm with 1C, lose their base on the winlocker with the key for 1024. That same day, the manager calls and says that everything has fallen and he is ready to pay these 3750 rubles.  How to fix everything. <br><br>  One more time I saw how in a fairly large company they mixed up the IP test server and production server.  And for several months we drove tests directly on real customer data.  Realized the problem at the moment when one of the clients saw a strange movement on the account (in the minus).  Kickbacks were epochal - it was necessary to raise the entire history of the tests and return, in fact, with their hands, as it was. <br><br>  Or there was a story.  One of the loops of the array fell at the client (state institution).  We came from EMC for support, diagnosed a problem with an LCC card.  In the end, after dancing with a tambourine, it turned out that replacing the LCC card did not help.  The base had to be raised very quickly - there were serious financial losses for the client. <br><br>  A Russian IT guy who was at the site did not agree with the diagnosis of a potential opponent and suggested another solution.  There was an IO-module from another machine building, put it in the course of testing this version.  Everything immediately rose.  But since they did not follow the plan, EMC sent everyone to ... Well, in general, they refused to change the faulty IO-module to a new one.  They say that the problem is not in it, and there were no dances with a tambourine, only a spare part was spent.  And it costs a lot of money. <br><br>  Fortunately, the head wrote a letter directly to their (client) main thing, that if the problem is not in the module, then he will change it back to the one that was.  Only the base will fall again, most likely.  Will do it right tomorrow.  And sent the team insurance, attaching a letter to the EMC.  The next morning, EMC agreed on a replacement right away and promised to bring a new IO in 24 hours. <br><br>  And, of course, the best thing that happens in life is when the development rolls a release somewhere on December 30, and at this time, until the heap, someone updates either the firmware of the routers or the Oracle revision.  Holidays are much happier.  Moreover, 24 hours SLA from manufacturers of this damn firmware means ‚Äúa Hindu will call you and ask 100 stupid questions, will not understand anything, but he will say that the problem is on your side‚Äù. <br>  It was the same. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304548/</a></p>
