  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Verge of freedom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When thinking about one problem (topics, articles, etc.), as is often the case, a number of side related problems arise, requiring not less, and often more intensive study, and in this case, when working with a certain technical problem, another one appeared somewhat less technical, but no less interesting and complex, which formed the basis of the plot of this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù is</b> perhaps the most popular word in the mouths and minds of modern man.  Along with this, we rarely think about the meaning of this term, which different people sometimes use in completely opposite meanings. <br>  For some, <i>freedom</i> is an opportunity to <i>‚Äúiron‚Äù</i> cruise missiles anywhere on the globe and dictate their conditions to everyone else, for others, to maintain their territorial independence by any available means.  But having diverged in our thoughts from the level of peoples and states, let us consider the essence of <i>freedom</i> for each individual person (in this case, a habrachelodek :). <br><br><blockquote><h2>  Brief <s>tricky</s> scientific help </h2><br>  <i>Freedom</i> is divided into <b>negative</b> and <b>positive</b> .  The first can be briefly described as the absence of restrictions.  It is characterized by the question: <i>‚ÄúFreedom from What?‚Äù</i> The second is the possibility of choice, which provides for the availability of alternatives and the ability to choose.  Freedom of choice implies a person‚Äôs competence.  Positive freedom depends on resources. <br><br>  <i>Freedom</i> is manifested as <b>freedom of action</b> or <b>free will</b> .  The first involves the availability of conditions and resources to achieve goals.  Limited to prohibitions or deprivation of resources.  The second is the absence of an unambiguous strategy of human behavior and the ability for independent choice.  It is limited by the formation of a certain type of personality, character, and by means of ‚Äúcunning‚Äù manipulations (which it makes no sense to describe here).

      Also, <i>freedom</i> can be divided into <b>objective</b> and <b>subjective</b> .  The first is the absence of external restrictions, and the second is internal. <br></blockquote><br>  Having remained for several days without electricity (through the fault of one in the snipe of a well-fed electrician), I unwittingly thought about the meaning of the above-described term and brought out for myself one curious theory, which I share with you. <br>  By <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">analogy</a> with the physical mechanics of a typical school course, having appropriated such a property as the number of degrees of freedom, I tried to approximately determine its value based on my goals and resources.  Results below. <br><ul><li>  <b>4 degrees of freedom of movement.</b>  As a resident of a fairly large city, I don‚Äôt have one to the fullest extent, because I have not yet made any money for a <i>car</i> and I have to use public transport, which is sometimes faster and cheaper, but does not provide the necessary freedom.  Here we also attribute the <i>presence of a mobile phone</i> (it is not only for someone who does not need it in FIG), which does not restrict freedom of movement, if necessary, to be constantly in touch.  We will also bring here a <i>laptop + wireless access to the network</i> .  To this compote add the <i>absence of a passport</i> that restricts freedom of movement outside our state. </li><li>  <b>Freedom from custody.</b>  I‚Äôm not mistaken if I say that each reader is perplexed or is now perplexed by this problem.  We all love our parents and relatives, but despite this, we get enough of their excessive custody of us, which often translates into a maniacal desire to decide everything for us.  Although it is impossible not to positively mention the parents, who set before us completely non-trivial tasks of acquiring independence, which often result in moving to the institute's hostel and various extra earnings, designed to increase our independence from parents.  <i>IMHO</i> , honor and praise to such parents. </li><li>  <b>2 degrees of information freedom or why I threw away the TV.</b>  All people coming to me, from colleagues to girls, pay attention to the lack of a <i>‚Äúbox‚Äù</i> in my apartment.  I explain this fact not with love to waste my time on viewing unnecessary advertising for me, talk shows that have flooded all the TV shows and one-sided coverage of world events.  To meet the information needs I have enough Internet (well, you yourself know it :).  It‚Äôs not cool, and the largest part of the network is still English-speaking, therefore, limiting ourselves to work only in the Russian-language part, we lose a huge amount of sometimes unique information.  Yes, and when traveling abroad, having the <i>ability to freely communicate in English language</i> , less likely to get into an unpleasant situation. </li><li>  <b>Labor freedom, or how you want it, but so far no luck.</b>  At the moment, I almost entirely <i>depend on the organization</i> in which I work.  There are several ways to acquire this freedom.  Everyone has heard of <i>freelancing</i> and <i>FOREX</i> .  I take steps on both, let them be timid and sometimes extremely ridiculous, but in time everything will get better and I can add one more to the number of degrees of freedom. </li><li>  We now turn to the iron friend.  Without going into details, I would like to note that not every store when you buy, we are given the <i>freedom to choose an operating system</i> , which in my opinion it is high time to fix it.  It's not even that I can be an ardent linuksoid and in general <i>‚ÄúVenda atstoi‚Äù</i> , but when buying a new car I don‚Äôt need another small license (I have them, so I have to salt them whether?) </li><li>  In addition to the linukhovy machine in my household there are also windows.  There is another song.  <i>Open source</i> is called.  Not being a manic supporter of this ideology, I still strive to ensure that software under open licenses nest on my typewriter (mainly for reasons of the possibility of editing the code and eliminating bugs that come across my eyes). </li></ul><br><br>  All these freedoms and lack of freedom are somehow connected with my way of life, so I described them.  Since we all have a slightly different way of life, someone may be similar or completely different.  This is not important, the <b>fact of our awareness of our lack of freedom and dependence is</b> important, and in this connection our attempts to increase the number of degrees of our freedom, which in my humble opinion is one of the fundamental factors that favor creativity and, as a rule, success.  Of course, theoretically, you can follow the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD)">plot of</a> <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA">Chuck Palahniuk</a> , and give up everything, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs not so far to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">get</a> to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Diogenov</a> barrels, and at any station we have a dime a dozen, and I don‚Äôt want to join them. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I got <b>7</b> . <h2>  And how many degrees of freedom do you have? </h2></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39716/</a></p>
