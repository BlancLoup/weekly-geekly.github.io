      - Do it, and you will get triple. <br><br>  And the Manager began to build a tower. <br><br>  At first, he hired kamnetesov, porters, bricklayers ... And it was to the liking of the Manager. <br><br>  But there were too many of them, and the Manager could not cope with them, and then the Manager hired supervisors.  The manager generally liked to hire and manage.  After all, he was a manager! <br><br>  But the supervisors could not cope, and had to hire even more supervisors.  And then the Manager no longer cope with the overseers, and he had to hire supervisors over the overseers. <br><br>  And overseers overseers overseers. <br><br>  And overseers overseers overseers overseers. <br><br>  And it was to the liking of the Manager. <br><br>  But then it still did not go, the stonecutters obeying the stupid overseers made crooked stones, the porters wore them not there, and the masons put them on the wrong walls.  And the manager had to hire consultants.  And it was to the liking of the Manager. <br><br>  And consultants advised to highlight the production of stone and the transportation of building stones to individual businesses.  And the Manager did so.  And under his leadership, the CEOs and Presidents of the companies became, and the Manager himself became the head of the Holding.  And it was to the liking of the Manager. <br><br>  But the work did not go.  And the manager again called for consultants, and the consultants said: ‚ÄúLocal workers are too expensive.  Order a stone in Egypt and Greece. ‚ÄùAnd so did the Manager.  And his corporation became transnational.  And it was to the liking of the Manager. <br><br>  And there was a feast, and the feast was attended by CEOs of the manager‚Äôs companies, his suppliers, his partners, his contractors from all over the Earth ... And the Manager liked it. <br><br>  And God came to the feast.  And God said: ‚ÄúManager, your people speak different languages.  They do not understand each other.  How do you hope to make my tower on time? ‚Äù <br><br>  And the manager answered: ‚ÄúMaybe they really can't do anything.  But look what a pyramid I built for you from people! ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou built it for yourself!‚Äù God sighed and left the feast. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  King Balthasar stared blankly at the wall of the feast hall, on which the words "MENA, TEKEL, FARES ..." <br><br>  Daniel 5:25 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20952/</a></p>
