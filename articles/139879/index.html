      Gradually, applications of this class began to appear on other digital devices: mobile phones and smartphones. <br><br>  For example, for mobile phones that support Java technology, there are simulations of the process of deleting files or the full formatting of the device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Undoubtedly, it is not very pleasant to feel the result of the work of such programs, because their actions can often turn into a nightmare for the user, especially if he is not already very familiar with the technique used. <br><br>  However, among the joke programs, there is a special subspecies that is different from all the others.  These are applications that literally frighten the user.  Next, we will discuss one of these applications designed for mobile devices running on Android. <br><br>  We basically do not give the name of the program, so as not to cause a wave of those who want to try it in action. <br><img src="http://blogs.drweb.com/sites/default/files/images/u35/market.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It should be noted that in the description of the application, the developer proposes to abandon its use to banter people suffering from heart disease, but it is not a fact that it will stop many. <br><br>  After installation, the program does not create an icon in the main menu among other applications.  To launch and configure it, you must enter a special code or add a widget, which is then easy to remove. <br><br>  The principle of its operation is the following: through the settings, the ‚Äúwell-wisher‚Äù ties any application installed on the device to it, and after a certain time has elapsed after launching this application, its main function is triggered: a terrible ghost image appears in full-screen mode, and a heart-rending cry is played at full volume, reinforced by prolonged vibration. <br><br><img src="http://blogs.drweb.com/sites/default/files/images/u35/menu1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can attach any application to such a program: both third-party and system, including GUI-shell. <br>  The ‚Äújoke‚Äù will be triggered each time the associated application is launched.  In the case of constantly running applications, such as messengers, the triggering will be repeated until these same applications are closed. <br><br>  The time interval is set in seconds and allows you to significantly delay the launch of a hidden threat. <br><img src="http://blogs.drweb.com/sites/default/files/images/u35/menu3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now imagine that some clever man decides to play a trick on you and installs this ‚Äújoke‚Äù. <br><br>  In order not to cause unnecessary suspicion, he can set a considerable time interval to trigger.  There is no icon to see an extra program, and not all users often enter the system menu to study installed applications. <br><br>  You can even have time to forget that you gave someone your smartphone (if at all).  The situation is aggravated by the fact that the cry is played at full volume, even if before that the volume of multimedia was at a minimum.  And if you are in headphones? <br><br>  Or if your child plays on the device?  At best, the one who feels the full charm of such a joke will laugh or get off with a slight fright. <br><br>  At worst, you or someone from your loved ones will get quite a serious psychological blow, and for people with a sick heart or an unstable psyche this can turn even more pitiable. <br>  And the device itself may eventually fly very far. <br><br><img src="http://blogs.drweb.com/sites/default/files/images/u35/beee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If programs in one way or another interfere with the user, frighten him or make it difficult for him to work normally, but do not contain the inherent functions of other malicious programs, they are added to the virus databases as jokes. <br><br>  Based on the principle of operation described above, this application can be attributed to this class of programs, therefore Dr.Web anti-virus detects it as Joke.Horror. <br><br>  Be attentive, do not allow ‚Äújokers‚Äù to subject themselves or their loved ones to unpleasant experiences. <br><br>  Of course, the likelihood that someone will try to play a trick on you is small, moreover, if another similar program has not yet been analyzed in an antivirus laboratory, the antivirus will not always be able to warn about the danger. <br><br>  However, the use of antivirus software, as well as attentiveness will help minimize the possible negative consequences from the use of your mobile devices. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139879/</a></p>
