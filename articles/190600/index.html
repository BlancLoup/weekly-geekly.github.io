      Original appeal - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/189652/">habrahabr.ru/post/189652</a> <br><br>  Dear Artem! <br><br>  Thank you for the letter and for the civil position.  I will try to answer your questions in order: <br><br>  1) Upon reaching the threshold of 100,000 votes, the initiative should be submitted to an expert working group indicating, among other things, information about those who voted for and against, about the distribution of votes among regions of Russia.  If voting continues, such information ceases to be relevant immediately after the initiative is sent.  Without doubting that all initiatives that have exceeded the threshold of 100,000 votes, or 5% of the population of a subject or municipality, have the potential to further collect votes, according to the current regulation of overcoming these thresholds, it is enough to consider the initiative in state bodies.  It is also necessary to take into account the fact that when examining experts the experts will be guided by the initiative materials sent officially, and not by operational information from the resource.  The initiative of which you are the author was transferred to the expert group on August 12, 2013. <br><br>  2) On behalf of the operator of the ROI Foundation for Information Democracy, we did everything possible so that initiatives that received the support of 100,000 citizens were immediately sent to the expert group for consideration.  In accordance with paragraph 24 of the Rules of the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation N183 of March 4, 2013, the experts have 2 months to make a decision.  The meeting of the expert working group will be held in early September 2013, and the decision will be promptly published on the website <a href="http://www.roi.ru/">www.roi.ru.</a> <br><br>  3) Your desire to speak at a meeting of the expert working group to consider this initiative was reported to the Government of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  President of the Information Democracy Foundation <br>  Massuh I.I. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>So.</b> <br><br>  <b>Under Clause 1</b> , I believe that this is an unsubscribe, which is essentially not answered, which prevents the petition from continuing to collect signatures even after reaching the threshold of 100 thousand votes.  But, since  the question has already been played, and further similar correspondence promises to be prolonged, then it most likely no longer makes sense to insist that the meter be working again. <br><br>  <b>According to paragraph 2</b> - most likely my joint, it was necessary to indicate the addressee including.  and Mikhail Abyzov, as the leader of the expert group, which will consider the essence of <a href="https://www.roi.ru/advisement/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/otmenit-zakon-o-proizvolnyh-blokirovkah-internet-resursov-ot-02072013-187-fz-zakon-protiv-interneta/">our petition</a> .  In this matter, in fact, both PID and ROI and Massuh personally decide very little.  And the statements of deputies have already appeared that our petition will most likely be considered at the end of August / beginning of September. <br><br>  <b>According to paragraph 3</b> - Ok!  And this is thanks.  It was not necessarily meant by my presence, but this petition must have its representative (s) at the expert group meeting of those who participated in the preparation and placement of the text of the petition ( <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">RKS</a> , <a href="http://pirate-party.ru/">PPR</a> , <a href="http://freerunet.ru/">IPA</a> ). <br><br>  Under paragraphs 2 and 3, I will again try to contact the members of the expert group directly. <br><br>  By the way, here is its composition: <br>  Abyzov M.A.  -
