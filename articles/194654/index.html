  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple iPhone 5s: autopsy, comparison with previous generations and maintainability assessment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> On Friday evening, the first copies of the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c were brought to Russia.  One of the copies of 5s fell into my hands.  But I decided not to hurry with the review, because it requires a rather thorough acquaintance, which takes at least two weeks.  But the iPhone 5s literally burned his hands, demanding something to write about himself.  And we with the master Alexander Levchenko could not stand it, having disassembled the poor fellow to the ground and comparing its components with analogues from previous generations.  At the same time, we also evaluated the maintainability of the novelty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f63/b6f/23e/f63b6f23ef2a02869a43c8d3642c7ebf.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The technology itself disassembly, to the delight of the masters, has not changed.  Certain difficulties still arise, but at a later stage.  The main thing when removing the screen is not to forget about the thin cable that appeared between the updated Home button with the Touch ID sensor and the Lightning connector.  Otherwise, everything is as before.

      Every iPhone with an S index is a bug fix.  That is all about the same, but better.  This concerns not only the characteristics, but also the internal device.  At first glance, 5s and 5 are very similar.  But on closer examination, quite important things are revealed. <br><br>  Here's a trifle - instead of two parts, one began to be used.  But it looks sleeker, the rigidity of the structure is higher, and the assembler is more comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd5/ec5/e72/dd5ec5e72d491a68d43b654e76a53435.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>IPhone 5s left, iPhone 5s right</i> <br><br>  The screen itself, as before, comes complete, and a crack in the glass leads to the replacement of the whole structure.  Given that the characteristics of the screen have not changed, we can hope to maintain the previous price tag - about $ 200. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/449/a88/cfc/449a88cfc383e3cce76082f3d94425f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some elements of the structure are now removed more easily than before.  For example, to get to the camera 5s is significantly easier than to its predecessor in the "five".  Interface connectors are also located a little more freely, it is more convenient when assembling and repairing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/0b0/885/b830b0885edc0d7714c68e0ef4ac7121.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>iPhone 5s on the right</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72d/8d1/6ba/72d8d16bae5eceaa99ba0803d6bfddec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>iPhone 5s down</i> <br><br>  The camera module, despite the increased dimensions of the sensor, remained rather compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89c/6ce/2da/89c6ce2da9950cac550ced4a2404d67e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And against the background of his predecessors, he looks far from being a giant <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd1/eae/bef/bd1eaebefdc4516a44e1739927c76ba8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From left to right main cameras iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, iPhone 4s, iPhone 3GS</i> <br><br>  The quality of the pictures has not yet been compared, it takes time. <br><br>  Pay attention to the trains.  They also periodically fail, especially when our temperature drops. <br>  The upper loop, with almost identical functionality, has become much wider.  Again, more convenient during assembly, more reliable in operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfd/af3/094/bfdaf309461bf6041909b8941ef43ff7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>IPhone 5s to the left, iPhone 5s to the right.</i> <br><br>  The bottom loop, in which the Lightning connector is located, has become noticeably more difficult, because now it serves the Touch ID sensor in the Home button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d8/6cd/e51/7d86cde511100db734b5c4df2a774677.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>IPhone 5s to the left, iPhone 5s to the right.</i> <br><br>  Replace it in parts can not be only in the collection.  Previously, the replacement cost about 2500 rubles.  How much will it cost now - I do not know yet.  But, most likely, the price will rise by at least 50%.  Because the item is more expensive, and more work. <br><br>  And here is the updated Home <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d49/160/516/d49160516269af53ef5dcc4549c335e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b4/c82/64a/5b4c8264adfcc74eef434e1d6b60e035.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Previously, it was changed for 2,200 rubles.  A new price tag is hard to imagine.  According to the most optimistic estimates - from 5000. <br>  To repair the motherboard in the iPhone has long been taken only very pumped wizard.  It seems that in the case of 5s they will begin to refuse and they, it is painfully all densely located.  And changing it is comparable in price with a new device.  However, something really bad with her usually happens only after bathing in earthenware tanks and in the sea. <br><br>  During the disassembly, we have a unique opportunity to compare motherboards of all generations of the iPhone.  Here they are, beauties.  Moore's law in one picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/6b9/80e/7bd6b980e39091472a52a9ebceaaee2e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From left to right: 5s, 5, 4s, 4, 3gs, 3g.</i>  <i>Above is the very first iPhone board.</i> <br><br>  An unpleasant surprise awaits us when trying to replace the battery.  It is very firmly glued to the bottom cover, and at home it is almost impossible to remove it, it requires warming up with a hairdryer and a neat "otkovyrivanie."  The fact of replacing the battery after that is impossible to hide, no matter how hard you try.  This is noticeable on the cover and on the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b87/a6b/f2b/b87a6bf2b40054a066eb02af1fb74482.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The battery itself is slightly more capacious, which is good.  Of course, the flagships of Sony and LG are far away for her, but perhaps the more energy efficient Apple A7 processor will suffice for this too.  The price of the battery itself will remain at the same level, but given the increased complexity of work, they may charge more for replacement.  For replacing the battery in the "five" took 2000, now, I think, will raise the price tag to three. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/304/3a6/aa73043a6cbd9ce96ba9e66ddc8b2d74.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>IPhone 5 on the left, iPhone 5s on the right</i> <br><br>  The Wi-Fi antenna has noticeably grown in size.  It seems that in the previous version of the iPhone, it normally caught the network.  But now it seems to be quite good.  You can check in the field, before this has not yet reached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d41/3f6/b55/d413f6b55532ec3465475a210064eeaf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At the top of the iPhone 5s, at the bottom of the iPhone 5</i> <br><br>  The 5s polyphonic speaker (in the photo on the left) became slightly smaller, and at the same time the body also decreased.  The sound of this quieter and worse did not.  The price, it seems, will not change much (in the "five" it was changed for 3,000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/3ba/7c8/41e3ba7c89f226629c6fe552a81df72d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the voice speaker 5s, to be honest, surprised us. <br><br>  Externally, it is almost no different from its predecessor, only larger (in the photo on the left). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/cc1/67d/e36cc167d1280d9b0cb51cac64493651.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But behind him there are not two contacts, like the absolute majority of analogs in devices of any brand, but as many as four!  Why so much - is unclear.  It seems to have no additional functionality.  Well, taking into account the uniqueness, the price tag will certainly jump when replaced - from the current two thousand to three, or so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/500/0ed/d9a5000edd9455bb5ed3561de1b31e6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the work of Apple engineers continues to inspire the strongest respect.  People are constantly improving the design, taking care of its convenience and reliability.  Do not forget about the appearance of the electronic filling, as bequeathed by the great Jobs.  None of my business colleagues have yet reached such austerity and forethought.  Well, the fact that repairing the device is becoming increasingly difficult ... In countries not as creative as Russia, the deceased iPhone is either changed under warranty (free or extended), or sent to a large service center with special equipment.  We also have these, and their 5s do not seem to be scared.  And the clever guys in the stall "Repair watches, cell phones and making keys", of course, will not be easy ... <br><br>  In advance I answer the question ripening for many: the device was safely assembled back, everything is fine with it.  We are preparing for this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e09/f13/615/e09f13615abd4ea858b34ac625ee00bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_MhhnOumsbM">small video in the process of unpacking</a> , but this is an amateur :) <br><br>  The price tag on the device is now "pleased."  For 5s of black or silver color, they ask for 50-55 thousand, for gold with the same amount of memory - as much as 95. Well, and incrementally.  But this does not stop many.  Good to be a wealthy guy! <br><br><h5>  The author thanks for the great help in preparing the review of Alexander Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">www.tech-town.ru</a> ). </h5></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194654/</a></p>
