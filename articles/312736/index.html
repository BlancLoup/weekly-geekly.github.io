We are so actively imposing selfishness on the company's goals, that a half-hour delay at work becomes a favor.  Work turned into prostitution, i.e.  selling your services, not creating value. <br><br>  Work on freelancing from tropical islands has become an obsessive dream.  Time passes and the downshifters return, because they realize that work is not created for money, but life is not for rest.  We have a desire in the blood to create something valuable.

      <i>‚ÄúFormula for success?</i>  <i>I have a very simple answer: Work.</i>  <i>Work.</i>  <i>Work. ‚Äù- Oleg Tinkov</i> <br><br>  We started reading too much.  The bright covers of the Mann, Ivanov and Ferber publishing houses spawned a generation of book collectors.  Reading has become fashionable, but thinking and acting is not. <br><br><h3>  Corporate culture that changes companies </h3><br>  Free lunches, pillows, gym not able to change the internal atmosphere.  I realized this when I spoke with an employee of one of the largest IT companies in Europe.  I asked him why he left the new company so quickly.  The answer was brief: <br><br>  <i>"Tired of working" in the table. "</i>  <i>And the atmosphere is there, to be honest, not very. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I do not want our employees to say such words.  Therefore, after studying my personal communication experience and analyzing mistakes, I derived several actions that positively affect the atmosphere in the company and, thereby, help the business grow. <br><br>  <u>Do not scold, but think about the decision</u> .  No matter who was wrong.  First of all, come up with a solution and assign a responsible person, and only then analyze the mistake.  And, even after determining by whose fault the error occurred, stop.  Perhaps the problem is an inaccurate task setting?  It is necessary to criticize correctly.  Ask the employee how to prevent this error in the future, listen to his opinion, and then offer your own. <br><br>  <u>Prohibit salary talk</u> .  Due to this, we have avoided unnecessary discontent.  When employees know how much their colleagues earn, it becomes difficult to avoid the following questions: ‚ÄúWhy does he earn more and leave yesterday half an hour earlier?‚Äù  Maybe this is true, and maybe he worked all weekend.  In any case, such things only harm the team. <br><br>  <u>Work yourself</u> .  The leader is a reflection of the team.  If he leaves early, late, then the employees behave in the same way.  And, on the contrary, when everyone sees the purposefulness, vigor and efficiency of a manager, employees are charged with energy.  You yourself remember this in your student years.  If the teacher does not allow those who are late to the audience, you will have to become more disciplined. <br><br>  <u>Explain the overall goal</u> .  Two weeks ago, we had an informal meeting at which the leaders announced the company's goals, work rules and development strategy.  For most, this information is not useful in practical terms, but thanks to the information received, now every employee understands the direction of the company and its role in its development. <br><br>  Senseless work does not add enthusiasm to anyone, while meaningful, on the contrary, increases motivation and dedication. <br><br><h3>  How to work yourself </h3><br>  Last year, I worked with Igor Mann on the book Life for Every Day.  We have collected hundreds of recommendations on how to live and work effectively.  The main problem - most of the tips do not work.  They cover only the external part of the work, when it is much easier to change the fundamental approach. <br><br>  The foundation of effective work is awareness of the main goal of the company.  You, like every employee, need to understand how your work benefits the company.  How does what you do today help bring success closer? <br><br>  Realizing the purpose and personal value, look at the following tips, which helped me improve the quality of work and increase personal value within the company. <br><br><h3>  Some tips </h3><br>  <u>Suggest a solution</u> .  Do not wait to be asked.  Do not wait to set the task.  If there is time, think about how to improve what you do.  Look at the project from the side.  Imagine how convenient it is to use you.  Write down the ideas that have appeared and pass them on to the product manager or to the chief designer. <br><br>  <u>Public report</u> .  An employee of our company every evening fills out a report on the work done during the day.  All these reports are open and accessible to everyone.  It becomes easier for managers to calculate salaries, for managers to plan a project, and for employees to discipline themselves. <br><br>  <u>Planning</u> .  It is convenient to combine the use of a public report with planning.  This disciplines and sets the time frame for the tasks, which has a positive effect on the speed of work.  We use a simple table with columns: date, work period, project, task. <br><br>  <u>It is important to set goals</u> .  This will help focus on the essentials and improve work efficiency.  Having a specific and measurable goal forces you to analyze your actions and cut off all unnecessary.  Write down the goal and do not lose sight of it.  I recommend using the goal achievement service. <h3>  Smartprogress </h3>  .  It will help to formulate a specific, measurable, achievable and meaningful goal for you. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <u>Study related disciplines</u> .  Over the past three years I have worked as a web developer, author of articles in a men's magazine, and now as a chief designer.  All these seemingly random skills help me in my work.  I can communicate with developers in the same language, it is easier for me to accept work, and sometimes I can offer a solution.  The skill of writing helps to express thoughts correctly, which is very important when you need to defend your opinion.  Now I am studying marketing and have already written a few ideas for the development of the company's business. <br><br>  How to study related disciplines: <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Select several books from areas that are not directly related to your work.  For example: design, marketing, project management, writing skills, communication. <br>  <strong>2.</strong> Read them, write down ideas that may be useful in your company; <br>  <strong>3.</strong> Describe them in a letter and send to management. <br><br>  Several books on the topics listed: <br><br>  <u>Communication</u> <br>  Turn on the charm by the method of special services - Jack Schafer, Marvin Carlins <br>  Argue this!  How to convince anyone of anything - Nikita Nepryakhin <br><br>  <u>Writing skill</u> <br>  How to write well.  Classic guide to creating non-fiction texts - William Zinser <br><br>  <u>Project management</u> <br>  Deadline.  A novel about project management - Tom DeMarco <br><br>  <u>Marketing</u> <br>  More money from your business - Alex Levitas <br>  Marketing without a budget - Igor Mann <br><br>  <u>Design</u> <br>  Kovodstvo - Artemy Lebedev <br>  Don't make me think - Steve Circle <br><br>  <u>Focus</u>  We are full of information.  In the 21st century, those who know how to focus and bring things to the end are changing the world.  This is what the founder of VKontakte thinks about concentration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb5/917/e1d/eb5917e1d6954e239231ad18af877c0e.png"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe ability to concentrate for hours on a single lesson is a skill that is becoming increasingly rare in our mobile-online era.</i>  <i>But it is precisely this skill that is necessary for an intellectual, creative, or spiritual breakthrough.</i>  <i>The future is for those who develop immunity to technological attention traps and retain the ability for long-term concentration ‚Äù- Pavel Durov.</i> <br><br>  3 main rules: <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Do not speak out loud in the office if it can be stated in a message; <br>  <strong>2.</strong> Do not rush to respond to the message immediately after receipt.  Your current job is more important; <br>  <strong>3.</strong> If the question is really urgent, come up. <br><br><h3>  What is the result </h3><br>  Applying the described rules, we realized that: <br><br>  - Employees began to work more, and the mood became better; <br>  - Projects began to be completed on time; <br>  - Employees began to understand their role in the company; <br>  - The speed of work has increased; <br>  - Began to appear creative ideas for the development of the company, not only among management; <br><br><h3>  What about you? </h3><br>  I am very interested to know how the corporate culture in your company works.  What do you like and what would you like to change?  Share this in the comments. <br><br>  Thanks for reading! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312736/</a></p>
