But in our age of high technology it is not necessary to go to the window and look at the thermometer, you just need to put the applet on the desktop of your tablet and you are always up-to-date with data on precipitation, wind and temperature a few days in advance!  The program Other Maemo Weather is one of the most popular applications developed for the Maemo platform by the development team led by Vladislav Vasiliev.  Vladislav gladly told us about the new version of the applet, shared the story of its creation and told about his team. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Dear Vladislav, you are one of the very developers <br>  famous program for internet tablets Nokia, tell us how <br>  the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating this utility was born? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> I started developing this applet when the platform (Maemo) was <br>  less than a year.  Then there were very few programs for her and for me personally <br>  there was not enough program that would conveniently show the forecast <br>  weather  Actually, I don‚Äôt have my Internet tablet yet. <br>  It was.  I gave my one good friend to use.  AND <br>  the platform that stood on it struck me with its openness and <br>  opportunity to experiment.

      <strong>ShutteR:</strong> When did this software first appear? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> The first version (0.1) was released on September 26, 2006.  I did not do it <br>  announcements, but thanks to a developed system for projects garage.maemo.org, <br>  the program was noticed and I received some approving reviews <br>  and feature requests.  At first, I really <br>  friends Zhenya Kalyuta and Maxim Kalinkevich helped.  In general, the main <br>  the ideologue who shaped that look and principles <br>  Modern Omweather is a fairly Famous Person - Ed <br>  Bartosh. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Why Other Maemo Weather?  Have there been other suggestions <br>  how to call a program? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> No, there were no offers.  I was originally going to call <br>  Maemo Weather.  But, while two months understood how to write <br>  programs for this platform (set up the SDK, studied GTK + and the method <br>  builds of deb-packages) on garage have already registered a project with such <br>  name (https://garage.maemo.org/projects/mweather/) and not for long <br>  thinking not to redo the name in different parts of the project, <br>  just replaced the phrase "Maemo Weather" with "Other Maemo <br>  Weather. "  Moreover, the abbreviated name is omweather on the Internet <br>  practically did not occur and means in the future, I hope, no <br>  I will have no problems with trademarks. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Now I would like to ask you some questions about your <br>  team.  What kind of people are its members?  What countries?  In which language <br>  You communicate with each other, and how this communication happens: locally or <br>  virtually? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> There are a lot of people in the team at the moment.  Everyone is busy <br>  a certain occupation.  My most important partner and associate <br>  is Pavel Fialko.  He is also from Belarus.  Two thirds of this <br>  his credit is a very good programmer.  We studied together in <br>  Institute and at one time worked at the same enterprise.  When I <br>  invited him to connect to the project, then he immediately responded and, so <br>  as I have known him for a long time, I feel very comfortable working with him.  Then to <br>  Finn joined the project - Marko Vertainen (he lives in a small <br>  city ‚Äã‚Äãin central Finland).  Marko is developing files <br>  assistance to the program, as well as interface translation in Finnish. <br>  Also in the project involved translators from Italy - Alessandro <br>  Pasotti, Salvatore Fiorenzo, France - Nicolas Granziano, Germany - Claudius Henrichs and Spain - Alejandro Lopez.  All these people themselves <br>  offered help and we gladly accept it. <br>  In 2008, Andrei Zhilin painted a new set of icons for omwether <br>  Countur.  So I met him.  Andrew is a great designer, and <br>  This is a very popular specialty in the world of OpenSource. <br>  In the new version (0.21), all that is connected with the design is his merit.  Have <br>  Andrey still has a lot of ideas, so the program will be all the time <br>  to improve both in the field of graphics and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits convenience <br>  use by users. <br>  Then Andrew brought the Canadian team Andrew Olmsted - this fellow <br>  a real GTK hacker, now he is making small patches for the project. <br>  Such, for example, as transparency in the applet, acceleration of gtk <br>  widgets. <br>  Another member of our team is Olga Sidorova from Minsk.  She is <br>  developed the site, and now writes the code for hourly forecasts. <br>  I would like to note that a very important point is the presence in <br>  project testers.  There are many of them, but there are three people whom I constantly <br>  I send new "builds" to check.  This is Arkady Glazov from Peter, <br>  Alexander Savchenko from Belarus, and Andrew (Tabbster) from the USA. <br>  As you can see, our team members live in many parts of the world. <br>  The main language of communication is, of course, English, but those who know <br>  Russian, communicate with each other in Russian, it is more convenient. <br>  I know the half of the team personally.  Recently traveled to Finland, where <br>  met live with Marko, and communicate with the rest virtually. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> And the development and improvement of omweather for you and your team <br>  Is this work or is it still a hobby? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> Hobby.  In fact, the team is very busy people and <br>  everyone is giving this project a small part of their free <br>  of time. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Does the project need new faces?  And if so, whom would you like <br>  see in your team? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> Yes.  There are not enough programmers!  We have a lot of ideas and no one <br>  bring them to life.  We need translators for the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are in <br>  official maemo.  Need a web designer for the site. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Vladislav, what is your attitude to the project Maemo?  With which <br>  problems you encountered while developing your program? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> Maemo project is progressively developing.  Around him formed <br>  good community.  Although, of course, more openness did not stop <br>  would.  Nokia, in my opinion, does not fully understand the essence of the Free movement. <br>  Software.  One of the main problems is a fairly high level <br>  entries for programmers in this project.  Good knowledge is required. <br>  in Linux, package building skills and programming like languages <br>  high level and scripting languages.  Big for me <br>  the problem was that Omweather is a desktop applet.  System itself <br>  applets in Maemo, it seems to me, was initially poorly thought out.  Applet <br>  is not a standalone program, but a library operating in <br>  shared address space with hildon-desktop.  Because of this arise <br>  difficulty updating applet.  It is necessary to completely overload <br>  device in order to launch a new version.  Error (for example, <br>  segmantation fault) in an applet causes the entire desktop to drop. <br>  Nokia has been constantly changing the API for applets for two years. <br>  table and we had to expend efforts to adapt to each new <br>  version of maemo.  The only exception is the transition from chinook to <br>  diablo, it went more or less smoothly. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> It is now rumored that Nokia may switch to qt, will you <br>  rewrite your plugin? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> If the basis of the new desktop will be qt, and there still <br>  applets will remain, then most likely yes. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> What is your opinion, is it better to switch to qt or leave everything as is? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> It's easier to leave it at that.  Gtk is not so bad, but I'm afraid that <br>  business laws are such that Nokia will not develop two similar <br>  platforms. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> Now, could you tell us about the new version of omweather (0.21). <br>  What is new?  What amenities and extras <br>  have added? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> This version came out quite recently (August 15), we were working on <br>  its creation is almost six months.  This is not a stable version and it <br>  designed for advanced user testing.  Main <br>  Changes affected the appearance and usability of omwetaher <br>  "Fingers" (finger friendly).  All design changes are due to our <br>  Chief Designer Andrei Zilin, who did a lot of work on <br>  processing the appearance of the program.  Andrew Olmsted redid the code <br>  responsible for transparency.  This allowed us to choose the level <br>  background transparency for the applet.  Also, thanks to the criticism, we decided <br>  reduce the size of the package by breaking it into two.  Now this is omwetaher himself and <br>  package with a database of cities and countries with codes to get forecasts <br>  weather  Most likely in the next versions we will continue this work and <br>  separate the icons from the main package.  In the new version appeared <br>  the ability to add on the main form the wind speed for each <br>  of the day  And one of the major innovations is a welcome improvement. <br>  change the size and type of font on the appearance of the plugin.  Now we <br>  We are starting work on connecting new sources of weather forecasts, <br>  such as wwwa.accuweather.com, r5.ru, <a href="http://www.yr.no/">www.yr.no</a> and <br>  weatherunderground.com <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR:</strong> What additions and improvements are expected in new versions of omweather? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> Continue to work on improvements in design and management <br>  an applet.  As I said, the most important task for us now is <br>  Add new sources of weather forecasts.  May be added <br>  new display options.  Shooting modes will also be taken. <br>  from space with the boundaries of the fronts. In the near future more <br>  Detailed weather for the next day, painted by the hour.  Will be <br>  new icon sets have been added, and we can also make an option when <br>  Our application can work not only as a desktop plug-in, but also as <br>  separate program. <br><br>  <strong>ShutteR</strong> : Vladislav, how do you use your program?  In which mode <br>  display and what type of icons do you prefer? <br>  <strong>Vlad:</strong> I almost always have a pill with me, so omweather <br>  I use constantly.  To a greater extent, I control the appearance of any <br>  or bugs.  Since the development process is ongoing, you need all the time <br>  something to test.  I usually use combination mode. <br>  I prefer the grzankas icon set. <br><br>  Here is an interesting and lively interview.  Heartily <br>  I wish the project omweather further prosperity and I would like everything <br>  ideas that the guys thought up were realized!  Thanks Vlad! <br><br>  Author Yuri Shiryaev aka ShutteR </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37612/</a></p>
