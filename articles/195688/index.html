In particular, they checked 71 online stores, 69 websites of companies, 37 content projects.  The results <a href="http://freshit.net/blog/internet-marketing/infografika-top-seo-oshibok-sajtov/">were deplorable</a> : when creating and promoting websites on the Internet, they often do not even pay attention to such elementary requirements as recommendations of search engines for webmasters. <br><br>  The article focuses on the problems arising from the above - the search for information on the Internet and how SmartProgress can help in obtaining the necessary knowledge using target templates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9b9/128/4d4/9b91284d47760d8137b4f60a078ff00b.jpg">

      You have noticed such a fact - you, a person with extensive experience in the IT field, sometimes cannot find the information you need.  It would seem that there is Google and Yandex, take it and search, but then there are such problems and difficulties that the chances of finding at least something useful are equal to zero, or the search time takes an insane amount of time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  I will list these problems: </h4><br>  <b>1. Accumulation of ‚Äúempty‚Äù and outdated information on the Internet</b> <br>  For example, forums where people discuss a problem, but do not provide any specific solutions.  You have to scroll through and read all the messages in order to catch bits of the necessary information, and when you find a link to the site you need, it turns out that it is already closed or does not work at all.  You swear to yourself, close the tab and again go on a new circle. <br><br>  <b>2. Increasing the rating of inert and popular subjects</b> <br>  On the horizon, another problem is increasingly arising.  With the release of the next film with a florid title, it begins to flash on the first lines of the search.  If you once wrote about how you had a great bachelor party in Vegas, now there is a high probability that no one will read your article, because the entire search result is taken by the same-name film.  You have to refine your search query to see exactly the text articles on this topic.  This is just a lonely example. <br><br>  <b>3. Resources and services with small textual information.</b> <br>  Such sites include sites for photographers, illustrators, designers, or, for example, specific services that carry useful functions, but do not have good texts on their pages for search robots to find.  For the most part, you find such sites by chance and bookmark them to use later. <br><br>  <b>4. Black copywriting or articles for robots</b> <br>  This is where the fun begins.  The level of SEO optimizers is growing every year, as well as their number, and with it the number of sites for robots with the aim of earning on contextual advertising is growing.  For the most part, such articles are pure water that is not of practical value to you as a reader.  Time after time you open new sites and see very similar articles with rearranged words.  Add to this the terrible design of sites with an abundance of flashing pornos and advertising pop-ups. <br><br>  <b>5. Entertaining issue.</b> <br>  It‚Äôs no secret that video is becoming an increasingly popular type of content, and many are no longer looking for articles on the desired subject, they purposefully go to watch the video.  In the west, a new kind of entertainment is coming into fashion now, when a trash video is shot under a completely harmless request.  For example, you decided to install GTA V for yourself, and type GTA V in the <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dhow%2Bto%2Binstal%2Bgta%2BV%26oq%3Dhow%26aqs%3Dchrome.3.69i57j69i65j69i61j69i59j0l2.4459j0%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26espvd%3D210%26es_sm%3D122%26ie%3DUTF-8">How to instal</a> line and in the first positions a far from relevant video.  Runet will inevitably capture such videos.  The question is only time. <br><br>  <b>6. ‚ÄúSchool‚Äù and aggressive video blogging</b> <br>  Sometimes, in search of a review of a gadget, periodically you come across the creativity of schoolchildren with an abundance of mat taken in a dark closet at the camera of a budget phone.  Moreover, sometimes the rating of such a video rises in an unknown way, and it is in the top of the google issue. <br><br>  I have listed here the problems I encounter myself, in the comments I propose to discuss this issue in more detail.  Share your observations. <br><br><h4>  What do we usually do? </h4><br>  1. If you need, for example, to make a website or find a foreman for an apartment renovation, we go to friends who understand your question or can suggest competent resources on the network.  If there are none, you have to experience 6 laps of hell and search for yourself. <br>  2. Store bookmarks with useful and interesting sites. <br>  3. Go to Wikipedia.  To say that this site has changed the Internet is to say nothing.  We take it for granted, but we need to understand that the collective mind that has filled it for many years has done an incredibly great job. <br>  4. We ask on sites like Q &amp; A. <br><br><h4>  Solution to the problem. </h4><br>  It becomes clear that the situation will only worsen every year.  But not everything is so bad - it can and should be changed. <br>  <b>Here are my suggestions:</b> <br>  1. In Runet, you need to create more specialized and thematic resources with high-quality content.  On IT topics there are habr, on startups - Zuckerberg will call, etc. The more such portals, the faster and better the information search will take place. <br>  2. The development of search engines.  Now we need to focus on the quality of information and divide it depending on the tasks.  If I set to work and I need to quickly find the necessary content, then remove entertainment resources from search results, when I want to relax, then vice versa.  In Yandex, let's say there are directories with sites divided into categories, it‚Äôs quite realistic to implement such a function. <br><br><h4>  SmartProgress Solution. </h4><br>  Imagine how great it would be if at all stages on the path to global goals, for example, to open an online store or build a house, we would get the most useful information, links to the necessary sites and videos without wasting time searching for it.  And it would be nice to have our own experienced mentor who would give us advice in case of difficult situations. <br><br>  Realizing these needs, we decided to do something special. <br>  We are a <strong>service of setting and achieving goals - <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a></strong> . <br>  Most recently, we launched a new section on the site - <a href="https://smartprogress.do/template/index/">templates</a> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/194806/">more in this article</a> ) <br><br>  Templates are step-by-step instructions for achieving a particular goal.  Users set a template for themselves in the profile and work with it, as with the usual goal - add and remove steps, set deadlines and make entries in the goal diary.  Target templates are written by specialists in various fields who already have extensive experience in achieving this goal.  They constitute a step-by-step instruction with concentrated information, links to the necessary resources and video materials. <br><br>  At SmartProgress there are paid and free templates. <br>  Paid is an expert, free - journalists and copywriters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/88a/66a/90f/88a66a90fff386dff9666419611c0e83.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Why are templates paid?</b> <br>  The fact is that we work on the terms of cooperation with various specialists.  They spend their personal time on drawing up such templates, write many articles and shoot the necessary video.  Such labor costs need to be paid back, but the good news is that SmartProgress prices for such content are ridiculous. <br>  The cost of the paid template also includes expert support.  If you come to a dead end, you can always contact the author of the template and get advice or recommendation. <br><br>  I would like to add that all the information in the template is presented not as an article written once and forgotten forever, but as a goal.  This means that by purchasing such a template, you will be able to plan the dates for achieving this goal, keep a diary, and you will also be able to follow the progress of the people who have established the same template.  If you, for example, learn to draw, then we, in addition to the template, also give you a community of like-minded people with whom you can freely communicate and share experiences in achieving this goal.  The motivation for achieving such goals at the same time just rolls over!  In addition, the author constantly improves and replenishes the template with the wishes and feedback of its customers. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  <b>Buying a paid template, you get:</b> <br>  - step by step instructions for achieving the goal, <br>  - a convenient way to use this instruction as your personal goal, <br>  - expert support <br>  - A list of people who installed the same template to contact them and share experiences.  This list will be available only after purchase. <br><br>  The base of templates is not big yet, but we are working on its content and development. <br>  If you consider yourself a specialist with experience of more than 4 years (experience in web development for at least 7 years) and can present it in accessible language, write us at the post - <a href="">hello@smartprogress.ru</a> . <br><br>  We will be glad to see you among our users and experts.  The global task of SmartProgress is to change the attitude of people towards their life, to help them in development and development, to show new opportunities and horizons. <br><br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">Join now!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195688/</a></p>
