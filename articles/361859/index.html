And we can say with a bit of sadness that not all of us manage to make investments for the future, be it real estate, gold deposits or shares of oil companies.  Yes, and such investments can hardly be called "safe." <br><br>  Therefore, this article will be useful to you, in which I will share the wisdom of my good friend and talented system administrator who has worked with computer equipment all his conscious life. <br><br><h4>  Introduction: </h4><br>  My acquaintance with Andrey happened in my 12 years, when he brought our first personal computer and a huge inkjet printer.  At that time, he was a friend of my father, and also worked in a company that supplied computers from Taiwan to Russia. <br>  Then it was a 30 year old guy with long hair and a small smirk on his face, which at that time earned decent money, and his knowledge in iron was necessary for all the ‚Äúnew Russians‚Äù firms. <a name="habracut"></a>

      He was a vehement fan of his business, who preferred to take on complex tasks, did many things with his own hands, and he was not always good at delegating tasks.  A professional who began to grow horizontally. <br><br><h4>  16 years have passed: </h4><br>  At one of the meetings with him, he said a rather good, but convincing phrase for all IT specialists: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt 25 I was happy that I could get a monthly salary in a couple of days, paving the grid in the office.  It was cool.  But 45 year old man on four bones, crawling from table to table, this is not cool!  And firms already prefer working with young ones. ‚Äù  And in his eyes I did not see much joy from what he had to do.  In just a few months, from a cheerful one, he turned into a lost person. <br><br>  But the solution to the problem appeared rather unexpectedly.  His eldest daughter, having graduated from a pedagogical institute for a teacher of mathematics, could not find work even at school, so she sat at home idle.  In order not to leave her idle (and money), he took her to the position of enikeyschik.  Naturally, he taught her and cleaned up all the shoals for her so that the authorities would not dismiss. <br><br><h4>  A year has passed: </h4><br>  His daughter opened a small company support company and hired a staff of 3 system administrators.  Andrey is still working at the old job, but she has a ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù when she needs to complete complex projects. <br><br>  At the moment, her daughter‚Äôs income is 19 times more than what she could earn as a teacher.  She also plans to buy commercial real estate in the future to launch her own system of training the system administrator and conduct conferences. <br>  The final phrase is an experienced system administrator. <br><br>  We are accustomed to work head, the main resource - this is our knowledge.  They need to invest in people who will provide us with the largest percentage of profits.  And it's hard to argue with the fact that these are our children.  And for the sake of this you can crawl under the table. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361859/</a></p>
