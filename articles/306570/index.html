  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Low cost VDS hosting in Russia and its technical support</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Good day, ladies and gentlemen. </p><br><p>  There is one company here on Habr√© that has its own blog and is desperately promoted as " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/marosnet/blog/269561/">Loukost VDS hosting in Russia".</a> </p><br><p>  I have nothing against low-cost and immediately paid for their server.  At first, the service was at a fairly good level, except for a few discount packages that were immediately advertised.  But all these problems were quickly resolved through TP or comments on Habr√©. </p><br><p>  But the current situation has erased all the advantages. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  At lunch, I noticed the brakes of my sites, contacting tech support, I received the answer that there was a small DDoS and now the problem has been solved.  Indeed, the problem was solved and the sites ran over IPv4.  But the trick is that IPv6 was also registered in the DNS.  He was attached to the mail in the same way as to the sites.  And so he fell off a little more than completely. </p><br><p>  What do normal people usually do?  They write to technical support.  What I did. </p><br><p>  The answer is not what struck me.  Answer killed on felling: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/073/d99/6a5/073d996a5db14fd7ba64cf63791f66d7.jpg"><br><p>  For 15 years of working with all sorts of data centers and hosting services, I do not remember the situation that the hoster asked for root access to my server.  In principle, everyone understands that the hoster has access to the server's file system, if necessary.  But so that's so arrogant. </p><br><p>  I thought that would be the end of it.  Write a list of commands, I will give them the result and all.  But no.  The following comment from the TA was more insistent and continued to demand root access. </p><br><p>  I will not retell all the correspondence.  This is meaningless and fasting is not a complaint per se, but merely a warning. </p><br><p>  In general, if someone from habrovchan uses the services of this wonderful hosting provider and has problems with IPv6, then the problem is solved with one command: </p><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">ping6 -I &lt;_ipv6_&gt; 2a02:6b8::feed:0ff</code> </pre> <br><p>  After that, everything starts working. </p><br><p>  As you probably already guessed, this team did not come from technical support, but from my friend, who had been struggling with the TA three days before, for two days.  As a result, his situation has repeated today and this has helped. </p><br><p>  Most likely there are problems with AntiDDoS equipment, which was widely advertised on Twitter.  But who recognizes our problems and compensates for the simple?  The question is rhetorical. </p></div>
