For several days, the company talks, shows, gives it a try, or at least looks from afar at new items that it suggests to be considered essential for the industry. <br><br>  Android met me already in the rental car.  I already used <b>Android Auto</b> , but only on the phone.  This time, we managed to test in a combat situation on the roads of The Bay Area.  The main use case came down to the use of the navigator, the voice acting of incoming messages from the telegram and phone calls.  There are no complaints to the functional, but as long as the phone is connected to the car with a cord, it will not work, and this is very inconvenient.

The conference showed a preview of <b>Android In-Car.</b>  Last year, I saw a prototype based on the Aston Martin, and this one is already a real model.  The main difference from the already existing Android Auto is that it is an embedded solution that does not require a phone connection.  Showed solutions based on Volvo V90 and Audi.  The multimedia interface and the on-board computer are fully realized by the automaker and are identical to the usual design for the brand.  Built-in Google Assistant.  The current version is based on Android N. There is no Google Playlist yet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now in order. <br><br>  <b>Android O</b> - the new operating system - will be available this summer.  Decoding the name of the new version of the android did not say.  Although everyone already knows the answer: <br><br>  <i>- What was the name of the new version of android?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- How how?</i>  <i>At random...</i> <br><br>  The new version will work with the picture-in-picture mode, a new interface for notifications and autofill will appear.  Artificial intelligence will give contextual clues when text is selected.  For example, suggest opening a map when highlighting text with an address, etc. <br><br>  Google pays attention to security, but the OS remains vulnerable.  The company promises to solve this problem.  Also, the boot time of the OS version  on the Pixel phone is reduced by half.  Google developers have introduced support for the <b>Kotlin</b> programming language, calling it the ‚Äúfirst class‚Äù language for the Android OS, but so far it will not be a replacement for the ‚Äúfirst-class‚Äù Java language.  Previously, it was already possible to write on Kotlin, because  it works on top of the JVM, but now the integration will be added to the official development tool of the new version of Android Studio 3.0. <br><br>  The future of Kotlin is now beyond doubt, and the widespread dissemination of this language is a matter of the near future.  To dismiss, saying that this is a hipster language, will not work anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae8/d1d/421/ae8d1d4211b144cd89858730b195b2a3.jpg"><br><br>  Keynout was dedicated entirely to services.  The first was stoked for an assistant.  He began to support more languages, but Russian is not even in the plans yet.  Now you can make calls from Google Home.  Free and from your phone number.  So far only in the USA.  The assistant has become ‚Äúproactive‚Äù - now he understands the context of your daily life.  For example, if you ask about traffic jams tomorrow morning, he knows that tomorrow is a working day and you are driving to work in the morning, and will tell you about probable traffic jams on your route and time on the way.  Yes, and the main news for the android conference: the assistant will now work on the iPhone. <br><br>  <b>Google Home has</b> learned how to display visual cues on various devices: phone, TV.  For example, in response to a question about the weather, etc.  visualize the answers. <br><br>  The assistant can be used for weather and news services, ordering a taxi or delivering products, while learning a language or managing a smart home. <br><br>  Presented technology <b>Google Lens</b> .  Recognition of images from a photograph and search for information on a recognized object.  Very promising thing, but not new.  She is supported by an assistant.  Once again, pleases <b>Google Photos</b> .  Implemented support for smart sharing photos (Suggested sharing).  For example, to share with a friend photos from the last party, where he is in the photo.  As well as the function of sharing the entire library with family members.  That is, for example, photos will be poking around, where there are faces of your children or all family members, while all other photos will remain uncharted.  And local for the USA is the function of ordering a printed book with photos, which is compiled using a special algorithm that selects the most beautiful photos.  If anything, the list can be corrected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6f2/888/dd5/6f2888dd5492421985df3df8a145e23f.jpg"><br><br>  The practical example of Google showed exactly the example of a job search.  The search will aggregate the vacancies processed by special algorithms, due to which only the actual variants will be displayed.  But only for America. <br><br>  <b>Instant app</b> became available for everyone.  It will be possible to feel and possibly implement.  This is a separate functionality as a module, but is part of the main application.  This year, special attention was given to <b>Machine Learning</b> .  For example, using the <b>Magenta</b> project, you can implement a prototype of the Prisma application literally on the knee and very quickly.  The motto of the conference was the slogan "Mobile First to AI first", and this will certainly affect the future of Android. <br><br>  Following the recent trend, Google developers have proposed their approach to the implementation of the architecture in the form of the <b>Android Architecture Components</b> .  A new collection of libraries that will help create reliable, tested and supported applications.  One of these components serves to solve the problem of the <b>LiveData</b> life cycle.  It stores the model, for example, between cycles of changing the orientation of the screen.  Now this functionality is implemented through separate parent activations.  According to the developers, a reactive approach is used internally, but simpler than the implementation of such functionality through RxJava. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/771/655/790/7716557904fc4326bfdf5910b6ad9aea.jpg"><br><br>  In <b>Google play,</b> now there is a new algorithm for getting diffs between apk, which gives a significant reduction in the size of downloaded apk.  Also now available is a mechanism for automatic generation of multi apk on the side of the store, which also reduces the size of the application.  The decrease in the size of the diff has been achieved, among other things, due to the fact that it is considered over the unpacked data. <br><br>  A lightweight version of the <b>Android Go</b> operating system for low-power smartphones was introduced.  To work on such devices, Google is optimizing performance and developing additional data management tools in conjunction with a special package of simplified applications.  Popular apps like YouTube Go, Chrome and Gboard will get Android Go support.  Also in the Google Play store will be a separate category of applications for Android Go.  Such applications will consume less memory and more economically spend the Internet.  Exit is scheduled for 2018. <br><br>  Thanks to <b>Instant Apps</b> , Google makes embedded applications available to the user: even those that you haven‚Äôt already installed on your phone load as quickly as a web page.  Google announced this project at last year‚Äôs conference.  This time, the company announced that Instant Apps are now public and all developers can develop them.  Users can access them directly from the Google search results page.  With the launch of Android Studio 3.0, the company now has the tools to help developers break down their applications into modules. <br><br>  The only place where the constant queues were - is codelabs.  Those interested could complete a series of tasks and get a chance to win a ticket to the next conference. <br><br>  To charge phones and laptops, special zones were identified that were never empty.  More shrewd carried the powerbank with them and enjoyed the freedom of movement.  At the conference area, you could relax, play bouchu or billiards, sit in the shade or have a snack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/501/5b7/a10/5015b7a10a8d468d88dc806353ed397b.JPG"><br><br>  One of the actions was getting the android figure.  This required to check in using <b>Android Pay</b> on 4 sites.  With a check, you could choose a vending donut.  Some cheated and chekinilis several times on the same site, and someone walked in a circle and received several androids.  The organizers struggled with cheaters, putting a tag on the badge, but our man could not stop it :-) <br><br>  This year, the organizers coped with the flow of visitors and the implemented registration system for the sections worked as a whole well.  Yes, and increased at times the audience could accommodate everyone. <br><br>  Not without incident.  There was a local fire in one of the outbuildings.  Brave firefighters came, all the onlookers pushed the security of the conference.  Someone was ‚Äúlucky enough‚Äù to damage the arm, and he was taken away with a retainer in an ambulance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329414/</a></p>
