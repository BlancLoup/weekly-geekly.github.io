All communication gradually goes online.  In social networks and instant messengers, clients read news, find and buy goods, communicate, work - and if they have questions, they try to ask them there.  But! <br><br>  Not all companies are ready for this.  It is impossible to keep track of calls in all channels - not enough resources.  Specialists work for social networks, for whom it is often just one of the duties or, on the contrary, one SMM specialist who is not competent in other issues.  Because of this attitude of business to social networks, appeals are lost, customers wait for a response for hours, sometimes they don‚Äôt receive it at all and the wicked ones leave you.  Despite the existing trends, the business continues to miss messages in such channels, considering working with them as expensive and difficult, or working with them carelessly, which is even worse than ignoring at all. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/bitrix/blog/322298/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd7/4cd/193/cd74cd193aca4380a316941246ea037d.jpg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">When all customers decide to ask something</font></i>

      The business has two options: to hire more employees who will monitor all digital channels every minute, or combine them and automate the process of communicating with customers through social networks, online chat rooms and instant messengers in the <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">Open Bitrix24 lines</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Why is it difficult for a business to work with clients in instant messengers?</font> </h2><br>  In fact, the thesis of the inconvenience of working with digital channels of interaction, such as instant messengers, online chat rooms and social networks, did not arise in vain. <br><br><ul><li>  Messengers and social networks are fragmented - each of them requires a separate authorization: managers have to switch between different interfaces, you need to keep in mind who you answered or promised to clarify.  In such conditions it is easy to lose appeals, forget to answer, miss important information. <br><br></li><li>  Working with social networks and other channels requires free working hours of several managers who will monitor incoming messages.  But managers can not constantly monitor all social networks, customers have to wait for an answer - they leave dissatisfied. <br><br></li><li>  SMM managers usually deal with social networks, and they respond to incoming messages.  However, they are not always fully aware of the product information and are willing to provide technical support.  Therefore, qualified salespeople or support staff should advise customers in digital channels.  If the SMM manager cannot answer the question, he has to find a person who knows the correct answer, wait until he is free and answer, and only then write the answer to the client on the social network.  This is time-consuming. <br><br></li><li>  If the manager cannot answer the client's question, he needs to bring in the course of the matter (previous correspondence) another manager or find out the answer from him.  In this case, the transfer of information and the return response takes time. <br><br></li><li>  Not all instant messengers and social networks have convenient tools for integration with the CRM system, thus, all leads have to be started up manually. <br><br></li><li>  As a result, the cost of staff time increases, employees disperse attention, some dialogues and messages are lost.  In addition to lost profits (imperfect sales), a business also incurs reputational losses - inattention to customer inquiries can have a noticeable effect on loyalty and generate negative reviews, the processing of which turns out to be even more expensive. </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Combine all digital channels into Open Lines</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">The open lines of Bitrix24</a> combine 12 digital channels of communication with customers: Facebook, VKontakte, Skype, Telegram, online chat on the site, Viber, Instagram, Youtube, comments on Facebook, etc. Here they are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/0e8/2aa/6130e82aa2fedfb50f7edccaba1b6290.png"><br><br>  Digital channels connect to Open Lines, which monitor and automatically collect all calls: customers write a message with a question or a problem to social networks or instant messengers of the company, and messages fall into the <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">Open Line</a> Bitrix24.  Then the requests are distributed among the managers according to the rules of the queue (evenly or sequentially as there is no answer).  The manager sees the message in the Bitrix24 chat, replies there, and the client receives an answer in the environment where he left the request - the social network, messenger, etc. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e53/f36/fda/e53f36fdaf6d26be7dd1c3ed2320ade6.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Open lines collect messages from all channels, distribute them one by one, route - all in real time.</font></i> <br><br>  As a new user appeals in a particular channel, the Bitrix24 interface displays the number of incoming messages, appeals are distributed in turn, routed between managers, and can be assigned to a personal manager.  The main value of open lines is the processing of all leads and incoming messages in real time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/beb/588/4cd/beb5884cdf27671af8bdad927e01fed8.png"><br><br><h3>  How it helps in work </h3><br>  Open lines help businesses work with calls on all digital channels and not lose a single customer and message. <br><br><ul><li>  Presales customer consultations through digital channels - the ability to answer customer questions in the selection process and making a decision about the purchase.  Timely consultation - almost half of the successful sale.  At the same time, the client is not inconvenienced - if he does not want to communicate, it is enough to close the chat window. <br><br></li><li>  Communication speed - all calls are collected in the Bitrix24 interface, and managers can immediately start communicating with the client, without switching to other applications. <br><br></li><li>  Customer support - often customers turn to chat on a website or social networks after purchase.  It is important to respond to complaints and thanks in time. <br><br></li><li>  An additional source of leads for CRM - all potential customers are fixed. <br><br></li><li>  Re-sales according to the data in CRM - you can contact the clients in those instant messengers from which they once wrote to you, and offer additional services, promotions, etc. <br><br></li><li>  Sales support via online chat on the website, social networks and instant messengers - Open lines will collect all calls and you will not miss a single potential buyer. <br><br></li><li>  It is possible to create VIP support channels for privileged users. <br><br></li><li>  For developers, there is a REST API. <br><br></li><li>  Add-ons and applications for Open lines.  In the marketplace, you can purchase special chat bots that can communicate with customers instead of managers. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68e/10b/47c/68e10b47c12b1206672bdc1f6f777bb7.png"><br><br>  Additional and very important value - the so-called "invisible" CRM.  In CRM, during the first interaction, when a client wrote to you on the social network or instant messenger, the contacts of new clients are automatically recorded (except for the online chat, in which case the manager must clarify the data and enter them manually), the correspondence history is stored in the client's card.  If the client is attached to the manager, then new questions from this client will go to this employee.  Using CRM tools, you can analyze call statistics through open lines to determine customer satisfaction or understand needs. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>CRM quietly collects data related to your customers, and builds their portrait.</b> </blockquote><br><h3>  Setup, features and features of the Open lines </h3><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">The open Bitrix24 lines</a> are easy to set up, working with them does not require programming skills.  The interface is as intuitive as possible; there are hints and detailed descriptions in the help. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e3/d68/783/5e3d6878369b0ecc7eec76ae24a0d56c.png"><br><br>  <b>The rule of interaction in CRM.</b>  In the process of setting up open lines, the rules of interaction with CRM are prescribed.  So, if the client is not found in the system, a new lead will be created automatically.  It is important that the entire message history from each channel is attached to the client, which means that information is always available to users of Bitrix24.  In the commercial tariffs of Bitrix24, client recognition is available - just like telephony, if a client communicates with you not for the first time, his next call opens access to the client card.  The manager can see the profile of his interlocutor and build communication based on the available information.  And soon client recognition will appear in Bitrix24 in different channels and you will be able to ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù the client regardless of which messenger he writes from! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc3/99b/f9e/dc399bf9ee01f39bbe86f6fefddaa489.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ff/148/e09/6ff148e09082e1d99011263208aefc55.png"><br><br>  <b>Adjust the running time.</b>  As in telephony, you can adjust the open line operation time based on the schedule of work of managers: opening hours, weekends and holidays.  If the message arrives after hours, it is saved, it may not be answered at the time of sending, but it is better to set up an auto reply with text that you think is most successful for the business. <br><br>  <b>Always respond to customers.</b>  If no manager can respond to the message (it is not in place, it is not in the chat, after hours), you can set up sending an automatic response, return the message to the queue until the nearest answer, or do not take any action.  You can customize any type of message: request a wait, promotional offer, individual discount, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f44/2b5/b87/f442b5b877c874dadda119a26d703096.png"><br><br>  <b>Correspondence will continue.</b>  In the case of redirecting the dialogue to another employee, the person responsible for the lead automatically changes in CRM, and all correspondence is saved.  If necessary, you can transfer the entire message history to another manager or technical support.  The correspondence can be easily transferred to another manager - so it does not matter who previously worked with the client.  When the message goes to the manager, he decides what to do with him: answer, reject or redirect to another employee.  This is useful, for example, in cases where the answer requires the competence of another employee or when the question is managed by several people.  Of course, one could simply forward the question or find out the answer and make the client wait, but this will most likely lead to his loss. <br><br>  <b>Consult with colleagues.</b>  In the Open lines of Bitrix24, directly during a conversation, you can connect to another manager and work with the client together.  At the same time, the managers themselves can correspond in the mode of hidden communication - the client will not see their dialogue.  Hidden communication is necessary, for example, in the case of price discussion, discounts, special conditions for the client, or if there is a mentor next to the newcomer who teaches communication with clients. <br><br>  <b>Get to know customers.</b>  It happens that the same customer contacts the company through different channels.  For example, he saw a post on Facebook, wrote a message, and then came through Viber or VKontakte and wrote some other question.  Bitrix24 automatically recognizes the client in any of the channels, combines all the dialogues with him into one profile and saves them in CRM (available only at commercial rates). <br><br>  <b>Analyze the statistics.</b>  Bitrix24 accumulates statistics on the Open Lines.  In a separate report, you can view all interactions by type, status, source, client, presence of an entry in CRM, the number of messages in the dialogue.  Also from the report it is clear, during working or non-working hours a dialogue took place, which employee is responsible for him, the exact time of the last log.  Right from the report table, you can pick up and view the history and reopen the dialog if necessary.  In addition, the user can evaluate the response of the employee - and this metric can even be included in the KPI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/804/01f/8bb/80401f8bbbc3642f0eeb9b6fc9a287ad.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/96d/f56/4a396df56d424280974f7b68b6e32951.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In Bitrix24 statistics is collected for all channels, the desired channel can be connected in a couple of clicks</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Load managers under control.</b>  With the help of Open Lines, it is convenient for a business to control and, if necessary, adjust the workload of employees: it is possible to track how many dialogues each manager has openly, how many messages are in a dialogue, how quickly an employee closes the dialogues.  Messages can be routed evenly and in a queue: in the first case, all managers will receive an equal number of requests, in the second, the message goes to the first manager, if he cannot answer, the second, etc.  You can create several open lines and different queues of employees, so some questions will get to one specialist, others - to others.  Thus, it is possible to redistribute and control the load of each responsible person. <br><br>  Let us consider in detail some channels in order to assess how difficult and how difficult it is to interact with them. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Online chat on site</font> </h2><br>  Business representatives say that with the advent of online chat on the site, conversion is growing significantly.  That is why Bitrix24 offers a proprietary online chat that also connects to Open Lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe8/517/638/fe8517638ae669408a208af9be20e6a7.png"><br><br>  If you had to communicate with consultants in online chat rooms, you might have noticed that managers often respond with a long delay or, in the most terrible cases in terms of business communication, they are asked to leave a phone number in order to call them back.  At the same time, redirecting the client to other channels is a fatal mistake; you need to finally resolve the issue on the channel that sent the call to the company (in other words, the one that the client has chosen at the moment).  Bitrix24 allows you to shorten the response time of the client to a minimum - the message instantly gets to the free manager.  If waiting is inevitable and everyone is busy, you can customize the auto answer text. <br><br>  When a client is on the company's website or online store, he will most likely prefer to chat with a consultant in a chat - this is convenient and fast.  For the chat window to appear on the page, all you need to do is to place the automatically generated JS script and communicate with customers via Bitrix24 in real time.  At the same time, employees will be able to respond to the client from the Bitrix24 web messenger, including from the desktop and mobile versions.  That is, even if the manager is not there, he will be able to answer from his smartphone. <br><br>  The advantages of online chat Bitrix24: <br><br><ul><li>  It is not necessary to have your own website - for each chat a public page is created, to which you can send a link or place it somewhere on the web.  Thus, you can communicate with customers without having your own chat. <br><br></li><li>  Chat is easily embedded on the site or placed on it as a widget. <br><br></li><li>  In Bitriks24 there is a "magic" widget for the site - combined.  This is one button that, when clicked, expands on three buttons: online chat, callback and web form to fill out.  Thus, the client can choose exactly the method of communication that is convenient for him at the moment.  All filled information will immediately go to the manager in CRM. <br><br></li><li>  One online chat - one open line.  For each line creates a separate queue of managers. <br><br></li><li>  Easy to put on any site using automatically generated code.  No need to know programming. <br><br></li><li>  Appearance customization - the chat window looks like the design of your site requires; it does not look like an alien intrusive element. <br><br></li><li>  Setting display options - you can choose under what conditions the chat window will be displayed. <br><br></li><li>  Integration with CRM - all leads are saved, the history of correspondence is attached to them, which can be raised at any time. <br><br></li><li>  Responsive design - the online chat Bitrix24 looks equally appropriate on the full and on the mobile version of the site. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">CRM forms Bitrix24</font> </h2><br>  Another way to get the lead, even without having your own website on the Internet, is the Bitrix24 CRM form.  A form is a questionnaire with fields to fill in, a link to which can be placed anywhere.  After filling in by the client, the information enters the CRM as a lead, contact, company or transaction.  The form is created as quickly as possible, complex settings are supported.  Managers will not miss a single application - Bitrix24 will remind them themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/583/0d2/74a/5830d274a36bdcfe370b352fe5cd1326.png"><br><br>  The form itself is created in Bitrix24 in a convenient constructor, where you set the parameters of the fields, change their names, set the mandatory filling.  Homogeneous fields can be combined into blocks - so the user will more easily perceive the form and is more likely to interact with it.  Inside the form, you can even customize the dependencies of the fields: for example, you ask where the client learned about you and establish that if from the Internet, you learn from him your full name and phone number, and if you know from friends, then check if the client has a partner coupon or a discount .  All data from the forms are stored in CRM and remain there even after the form is deactivated. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Social networks, chat rooms and messengers</font> </h2><br>  If you run a corporate Facebook page, you‚Äôve probably noticed that an inscription appeared on it recently with the response time ‚ÄúUsually responds within a few hours‚Äù and with a share of replied messages.  Now the user knows exactly when he can get an answer from the company on the social network.  The appearance of such an inscription is a consequence of the sharply increased share of customer calls through various digital channels (instant messengers, chat rooms), including social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/58f/003/4f258f003501bcef5783ccce27891643.png"><br><br>  If a company works in the b2b sector, it may not fully appreciate the role of social networks in customer communications.  Although there are exceptions - for example, some companies are looking for partners through appeals to official VKontakte groups or on a page on Facebook, rightly believing that there are real people behind SMM. <br><br>  The situation is quite different in the consumer segment - users communicate in social networks with brands in the same way as with their friends.  Communication via instant messenger and social networks is convenient, cheap (for example, writing from Ufa to an exclusive cosmetics store in Moscow is much cheaper than calling there, especially if the company does not have a toll-free number) available due to the distribution of budget full-featured smartphones.  Moreover, successful models of sales organization through social networks and instant messengers have already appeared.  Accordingly, the company is waiting for all the attributes of social networking: response speed, convenience, personal attention. <br><br>  Companies believe that it is long, expensive and difficult: the client writes, you need to allocate a resource to constantly check the instant messengers on all pages, then the question needs to be copied and redirected to colleagues, then the answer is copied ... As a result, the answer goes longer than by email, and the client remains unhappy. <br><br>  Within the <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">Open Lines,</a> Bitrix24 easily combines all channels from social networks, chat rooms, bots, instant messengers and allows you to respond to messages and redirect them in minutes. <br><br>  Here are just a few ways to use Open lines in popular services. <br><br><ul><li>  Instagram - all comments on your publications are attached to Bitrix24.  You can write messages up to 300 characters, attach up to 4 hashtags. <br><br></li><li>  VKontakte - integration with personal messages on the company page.  In working with messages, you can use all the functionality of the Bitrix24 chat panel: emoticons, chat redirection with history, CRM forms, user references, etc.  VKontakte group is connected as simply as possible: just register a group, log in through a social network and save the settings.  After connecting and starting to work with messages from your customers, statistics on the group will be available: the number of calls, which of them are processed or closed, the number of operators, leads, etc.  In case you are not sure of the speed of response or the staff will not be able to respond promptly for some time, you can configure auto-answers. <br><br></li><li>  Facebook - you can connect the group. <br><br></li><li>  Viber - you can join public and individual chat rooms. <br><br></li><li>  Using the Microsoft Bot Framework, you can connect Skype, Slack, Kik, GroupMe, SMS, e-mail, Office365 and other channels to the Open lines in Bitrix24 and receive calls from your customers.  Creating the Microsoft Bot Framework should not scare you - even if you don‚Äôt have one, it is configured directly in the Bitrix24 interface with step-by-step instructions. <br></li></ul><br>  And with each release to the functionality of the Open Lines for the existing 12 digital channels will be added new features and features.  At the free rate is available only one open line - do not forget to evaluate all its benefits. <br><br>  <b>Where can <a href="https://goo.gl/srrLS3">Open Lines</a> apply</b> ? <br><br><ul><li>  Organization of b2b and b2c sales departments. <br></li><li>  Organization of sales through groups in social networks. <br></li><li>  Organization of work with clients on the Internet, if you do not have your own website. <br></li><li>  Organization of customer support service. <br></li><li>  Providing background information. <br></li><li>  Any tasks involving communication with customers in different digital channels. <br></li></ul><br>  All contacts, calls and leads are recorded in the omnichannel CRM Bitrix24.  Thus, it unites all communication channels, builds a single customer profile to which you can apply and for which you can and should prepare personalized offers.  Plus, CRM allows you to control the load on managers and regulate the quality of service.  In combination with Open Lines, the company receives an integrated sales and customer support tool.  And this is a direct path to high loyalty.  How do you communicate with customers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322298/</a></p>
