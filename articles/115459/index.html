  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qt and Digia: facts and fiction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The planned deal between Nokia and Digia is important for both companies, it will have positive results for the Qt and Qt community, including commercial customers and our employees. <br><br>  It goes without saying that we firmly believe in the correctness of this step, however it seems that both companies had difficulties with this transaction.  We came to this conclusion based on misinformation in some reports. <br><br>  You probably read how some people presented this news.  And so do we.  Although most of them reported this news correctly, we saw some misleading or inaccurate reports, as well as some speculative comments that incorrectly convey our intentions.

        </script>
      <br>
      We decided to talk about the fact that these comments are facts and what is fiction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Article: "Nokia sells Qt / gets rid of Qt / sells most of Qt" </h4><br>  Lying.  Nokia will sell the commercial business of Qt for Digia, which gives Digia the right to sell licenses for Qt Commercial and offer professional services and support to the Qt community. <br><br>  Qt Commercial based business is important, but it is not a big part of Qt.  According to our estimates, more than 400,000 developers in more than 70 industries use Qt.  There are 3,500 commercial customers.  Some of them have one license, and some have dozens, but commercial customers do not make up most of the Qt user base. <br><br>  Nokia will continue to invest in the development of Qt, continue to retain copyright and will continue to publish Qt under an open source license for the benefit of the entire community. <br><br><h4>  "Developers are moving from Qt to Digia."  True or Fiction? </h4><br>  False: Some news websites suggested that 19 developers left Qt for Digia, others broke the news later.  It's a lie.  In addition, Digia already has hundreds of Qt-certified developers, more than anyone else in the world. <br><br>  19 employees from our sales team are planning to move to Digia when the deal is completed, nine to Norway, ten to the USA.  But among them there is no developer.  They are great people, and we wish them success in a great and prosperous future with Digia. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThis will create a ramification between the commercial and the LGPL version‚Äù True or Fiction? </h4><br>  Again, this is incorrect.  Nokia and Digia started this collaboration together, and together we will work in the interests of the entire Qt community, and not just the LGPL or commercial licenses. <br><br>  Digia already has a partnership with Nokia, and we are confident that this new structure will benefit everyone.  Commercial users receive service and attention from a company whose main interest is Qt Commercial business, Nokia's Qt partners and developers can better focus on their area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNokia. <br><br>  Nokia and Digia have a common interest not in Qt fragmentation, but in the growth of the entire Qt ecosystem. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúNokia is breaking Qt apart and trying to get rid of it.‚Äù True or False? </h4><br>  Lying.  Since the announcement of Windows Phone in February as the main platform for Nokia smartphones, Nokia has provided some promises about its future intentions about Qt.  In particular, that we will continue to develop it, develop it, improve it.  Here is CTO Rich Green <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnMe1qbqxVa0">talking about it</a> . <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThis is due to the adoption of Nokia‚Äôs strategy to use Windows Phone as a platform for smartphones‚Äù True or Fiction? </h4><br>  Lying.  We began the process of finding a partner to serve Qt commercial customers in 2010. <br><br>  So, here are a few corrections we wanted to make.  We express our gratitude to all who enter into conversations in blogs, forums and news sites, corrects inaccuracies and offers support. <br><br>  If you want to know who, in our opinion, most accurately covers this news, here are a few of our selected publications.  Please let us know if you have seen others, we should know. <br><br>  <a href="">ArsTechnica</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.businesscomputingworld.co.uk/digia-to-sell-qt-commercial-licences-nokia-continues-commitment/">Business computing world</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/12651_Digia_to_acquire_commercial_li.php">All about Symbian</a> <br><br>  Sebastian Nystrom <br>  Vice President., Head of MeeGo, Qt and WebKit <br>  Nokia </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115459/</a></p>
