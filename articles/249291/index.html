I worked as a communications installer in one small organization in the city.  Then there was a promotion to a more prestigious position in the organization - a fiber fiber splinder.  This whole action took place within 3 years. <br><br>  During this time we have built many objects in the city and by regions, including entire cities entangled with the FTTH / FTTB network, so experience in building and maintaining some documentation already existed. <br><br>  They transferred me to the PTO at the very peak of the documentation, by the end of the year they closed two large objects in different cities.  They put them at the computer, explained what was missing, gave the data and determined the deadlines.

      This is where the fun began. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Go </h4><br>  They gave me the most unpleasant task, it was necessary to make OTDR reports on all measurements that were carried out throughout the construction.  Since there were two objects, and the reflectometer was rushed here and there, we did not have all the measurements.  There was also no input control carried out when the optical cable arrived at the warehouse before it was laid.  How do they usually act in cases when the train left and did not return anything?  Begin to rummage in old reflectograms and look for data similar in length.  They were not as many as we would like.  I decided to search the Internet for programs of reflectograms, there were such, but they were paid.  Many of the things that I tried were the usual Viewers, there were online simulators for ‚Äúmaking‚Äù ref. <br><br>  I have been searching the Internet for a long time in search of the SOR file structure, it hasn‚Äôt been crowned with anything good.  Here, purely by chance, in the OTDR View program from SVPRIBOR I found the data export to a CSV file.  And when I opened this file with Notepad, I was extremely happy to see there: <br><br><blockquote>  0,000000; -17,723000 <br>  0.003267; -0.863000 <br>  0.006535; -0.863000 <br>  0.009802; -0.863000 <br>  0,013070; -0,863000 <br>  0.016337; -0.863000 <br>  0.019604; -0.863000 <br>  0.022872; -2.445000 <br>  0.026139; -4.276000 <br>  ... <br>  4,982791; -21,518999 <br>  4.986059; -19.915001 <br>  4,989326; -22,038000 <br>  4.992593; -25.032000 <br>  4.995861; -39,894001 <br>  4,999128; -39,894001 </blockquote><br><br>  These were the X, Y values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the graph. <br><br>  Here it remains the case for small, take Delphi, component TChart and draw a graph using the modified data.  The data had to be corrected manually in Excel, but the result was not long in coming. <br><br><h4>  Main program window </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/602/41e/d0c60241ed037c470a0220191ffd11de.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Skills </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Range selection; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Download data in CSV, TXT format (both exported CSV and processed by CSV, TXT); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Saving data in CSV, TXT formats (for future change); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Saving in BMP format (for future use in the OTDR report). <br><br><h4>  The result of the program </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de0/d8b/e0e/de0d8be0ec82898e566f5b48121a9c35.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In a short time, a program was written that could draw a trace of any complexity.  It depended, of course, on fantasy and certain standards and conditions. <br><br>  I will not upload the full program listing, there is nothing special and complicated in it. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249291/</a></p>
