Listen to this criticism and ask how other sysadmins approach these tasks. <br><br>  I will describe the rules we adhere to (we try to adhere) in our office (~ 80 computers, ~ 80 phones, 8 surveillance cameras, 4 servers, 8 VoIP gateways, 1 rack, one and a half provider, one and a half sysadmin) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Regarding the labeling method itself - we use a cheap and easy-to-use method - a permanent marker.  On typical wire insulation, it holds pretty well. <br>  For marking, numbers are used mainly (which are similar to Arab-Indian, but quite distinct), dashes ("-", "/". "|", "*"), And some letters ("x", "T" , "N", "V").  All of them are quite distinct. <br>  For wires in and around the rack, it would be necessary to come up with something more intelligible, because there are more cunning notation, but by inertia we sign with a marker.

    <h4>  Marking </h4><br>  <b>1. Cables are marked</b> at both ends, at the branches of the box or passing through the wall, as well as at twists / joints / joints. <br>  In the case of prokidyvaniya through the wall - the mark is placed on both sides, at the nearest factory marking metric area and mark. <br><br>  <i>/ * this rule is followed weakly and we mark basically only at the ends.</i>  <i>and then we suffer - we pull through the box, which is especially fun if it is pushed back by some kind of furniture or a safe, even checking by footage does not always help. * /</i> <br><br>  <b>2. End points.</b> <br>  Sockets are numbered along the wall from left to right (left-handed walk principle) / * this rule allows you to determine the number of the socket without looking at the marking * / <br>  Numbering at telephone and network one and the same.  Paired are numbered as one, separate - individually. <br>  <i>/ * A separate song if a new one is later mounted between two sockets.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On this account, the only sensible idea is to designate it with a fraction separating the numbers of its neighbors.</i>  <i>Type "4/5" - between the 4th and 5th, "4/5/5" - another one between the previous and 5th.</i>  <i>According to this designation it will be easier to find them * /</i> <br><br>  If the rooms are adjacent (one door, but the room is divided by the main wall) - a fraction is added to the room number. <br><br>  On the whole office scale, sockets are indicated by the room number "-" and the socket number. <br>  All sorts of switches, hubs and telephone crosses - just the number of the room or with the addition of "x". <br>  Twists, branches, any spikes - the number of the room and "*" <br>  Within the limits of one room, everything is simply indicated by the internal number, or ‚Äúx‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>3. Cables are indicated by</b> Endpoints (and sometimes cable type). <br>  At each end and at the adhesions there is a designation of the point where the opposite end goes. <br>  In the middle - the designation of both end points and the type of cable (N - network, T - telephone, V - video, etc.), it is placed between the end marks as their separator. <br>  Moreover, the marks are oriented in the respective directions of the end points. <br><br>  Cables running parallel (to the same place) are additionally marked with sticks (‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚ÄúII‚Äù).  <i>/ * numbers merge with numbers, and finally it is not convenient to write letters * /</i> <br><br>  Telephone cable has a habit of diverging in separate pairs. <br>  If this happens on a cross-country or at least a twist, then it is indicated separately. <br>  If it is simply stratified by one pair - are indicated (all) of the room where the pairs are displayed. <br><br>  The ends connected to the sockets often remain unmarked, such as - and so it is clear where the wire goes.  However, marking the end helps to determine the number of the outlet itself, for example, if a piece of paper has flown out, or the inscription is stuck. <br><br><blockquote>  "510 N 590" = network between the switches in 510 and 590; <br>  "530 T 590" = telephone between crosses 530 and 590; <br>  "510 T 520 *" = telephone from the cross in 510 to the commissure near 520; <br>  "1" at the switch = to the 1st outlet in the same room; <br>  "520-2" = to the 2nd outlet in the (adjacent) 520th room; <br>  "2 T 510" at the hole on UTPkha from which one pair is pulled out = the pair goes to the 2nd outlet, the utha - to the cross in room 510 </blockquote><br><br>  Inside the rack, everything is signed by the names of servers or devices, with numbers, if there are many. <br>  The numbers, however, must not be forgotten to sign on the devices themselves.  It is not always obvious in what sequence they are considered. <br><br>  <b>Accounting for cables and network configuration.</b> <br>  All wires, switches and crosses neatly correspond to a special file. <br>  The file structure assumes a star network configuration, which allows the cable to be ordered from the center to the periphery. <br><br>  Network cables are recorded by switch: switch, port, destination. <br>  The port number is not critical, but if you simply number them, it will be clearly visible how much is connected and how much is free.  In addition, wires are written that are connected to the switch, but not plugged into it. <br><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  switch </td><td>  ports </td><td>  purpose </td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="10">  590 X (DES1008) </td><td>  1G </td><td>  500 X </td><td>  uplink </td></tr><tr><td>  2G </td><td>  - </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  590-1 </td><td rowspan="5">  sockets in the rooms </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  590-2 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  590-3 </td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  580-1 </td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  580-2 </td></tr><tr><td>  (3) </td><td>  are free </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  580-3 </td><td rowspan="2">  unconnected sockets </td></tr><tr><td>  - </td><td>  580-4 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Similarly, telephone cables can be recorded: source node, cable, end node, destination. <br>  "Nodes" can denote custom sockets, terminals on the crosses, ports of local devices, or city station lines. <br>  "Cable" indicates the name of the cable, as well as the color of the pair inside it. <br>  ‚ÄúEnd node‚Äù indicates where a specific cable is plugged. <br>  "Assignment" indicates where in the end, after all the crosses, comes the line. <br>  The idea is that the scheme was visible and where to plug the nearest end of the cable, and where in the end it comes. <br>  <i>/ * scheme for telephone only invented but not yet used in practice * /</i> <br><br><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  knot </td><td>  ports / connectors </td><td>  cable </td><td>  end node </td><td>  purpose </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  zaptel </td><td>  1..4 </td><td rowspan="2">  Z X1 </td><td rowspan="2">  X1 (26..38) </td><td>  GTS: 2128506, 2128507, 2128508, 2128509 </td></tr><tr><td>  5..8 </td><td>  payphones crap telecom </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">  mediatrix-1 </td><td>  1..2 </td><td rowspan="2">  M1 X1 </td><td rowspan="2">  X1 (1..25) </td><td>  580-1 580-2 </td></tr><tr><td>  3..25 </td><td>  590-1..25 </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">  X1 </td><td>  one </td><td>  500 T 580 orzh </td><td>  580-1 </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  500 T 580 green </td><td>  580-2 </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  3..25 </td><td>  500 T 590 </td><td>  590-1..22 </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  26 </td><td>  UPL krs / sin </td><td rowspan="4">  magic box </td><td>  2128506 </td></tr><tr><td>  27 </td><td>  UPL zhlt / chrn </td><td>  2128507 </td></tr><tr><td>  28 </td><td>  UPL green / flt </td><td>  2128508 </td></tr><tr><td>  29 </td><td>  UPL ser / drill </td><td>  2128509 </td></tr><tr><td>  30..34 </td><td>  500 T 590 </td><td>  590 X (1..4) </td><td>  pay phones </td></tr><tr><td>  magic box </td><td>  - </td><td>  500 T 590 syn </td><td>  CTA </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  590 X </td><td>  1..4 </td><td>  T crap </td><td>  Crap telecom </td><td>  pay phones </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  I suspect that somewhere there are special programs that contribute to such accounting.  And it is absolutely wonderful if the cable could be indicated on the office diagram, with the miscalculation of the footage and other goodies. <br>  But I did not come across this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50198/</a></p>
