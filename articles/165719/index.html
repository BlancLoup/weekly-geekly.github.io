The methodology of activating creativity through the conscious striving for the ideal arose as an alternative to imperfect selection of options.  The mental activity of this knowledge is aimed at finding an idea in an obvious, rather than random, way. <br><br>  Of course, ideality does not need to be taken literally.  Ideality is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãideality, direction, approaching the ideal.  On the way to the ideal, it is necessary to strive to get rid of unnecessary, unnecessary, inefficient elements.  At the same time, it is important to remember that an object should be improved so that the system does not lose its meaning, the functionality does not decrease and the overall system efficiency increases.

      Now I come to the most important thing, how it works.  It works like this: the idealization of the system is achieved by reducing the individual parts of the system, by combining the functions of one or several objects in one object.  This technique is called coagulation.  Altshuller defined the collapsed system in this way - when one object performs several functions. <br><br>  The easiest way to understand dry theory is through examples.  What I do. <br>  A good example for understanding the coagulation technique is an example of visualization of the battery charge level and the signal level in the Nokia 3310 phone. On the left is the antenna icon with bricks, on the right is a battery with bricks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fab/48a/59a/fab48a59aa662730420cc0ccd9129cb2.jpg"><br><br>  It is obvious that the bricks can be combined with the antenna and the battery without losing meaning.  But this evidence was not obvious to the Nokia developers.  Model 3310 released in 2000.  Maybe something has changed over time?  Let's look at one of the latest flagships of the company - E7, released in 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a22/4ec/540/a224ec54030ce0faaa1f1ca8577881f9.jpg"><br>  It can not be again bricks, though a little combed.  Obviously, this circumstance led to a decrease in the market share of Nokia.  That is what such negligence in ignorance of the method of coagulation leads to.  Joked of course. <br><br>  The developers of the iPhone did not follow the example of Nokia and did it differently, namely, they combined the building blocks with the metaphor of a battery and an antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb5/593/552/eb55935521abd90ba66d8b66ad480d94.jpg"><br><br>  What is the result: the system did not lose its sense when combining the functions, the functionality did not decrease, and the efficiency increased - the battery level metaphor increased the degree of natural conformity. <br><br>  Another example.  Motorists are so accustomed to the recursive actions of unscrewing and twisting the cap of the gas tank that they do not think about it, the cap is not needed at all!  Ford is gradually introducing on its models the neck without a separate cover for the <a href="http://www.ford.ru/Technology/FordComfortAndConvenience/CaplessRefuellingSystem" rel="nofollow">Easy Fuel</a> technologist. <br><br><img src="http://www.zr.ru/wpfiles/uploads/2011/08/201108300900_09-575x383.jpg"><br><br>  The function of the cover is to ensure the tightness of the gas tank.  There is no cover, but its function is performed.  The cover function is now performed by the hatch.  The system did not lose its meaning when combining functions, functionality did not decrease, and efficiency increased - there is no need to think about what to do with the lid and it‚Äôs impossible to lose - there is no lid! <br><br>  We are in the grip of bad technology, bad decisions, and we think it should be so.  Developers and engineers protect their imperfect products and pass on the inconvenience of use to consumers.  And you need this: ‚Äú <i>Jobs</i> ‚Äôs <i>revolutionary decision to get rid of the switch struck all his colleagues (talking about the iPod).</i>  <i>Over time, this has become a distinctive feature of Apple devices - they should not be turned off.</i>  <i>It was shocking.</i>  <i>They fell asleep when they were not used, and woke up when you press any button.</i>  <i>There was no need for a switch</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  And again, an example with the products of Apple, namely the example with the magic mouse Magic Mouse.  I am almost sure that not a single computer manufacturer could create such a mouse, for the same reason - a lack of understanding of real simplicity. <br><br>  Apple word: <br>  <i>The Multi-Touch area occupies the entire top surface of the Magic Mouse, and any part of it can be a button.</i>  <i>With one finger, you scroll the content in any direction, with two you scroll through web pages and photos.</i>  <i>You can click at any point.</i>  <i>Inside the Magic Mouse there is a chip that transmits your commands.</i>  <i>This mouse will never confuse scrolling with scrolling, and if your hand just lies on it, the mouse realizes that no action is needed.</i> <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ru/magicmouse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/ru/magicmouse/</a> <br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/magicmouse/images/lasertracking_20091020.jpg"><br>  Wheel and buttons there, and their function is performed.  The surface of the mouse is a solid button and a wheel.  The system did not lose its meaning when combining functions, functionality did not decrease, and efficiency increased - a new way to manage gestures appeared. <br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/euro/magicmouse/images/gestures_list_20091020.jpg"><br><br>  One more example. <br>  In Perm, the design development center developed routeing guide plates.  The word PCDD: <br>  <i>The main difference from the existing ones is the use of interior lighting in vehicles for evening illumination (the base of the tablet is made from milky-white plexiglass).</i>  <i>At night, the number and description of the route will become more visible, while the design remains almost as simple and cheap, an additional light source is not required.</i>  <i>Therefore, a black background with slotted white letters was chosen (by the way, it also looks more harmonious during the day).</i> <br>  <a href="http://pcrd.livejournal.com/60255.html" rel="nofollow">http://pcrd.livejournal.com/60255.html</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/b3b/fce/f89b3bfce5f5783aada78555877bc2ac.jpg"><br><br>  There is no light box to illuminate the route at night, but the function is performed.  Used interior lighting in transport.  The system did not lose its meaning when combining the functions, the functionality did not decrease, and the efficiency increased - the plates became more noticeable at night. <br><br>  Moving on to the following example, it's time to tell about one important circumstance, namely, the identification of a variable zone (in terms of the SUT, an operational zone).  Simply put, you need to understand which element of the system you need to expose ideality. <br>  And now let's fantasize, or rather fantasize, the Shenzhen Hashi Future Parking Equipment, which presented its project of unloading the city from traffic jams - 3D Micro Express. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9df/942/abe/9df942abe007b8c681ae8b085dd307f6.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom line is that the double-decker bus-tunnel moves along the rails, on the first floor a highway and a tunnel can pass cars, and on the second floor passengers.  The authors decided not to break the highway, and the bus.  Ideally, if the bus goes on the road, as if the bus does not exist at all. <br>  The project is crazy, but very interesting and revealing.  Indicative in terms of enhancing the search for non-standard solutions. <br><br>  The scope of application of the ideal object extends to visualization. <br>  A word to Nikolay Toderovsky. <br>  <i>What is the best grid for the table?</i>  <i>That's right: the best grid is when there is no grid, and its function is executed.</i>  <i>What can perform the functions of the grid for free?</i>  <i>Nothing!</i>  <i>Empty place!</i> <br>  <a href="http://ksoftware.livejournal.com/106329.html">http://ksoftware.livejournal.com/106329.html</a> <br><br>  It was: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc1/671/90d/cc167190db5674fe8457fbd09c2d16fe.png"><br><br>  It became: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/569/23a/2a2/56923a2a2b324065de282e865f457681.png"><br><br>  The system did not lose its meaning when combining functions, functionality did not decrease, and efficiency increased - the table became more readable. <br><br>  Examples can be given from completely different areas.  Visit the Berlin metro. <br>  Word Ilya Varlamov. <br>  <i>Tickets (in the Berlin subway) are purchased in vending machines, special travel cards in a few offices.</i>  <i>A large number of different types of tickets are offered.</i>  <i>The main one is a single ticket for 2 hours of travel in any transport.</i>  <i>A short trip ticket costs 1.40 and entitles you to travel to three stations without a transfer (six on the bus and tram).</i>  <i>We offer tickets for the day, week, month, year and many others, including those combined with tickets to museums.</i> <br>  <a href="http://zyalt.livejournal.com/414961.html">http://zyalt.livejournal.com/414961.html</a> <br><br>  Transport tickets combined with tickets to the museum, the system has become more efficient. <br>  The system did not lose its meaning when combining functions, functionality did not decrease, and efficiency increased - saving on costs. <br><br>  Finally, talk about my experience. <br>  In the work on the <a href="http://valiullin.livejournal.com/118591.html">weather forecast for color-sensitive people, it was not very</a> necessary to reduce the height of the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91a/84f/90d/91a84f90d5182545aa11917eb0654cab.jpg"><br><br>  I was worried about the density of the data in the squares, it turned out too long page of the forecast for 6 days.  But, if you combine the time of the day, temperature, icon and take out over the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa colored square, then the space saving will be about 20%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/772/339/a53/772339a535ca26f9d031a7837044445e.jpg"><br><br>  The system did not lose its sense when combining functions, functionality did not decrease, and efficiency increased - 20% space saving. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions</b> . <br>  Ideally, if there is no output, but the function is executed.  I hope you understand :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165719/</a></p>
