  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practical Agile</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>A long time ago we had in our heads the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating webinars on Agile.</i> <br>  My colleague, Sergey Andrzheevsky, is an experienced and well-known scrum master who participates in various conferences and round tables where he shares his experience in Agile projects - he tells a lot of ‚Äútasty‚Äù and interesting things to his listeners.  It was he who asked me to publish this article on Habr√© (he does not have his account here yet), because  We were able to launch our webinar series (the first one took place on May 27 - <a href="http://www.exigenservices.ru/webinars/27may2010">Using Offshore Agile in Exigen Services</a> , and on June 21 was the second part - Important points when switching to Agile, July 19 will be the third - <a href="http://www.exigenservices.ru/webinar-registration">Introduction to Extreme Programming (eXP) practices</a> . <br><br><h2>  The use of Agile methodologies (SCRUM, XP, etc.) is becoming increasingly popular in the IT industry.  Why is this happening?  And how does it work? </h2><br><br>  Today, flexible methodologies are best adapted to the ever-accelerating development of technology, the emergence of new development tools and the ever-changing customer requirements.  Flexibility is now of particular importance due to the general trends in the development of information systems - global mass Internet services, Web 2.0 with its concept of ‚Äúpermanent beta version‚Äù, reorientation from software products to information services (which are by definition more flexible and dynamic), the popularity of SOA architectures etc. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In the modern world, it is almost impossible to imagine a software development project that is being carried out according to traditional ‚Äúrigid‚Äù methodologies, planned for 2-3 years ahead, since no one can predict how the outside world will change (and, accordingly, project requirements, technologies used and .d.) during this time.  There is also another problem - a modern customer of an IT project rarely accurately represents what he needs.  But if money was found for a project, then usually everything should be ready ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù, and, as a rule, there is no time, effort or experience to prepare detailed specifications.  In this typical situation, the use of Agile allows you to quickly start a project, thinking out the details already in the course of its implementation. <br><br>  In addition, Agile can be used in a variety of projects - ranging from tiny student-based high-tech start-ups to serious industrial projects with a workload of tens of person-years.  It is difficult to find another approach or methodology that would have such a breadth of use. <br><br>  It is important to note that the time of individual developers has passed.  Even if some ingenious lone programmer creates and launches a wonderful program on the market, nothing will prevent competitors from organizing a team that quickly implements similar functionality, and then, using the number of developers, can develop a product faster than the original creator can do.  Effective team work on an IT project becomes vital, and it‚Äôs about the work of the team, as a single efficient body, and not about the sum of the efforts of self-employed participants.  Flexible methodologies allow to organize team work correctly. <br><br>  Summarizing, we can say that Agile is: <br><ol><li>  flexibility, adaptability, risk reduction; </li><li>  scalability, breadth of use; </li><li>  focus on effective teamwork; </li></ol><br><br><br>  <i><b>PS</b> Modern IT specialist is difficult to surprise with a high salary, people want the work to be really interesting.</i>  <i>In Agile, a programmer who adds a new functionality immediately sees it working in the application and at the customer, which significantly improves motivation, since the result of labor is visual and used.</i>  <i>Flexible methodologies because of their focus on teamwork, informal communication, a minimum of bureaucracy, and constant changes make the process of work truly exciting.</i> <br><br>  Thus, we can add the 4th item to our results: Agile is a personal motivation for the participants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95423/</a></p>
