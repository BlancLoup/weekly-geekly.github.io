  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alibaba Group's development strategy for 2016 and plans for cooperation with Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba Group</a> holding CEO announced development plans for 2016.  He <a href="http://www.alizila.com/alibaba-ceo-outlines-his-2016-expansion-strategy/">identified</a> several priority areas.  Among them - the promotion in rural areas, major cities and global expansion.  It is worth noting that the company is ready to help Russia in the development of online export of goods. <br><br><h4>  Further development in large cities </h4><br>  "We are going to strengthen and expand our position in the market, increasing our presence in major cities," Chang said at a speech in Hangzhou in front of company employees. <br><br>  According to Chang, within the framework of development in the largest cities of the PRC, Alibaba plans to increase its reputation among residents.  At present, the retailer has already managed to achieve some success in Beijing, where he focused on online sales of products and household appliances.  It is planned that the capital will be the link between Alibaba and 400 million people in northern China, where the infrastructure is less developed than in the southeastern provinces. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Strengthened engagement with rural regions </h4><br>  The company plans to invest not only in the development of the purchasing power of rural residents, but also to help Chinese agricultural producers sell it online in major cities.  Alibaba has created more than 10,000 service centers that help make purchases online and provide delivery in rural areas of more than 20 provinces.  Now Alibaba is investing in these regions to streamline the sales and logistics process. <br><br>  Chang also noted that in the coming year, the company will continue to develop <a href="http://www.retailmagazine.ru/article.php%3Fnumn%3D8768">omnichannel</a> sales, including O2O (offline for online) and increase sales development under the ‚Äúwhatever-on-demand‚Äù scheme. <br><br><h4>  World expansion </h4><br>  Last year, the main focus for the company was expansion in the global market.  For the management of this direction, the former top manager of <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> Michael Evans was specially invited.  Alibaba strengthened its presence in Europe and cross-border sales <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">on Bachelor‚Äôs Day</a> (November 11). <br><br>  In 2016, we will also work on sales channels, with the help of which foreign brands can offer their products to Chinese buyers.  The center of attention for attracting imported goods to China will be a subsidiary project of Alibaba - the company <a href="http://about.tmall.com/">Tmall Global</a> , which allows foreign sellers to sell online in China under a simplified scheme, and g.taobao.com, a niche channel within the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao">Taobao</a> marketplace, which introduces Chinese consumers to high-quality goods from - from abroad. <br><br>  In the city of Tianjin is one of the free trade zones.  In the same place, Alibaba opened a showroom where popular products are grouped by producer countries.  This is the first offline trading platform in the history of Alibaba. <br><br>  In December 2015, it became <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2015/12/16/ma/">known</a> that the founder of the largest Chinese online retailer Alibaba, Jack Ma, supported the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin to create an Internet platform for the export of Russian goods. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that it is necessary to help small and medium-sized enterprises to develop their activities.  Therefore, I believe that the initiative of Vladimir Putin to create private Internet sites will increase the export of Russian industrial goods, ‚ÄùMa said. <br><br>  According to him, this will give Russia and Alibaba opportunities for joint development.  He expressed the hope that Alibaba will be able to actively participate in the development of the Russian infrastructure for e-commerce, as well as take part in creating an e-commerce platform in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297894/</a></p>
