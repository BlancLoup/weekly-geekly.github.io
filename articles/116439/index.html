  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP and Intel refute Oracle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/oracle/116075/">it became known last week</a> , Oracle announced that it would not develop new versions of its software for the Intel Itanium platform.  Oracle‚Äôs brief statement said that it became clear from conversations with unnamed Intel executives that <i>Itanium was nearing the end of its life</i> cycle.  Oracle also points out that Microsoft and Red Hat had previously refused to support Itanium, and HP executive director Leo Apotheker did not mention Itanium in his long and detailed presentation of HP‚Äôs future development strategy. <br><br>  Here I must say that today more than 140 thousand customers worldwide have chosen the HP hardware platform to support Oracle applications.  This was the result of over 30 years of working together with HP and Oracle in a close alliance. <br><br>  Therefore, the reaction from HP and Intel was swift: on March 22, the very next day, President and Chief Executive Officer of Intel Corporation Paul Otellini denied this statement by Oracle.  According to him, Intel continues to actively develop processors and Itanium platform, and is now developing several next generations of these processors.

      For its part, HP confirmed that it ‚Äúwill continue to develop Intel Itanium-based Integrity server platforms with the HP-UX operating system as part of its strategic development plan for more than ten years and <a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/110323c.html">will continue to provide support to customers using current versions of Oracle applications for HP servers Itanium-based Integrity (both current and next generations)</a> . ‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Last year, a new generation of quad-core Itanium (Tukwilla) was released.  Intel has officially confirmed that it is preparing to release at least two more generations of Itanium - the eight-core Poulson (it will be manufactured using 32 nm technology, and mass shipments will begin in early 2012) and the next Kittson.  Intel usually updates Itanium every three years, so given the release last year of Tukwilla, we can assume that Kittson will be released in about 2014-15.  Thus, at least until the end of this decade, Intel will continue to release new generations of Itanium.  It only remains to assume that unnamed Oracle representatives misunderstood unnamed Intel executives. <br><br>  Two other arguments to Oracle are also not tenable.  Yes, Microsoft and Red Hat refused to release new versions of Windows and Linux for Itanium.  But because these operating systems are extremely rarely used on Itanium servers and Oracle‚Äôs assertion that it only follows the example of these two companies incorrectly - now many HP-UX customers use HP Integrity servers and applications. <br><br>  The presentation by Leo Apotheker, referenced by Oracle, was devoted to HP's overall development strategy, rather than to the company's specific product lines.  For example, it did not mention not only Integrity, but also ProLiant and StorageWorks storage systems (of course, this does not mean that these products are approaching the end of the life cycle). <br><br>  It is also worth noting that after Oracle completed the purchase of Sun Microsystems in early 2010, the decline in sales of SPARC servers not only did not stop, but continued at an accelerated pace due to the fact that Oracle over the past two years has not presented its release plans. new generations of SPARC processors.  The fears of former Sun customers for the future of this server platform have only intensified, and many of them are switching to servers from other vendors. <br><br>  According to IDC, amid an average server market growth of 11.4% in 2010, sales of Oracle servers fell by 14%.  As stated in a press release from HP, ‚ÄúOracle‚Äôs latest disinformation message is a desperate attempt to get consumers to buy Sun server hardware to somehow slow down the decline in its market share.‚Äù <br><br>  Follow the latest developments in our blog! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116439/</a></p>
