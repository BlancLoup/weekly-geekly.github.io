From the first primitive illumination tricks and fake daggers in silent movies, to whole worlds and incredibly realistic creatures that never existed.  Now practically ALL films with a decent budget to some extent use virtual scenery. <br><br>  What is primary in the movie - the plot or the game of actors?  Special effects or the skill of the production operator?  Of course, all of these components are extremely important.  But, nevertheless, some films became famous precisely because of the special effects used.  And let today some of them look ordinary, and some naive, at one time they became milestones in cinema.  Of course, in general there were many such films.  But few people can boast of special effects, solely due to which it became possible to tell the conceived story.  These special effects that not only caused the wow effect, but really took over the soul.  Which forced to empathize to the protagonist, to like situations in which it appeared.  Let's recall some of these iconic films. <a name="habracut"></a>

The director managed to perfectly convey the atmosphere of the city of the future, and without complicated technical tricks was not done.  Here, the Sch√ºfftan Process (Sch√ºfftan Process) was first used, named after the inventor <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D1%258E%25D1%2584%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Eugene Sch√ºfftan</a> .  Its essence lies in the formation of a combined image with the help of a system of mirrors, which made it possible to create nonexistent landscapes and organically integrate the actors in them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/585/896/607/585896607b5d220d2c5139098245e2cb.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/84a/cd1/88384acd1c2749f075e90c0d9776af2e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fd/1ca/4e0/7fd1ca4e0407ef58a60ca640aace95c0.jpg"><br><br>  At that time, Metropolis was the most complex and expensive film created in Germany.  He also became a challenge to Hollywood.  However, the cost of production so much exceeded the budget that the studios of Universum Film AG had to go into debt to the Hollywood corporation Gunning.  As a result, Americans began to massively use the Schufftana process, until other technologies replaced it in the 1950s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a6/e59/ded/4a6e59ded99e0899dd9473c028b62d16.jpg"><br><br>  But even at a later time, the Schufftana process was regularly used in cinema. <br><br>  <i>The Taking of Power by Louis XIV (1966): Versailles construction site.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bc/346/55f/9bc34655f6857b699196b15ae2692260.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Socrates (1971): Athenian Acropolis.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/662/b69/7ca/662b697cac7a858c0a086ada99b8da62.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The Age of The Medici (1973): Florence of the 15th century.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/549/c5d/a05/549c5da05a67aa0d13cd234be216b502.jpg"><br><br>  Some scenes from The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King were shot using this technology.  It is difficult to say why Peter Jackson used the Schuffton effect, being armed with powerful modern technologies.  It was probably a peculiar expression of appreciation and respect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afe/0eb/4a8/afe0eb4a8bf6cf1373dd9373d4ce8d56.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/08c/5f6/05208c5f6b547576a41a710ca0e051a8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Forbidden Planet (1956) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb3/be5/873/eb3be5873f6c4ced9c3b4cef716443fb.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYFr3UyVpRA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiH55NXA2NoKyfZpDIQBJDNtYQnuQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The screenplay retells Shakespeare's play The Tempest, but the action is transferred to another planet.  Here you and spaceships, and unprecedented landscapes, and a mysterious monster, generated by the mind of one of the last representatives of an extinct people.  This film became a classic of the 1950s American cinema fiction. <br><br>  Luxurious for that time special effects were applied in the Forbidden Planet, thanks to which they depicted views of the planet Altair IV with two luminaries and a green sky;  underground cities of steel and porcelain created by an extinct race;  scenes of battles with the monster and the flying spacecraft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/001/b1a/22e/001b1a22efe9ffe908b7c0fc1e805542.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7b/0d6/739/a7b0d6739393479c1514f152f328de95.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/703/a43/8b3/703a438b362f7cec126db697f78a8b29.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e1/4bf/a0f/5e14bfa0fa4875cc4fed6d60b4d06bd9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bab/b4a/cbb/babb4acbbdd4612cc95568d639107148.jpg"><br><br>  To create many of the scenery used technique <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%258D%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D1%258D%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">matte painting</a> , which was the predecessor of the blue screens for analog photography and green - for digital.

A long, stormy story would bury any other movie, except this one.  Stanley Kubrick managed to create an incredible feeling of a close, almost come, but still future.  All the details of the scenes work on this, including the fonts of any inscriptions and interfaces.  The most amazing thing is that after almost half a century the space stations and ships depicted do not look naive.  And after watching, you‚Äôll understand where the Star Wars designers got their inspiration from.  True, we are talking about the exterior;  the interiors were still created in the spirit of the fiction of the 1960s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5da/302/1ce/5da3021ce81a44b7276c7adcc85964d9.jpg"><br><br>  Each scene, each frame was built with incredible accuracy and attention.  For shooting the film used the most complex and expensive special effects.  It was 1968, the computers were in their infancy, and all effects were analog.  In this case, the creators managed to achieve incredible realism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c11/97c/f6c/c1197cf6c723fbf4c18279a2c1ec80da.jpg"><br><br>  Aypad 1968: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75c/857/4a0/75c8574a0f70f23a6453a557bf0fb36a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e13/3d0/837/e133d0837cc830fe398516f0498773d3.jpg"><br><br>  The technology used to shoot the first part of the film is the Schufft process: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/018/2b1/00c/0182b100c08986c8ec2d01fd0b8f5eda.jpg"><br><br>  But this scene: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/juIMtNw_U_o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7wLAZb3dEbSM9Bse5ymDJJyznRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  was shot using slit-scan technique: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSesvu_uqLo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGNiH8_zqFCa9STqTWlC-jn1D9uA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For filming inside the annular module, a huge rotating drum was built on the spacecraft: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/254/3e3/f1f2543e3a6bae5b60eb6389f3d942a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e4/b77/786/6e4b77786e03dd9dc7ed830987b26a31.jpg"><br><br>  But not all the scenes were shot on such a scale.

A film that makes you feel the horror of loneliness and helplessness with the main character, hold your breath during depressurization, strain your muscles while trying to avoid a collision and reach the hatch - such a film deserves all its Oscars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/006/5d0/c81/0065d0c8160b59a38a97c57fea8652f8.jpg"><br><br>  This is one of the latest films, whose special effects work not just on a beautiful picture, but primarily on the tension that does not let go until the very end, the struggle for life with a female astronaut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0b/9e3/07f/a0b9e307fde4f621c8dadb01ba169bd8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a9/f96/180/4a9f9618047f99b11ea10af0da84a5ff.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/493/9ee/0a7/4939ee0a768957f6bbfaeb3a996e61dc.jpg"><br><br>  For 5 months, Sandra Bullock trained to move like a person in zero gravity. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2U8juidXC8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhGhWWQf9MAPL0m9ZXsna2OAjjAUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lftCWqwr7xo&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjSci2Ftbl3VtzNVtelMjR1mByjCQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I am sure that you will not agree with not every choice, you will not find something in this list.
