      <a href="http://www.brandz.ru/">www.brandz.ru</a> <br><br><br>  Brandz.ru is a recommendation network in which users evaluate and recommend brands and products to each other.  In addition, there is the possibility of forming wishlist and post ads.  Attention is drawn to an interesting marketing strategy.  The network promotes itself through Vkontakte applications.  In this way, many startups are moving in the west.  We have this rather rare phenomenon.  In addition, the site is now a promotion in which you can win an Acer laptop and iPod nano. <br><br><br>  <strong>Vlad Vishnyakov (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe idea came to Andrei Balashov a year and a half ago: he drew attention to the fact that people are often very loyal to certain brands and things: they like to advise, argue, boast, etc.</em>  <em>Then there were many different thoughts: for example, that when choosing a product it would be good to have the opportunity to consult with those who already used or used it.</em>  <em>Then we thought that a platform on the Internet would be ideally suited for these purposes, where users can leave their opinions about brands.</em>  <em>This information is relevant for both other users and manufacturers: they can use the service as a feedback tool with their customers. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  9th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.rateyou.ru/"><img title="rateyou.ru - dating service in the best traditions of the Highlander" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/c82/f48/e7bc82f489951abe0668d5c23447426a.jpg" width="182" height="89"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rateyou.ru/">www.rateyou.ru</a> <br><br><br>  Rateyou is preaching an interesting approach to dating.  You see in front of you two photos of girls (well, or young people) in a rather large size, not a preview.  And you have to choose the prettiest of them, so that everything is like in the Highlander, and only one remains.  After you have made your choice, you are shown a new pair, and so on to infinity.  Following the results of these ‚Äúbattles‚Äù, the girls are very harmoniously lining up in the rating of attractiveness.  The project is an analogue of the western project <a href="http://www.babevsbabe.com/">www.babevsbabe.com</a> . <br><br><br>  <strong>Developers:</strong> <em>‚ÄúOur technology for assessing attractiveness is much more convenient than asterisks.</em>  <em>You do not need to remember how many stars you put last time, of course, that the rating given by stars depends on your mood, and it‚Äôs difficult to evaluate a photo on a five-point scale.</em>  <em>Very convenient, in front of you are only two large photos, and not small pictures, which also need to click to go to view and vote "</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  8th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.moirodnye.ru/"><img title="moirodnie - social network for relatives" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/455/de8/4df/455de84dff3ec5fc6290e6ff4c159de0.jpg" width="256" height="41"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.moirodnye.ru/">www.moirodnye.ru</a> <br><br><br>  ‚ÄúMy relatives‚Äù is not the first social network for relatives in runet.  Now, from the possibilities on the site, it is already possible to compile one‚Äôs own family tree, a calendar of family dates, and a family tape, in which you can save the family history.  Curiously, the initial version of the project was created in just two weeks. <br><br><br>  <strong>Mikhail Tsyganov (Project Manager):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe high-quality service that allows you to realize communication between relatives has great potential.</em>  <em>After all, relatives, near and far, we have not much less than classmates, and regularly occurring reasons for communication - more.</em>  <em>We have tried to make our service a homely and cozy, without the usual programming difficulties inherent in many Internet services. "</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  7th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.ratia.ru/"><img title="ratia.ru - service recommendations of banks and offers" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/375/796/1ba/3757961baed4905bedbe15a145d84f96.jpg" width="158" height="57"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ratia.ru/">www.ratia.ru</a> <br><br><br>  Ratia.ru is a financial aggregator, using the tools of which the user can find a suitable bank and offer.  Banks on the site have a karma that reflects financial reliability and is taken from reputable sources, as well as a customer service rating, which is regulated by the users themselves. <br><br><br>  <strong>Oleg Kozyrev (Project Manager):</strong> <em>‚ÄúRatia.ru is aimed at finding relevant offers from banks that are most beneficial to users.</em>  <em>Simply put, Ratia.ru is Google for searching for offers from banks.</em>  <em>We consider our target audience to be people who want to find relevant financial proposals that meet their needs. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  6th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.openavatar.ru/"><img title="openavatar - Open Avatar Service" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ab/153/31a/8ab15331ab732f33811bd7fbfaa2d555.jpg" width="350" height="65"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.openavatar.ru/">www.openavatar.ru</a> <br><br><br>  Openavatar is a service that allows you to use your favorite avatar in any blog that has the appropriate plugin installed.  All you need to do is enter the nickname that you use on popular services, such as Habra, Ya.ru, or LiveJournal, and the system will copy your avatar from there and use it in all blogs where you will leave comments. <br><br><br>  <strong>Dmitry Baibekov (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúIf a commentator has an avatar on Gravatar.com, OpenAvatar.ru will receive an avatar from it too.</em>  <em>There is a plugin for WordPress.</em>  <em>If you used a gravatar plugin, simply deactivate it and activate the OpenAvatar plugin. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  5th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.juick.com/"><img title="juick.com - Twitter Tweet Microblogging" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab8/775/a3b/ab8775a3b66e6cb870796d538f179709.jpg" width="157" height="41"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.juick.com/">www.juick.com</a> <br><br><br>  Juick - This is a microblogging service.  Have you ever thought that Twitter is an ascetic microblogging?  Against the background of Tumblr, it may be so, but against the background of Juick, he seems to be an overloaded and slow-moving giant.  There is nothing superfluous in it.  There is no additional functionality.  It does not even need to register.  Just add his contact to jaber and write messages there, and they will be entered into your microblog. <br><br><br>  <strong>Anton Uhnich (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe main advantage over Twitter is the convenient and clear answers from other users to your posts.</em>  <em>But the main trump cards while in the sleeve.</em>  <em>Service is improving and refined every day.</em>  <em>Now I devote to this project all the time, so you can call it work.</em>  <em>As for income, this is in the plans for the near future.</em>  <em>There will be one "trick" that is not, for example, on Twitter.</em>  <em>It should be profitable.</em>  <em>This is a non-advertising earnings model. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  4th place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.feedme.ru/"><img title="feedme - Service recommendations of materials of interest to you." src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f6/03b/c26/9f603bc263fe9d6b979e7c2d4eaf5f84.jpg" width="235" height="58"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.feedme.ru/">www.feedme.ru</a> <br><br><br>  Feedme is a social recommendation service.  In essence, this is a plugin for Firefox that analyzes the sites you visit, finds people who visit similar sites and, based on this, gives you recommendations in the form of links to materials that you will probably find interesting to read.  The service respects anonymity and no one can see which pages you went to. <br><br><br>  <strong>Alexander Gagin (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúIt is clear that this is somewhat similar to StumbleUpon and other social recommendations systems - but we are doing a zero-effort system: the user should not do anything except install the plug-in.</em>  <em>I will still receive recommendations.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Although if he wants to configure the system more precisely, he can recommend urls and filter secret urls and clean the history already sent to the server. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  3rd place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.realitygirl.ru/"><img title="realitygirl - Reality shows on the Internet" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/227/d7f/7c2/227d7f7c2cebee0ca30abdb3245cfd5f.jpg" width="202" height="71"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.realitygirl.ru/">www.realitygirl.ru</a> <br><br><br>  RealityGirl - Reality show on the Internet.  The trend that has become popular in the west about a year ago has now come to us.  Entertainment programs on television in a crisis will shrink and change, this is already happening, which means that an increasing number of people will seek relaxation in the network, and from this point of view the project is very timely.  The bottom line is that the provincial comes to Moscow and receives $ 100k for self-realization.  Leading the show - Otar Kushanashvili and Alena Vodonaeva. <br><br><br>  <strong>Otar Kushanashvilli (Presenter):</strong> <em>‚ÄúJust a brilliant idea!</em>  <em>Since the days of ‚ÄúCarnival‚Äù and ‚ÄúMoscow doesn‚Äôt believe in tears,‚Äù the question ‚ÄúIs it easy to conquer Moscow?‚Äù Remains one of the most pressing.</em>  <em>Many have succeeded, many do not, but everyone is talking about one thing - I would have had money to start ... I am glad that the talented guys had the idea to conduct this, I‚Äôm not afraid to say, social and psychological experiment.</em>  <em>After all, what could be more interesting than observing human metamorphosis? ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  2nd place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.minution.com/"><img title="minution - Fall Auction" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dd/108/215/3dd1082153d4c18ef5a19f21170c3f20.jpg" width="223" height="113"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.minution.com/">www.minution.com</a> <br><br><br>  The project, the design of which was made by Lebedev's studio, plays on the basest human feelings - freebie, excitement, easy money.  Minution is a fall auction.  You must make a minimum unique bid to receive the lot.  If your bid is duplicated by someone else, it is no longer unique.  Therefore, you need to think about what number except for you no one will call, and at the same time, that it was minimal.  You can only see your bets.  Such valuable prizes as the Mazda car or the Sony TV are already being played. <br><br><br>  <strong>Pavel Bogachchi (Project Manager):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe essence of the project is to provide each participant with the opportunity to buy goods that, other things being equal, he could not afford, and do it easily, playfully, spending a symbolic amount of money.</em>  <em>Similar projects successfully work on the Internet.</em>  <em>Our goal is to be the FIRST! ‚Äù</em> <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  1 place </h3><br> <a href="http://www.bfm.ru/"><img title="bfm - Crisis Navigator" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06f/857/997/06f85799701f94a0774e3acf0573aad9.jpg"></a> <a href="http://www.dailyonline.ru/"><img title="daylionline - economic and analytical resource" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc8/7d7/704/fc87d770485a3bacd00280c9c8fa1018.jpg" width="328" height="63"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bfm.ru/">www.bfm.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dailyonline.ru/">www.dailyonline.ru</a> <br><br><br>  In the first place, I put two of the most topical and high-profile projects of the month - the crisis navigator from Anton Nosik, and business information in a new way from Raf Shakirov.  Despite the similar topics, the projects are quite diverse, and it seemed to me that BFM started much more successfully, but I didn‚Äôt decide to arrange them in places. <br><br><br>  <strong>Anton Nosik:</strong> <em>‚ÄúOur site is not the first resource of economic topics, and far from being the only one in RUNET.</em>  <em>We have great respect for all our colleagues, and absolutely do not want our appearance on the market to lead to an outflow of their readers or advertising budgets.</em>  <em>We just think that there will be enough space under the virtual sun for everyone: on RBC, on Tikr.Ru, on Kommersant with Vedomosti, on Finam with Finmarket, and on Prime-TASS with RIA Novosti, and on K2Kapital, and even, God forgive me, the business newspaper Vzglyad, which is read in our office by the most beautiful secretary.</em>  <em>We are not going to fight with them, but we want to be quite different from all of them "</em> <br><br><br>  <strong>Raf Shakirov:</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe basis of the resource is business information, but we want to submit it in a new way.</em>  <em>Our media are accustomed to working on a Western pattern.</em>  <em>How do we write about the crisis?</em>  <em>For example, talk about the collapse of the tractor factory.</em>  <em>And who cares?</em>  <em>It is in the West that everyone has stocks and everyone is interested in what is happening to them.</em>  <em>And we have a different situation on the market.</em>  <em>How to build your life during a crisis, how to cut spending, what is now profitable to buy when cars become cheaper, when real estate prices fall, what will happen to the ruble - that‚Äôs what interests readers.</em>  <em>Then comes the second stage - to explain why this is happening.</em>  <em>The third is what is happening in the world in the meantime.</em>  <em>It's interesting even for an office worker. ‚Äù</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45465/</a></p>
