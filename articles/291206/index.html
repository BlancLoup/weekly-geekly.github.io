Approximately such thoughts were spinning smart in the minds of DataArt four years ago, when we started the DataArt.EDU training initiative, which is still called so. <br><br>  The impetus was the desire of colleagues to join the industry lines in the company, to change projects and technologies.  In DataArt there is a great opportunity for the restless to choose what and on what to work, to delve into the industry.  As an answer to the question of where to get the necessary knowledge for the start, our DataArt.EDU was created.

      Today DataArt.  EDU is a branched structure, which includes several areas at once: from corporate English, seminars, PM courses to self-study courses.  They did not immediately begin to take into account how much we study, but even the hours already recorded are more than 240 thousand! <br><br>  Below for an example - some programs included in DataArt.  Edu <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Industry programs </h3><br>  It is not a secret that there is a ‚Äúceiling‚Äù concept that many blue-collar developers encounter - there is no new volume in their field, which is necessary and important to learn, while the habit of learning remains.  Managerial or administrative career is not interesting.  It is for such people that they have the opportunity to master industry knowledge, which then allows them to lead and work on more cunning projects, be it a complex project in the field of finance or an online travel system. <br><br>  DataArt.  The EDU has hired experts to develop industry knowledge programs.  And those who wish have the opportunity, after listening to a course of lectures, having familiarized themselves with selected literature, after consulting with colleagues, to go through high entry barriers during interviews with business customers in a particular industry. <br><br><h3>  Courses for self-study </h3><br>  Do not embrace all these new technologies, conferences, news, trends, do not keep up with the whole mass of information flow.  So there were courses for self-study.  Most often this is a set of theories, practical tasks, consultations of the course mentor, the final task and its verification.  Now in the library of their courses - more than 60. Colleagues get the opportunity to quickly respond to the demand within the company, get new opportunities.  If you want to become a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãor a pimper, please.  I wanted the dynamics of mobile projects - go through the course and get the appropriate qualifications.  Tired of the hustle and bustle of mobile projects and pulled back into the power-saving platform - pass the course, qualify, and get on the radar of resource managers with an additional skill. <br><br>  Here are the reviews of colleagues: <br><br>  <strong>Nikolai Rusenko</strong> : ‚ÄúThe course, more precisely, the courses that I managed to take, really helped.  First of all, he completed a course on QTP, Test Complete, then on Selenium.  As a result, I received basic knowledge in the field of automation, understood the basis, the main essence, the idea. <br><br>  I wanted to move on, and I completed the course on Selenium RC + .NET.  Then there was an opportunity to get into a very interesting project, but I lacked skills: I needed knowledge of Java and, in particular, Selenium RC + Java.  I reoriented, passing along the same course in Java.  Everything turned out the best way, I managed to get into the project.  He worked for a short time in this project, but it was already a real experience, which is valuable.  After such an experience, I was able to get into the project using Coded UI tests, where I helped with Selenium + Python.  And after this project I got into the Selenium WebDriver + .NET project, where I still work.  Of course, the courses contributed to my development, allowed me to learn a lot of new things and put knowledge into practice ‚Äù. <br>  <strong>Evgenia Gataullina</strong> : ‚ÄúAfter the internship program, I was invited to take courses.  We were very quickly taught, it is impossible not to note the role of the curator.  The courses help a lot: I didn‚Äôt do any automated or manual testing before them, and then we almost from scratch wrote a small Pythone framework together. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Seminars </h3><br>  How to go straight to all conferences, go to all meetings of all technological communities, and also share something of your own, when you have something to say?  No chance.  But we already have a lot in DataArt, constantly someone somewhere hears something, participates in something, studies something.  According to the results and impressions of various events, the colleagues who visited them prepare seminars that are broadcast to all offices, you can connect and listen from the spot, and then, when there is time, listen and look at the recordings, search for what was on the topic in corporate library workshops.  In the summer, the traditional calm of the seminar life, but in the usual time a week or two or three seminars. <br><br><h3>  Lexicon </h3><br>  In what language to speak within the company, if we are in different offices, in different fields of knowledge, how to discuss projects and people management?  To better understand each other, we had a similar context in corporate discussions, we conducted a series of simulated seminars on Adisis video lectures, and now anyone can view lectures in the corporate library.  The problem or opportunity, the types of managerial styles, the life cycle of the company and much more.  Now inside DataArt there is a common context, and we are able to discuss corporate and project issues in the same language. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291206/</a></p>
