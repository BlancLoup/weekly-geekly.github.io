  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High Start: where will Polybius Bank take the starting user base</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When we present Polybius Bank to potential partners, advisors and investors, we are often told something like, ‚ÄúA very interesting idea, but what do you have for starting, other than your idea and team?‚Äù Honestly, this is one of our favorite questions , because at this very moment we get the opportunity <s>to get out of wide leg</s> and put our main argument on the table: how about a half million user base?  At this moment, the atmosphere in the room changes approximately as follows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fd7/df4/52b/fd7df452be7b45d48a9aab54bbfb12e5.jpg"></div><br>  <i>At first I was just curious, now you deserve my attention</i> <br><br>  As we have already told you, the Polybius project has Swiss and Estonian roots.  "By mom" he inherits the genes of the legendary Swiss banks, by dad - technical expertise, experience and customer base of the company HashCoins, in particular - cloud mining HashFlare, in the blog of which you read this post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In just two years, since its launch in April 2015, we have accumulated a client base of more than half a million users.  What kind of people are these?  These are advanced users who are ready to invest in the growing cryptocurrency market.  Ideal for starting the first cryptobank for everyone, isn't it?  The argument that we already have a loyal user base of 500 thousand people, many of whom are ready to participate in the ICO and become the first customers of the Polybius Bank, has already opened many doors for us.

    <blockquote>  ICO - Initial Coin Offering, cryptocurrency analogue of IPO (placement of shares).  This is a crowdfunding campaign using cryptocurrency, usually organized by crypto-start or blockchain projects.  ICO "Polybius" starts until the end of spring 2017 and will last five weeks.  The goal of the campaign is to collect from $ 1.5 million to $ 25 million to launch a bank and additional projects listed in the Polybius roadmap.  ICO participants will be able to buy investment tokens for cryptocurrency or ordinary money, guaranteeing them annual deductions of a share in the profits of Polybius Bank. </blockquote><br>  All great undertakings occurred when great ideas met the necessary resources.  The user base of more than half a million paying users who are already interested in investing in a cryptobusiness gives us a huge head start for the realization of our wildest plans. <br><br>  Polybius is the common name for the ecosystem that links the Digital Pass Remote Identification service, storing secure personal information and financial services through Polybius Bank. <br><br>  Digital Pass will become a universal pan-European analogue of eID, with a greater set of functions and more versatile than existing electronic identity cards.  For example, in the EU countries there is still no single base on the state of people's health, therefore, according to a prescription prescribed by a doctor in one country, you cannot buy medicines in another.  There is no educational database that digitally records the courses that have been taken, so paper documents are often required to continue studying in a new place. <br><br>  These and other problems will be solved by the Digital Pass, developed by the Polybius Foundation, whose users will receive a universal digital repository of personal data on the blockchain, recognized by states and commercial organizations along with the classic ID.  For example, when providing emergency medical care in another country, the doctor will be available, with the permission of the patient, his full history and information about the state of insurance without unnecessary procedures and receiving letters of guarantee from the insurance company.  The Digital Pass user will decide who and what data to provide, and the level of protection of the repository excludes any access to information without the permission of its owner. <br><br>  Digital Pass will be launched by Polybius Bank, a payment institution under the auspices of the Polybius Foundation.  In those countries of Europe where there is no own eID, Polybius, as a banking organization, will be able to issue its eID, officially recognized by all other EU countries according to the eIDAS directive on July 23, 2014. <br><br>  We begin our journey with a payment service that allows you to conveniently and securely pay for purchases on the Internet without third-party applications and unnecessary data entries, when the phone contains all the tools 100% user identification: fingerprint, voice recognition, face recognition through the camera.  We create a kind of ‚Äúfinancial Google‚Äù, which will not only simplify and cheapen the management of the user's finances, but will also become an integral part of various aspects of his life.  At the same time leaving the user maximum control over his data. <br><br>  The Polybius ICO-based crowdfunding campaign starts this spring and is aimed at collecting fees above $ 25 million. Anyone who takes part in the campaign will be one of the first to get a bank account and the first in line for a digital identity Digital Pass.  After launching the project, everyone can join it. <br><br>  ICO starts this spring.  The exact date will be announced soon.
