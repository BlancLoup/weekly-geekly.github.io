  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professor Massachusetts Institute of Technology presented the future of prosthetics at the TED conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interest in the development of assistive devices, and in particular to the technologies on which they are based, has long gone beyond a single industry.  Applied solutions here, based on the latest achievements of science, can excite the minds of any inquisitive person.  And often it is the desire to solve the technological problem in the rehabilitation industry pushes science to the next step in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-v/yo/i9/-vyoi9pdga9q054u8hnn51wfsc0.png"><br><br>  Such a step was made by experts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT Media Lab), opening a new page in the field of bionic prosthetics.  American researchers were able to achieve biofeedback from an artificial part of the body, creating technology that allows a person to feel the prosthesis as a lost limb.

      The biophysicist, Professor MIT, Hugh Miller Herr, a well-known American developer and user of bionic lower limb prostheses, told this to the general public.  Previously, he spoke at the TED (technology, entertainment, design) conference, where he announced the achievements of his colleagues working on the NeuroEmbodied Design project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Hugh Guerra, modern bionic prostheses, for all their adaptability, are deprived of direct dynamic interaction with the muscles and feedback from the biological part of the body.  This means that the user does not feel the prosthesis as his body, does not feel it, which reduces the quality of use and the effect of rehabilitation. <br><br>  To solve this problem, the Hugh Guerra team developed an <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/surgical-technique-improves-sensation-control-prosthetic-limb-0530">agonistic-antagonistic myonevral interface</a> (AMI), which connects the nerves in the rest of the limb with an external bionic prosthesis and allows you to feel it as a full body part.  This is the feeling of unity with its means of rehabilitation - the border that turns a person into a cyborg, the professor is sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/ch/ec/dkchec5g2ivlc0drahbkvphxebu.gif"><br><br>  During his speech at TED, Hugh Gerr presented the first person in the world who had a bionic prosthesis installed using the new AMI interface and showed the result on video.  The cyborg's mechanical ‚Äúleg‚Äù reacted to ground irregularities and foreign objects.  She made it easy to climb and climb stairs and even go climbing.  But the main thing - the man felt it, felt like his lost limb.  According to the world's first cyborg, he perceives a bionic prosthesis on the basis of AMI not as a means of rehabilitation, but as part of himself, as a newly found limb. <br><br>  In itself, the achievement of the project <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2018/surgical-technique-improves-sensation-control-prosthetic-limb-0530">NeuroEmbodied Design</a> is a breakthrough in the rehabilitation of people who have lost limbs.  Hugh Herr is confident that the solutions and technologies involved by his team will make it possible to put an end to the disability associated with limb amputation by the end of the 21st century. <br><br>  In the future, the ability to connect nerve tissues with artificial mechanisms will allow a person not only to replace lost limbs, but also to modernize a completely healthy body, complement it with non-human parts.  For example, the wings that the cyborg will feel like their own innate limbs and will be able to control them with no less efficiency. <br><br>  Technology NeuroEmbodied Design - is the future of biophysics and the future of man, I'm sure Hugh Herr. <br><br>  TED, known for its annual conferences and popularization of technologies, has focused on the rehabilitation industry as an industry that can not only help people with disabilities, but also move all of humanity forward, developing physics, bionics and other sciences, complement our bodies and create cyborg.  So the world is interested in it. <br><br>  The TED Conference is held annually in the USA.  Within its walls, people with unique and promising ideas can give a public TED Talk lecture to bring their thoughts to the whole world.  Video recordings of all speeches are published on the official website of the event and are available for free viewing and downloading. <br><br>  In other countries, including Russia, their own events are held under the TED brand, as part of the TEDx project under license from the Americans.  It is hoped that domestic developers of the means of rehabilitation will more often talk about their achievements at such sites. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hugh_herr_how_we_ll_become_cyborgs_and_extend_human_potential">Lecture by Professor Hugh Guerra How to become a cyborgs and extend human potential at TED 2018</a> .
