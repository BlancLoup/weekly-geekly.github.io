The mobile device received an increased Full HD Super AMOLED display with a diagonal of 5.7 inches, while it became thinner (8.3 mm) and dropped some weight (up to 168 g).  The battery capacity has increased to 3200 mAh.  Amateur photographers will appreciate the 13-megapixel camera with smart stabilizer and a powerful CRI LED flash on board.  The amount of operating memory is unprecedented for mobile devices - 3 GB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4c/545/514/f4c5455141b90a70a5eebf2653e0555a.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d19/adf/603/d19adf603fb7ac9c8c257f211e04aa14.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The novelty, which has expanded the line of technology with a proprietary design of Samsung GALAXY, is equipped with a housing with an already traditional textured back cover.  The textured pattern on the side panel of the device reminds of the company's classic notebooks.  Samsung GALAXY Note 3 will be available in two colors - black and white.  After the start of sales will be available to a variety of accessories for the gadget: dozens of interchangeable back panels and covers, covers of different shades. <br><br>  Improved electronic pen S Pen, which is included with the smartphone, is designed to further simplify the usual method of handwriting information and cope with a large number of tasks with one click.  When you press the S Pen button and hover on the display, the Context Commands menu appears with five useful features.  Thanks to this, there is no need to switch between screens, memorize commands or search for information in several menus. <br><br>  Context Commands provides access to the following functions: <br><ul><li>  <b>The function "Active Notes"</b> allows you to automatically convert handwritten text into a printed in the desired format using a handwritten command, make calls, add contacts, find the address on the map or information online, compile a task list and much more. </li><li>  <b>The Album of Fragments feature</b> will help you collect and organize data from many different sources, including websites, YouTube videos and image galleries, in one place.  The user can save a large amount of data and return to working with them after some time, while gaining access not only to information, but also to links to all sources. </li><li>  <b>The "Instant Comments"</b> feature allows you to take a snapshot of the page open on the screen and leave comments directly on the image. </li><li>  <b>The S Finder</b> feature provides access to advanced content search on a device, regardless of its type.  Using keywords and filters, for example, dates, location and file type, you can quickly find documents, events, discussion history, which will be collected in one place.  In addition, the smartphone supports searching for handwriting data, symbols and formulas. </li><li>  <b>The window-in-window</b> feature expands the capabilities of the digital pen.  Thanks to this feature, S Pen can be used not only for drawings and recordings, but also for working with several windows in multitasking mode.  It is enough to draw a window of any size on the smartphone screen to automatically open one of the applications in it, for example, YouTube, a calculator or a web browser, without interrupting work with already running programs. </li></ul><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6c/dbe/458/d6cdbe458552e1bb50a18f2334ff4f1c.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f90/dcc/598/f90dcc5985be7b782ba272b620427dfe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Other advantages of the software GALAXY Note 3:</b> <br><br>  The updated <b>S Note</b> service makes it easy to add, edit and view entries using a convenient interface and the ‚ÄúSimple Chat‚Äù function.  Also, the application can be synchronized with Evernote or a Samsung account to access information from multiple devices.  In addition, if the user wants to copy only a part of the image from a web page or from content already stored on the device, the new Quick Copy Fragment feature will help you easily select the desired section and save only the desired fragment of the image. <br><br>  The new <b>‚ÄúTwo active windows‚Äù</b> function will allow you to easily switch between different applications without having to close / open a new window each time, which significantly improves the efficiency and productivity of work.  Users can also launch the application simultaneously in two windows, for example, read news and search for information in the Internet browser or read and send messages to ChatON. <br><br>  Working in the <b>‚ÄúQuick Copy‚Äù</b> mode will help you easily drag and drop content, for example, a part of text or an image, from one window to another. <br><br>  Developed in collaboration with Flipboard <b>, My Journal</b> provides access to personalized news, social networks and entertainment in a stylish magazine design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/038/a52/7d8/038a527d80282d3e777b41da10e348d6.jpg"><br><br>  Also, users have become available update service <b>Group Play</b> , first introduced with the model Samsung GALAXY S4.  With it, you can listen to your favorite music or play games with friends, collectively work on documents and share a variety of content with a large number of users.  The application can also combine a group of up to five devices to create one ‚Äúbig screen‚Äù. <br><br>  For the first time, an effective new solution for protecting personal and corporate data called <b>Samsung KNOX</b> will be available to the average user.  Thanks to him, you can work with applications inside a special container that will reliably protect all important personal information from malware and phishing at the system level.  Even if the user loses the smartphone, data protection will be almost impossible to crack.  You can use the container to store personal images or video without worrying about possible hacking.  In addition, users can store corporate applications and data, such as emails, contacts, and calendars in Samsung KNOX, and the IT service will work with the storage through the EAS server (Exchange ActiveSync Server). <br><br>  The new smartphone also got a service <b>"Search Phone"</b> , which will allow you to find or block the device when it is lost or stolen.  Thanks to an improved user authentication function, an attacker will not be able to return to the factory settings of the equipment, and the owner of the smartphone will be able to remotely control or delete data from the device. <br><br>  Samsung GALAXY Note 3 with 32 GB of memory and an additional slot for microSD memory cards will go on sale on September 25 in more than 140 countries around the world. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/245/b65/9d9/245b659d9eb990e443269219952bb2c1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> 5.7-inch (144.3 mm) Full HD Super AMOLED (1920 x 1080), 386ppi <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> 4 cores, 2.3 GHz, Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (LTE version) or 4 A15 cores with a frequency of 1.9 GHz + 4 A7 cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz, Samsung Exynos 5420 <br>  <b>Graphics Accelerator:</b> Adreno 330 (LTE version) or Mali-T628 MP6 <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 3 GB of RAM <br>  <b>Storage:</b> 32 GB Ôºã microSD (up to 64 GB) <br>  <b>Camera:</b> Main: 13 megapixels, BSI matrix, autofocus and smart stabilization, LED flash (High CRI), zero shutter lag;  Front: 2 megapixels, BSI matrix and smart stabilization, Full HD 30 fps video recording <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Standard Li-ion, 3200 mAh <br>  <b>Connections:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac (HT80);  GPS / GLONASS;  NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 (LE), IR LED (remote control), MHL 2.0 <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 168 g <br><br>  In conjunction with <b>GALAXY Note 3,</b> Samsung introduced a curious accessory called <b>GALAXY Gear</b> , which allows you to control your smartphone.  This device is essentially a modified wristwatch that notifies the user of incoming messages, calls, emails and reminders.  Moreover, a preview of all the alerts is displayed on the screen, which makes it possible to look at them or ignore them.  If the incoming message requires special attention, the user can activate his mobile device GALAXY, on which, thanks to the Instant Alert function, it will already be open. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/a9a/ef6/22ba9aef6861ea32220bf1f463c3063f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The built-in speaker allows you to make calls in hands-free mode.  For example, driving a car, you can make calls without touching the screen of the GALAXY Gear watch.  Users can also dictate text messages, create events in the calendar, set an alarm and receive the weather forecast using the voice function S Voice. <br><br>  In addition to the device management features, Samsung GALAXY Gear offers the opportunity to capture what is happening around.  Thanks to the built-in 1.9-megapixel camera and the function "Instant photo", users can take photos or videos on the go and share the result of shooting in social networks.  The Voice Note feature turns GALAXY Gear into a convenient voice recorder, recording from which can be decrypted into text already on the GALAXY mobile device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2ca/07a/0d2/2ca07a0d29f601725b410a9518e92fee.png"><br>  The Auto-lock feature automatically locks the screen of the connected smartphone if it is located more than one and a half meters from the Samsung GALAXY Gear watch.  The function ‚ÄúSearch for a device‚Äù helps to find a smartphone - when activated, it gives sound and light signals, and also vibrates.  Also, a smart watch allows you to control the music that is played on your GALAXY mobile device.  Rewind, track selection or pause are performed in the same way as on a regular player.  And finally, GALAXY Gear can work as a pedometer and track the user's physical activity with the help of built-in sensors.  This feature allows you to monitor parameters such as calories burned, the number of steps and the distance covered. <br><br>  At the start of sales will be available ten options for the design of the dial.  New options will gradually appear in the Samsung Apps store.  So far, there are six colors available: black, gray, orange, cream, gold and green. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/14b/5d5/930/14b5d593083cac4eddcfcda99dba9b65.png"><br>  Smart watch Samsung GALAXY Gear will go on sale on September 25 at the same time with the smartphone Samsung GALAXY Note 3. <br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> 1.63-inch (41.4 mm) Super AMOLED (320 x 320) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> 800 MHz <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512 MB (RAM) <br>  <b>Storage:</b> 4 GB of internal memory <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 1.9 megapixels, BSI matrix, autofocus, photo with sound, video recording and HD playback (720p) <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Standard Li-ion, 315 mAh <br>  <b>Connections:</b> Bluetooth v 4.0 + BLE <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 36.8 x 56.6 x 11.1 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 73.8 g <br><br>  Another pleasant new product was the <b>Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 2014 edition</b> tablet.  It is equipped with a 10-inch WQXGA Super Clear LCD display with an impressive resolution of 2560x1600 pixels, an eight-core 1.9 GHz processor (only in 3G / Wi-Fi version) and 3 GB of RAM. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/4d1/833/3144d1833de8315a9b36d93b00002093.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 2014 edition significantly expands the capabilities of its predecessor - the original tablet Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1.  In addition to the improved performance of the device, its design has also been improved: the frame of the case has become very thin, smooth and light, which gives the tablet a more style.  New design solutions touched and the back panel, which is now covered with elegant textures. <br><br>  The wide and bright screen of the new tablet provides four times higher pixel density in comparison with the first generation Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1. <br><br>  Using the ‚ÄúTwo active windows‚Äù mode, users can launch the same application several times, as well as use the improved S Pen, dragging content from one window to another.  The Window in Window function allows the user to draw a window of any size on the screen and get instant access to applications such as YouTube or a calculator. <br><br>  The updated S Pen, which is included in the Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 2014 edition, has improved response rates and provides more features, such as Active Notes, Fragments Album, Instant Comments, and S Finder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84c/175/45b/84c17545bc246ebae666015aae06e367.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the new features of the Album of Fragments function, users can easily mark any interesting content using the S Pen and turn it into a separate ‚Äúfragment‚Äù in their journal, accompanied by comments, a list of tasks or the concept of a new design project. <br><br>  S Note has also received some new features and a more intuitive, easy-to-use interface.  With the help of the ‚ÄúSimple graph‚Äù function, all data presented in the form of a figure can be immediately converted into the form of graphs and charts. <br><br>  The Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 2014 edition also includes a universal application that ensures the privacy and security of the mobile environment - Samsung KNOX, which we have already mentioned above. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/000/86e/46c/00086e46cfc750d0403e5aab83bdefb7.png"><br>  The new tablet Samsung GALAXY Note 10.1 2014 edition will be available in two options: with a Wi-Fi connection and with Wi-Fi / 3G connections.

If necessary, the display can be easily installed in a vertical position.  This was amply demonstrated at the exhibition itself in the form of giant 171-inch video walls made up of three vertically arranged UHD displays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e1/983/5f6/5e19835f622ebd5cf07620b26c86e631.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the exhibition, Samsung also unveiled the first Ultra HD monitor.  Undoubtedly, this is the largest model of the released models.  The 31.5-inch screen provides a clear and vivid image of UHD-resolution, the number of pixels is 8.3 million and is almost 4 times higher than the performance of Full HD monitors with 2.07 million pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0a1/2bc/ba8/0a12bcba884158dc8b0727dcdf0bf784.png"><br><br>  Any such UHD monitor can be calibrated for the most accurate display of colors.  The display is conventionally divided into 25 sections, on each of which with the help of an external calibrating device, the correctness of color rendition, uniformity of the backlight and white balance are carefully checked.  Calibration with optional software is also available.  In addition, due to the display of 1 billion colors and wide color gamut of Adobe RGB 99%, you can get richer shades compared to the image of conventional monitors. <br><br>  Also close attention of the public was drawn to the new UHD-TVs with a curved display - <b>Samsung Curved UHD TV</b> .  Panoramic displays were presented in two versions - with a diagonal of 55 and 65 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/72d/404/b2f72d4046b2b52eb5f1685183b68b6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The production of UHD TVs with a curved display is a much more complicated process compared to the same OLED screens of a similar shape.  Since the UHD-device market is at the initial stage of development, the company intends to carefully analyze consumer reviews after the release of Samsung Curved UHD TV, in order to fully respond to consumer demands in the future. <br><br>  New items have expanded the series of Samsung UHD TVs, which currently include models with a diagonal of 110, 98, 85, 65 and 55 inches. <br><br>  Closed the chain of latest displays Samsung new <b>UHD OLED TVs</b> .  They provide the same extremely realistic and detailed Ultra HD resolution image with the highest brightness and contrast, achieved thanks to the latest OLED technology, 8 million pixels and 4 times higher resolution than Full HD models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d4/191/434/6d41914340545432c3274968ef880593.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The combination of OLED technology and self-emitting sub-pixels allowed to bring the image quality and contrast to a new level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="60ff00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRINTERS</font> </h2><br>  No less interesting were the new Samsung solutions for mobile printing. <br><br>  It was assumed that the growth in sales of mobile devices and the gradual transition of offices to work without using paper documents will reduce the demand for printing equipment.  However, according to the latest IDC research, in 2012, using so many printers and multifunction printers, they printed so many pages that they could cover the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew York 237 times.  In addition, the results of the study showed that the owners of mobile devices, smartphones and tablets, print documents that are not the most active ones.  According to IDC forecasts, by 2015 more than half of these office workers will switch to printing from mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f90/fa4/b8d/f90fa4b8d6945e844e78d0c91eaf08f1.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung foresaw this trend and in 2009 focused on the development of appropriate solutions: Samsung Mobile Print, Wi-Fi Direct, Native photo printing button, Google Cloud Print and the recent integration of NFC technology.  This year, the company was the first in the world to introduce color laser multifunction devices with NFC support for simple and convenient mobile printing.  A series of Xpress C460 with the installation of Wi-Fi-connection in just three steps has received positive reviews and the prestigious Buyers Laboratory (BLI) award for outstanding achievements and innovations.  The line of NFC-technology also replenished with a monochrome laser printer and MFP series M2070, which will go on sale in September of this year. <br><br>  Also at the IFA 2013 exhibition, Samsung has demonstrated a large selection of new concepts with outstanding design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6c0/43b/367/6c043b367930e8a685a913b6dffb42fd.jpg"><br><br>  The minimalist <b>Wave</b> model can be used as a docking station for a smartphone and it is easy to print out content from a mobile device with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/28c/c31/8a8/28cc318a82422ce4d30427a2fbf17251.jpg"><br><br>  Made in retro-design concept <b>Indie</b> combines the functions of a printer, a sound system and a docking station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8ad/82a/ec1/8ad82aec1a6433d448861f4a6993b30a.jpg"><br><br>  The monochrome laser model <b>One &amp; One</b> allows you to print documents in two colors, thanks to the choice of an additional shade (cyan, magenta, or yellow). <br><br>  In addition, the <b>CLP-415</b> series devices, which were the first in the industry to win the iF Design Awards 2013 gold award, and the IDEA Gold Award 2013 holders: <b>Origami</b> , <b>Clip</b> and <b>Mate</b> were presented at the booth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/699/59c/5b0/69959c5b0ad4d4822caea0dd37a2e808.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/077/11c/6c6/07711c6c69c3cf15f6bbf462a7416610.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7f5/948/1e7/7f59481e7e28e4024c23b8e2cc8c1dc2.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193480/</a></p>
