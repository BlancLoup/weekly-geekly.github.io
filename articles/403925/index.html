Someone clicks on the lessons, someone masterfully owns the "butterfly" and the rosary, someone sorts out a coin in his hands, like Captain Jack Sparrow - a pirate medallion.  Something to twist in the hands of a man almost laid by nature.  And it could not happen that someone did not try to do business with it.  After the furious success of push-button Fidget Cube on Kickstarter, the world went crazy, and now there is a whole class of items called spinners. <br><br>  <i>We had to complete the entry.</i>  While we prepared the publication, on Geektimes the post about various spinners managed to leave.  We were even a little upset, until we saw the prices - after all, the Chinese industry always manages to catch and develop an idea, making it significantly cheaper.  In any case, buying something for $ 3-5 is even more profitable than printing on a 3D printer, especially if you don‚Äôt have it. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/289211/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/296/0ed/967/2960ed9679664ab8d0e3b19243ef4f56.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  "Pinwheel for Fidget" </h2><br>  Ball bearing devices, tiny mechanisms that can be twisted between fingers, replaced the pushbutton cube.  Most often they are called ‚Äúfidget spinner‚Äù, which can be translated as ‚Äúspinner for fidget‚Äù.  This name conveys the essence that marketers have invested in the mechanism - a sedative and anti-stress device for all ages.  One magazine called this class of small gadgets "an antidote for attention deficit hyperactivity, anxiety, and autism."  The spinners shot at the market in the spring, and now they are banned in schools in parts of the United States, because they began to distract students from classes.

      Nevertheless, they enjoy fame rightly. <br><br><ol><li>  This is an anti-stress that will help you focus on your work, meeting, on the road, in traffic, in flight - in general, wherever stress is around us. <br><br></li><li>  Practicing pediatricians and neuropathologists use tactile disks, balls, sensory toys, materials for sculpting, and even kinetic sand to calm children with sensory problems and hyperactivity. <br><br></li><li>  Working with such finger tricks helps relieve muscle tension that occurs, for example, after a long letter (at a lecture), working on the keyboard, driving, playing games, operations, etc. <br><br></li><li>  Children from 6 years old spinners are also useful (but not in the classroom!): They help to focus, cope with the motor manifestations of hyperactivity, to distract from the gadgets. <br><br></li><li>  Spinners develop fine motor skills, with which, as you know, imagination, speech, thinking and visual memory develop. <br><br></li><li>  With these hands, you can do tricks with forwarding, balancing and everything that allows your imagination and does not injure others. <br><br></li><li>  Spinner helps get rid of the bad habit of clicking, knocking, banging your fingers during a conversation ... but it will form a new habit.  Although the quiet and beautiful spinner looks in the hands as an element of the image, unlike the snapping gnawed cap of the handle.  By the way, with regard to nibbling - if you or your child have a habit of nail biting, the spinner successfully solves this problem. <br></li></ol><br>  Previously, for the purpose of calming down, the population of the Earth used rattles, pens, buttons, fish in an aquarium, the soft wool of their favorite cats, and even such cats: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5f3/56e/23c/5f356e23c55143a2bf540d134d636fae.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Chinese industry is not far behind </h2><br>  On the Gearbest pages, there are a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/fidget-spinners-c_12285/%3Fodr%3Dhot%3Flkid%3D10735711">lot of such things</a> , with excellent quality and even with additional options: lighting, different geometry, rattles (if necessary), multi-colored elements, for any hand size and ... even a wallet. <br><br>  The principle of operation is simple: you hold the toy by the central stationary part, in the outer one you spin around your axis.  By the way, DYI spinner lovers have already appeared.  Advice - if you decide to collect something of your own in a fit of free time, be sure to choose a ceramic bearing - it eliminates the extraneous sounds of homemade. <br><br>  The simplest model is a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_606385.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">three</a> - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_606385.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">bladed spinner</a> with a steel ball bearing in the center, which is easily unwound, even with the push of a finger of one hand, if adapted.  It feels nice in the hand, weighs 30 grams. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32a/081/b50/32a081b500fbbcd4333937c514cbe1b3.png"></div><br>  For those who like to twist and squeeze, there <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_618914.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">is a bat-shaped fidget</a> - it also turns nicely in your hands, but you can still wrap it around the sides, if you don‚Äôt want to turn it, but it‚Äôs already uncomfortable.  Plus, this design is safer and suitable for children from three or four years. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f2/1e2/302/8f21e2302000df4366f0efce1adeec49.png"></div><br>  A separate story - turntables made of metal: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_612178.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">aluminum</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_609457.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">copper</a> , steel.  They lie pleasantly in the hand, they look stylish, they keep spinning longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c43/adb/303/c43adb3035007a30b7e6cee39469dc3b.png"><br><br>  There are gadgets and a more unusual look - for example, with several blades or in a star shape.  They cost not $ 3-7, but $ 25-30, but they are worth it - for example, a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/novelty-toys/pp_622561.html%3Fwid%3D21%3Flkid%3D10735711">light star made of titanium</a> rotates perfectly, does not rub off, does not break and at the same time cleans up even the smallest pocket.  By the way, choose a spinner, pay attention to the size in centimeters so that the gadget is not too big for your hand - especially for children and fragile girls. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bf/0f5/85c/7bf0f585ccbeecbfec4defa09152449d.png"></div><br>  The whole range of fidget spinners can be viewed <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/fidget-spinners-c_12285/%3Fodr%3Dhot%3Flkid%3D10735711">here</a> , and promotional offers - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-daily-9.99-special-1285.html%3Flkid%3D10735711">here</a> .  By the way, have you seen a lot of toys for a few dollars that Forbes wrote about?  And he <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jplafke/2016/12/23/fidget-spinners-are-the-must-have-office-toy-for-2017/">wrote</a> about Fidget Spinner - because this is another phenomenon of the kitschy culture, which is stormy and from where it hit the consumers.  We make bets how long this popularity. <br><br>  Well, if you are calm, affable and you are not annoyed at all, you can bring an element of peace to your workplace or simply give someone a cool <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/stuffed-cartoon-toys/pp_629103.html%3Fwid%3D26">teddy figure of Waiting</a> .
