It is not enough to make a beautiful design and selling texts.  We need something more that will stop the search for other offers.  We will talk about the tools that help to ‚Äúgrab‚Äù the site visitor and convince the client that with this company along the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eae/817/3dd/eae8173dd0b64cf79325b68a015e52a9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Countdown counters</b> <br>  <i>+ 10-15% conversion</i> <br><br>  Let's start with the most well-known tool - the countdown counter, which creates a sense of time pressure and forces the client to make a purchase decision faster.  Internet marketers can sigh and say that they personally immediately leave the site, seeing such a counter.  But let's not judge the audience on their own.  The tool is so effective that it was picked up by email-marketing - the counters report days and hours before the end of the campaign in letters.  A new round of development counters - agile-timer, which counts the time <a href="https://vc.ru/p/flash-sale-campaign">since the opening of the letter</a> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/649/3ae/0166493ae51e4aaea77821e6ff847ffa.jpg"><br><br>  Using such a tool, you need to be honest with your customers.  If you reduce the price for the promotion period, then you should not raise it on the eve, as shops often do on the eve of Black Friday.  Many major brands have already lost confidence in themselves, using such tricks. <br><br>  The counter on the site can be implemented using an html-widget for your <a href="http://megatimer.ru/">content</a> management system (CMS) or special services, for example, free and flexible <a href="http://megatimer.ru/">megatimer.ru</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da2/223/49c/da222349c94b4b0f80eeae83f4df6653.png"><br><br>  <b>Callback widget (callback service)</b> <br>  <i>+ 70% conversion</i> <br><br>  When choosing a product or service, customers study several offers at once.  The client always has clarifying questions, and who will resolve them first, he will get more chances to close the deal.  Here, as in the Wild West, you are either quick or dead.  A callback widget is the most efficient way to communicate. <br><br>  Often, for the sake of experiment, visitors to the site enter their phone number to check if the company really will call them back so quickly.  And when the bell rings, it produces a stunning effect on the customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/20e/ece/d6320eece0bc44aaa63585b78425636f.PNG"><br><br>  Behind the seeming simplicity is a serious technology.  As soon as the customer left the phone, the system calls the sales manager, and when he picks up the phone, the customer calls.  When the client is on the line, the system connects them to a general conversation. <br><br>  The system has many nice bonuses to communication efficiency.  First, the assessment of the effectiveness of sales managers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/72c/734/ca072c73415b4027a353cf4a9aafcc8e.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, analytics promotion channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be6/6d8/bc9/be66d8bc9868452b83c86ebe01f496a7.jpg"><br><br>  And, thirdly, ease of installation.  A widget is an html-code that is installed on the site in three minutes.  Pozvonim.com has detailed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLSdQ22NEN2oDS2QfeTTPvxGhnD2kKTsip">video instructions for all types of CMS</a> . <br><br>  <b>Chats</b> <br>  <i>+ 23% conversion</i> <br><br>  Chatting is evolving.  For the generation of the ‚Äúthumb‚Äù, which is used to communicate via instant messengers, companies use platforms that allow correspondence with users of different instant messengers through a single window.  Mostly through this channel they make orders or clarify anything before purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4a/f61/94a/f4af6194a7014f3b8354171f27bb5e84.png"><br><br>  From the pros: it is convenient for a certain type of clients and allows you to count on further relations, orders, because the contact of the company is always at hand. <br><br>  Of the minuses: you need to add the company to your contact list in your favorite messenger. <br><br>  <b>Social evidence</b> <br>  <i>+ 14% conversion</i> <br><br>  The level of confidence in reviews is 12 times higher than the description of the product.  Therefore, it is very important to take this process under control in order to increase the conversion of the site.  To begin, give customers the opportunity to leave feedback on your product or service.  Most commercial CMSs have easily customizable plugins that allow you to display customer reviews, edit fields, assign ratings to a product, etc.  For example, it looks like a plugin of reviews in the Bitrix management system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e95/97f/33b/e9597f33bf084a479b5ad57ec7854a99.png"><br><br>  But there are offers on the market for those who do not use commercial CMS - for example, the service <a href="http://sprosikupi.ru/">SprosiKupi.ru</a> , which not only collects and broadcasts reviews on the site, but also encourages buyers to share their impressions.  The service sends letters to those who purchased something from the online store and offers to leave a review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be5/a94/87a/be5a9487ad324eb58299882b79c32660.jpg"><br><br>  Good social proof are also likes and reposts in the social network.  If, under a photo of your product, a client sees, for example, a hundred likes, it will automatically think that the product is popular and has value, since so many visitors have noted it.  Buttons likes and reposts on the site are also implemented using plug-ins for your CMS or a small refinement of the program code.  For example, Vkontakte offers an easy way to install your ‚ÄúLike‚Äù widget, which counts and displays likes on your website: <a href="https://vk.com/dev/Like">https://vk.com/dev/Like</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1a/992/7a7/c1a9927a713b495bad4c8f912b99a5da.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Pop-up window</b> <br><br>  This method can be called the "last hope" of a commercial site.  It is worth it to use it as a last resort - when you are sure that the person who has come in is not here by chance, and you have something to offer.  Some online stores, for example, offer promotional codes for a discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93c/b32/203/93cb32203db84ad3993d5cf5f3c018c0.png"><br><br>  In order not to irritate the audience, the appearance of pop-up can be customized.  For example, staying on the page for more than a minute or scrolling it already means that your assortment is interested, and there is not enough of a small step to choose in your favor.  Or the appearance of a pop-up when the user intended to leave the site - the technology allows you to track the movement of the cursor.  Pop-up can be implemented using special widgets for different CMS or using program code. <br><br>  <b>Games for lovers of discounts</b> <br><br>  Gamification in business is becoming a new trend.  Not less than the game, people love and discounts.  All this can be combined by offering site visitors to perform targeted actions (Vkontakte / Facebook subscription, writing comments, reviews, likes, shea, etc.) in exchange for bonuses.  And, the higher the social activity of the user, which benefits the company, the larger the resulting bonus.  An example of a service that helps companies create such a game is <a href="http://magictab.ru/">magictab.ru</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f9/939/0e9/7f99390e969f40f5b24b4855b94813ab.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, it is impossible to guarantee an increase in conversion with the introduction of all the above tools.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to show patience and, with the help of testing and analyzing all the tools, determine what exactly is missing for your website visitors in order to take a targeted action. <br><br>  For example, to determine the effectiveness of a callback-service offers a fairly long test period - <a href="https://pozvonim.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg_11.03">50 minutes</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299234/</a></p>
