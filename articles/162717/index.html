At the presentation of the new mobile gadget, we were shown and show how great it looks, but in life everything looked dull and empty. <br><br>  Under the cut solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To fill such a book, it was necessary to photograph all contacts on your phone.  Firstly, it is not realistic, and as a result, blue, semi-living faces were obtained.  Frequently, their owners did not like it, and he was not able to decide which avatar to assign.

      Now there are programs for smartphones that allow you to synchronize your phone book with the social network. <br><br>  But they have a number of disadvantages: <br><ol><li>  not all contacts from the book are in a social network; </li><li>  Not all contacts in the social network are your friends and they have access to contacts; </li><li>  after synchronization, the book is often cluttered with contacts without a phone (or no contacts at all) and you need to rake and connect contacts; </li><li>  in social services there are rules for avatars; </li><li>  Avatars do not look beautiful on smartphones due to low resolution. </li><li>  Well, at the end, not everyone uses social services. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  About what happened. </h4><br>  To solve a number of these problems, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.friendsavatars">FriendsAvatars</a> service was invented. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZwkZtwtTmk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjpGwADjj7SEkFAInJWD6rmgutiBQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The scheme is simple, install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.friendsavatars">the FriendsAvatars application</a> on your smartphone, download the avatar (from FB, VK, Events or galleries) and confirm your phone with a code from SMS.  A friend also <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.friendsavatars">installs the application</a> , synchronizes his phone book with the FriendsAvatars service and there is your avatar in his phone. <br><br>  You may notice that not all contacts are in our service, we have provided for it.  For contacts that are not on the service, you can upload random avatars - these are avatars downloaded in random order from the service gallery, and the uniqueness is preserved (1 Vatar - 1 phone).  If you do not like avatrak, you can replace it by selecting another from the gallery. <br><br>  Service benefits: <br><ol><li>  We load the avarkaru what you like - there is no censorship at all!  Which one you want, which one you like, which one you like, even any part of the walrus body.  After all, it is you who decide how you want to look in a friend‚Äôs contact book. </li><li>  High resolution avatar support.  This is true for smartphone, especially for the call answering screen, where the avatar is stretched to full screen. </li><li>  If the user is not your friend in a social network or he is simply not there, then you still get his avatar. </li><li>  If your friend has updated the avatar, you will receive a notification. </li><li>  No rubbish in the contact book with contacts without phones. </li><li>  You can download in the whole phonebook of the avatar in 1 click. </li></ol><br>  At the moment, there are no paid services in the project, a little comes through advertising, but this is barely enough to pay for the SMS gateway, not to mention hosting.  At the moment, an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.friendsavatars">application for Android has been</a> developed, in case of popularity of the service, an application for IOS is planned and a number of interesting services within the application. <br><br>  The project was developed by a group of enthusiasts in their free time. <br>  There are only 3 of us: <br>  I am the author of the idea, designer, copywriter: <br>  ASP.net programmer - server and database developer; <br>  Android programmer - application developer </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162717/</a></p>
