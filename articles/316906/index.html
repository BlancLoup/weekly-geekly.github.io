My name is &lt;Ηράκλειο&gt; (do not delve into the name, the word that exists, but this is the fruit of a second fantasy), I am the production director at &lt;Κρήτη&gt;.  I have a number of problems with production planning.  Could we meet with you? <br><br>  The meeting was attended by Ηράκλειο, the CEO and, by chance, a business owner.  I was provided with a list of technical requirements for production planning, the presence of which has a positive effect on the subject matter of the conversation.  During the conversation, we met, shared commercial and organizational information, outlined the first steps. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  I note that I do not recognize the “rapid survey”, since in the short period that this stage involves, the desired or even intermediate result will not be achieved.  The period of "rapid survey" will help you and your partner to evaluate each other, the method of work, the seriousness of intentions.  Therefore, I try not to carry out this stage (sometimes I do it for free), but to immediately do a full-fledged survey (depending on the current load, attitude, and interest of the owners).  Yes, sometimes there are costs, but I get saturated with the pleasure of learning a new enterprise - I see how they produce toys, special-purpose equipment, building materials and much more. </blockquote><br>  The next day, Ηράκλειο showed me the enterprise from the inside, technological processes, production sites.

      <strong>My primary task</strong> is to assess the possibility of the project, which includes two components: <br><br>  1. physical ability <br>  2. administrative readiness. <br><br><h2>  Physical opportunity </h2><br>  1. With the first item - everything is simple.  You should receive the technical requirements of the project (TT) - yourself (having discussed with the customer) or already formulated from the customer.  <a href="http://ingraf.su/firststep/">I wrote</a> about the TT document itself <a href="http://ingraf.su/firststep/">here</a> , but I’ll emphasize that you should have a table of this type: <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a8/957/e70/6a8957e700f0915957621e0ad772e583.png"><br><br>  Of course, you and your team must be specialists in order to assess the feasibility of the technical requirements.  You must understand each item and see the guideline for its decision.  In the process of modeling, when you go into all the details, you will have clarifications.  However, they will be in the process of the whole life of the project. <br><br><h2>  Administrative readiness </h2><br>  2. In administrative readiness, I include everything that is beyond the boundaries of engineering - the interest of the management, the financial capabilities of the customer, the psychological climate of the team, the competence of the company's specialists.  All these indicators will be considered in the course of the article. <br><br>  <strong>The interest of leadership.</strong> <br><br>  There are many enterprises where the appointed general director receives a salary according to the formula [the <em>size of the salary plus a percentage of the difference between the income and expenses of the enterprise</em> ].  If the desire to get a higher salary exceeds the essence of the Creator, then you will not start anything investment there.  He has a contract for 2 years, and during this time it is more important to pay off the loan for a car recently taken to "fit" the position. <br><br>  On the very first day I am compiling an “Empty Memorandum”: I request the organizational structure and according to it I draw up a schedule of interviewing key employees.  I send this “document” with the request of the signature of the <strong>general director</strong> and <strong>fix the date and time of sending</strong> . <br><blockquote>  I define key persons by comparing technical requirements with posts by organizational structure, plus key users from the category of business owners and co-owners.  Business owners can be found in the <a href="https://egrul.nalog.ru/">extracts</a> from the register of unregistered <a href="https://egrul.nalog.ru/">tax services</a> , except when information on shareholders is kept in the registrar organization.  For a detailed list of affiliates, I recommend the <a href="http://www.spark-interfax.ru/">Spark-Interfax database</a> .  Do not count for advertising, but the base gives answers to many questions regarding reliability, financial solvency, holding structure. </blockquote><br>  Evaluate the result of the response to the "blank letter": <br><br><ul><li>  The answer came quickly with the signature of the CEO.  Feature: <strong>excellent</strong> ! </li><li>  The answer came with the signature of the CEO, but with a long wait [fast / long is a subjective indicator of <strong>personal</strong> sensation].  Feature: <strong>good</strong> ! </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Remember the book " <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/mif/008/">Reengineering Corporation. Manifesto of the revolution in business</a> "? <br><p>  “The bureaucracy is the glue, ... It was and remains the solution to the main problem - the fragmentation of processes.” </p></blockquote><br><ul><li>  The answer came quickly with the signature of the project manager (in my case, Ηράκλειο) or by another person who does not have a <strong>full</strong> administrative resource - <strong>satisfactorily with a minus</strong> ! </li><li>  The answer came with the signature Ηράκλειο and with a long wait, exactly as it did not come.  The indicator is <strong>unsatisfactory</strong> ! </li></ul><br>  I repeat - fast / long - a subjective indicator that depends on your expectations and the specifics of the enterprise.  In large organizations, approval procedures can last for months.  Here is an example of the approval sheet of the technical task of ROSATOM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68f/ad5/566/68fad55669dfa779a8aee98f06345ce5.png" alt="list-soglasovaniya"><br><br>  The event of an “empty letter” may seem insignificant, but <strong>their combination</strong> will help form a comprehensive view of the company's readiness for change.  There may be several such procedures. <br><br>  <strong>In the process of interviewing try to identify interested persons, and vice versa.</strong>  Label your sense of employee interest in the project in the <a href="http://ingraf.su/anketa/">interview questionnaire</a> .  Sometimes it happens that an opinion was not formed about the interlocutor, then they distract, then yulit, then “run away” to meetings.  What to do?  Agree on the need to re-meet, after doing <strong>a</strong> <strong>little</strong> work, for example, he let him classify the processes of his department and you discuss them next time. <br><br>  Example of classification of business processes (BP): <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="46"><p>  <b>No</b> </p><br></td><td width="207"><p>  <b>BP group</b> </p><br></td><td width="158"><p>  <b>BP</b> </p><br></td><td width="141"><p>  <b>Operation</b> </p><br></td><td width="165"><p>  <b>Responsible</b> </p><br></td></tr><tr><td width="46">  <i>1.1.1</i> </td><td width="207" rowspan="4">  <i>Group 1</i> </td><td width="158" rowspan="3">  <i>BP 1</i> </td><td width="141">  <i>Operation 1</i> </td><td width="165">  <i>Ivanov I.I.</i> </td></tr><tr><td width="46">  <i>1.1.2</i> </td><td width="141">  <i>Operation 2</i> </td><td width="165">  <i>Petrov P.P.</i> </td></tr><tr><td width="46">  <i>1.1.3</i> </td><td width="141">  <i>Operation 3</i> </td><td width="165">  <i>Kuznetsov K.K.</i> </td></tr><tr><td width="46">  <i>1.2.1</i> </td><td width="158">  <i>BP 2</i> </td><td width="141">  <i>Operation 4</i> </td><td width="165">  <i>Smirnov S.S.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  According to the results of the second meeting, you determine the results all the same results from “unsatisfactory” to “excellent”!  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  The meeting took place with the provided "homework".  Feature: <strong>excellent</strong> ! </li><li>  The meeting took place, but without the assignment.  Indicator: <strong>satisfactory -</strong> <strong>good</strong> depending on the feeling of the conversation. </li><li>  The meeting did not take place.  The indicator is <strong>unsatisfactory</strong> ! </li></ul><br>  <strong>Summary:</strong> <br><br>  <em>As a result of meetings and interviewing, we get the interest of key employees, their communication between colleagues and with you.</em> <br><br><h2>  "Organizational Chess" </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/95f/4bb/bf695f4bbbc35d6f1d68c07b3ba849ab.jpg" alt="ogranizatsionnye-shahmaty-oboznacheniya" width="750" height="240"><br><br>  In the scheme we will consider 2 important parameters: the interest of a key employee and the level of communications.  The latter determines the impact on the employee through the thickness of the line. <br><br>  <strong>The first combination.</strong>  DG is not interested, DP is interested, CD is not interested, WB is neutral. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/725/b4b/ed3725b4be9f4f2a36348f56ca63e28c.jpg" alt="ogranizatsionnye-shahmaty-pozitsiya-1" width="750" height="542"><br><br>  Do not forget to answer the following questions: <br><br><ul><li>  Why such a position of this employee? </li><li>  Does this make it difficult to achieve a local and global result? </li><li> What are the risks and what are the possibilities to minimize them?  (add to your <strong>personal</strong> risk card) </li></ul><br>  In this case, Ηράκλειο - DP, which is interested in the implementation of the system, as it requires good production results.  DG - not interested in the costs that affect his salary.  After the launch, an economic effect is likely to occur, but he is not sure about saving the position by that time.  CD is not interested, because the introduction of the system will add him and his department additional work, as in the volume-calendar and operational planning he will need to regularly enter additional calculations and forecasts, to enter information into the system. <br><br>  <em><strong>Summary.</strong></em>  <em>This diagram shows that the enterprise is not ready for change.</em>  <em>Only partial cases of small influence are possible: (1) DP is a brother / relative of the State Duma;</em>  <em>(2) the presence of contact with the WB, where offer him to exclude from the calculation of the salary of the DG investment costs.</em> <br><br>  <strong>The second combination.</strong> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/000/49e/929/00049e929976c8dc7891fd84043ab48d.jpg" alt="ogranizatsionnye-shahmaty-4" width="750" height="542"><br><br>  In this situation, you have to make one, but <strong>honest</strong> step (you will be taught many and dishonest in sales courses): <br><br><ul><li>  Create a SWOT analysis of the project, identifying strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats.  For clarity, include Ishikawa diagram in the analysis.  This information is addressed to WB, DG and CD. </li></ul><br>  Let them appreciate the possible benefits, only, for God's sake, do not write lies and exaggerations.  It is better not to participate in the project than to fail it. <br><br>  My example of a SWOT analysis of "Multi-company accounting in a single database": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0d/129/a74/e0d129a74df6ba383cc1e93ff1d74829.png"><br><br>  Not so long ago, I opened the Ishikawa diagram for myself and, due to my love for infographics, made a small revision - the greater the impact on the risk / problem / solution, the thicker the line.  <strong>Strengths</strong> in Ishikawa infographics of the following type: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/389/85b/af3/38985baf32f3f290e6f58b976a3b9c86.jpg" alt="swot-silnye-storony"><br>  <strong>Weaknesses</strong> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87a/7fd/b4e/87a7fdb4e5f08c1c93e2647367e68ad7.jpg" alt="swot-slabye-storony" width="750" height="456"><br><br>  Do not judge strictly my first attempt, but for myself I indicated that the SWOT analysis can be presented in a more visual form.  If one condition is observed, namely, to bring the advantages and disadvantages to a unified system of measurement, you can get a visual scheme for decision-making. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbe/a9e/64f/bbea9e64f8614adb8d71b829f00da9b7.jpg" alt="swot-i-isikava" width="750" height="283"><br><br>  It is clear that the right side is not translated into a cash equivalent and it makes no sense to compare these two parts.  In the following publications, I will give an example where Ishikawa’s infographics work in comparison. <br><br>  <strong><em>Summary:</em></strong> <em>you face a person who is interested, but it does not have full administrative authority.</em>  <em>You conduct surveys, identify employees who have political influence and interest.</em>  <em>Without lies and exaggerations, as an independent expert, present a real picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the project for decision-making, where possible, the business owner.</em>  <em>Excessive influence on people who reject - is the release of energy into the void.</em>  <em>The result of your presentation will show whether the company is ready for change.</em> <br><br>  <strong>The third combination.</strong> <br><br>  I recommend a little distraction, but on the topic. <br><blockquote>  USSR, 1976, a small instrument-making plant is faced with the problems of enterprise resource management.  The management decides to implement an ERP system.  It is based on the film “An Ordinary Month”, shot by the Lenfilm studio at the request of the USSR State Television and Radio Committee. </blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bC_BMqGdSQM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this case, the scheme has the form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48a/de2/79a/48ade279ae3a1acc7b77e7c20c07c553.jpg" alt="ogranizatsionnye-shahmaty-pozitsiya-22" width="750" height="542"><br><br>  The results will be summarized in the following combination, since they are similar. <br><br>  <strong>The third combination.</strong> <br><br>  The director of the manufacturing enterprise &lt;Αθήνα&gt; turned to the contracting company for the implementation of the project.  He was inspired by the modern system and its capabilities, while his entourage did not show much enthusiasm, because “the enterprise is in crisis”, “the wages are small”, “it will take more work”.  If I, as a third-party executor of the project, need a qualified team, implementation experience, the right choice of methodology, etc., then one of the main requirements for the customer is a <strong><em>budget</em> and <em>administrative will &lt;Αθήνα&gt;</em></strong> .  Both are “perishable”.  We know about money on the example of our wallet - only received a salary, and in a moment only voiced balances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/596/4ca/f05/5964caf05c3d019b3b7754c886648a0a.jpg" alt="ogranizatsionnye-shahmaty-pozitsiya-2" width="750" height="542"><br><br>  The same can be said about administrative will: if the decision-maker (DG, WB) does not have it, do not start, because it smells like failure.  Difficulties will be on any project and his entourage will not miss the opportunity to peck at the first opportunity with the phrase "I told you."  With the flexible nature of the leader, his enthusiasm will quickly be replaced by sadness.  Consequently: <br><br><ul><li>  The manager must waver a minimum number of times <strong>after the</strong> decision has been made. </li><li>  Produce quick results. </li></ul><br>  Under this scheme, you will have, with a probability of <strong>100%,</strong> difficulties with the staff, because: <br><br><ol><li>  Man does not like change, where there is no motivation. </li><li>  Man is lazy by nature. </li><li>  Man does not like changes in his personal "kingdom." </li></ol><br>  We represent at the enterprise &lt;Κρήτη&gt; the head of a division, for example, a CD  During his work, he formed his team, his rules, his KPIs in his own accounting system (MS Access).  I come and say to show how to keep a new account in 1C: Consolidation 8. <br><br>  Required expenses of KD: <br><br><ul><li>  Explore the new program </li><li>  Re-implement all formulas in the new program </li><li>  Forget about the program, which he created with his own hands (psychologically difficult) </li></ul><br>  The result of changes for the whole enterprise: <br><br><ul><li>  Single information space of consolidated information </li></ul><br>  <strong>And what is the motivator in this case?</strong>  <strong>From the point of view of the CD, only cons of the new system!</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdc/ec5/c08/fdcec5c08404abbc80924d0342bfadd1.jpg" alt="vesy" width="750" height="342"><br><br>  How to deal with saboteurs, "gray cardinals", "elusive avengers" will try to make a separate article, so as not to interfere with everything in a heap. <br><br>  <strong><em>Summary</em></strong> <em>: this scheme is promising for changes in the enterprise.</em>  <em>And if the leadership does not exclude personnel decisions in relation to saboteurs, then you have an ideal environment for launching a project.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316906/</a></p>
