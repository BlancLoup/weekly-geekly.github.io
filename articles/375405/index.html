This was influenced by underdeveloped medicine, infant mortality, epidemics, military conflicts.  For 8 years more lived commander Can Grande della Scala, the ruler of Verona: he managed to stretch up to 38 years, and died not his own death.  According to the descriptions of his contemporaries, he was a brave warrior, and at the same time his court served as a place for scientists and poets, including Dante. <br><br>  Can Grande della Scala was born in 1291, at the age of 20 he became the ruler of Verona, a city in northeastern Italy.  Thanks to military skill, he captured several territories and annexed them to the land of his family.  He fought Padua for almost 16 years, after which he nevertheless captured this city.  A triumphal procession to the city of Treviso, in which power was to be changed, was overshadowed by a sudden illness.  According to rumors, the commander drank water from a poisoned source.

      After four days of pain, Can Grande della Scala died at the age of 38 on July 22, 1329. <br><br>  In 2004, the body was exhumed from the crypt, where it was perfectly preserved.  <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/modern-forensics-solve-700-year-old-murder-mystery/">X-ray and computed tomography were done to the</a> "patient": they showed the presence of osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, as well as traces of feces in the intestine.  This material was investigated by scientists.  Traces of chamomile, black mulberry and digitalis pollen were found - the digitalis isolated from this plant is a dangerous poison in overdose. <br><br>  Because the symptoms of the disease are known - namely, diarrhea and vomiting - the scientists concluded that it was this poison that caused the death 700 years ago. <br><br>  Who was the killer?  The main suspects are neighboring states, Venice and Milan.  By poisoning could be involved nephew of Can Grande, Mastino, who became the ruler of Verona after the death of his uncle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68f/515/756/68f51575624f883ec06dcf1162269656.jpg" width="600" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375405/</a></p>
