In <b>2006</b> , the formula consisted of only <b>20</b> characters ( <b>0.02</b> kilobytes)! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa9/c44/e0d/aa9c44e0d23e473ca237476071beaea8.png"><br><br>  There is no error.  Climbing on to the very simple <b>PageRank algorithm, Google</b> and <b>Yandex</b> turned the world of Internet search and became financial heavyweights.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><i>Description of the original PageRank algorithm</i></b> <br><br>  <i>We assume that page A has pages T1 ... Tn that refer to it (that is, quoting).</i>  <i>The parameter d is the attenuation coefficient, which can take values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 0 to 1. We usually take it equal to 0.85.</i>  <i>A more detailed consideration of the coefficient d is given later in the article.</i>  <i>Also C (A) is defined as the number of outgoing links of page A. PageRank of page A is calculated as follows:</i> <br><br>  <b>PR (A) = (1-d) + d (PR (T1) / C (T1) +‚Ä¶ + PR (Tn) / C (Tn))</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertext Network Search Engine,‚Äù 1998, Computing Engineering Department, Stanford University, Stanford, California.</i> <br><br>  However, on the Segalovich graph proposed above, we see that the ranking formula ‚Äúswelled‚Äù very quickly.  In the indexes of scientific articles, <b>PageRank</b> works well, but in the living world of the Internet, it‚Äôs impossible to achieve high-quality search by open and simple reference counting.  For example, it is very important for search engines to have real referrals of live users from external links.  It is important that the site be referred to as more thematic and authoritative sources as possible, where there is a lively, active audience clearly and on all grounds. <br>  And today there is such a type of links, which is uniquely recognized by all search engines quality.  As you can easily guess, this is the topic of this article - <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/52">links from posts in personal accounts and communities with a ‚Äúlive‚Äù audience</a> . <br><br>  <b>The benefits of links from social networks</b> <br><br>  What are links from social networks in terms of search engine? <br><br><ol><li>  Confirmation that a certain site is of interest to living people. </li><li>  Factor increasing the naturalness of the reference profile of the site. </li><li>  Quickly indexed links that report new pages. </li><li>  Stable links with a long lifespan (WebArtex checks whether the account owner deleted the link after it was posted). </li></ol><br><br>  These four factors make a significant but not decisive contribution to the final ranking calculation.  According to experts, the share of social factors so far does not exceed a few percent.  However, it should be understood that the benefits are not limited to static parameters, because now Yandex pays great attention to behavioral factors and referrals. <br><br>  <i>Clicking the link</i> is a sign that the link leads from an adequate placement to the page of interest to people: <br><br><ul><li>  the link is located where real users see it; </li><li>  The link is surrounded by relevant explanatory text that creates context for the transition. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Behavioral</i> ranking <i>factors</i> reflect the interest of visitors to the site: <br><br><ul><li>  number of visitors; </li><li>  bounce rate (percentage of visitors who viewed only one page); </li><li>  depth of viewing the site; </li><li>  the amount of time spent on the site. </li></ul><br><br>  Obviously, links from posts in social networks bring more transitions from representatives of the interested audience than any other type of link placement.  Only articles on high-quality sites that are advertised at least in the form of links on the main pages can be compared with them.  This feature is also available in <b>WebArtex</b> ( <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/27">see article types</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Position growth + cheap traffic</b> <br><br>  Links from posts in social networks contribute to the growth of the position of the site being promoted in search results by increasing the naturalness of the reference profile and improving behavioral factors.  Interested and active visitors come from social networks: the post where the link is placed can be made interesting and stimulating transitions.  The peculiarity of the perception of such posts by users is that the information placed is completely trusted (as if it were verified information from a friend or relative), despite the fact that it is an unveiled advertising character. <br><br>  At the same time, the traffic turns out to be very cheap due to the simplicity of sharing and low cost of placement (from 6 rubles on <b>Twitter</b> and <b>VKontakte</b> and from <b>50</b> rubles on <b>Youtube</b> ).  Of course, it all depends on the content: provide quality content - and people will share it. <br><br>  It should be understood that the traffic from social networks is not a purely ‚Äútechnical‚Äù indicator, a kind of appendage to the SEO parameters of the link.  This is the target audience, that is, real users who are likely to turn into buyers and customers. <br><br>  <b>Ideal for startups and young sites</b> <br><br>  The search engines have a filter "Sandbox" - sites that are not yet a year old and that are not yet able to compete for the top 10 for a little bit competitive demands.  Links from social networks not only shorten the period of stay in the Sandbox (as well as links from articles on the maximum trust sites like federal media), but also lead to active low-cost traffic - that is exactly what young projects and start-ups need.  Along with contextual advertising, links from social media posts are a response to high SEO latency.  If from the beginning of the traditional promotion of the site to its release in the top ten may take several months, the posts in social networks will bring interested visitors on the first day. <br><br>  <b>How to buy links from social networks in WebArtex</b> <br><br>  Register in the system, add the site you want to promote, go to the "Optimizer" section and click the "Order" button.  Next, click on the tab "Social". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6b/bf4/266/a6bbf42663104d10aa0663c7304a718d.png"><br><br>  In the opened tab you will see personal accounts and communities selected by a two-step scheme.  WebArtex does not include sites that have bots, as well as those created solely for the purpose of advertising.  Initially, the account is checked for compliance with the quality parameters (age, number of friends or subscribers, user activity and audience) automatically, and then manually: the WebArtex moderator checks candidates for bots and other fatal flaws.  So, you see only verified accounts and can evaluate their parameters.  <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/52">Currently,</a> Twitter, VKontakte and Youtube accounts <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/52">are available</a> , as well as VKontakte communities.  In the near future, the developers plan to add other popular social networks in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/420/fc1/e97/420fc1e97671445f98e287187df457c4.png"><br><br>  Download post content and pay for accommodation.  Payment for the post with the "perpetual link" is charged once (not monthly, but exactly once).  In the foreseeable future, the post will not disappear anywhere: WebArtex fully controls the process and immediately expels sites removing links. <br><br>  <b>Profitable traffic monetization</b> <br><br>  It is quite obvious that the owners of accounts and communities in social networks want to make money on advertising.  Successful examples of Artemy Lebedev and Ilya Varlamov showed that if one does not hide the advertising nature of posting, then, unlike the notorious ‚Äúsholademization‚Äù, that is, the publication of advertising in a hidden format, does not cause a negative audience.  The WebArtex Exchange <a href="https://webartex.ru/news/51">provides an opportunity to monetize traffic to even the most popular accounts</a> : the main thing is that they have a high-quality and ‚Äúlive‚Äù audience.  Limits: from <b>200</b> friends for personal accounts on <b>VKontakte</b> and <b>Twitter</b> , from <b>500</b> subscribers for <b>Youtube</b> , from <b>1000</b> participants for communities. <br><br>  In <b>WebArtex, there is a</b> great demand for links: it is created by more <b>than 50,000</b> optimizers and site owners.  In high-quality accounts with an adequate placement price, all advertising spaces are redeemed very quickly. <br><br>  <b>Referral program</b> <br><br>  In <b>WebArtex,</b> you can bring sites and receive a percentage of their income.  Moreover, the percentage is very generous: if the income of community owners and accounts coming through your referral link is, for example, <b>200,000</b> rubles per month, then you will receive <b>25,000</b> rubles a month. <br><br>  <b>TL; DR</b> <br><br>  Now in <b>WebArtex</b> from posts in social networks you can buy ‚Äúperpetual links‚Äù, which not only contribute to the promotion of the site in the <b>TOP-10</b> search results, but also lead to high-quality cheap traffic.  Price - from 6 rubles for accommodation.  Accounts and communities are checked manually, they all have a ‚Äúlive‚Äù audience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265555/</a></p>
