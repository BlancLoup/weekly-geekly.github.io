  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Webmoney has one of the worst tech support.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Webmoney has a service called Notify, which allows you to receive notifications about the flow / arrival of funds, the inclusion of the keeper and messages from other users of the system by mail, to the gabber, icq or sms on the phone.  It was necessary to use it as an addition to the main functions of the project, but what a bad luck - email notifications come without a comment to payments, which could identify the direction or subject matter of expenditure of funds. <br><br>  First of all, they addressed the question to the technical support by the phone number indicated <a href="http://www.wmtransfer.com/rus/about/contacts/index.shtml">here</a> .  The not quite adequate girl said that she didn‚Äôt have enough experience in solving such problems, as well as her colleagues, and advised her to contact technical support by mail at support@wmtransfer.com. <br><br>  So did.  Automation worked properly, the ticket was opened on 10/01/2009 14:57:27 with the status "expected response of the operator."  The wait has begun. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Day passed.  No one responded to the application either by mail or on the ticket itself.  We decided to add another entry "waiting for a response." <br><br>  Since the opening of the ticket, 10 days have passed, we decided to repeat the call to technical support.  A more competent employee listened to the problem twice, after which he promised to sort out the question, asking to stay on the line, but unfortunately forgot to turn off the sound.  The mouse clicks and wheel scrolling were clearly audible - the suspicion immediately crept in that the specialist was trying to familiarize himself with the services provided by his company in a short time. <br><br>  However, the fear was confirmed.  Returning to the conversation, he began to cheerfully tell what is possible and what is not in the Notify service.  From the second time, realizing that we know all of the above, and having once again understood our question and request, he disconnected again, this time not forgetting to turn off the sound. <br><br>  His answer was expected - the question was transferred to the specialist responsible for the development of the mentioned service, but definitely couldn‚Äôt say anything about the time and possibility of answering it.  He responded to the request to split up and give contacts of the persons involved in a minute, disconnecting again and advising him to contact the ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù post at all@wmtransfer.com.  The fact that this is a box of anyone, but not managers, and is available publicly on the main page of the site, it became clear after the end of the conversation. <br><br>  All the same, we have compiled a description of the question and the accompanying history of the relationship with support and sent it to this box. <br><br>  Since the opening of the ticket 16 days have passed.  There was no reply to any of the addresses, the ticket is still left without comments from Webmoney Transfer. <br><br>  What‚Äôs bad about this is not only the silence of technical support, but the fact that no-one knows what they are doing and what they are doing through accessible contacts.  One gets the feeling of utter chaos and confusion "there inside."  Frankly, we were fully able to satisfy a reasonable answer about the unrealizable function, about the limited capabilities of the service, etc., but not silence. <br><br>  Gaining strength to clarify the relationship and another assault on all of the specified addresses. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Today, 23 days after the application was submitted, a short response was received: <br><blockquote>  Unfortunately, there is no such possibility. </blockquote>  I am afraid to imagine what forces were required by Webmoney employees to clarify whether there is such a possibility or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72608/</a></p>
