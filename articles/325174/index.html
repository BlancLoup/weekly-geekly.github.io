      Now I consider myself a rather productive person, but still forced to fight procrastination, and it seems that it‚Äôs not only me who has to fight it.  This is confirmed by the results of a survey that I conducted to write this article: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>85% of</b> respondents procrastinate, at least sometimes. <br></li><li>  <b>About 25% of</b> respondents procrastinate often or very often. <br></li></ul><br>  Do you treat these 85% - or even 25% of the most avid procrastinators?  You are in good company. <br><br>  In this article, I will share a few useful tricks that I have learned over the years in the fight against procrastination: with their help, you can do the next project on time.  Believe me, next Thanksgiving you will thank me. <br><br>  <b>Transferred to <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dfight-procrastination-usually-win">Alconost</a></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/9db/0af/d019db0af8c741b5bb9cd51a3757dcfa.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Pros procrastination</b></font> </h3><br>  Before proceeding to the recommendations on combating procrastination, I consider it necessary to make a reservation that procrastination is not always bad, it has a good side. <br><br>  In fact, sometimes it makes sense to postpone the execution of the task to the last moment - with the right approach.  Let's look at the three best options. <br><br><h4>  <b>1) There is no time to think too much</b> </h4><br>  I have developed a good order of packing things for short trips, but often I puzzle over what I need to take with me on longer trips.  The more time I spend on packaging, the more I think it over and unload everything from the suitcase to repack. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, I was packing things a few days before the weekly trip to Death Valley (California).  Given that the daytime temperature there reaches 38, and the nighttime temperature can fall below zero, it is a real problem to pack properly with these extremes. <br><br>  As soon as I finished packing, I began to doubt whether I took exactly what I needed.  ‚ÄúAnd if it is colder than predicted?  What if you have to stay longer?  What if? .. ‚ÄùI myself did not notice how the suitcase stopped closing.  I had to completely repack the night before the trip, and in the end I took with me about the same set of things that I had packed at the very beginning. <br><br>  The idea to pack in advance turned to me a huge amount of wasted time.  Putting aside for the last moment tasks that you tend to get stuck in loses your time for extra reflections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/236/fd2/45a236fd2beb469cbde6e9185ab378c7.png"><br><br><h4>  <b>2) Let the dust settle</b> </h4><br>  Procrastination can also provide you with extra time to gather information about the task being performed.  When I encounter tasks that are directly affected by something beyond my control, I prefer to save my time and wait out the effect of external factors as much as possible. <br><br>  For example, if you need to integrate into an API project that is still in development, in my experience, completing the integration task before completing the development rarely makes sense.  There is too much risk that implementation details near the end of the project will change. <br><br><h4>  <b>3) Bad ideas die off.</b> </h4><br>  In the end, procrastination with respect to tasks of dubious consistency often justifies itself. <br><br>  Have you ever faced a task that you could not refuse from political or personal considerations, while realizing that this is a waste of time and effort, or just a generally bad idea?  If such a task is still sent to work, the team usually forgets about it (since it is clearly not an important one anyway) or someone eventually takes on the mind and admits that it was not worth even taking on it. <br><br>  Of course, this is not the highest moral standard, but I dealt with contracts and scenarios, where it was easier to wait until the task disappears by itself than to waste time challenging it. <br><br><h4>  <b>It only works with a conscious approach.</b> </h4><br>  Note that all three approaches work only if you make an informed decision to postpone the task for the sake of future gain, rather than just allowing it to happen. <br><br>  For example, you might think: <br><br><ul><li>  "I know that I can do this at the last minute and get the best result." <br></li><li>  ‚ÄúWith this, it‚Äôs probably worth the wait, because too much is changing.‚Äù <br></li><li>  ‚ÄúThis is a stupid idea;  I will not be in a hurry with the implementation in the hope that it will be considered unimportant. ‚Äù <br></li></ul><br>  In such situations, procrastination will not affect your ability to do everything on time;  on the contrary, in fact, it <i>will increase</i> this ability. <br><br>  In general, it happens that procrastination can be beneficial.  And what about the harm? <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Cons procrastination</b></font> </h3><br>  Postponing important feasible tasks for later has real consequences: they have to be performed in a hurry, which reduces the quality of the result.  If the delay is too great, you will not have time in time. <br><br>  Why is that bad?  Yes, because the deadlines delay other team members awaiting your work, and you run the risk of encountering a mob of disgruntled employees at your door! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b29/f1a/9d7/b29f1a9d78014d88abf5ab190ca652b7.png"><br><br>  Bad results and deadlines can lead to loss of contracts and cash costs for freelancers and consultants.  By completing tasks in a hurry, you can accidentally or consciously skip important steps. <br><br><blockquote>  The story of the rush to release a product from Caden Wilkinson ( <a href="https://twitter.com/kdawgwilk">@kdawgwilk</a> ): <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhen I was preparing to publish an iOS application in the App Store, I had been postponing all I needed to do this for too long.</i>  <i>It all ended with the fact that I forgot to check the migration of the database from the previous to the latest version, the release of which was planned, and the application crashed when launching for all users. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br>  I am sure that each of us has a similar story when a problem arose because of procrastination, which would not have happened if we started the work earlier! <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Why do you color?</b></font> </h3><br>  Understanding <i>why</i> you procrastinate a task can help determine the best way to cope with procrastination. <br><br>  The survey revealed many common reasons for procrastination, and they, oddly enough, quite accurately coincide with my own.  Here are the three most popular: <br><br><h4>  <b>1) I prokrastiniruyu, because I feel that I can not cope</b> </h4><br>  Procrastination often follows the feeling that you are not up to the task.  In this state, you want to postpone the task in the hope that later you will understand how to accomplish it.  However, you can not wait for this clarity because of the procrastination itself.  When I'm not sure about my priorities, it's easy to do unnecessary things or not to do anything at all. <br><br>  The irony of procrastination is that it feeds itself.  Tasks that appear while you are postponing others also suffer.  So it seems that you are not able to cope, which causes you to prokrastirovat even more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef0/57d/f38/ef057df38c19466a95ec91591bb3c8b6.png"><br><br>  The feeling that you can not cope, may be a consequence of uncertainty in how to begin the task.  She, in turn, may arise from poor management, attempts to leave the comfort zone or work in a project that needs better organization.  Whatever the reason, uncertainty about where to start often leads to the fact that you don‚Äôt get down to business at all. <br><br><h4>  <b>2) I will procrastinate because I don't want to do it</b> </h4><br>  Procrastination can also be a sign that you have a task that you simply don‚Äôt want to do.  The majority of survey participants noted ‚Äúlack of motivation‚Äù or ‚Äúboredom‚Äù as the main reason for their procrastination. <br><br>  You will hardly have to be encouraged if you take on something that you like or enthralls you, and it is not surprising that difficult tasks lead to procrastination. <br><br>  For example, I really need to work on my application, but - hey, hey!  - someone just liked my post on Facebook, I have to check my page immediately.  I <i>really</i> do not like to do taxes, but Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãhere, in the next room, with all these films that I have not watched, whereas the deadline for submitting reports is still <i>so</i> far ... <br><br><h4>  <b>3) I will procrastinate because I am afraid of failure</b> </h4><br>  The fear of failure often results in you constantly modifying something and revising endlessly, insisting on ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or ‚Äúone hundred percent‚Äù performance of a task before presenting the result to the world.  In fact, you just shy away from the assessment that the world will give you. <br><br>  On the implementation of the task, which you can not finish, never will judge others;  An unfinished project is not subject to evaluation or criticism.  Unpublished app will never get a single star review.  Even in the absence of formal assessments, like at a university, work projects are assessed by colleagues and supervisors, and the success (or failure!) Of these projects determines whether you are worthy of promotion and salary. <br><br>  Procrastination problems suck in very easily, but do not lose faith: people spent many years searching for solutions on how to overcome procrastination.  Read on to learn how to get yourself out of this rut ‚Äã‚Äãand get back to working condition! <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>How I struggle with procrastination - and usually win</b></font> </h3><br>  So, we figured out that procrastination can sometimes be useful, and can lead to serious problems. <br><br>  It is time to share what I promised at the beginning: the techniques developed in the years to combat procrastination, which, as a rule, allow me to defeat it!  :] <br><br>  <b>Let's talk about three techniques:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Distraction management. <br></li><li>  Time management <br></li><li>  Energy management. <br></li></ol><br>  Let's go! <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> Although the tips from this article, it seems to me, should help in your fight against procrastination, you cannot beat it overnight. <br><br>  Personally, I recognize that procrastination is my eternal enemy, and I have to take care of myself in order not to return to old habits.  No article will give you all the possible answers to defeating procrastination, but I found three things that helped me to at least curb it (for the most part). <br><br><h4>  <b>1) Distraction Management</b> </h4><br>  There are a million distractions in this world, with many of them completely within your control. <br><br>  I recommend spending some time to reduce distractions and allow yourself to concentrate directly on work.  Here are three things that worked for me: <br><br>  <b>a) Disable notifications.</b> <br>  When I set up a new computer or phone, my first step is to turn off almost all notifications. <br><br>  My employees did not immediately get used to the idea that I check mail only a few times a day, but I found out that I was better focused when no one distracted me with messages and other social notifications.  It takes quite a bit of time to turn off notifications, but you will be surprised how much time you will get in return. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b53/000/ee3/b53000ee359944ed902177690aacc6ad.png"><br><br>  <b>b) Make it difficult for yourself to enter the social network.</b> <br>  When you struggle with an error in Auto Layout, the temptation to forget about Twitter can be irresistible.  Creating at least small obstacles between you and social network tapes can really help. <br><br>  For example, log out of your Facebook account at work.  The need to log in again will serve as a constant reminder of a task that you are <i>not</i> performing. <br><br>  <b>c) Block the most active time eaters.</b> <br>  In more advanced cases, extensions are useful for selectively blocking websites that are in most browsers. <br><br>  <a href="https://marco.org/apps">Quitter</a> can close favorite applications when they are not used for some time, reducing the temptation to switch to them during work.  <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/">Cold Turkey</a> temporarily blocks tempting sites and applications for specific periods of time. <br><br><h4>  <b>2) Time Management</b> </h4><br>  Well, you have freed a lot of time, having dealt with distracting factors: how now to use it with maximum benefit?  I found out that the best way for me is to focus on managing time and the project: it really helps me control the situation and reduces the desire to prorastize.  There are many systems for managing time and projects, and each has its own approach to the problem of performing tasks.  Some are based on simple techniques and practical advice, while others offer a complete, comprehensive approach to managing your work and personal life. <br><br>  The combination of three systems works best for me: <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a> , <a href="http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/">‚Äútomato method‚Äù</a> and simple prioritization methods.  Let's look at all three. <br><br>  <b>a) Getting Things Done (GTD)</b> <br>  The basic approach of Getting Things Done, or GTD, I have been using for a long time.  For handling tasks and projects, GTD offers five steps: <br><ol><li>  Focus on what needs your attention. <br></li><li>  Clearly define what needs to be done. <br></li><li>  Put in order what you work with. <br></li><li>  Regularly review and think about the state of affairs. <br></li><li>  Act according to circumstances and priorities. <br></li></ol><br>  The most valuable feature of this technique for me is writing out what needs to be done, at the moment when it comes to my head, instead of holding all this in my ‚Äúoperative memory‚Äù.  Fixing ideas allows them, as well as subsequent tasks, to quietly visit my head, without tearing me away from what I am busy at this moment. <br><br>  The organizational aspect of GTD assumes that you start a task when you have everything you need to complete it.  Imagine that you just sit down and get to work - without first searching for files, notes, and tools.  How cool! <br><br>  The GTD approach also focuses your efforts solely on the next small task that will advance your project.  It distracts from the staggering scale of the whole thing and allows you to focus, in fact, on the implementation of the plan.  :] <br><br>  <b>b) "Tomato Method"</b> <b><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24e/276/cc7/24e276cc763046cc9d5a3a35fbc043b8.png"></b>  While GDT offers an excellent method for defining, fixing and organizing your actions, the "tomato method" forms the very environment for doing the work. <br><br>  According to the "tomato method", you divide your work time into intervals of 25 minutes, which are called "tomatoes."  During each ‚Äútomato‚Äù you work on a task, without throwing it or interrupting another activity.  After 25 minutes, you can take a short break and then start a new ‚Äútomato‚Äù. <br><br>  After finishing four ‚Äútomatoes‚Äù, you take a longer break so that your brain can process everything that you have managed to do and get ready to work on the following tasks.  Depending on what kind of work I do, I often extend or shorten 25-minute intervals to make my tasks easier.  When I write, for example, it is more convenient for me to work with ‚Äútomatoes‚Äù for 50 minutes and have a little longer rest between them. <br><br>  <b>c) Simple prioritization methods</b> <br>  GTD helps you put things in order, ‚Äúthe tomato method‚Äù - to focus, but how do you know exactly what to tackle? <br><br>  Every morning I choose three tasks that I want to finish by the end of the day.  Sometimes I know that I will not be able to cope with all three, and on other days I could do more.  But the selection process itself helps me take everything into account and select only three things that matter most to me. <br><br>  Examples of priorities are things that need to be done by a certain day, or things that you want to get out of your head, or even something that, when completed, will just make you feel good satisfaction. <br><br><h5>  <b>How does all this work together?</b> </h5><br>  Here's how all these three systems fit together with the best result for me: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The ‚Äútomato method‚Äù</b> helps me overcome inertia and get down to business.  I can work on anything for 25 minutes and almost always some progress will be noticeable during this time. <br></li><li>  <b>GTD</b> helps me not to feel powerless over complex projects, stretched for months and consisting of many unstable components that distract my attention. <br></li><li>  My <b>three priorities</b> help complete each day with a sense of satisfaction.  To feel satisfaction from the work done is very important, first of all, in order to bring the work to the end. <br></li></ul><br><h4>  <b>3) Energy Management</b> </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b98/cc3/610/b98cc361052c4256a4e70914eecc318a.png">  Have you ever felt that you simply do not have enough energy to complete a task? <br>  Personally, I noticed that at a certain time of day I have more energy, while at another time I am exhausted.  Accordingly, I try to plan tasks that require less mental or physical energy for low-energy time and leave complex tasks for those periods when my energy level will be higher. <br><br>  For example, reviews, mail, and research are for low-energy periods.  And the elimination of errors and other tasks that require high concentration of attention - for periods when there is more energy. <br><br>  If I know that I have a very intensive week ahead, I plan more complex tasks for its beginning, while I am still full of energy.  I also consider my current physical condition.  If I have a cold, these days will probably not be the best for designing a new application.  At this time, I will take up work that requires less physical and mental vitality.  If I suddenly feel a special surge of energy before dinner, I will deviate from the plan and take on a task that requires more energy. <br><br>  When I need to quickly replenish my energy in order to complete a challenging task, it‚Äôs an excellent option to get up to warm up or go for a short walk.  When I can‚Äôt concentrate at all, clearing my head for normal work in the following days is perfectly helped by a long walk in the fresh air, playing sports or even going to the forest.  Sometimes the breaks between "tomatoes" consist of short walks.  Find what restores your energy and build it into your work day. <br><br>  Despite all the planning and built processes, from time to time I still have to postpone tasks for later.  But, if I'm not hiding behind procrastination, I can postpone the task without feeling guilty. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>What's next?</b></font> </h3><br>  In this article, a lot of material for learning ... if you, of course, did not postpone its reading for later!  :] <br><br>  Fighting procrastination is not at all easy.  Everyone has their own reasons to postpone something for later.  Some of these ideas and techniques will suit you, some not so much. <br><br>  Looking for an easy way to get started?  Start by eliminating distractions.  It takes quite a bit of time to turn off notifications on the phone, and while you are messing with the phone, you will also make fun!  Also close all applications and programs that you do not need to work on your computer.  When 23 applications stop demanding your attention, you will see an immediate increase in concentration. <br><br>  Share your experience with procrastination in the comments? <br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dfight-procrastination-usually-win">localization of applications, games and sites</a> in 62 languages.
