  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The complexity of the person in the interaction with technology in different stages of life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A person living a life often changes his attitude to the world.  At first, he thought it was necessary, then he realized that it was better in another way.  Today I want to talk about the stages of human life and its relationship to the world, to technology.  I do not have psychological or philosophical formations, but I think with the below-mentioned schemes many will agree, since they are simple and understandable, and in many respects even known. <br>  I want to raise the old problem of ages and attitudes towards something new.  I think that the information will be mainly useful for interface designers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Nz77prXnLGs/TC-uWGJun8I/AAAAAAAAAgU/KM7uApzcu1c/Zizn_etapi.png" alt="A life"><br><br>  Periods of life of an ordinary person are divided into 2 stages. I want to create and I have to consume. <br>  In the first stage, a person wants to create, wants to improve the world, wants to work.  Everything new is better.  Updates, news, activity - these are the words of this time. <br>  In the second case, the person is tired, he does not want anything, but in order to survive he has to act.  At the stage of consumption, a person is fed up with everything, he constantly forgets and understands for a long time, it is difficult to perceive new information.  Life is more like torment than joy. <br>  The first group, unaware of the existing differences, often scoffs and mocks the second.  For example, have you ever said: <br><ul><li>  This person does not distinguish between ‚ÄúWhat is the Internet?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhat is a browser?‚Äù.  Here is an idiot! </li><li>  This person is using IE, although you can INSTALL a more modern and faster browser.  Let him suffer. </li></ul><br>  With my grandfather‚Äôs example, this is easy to understand.  He used to be smart and resourceful.  Now he calls every week to find out how to switch channels on the TV, because now with two remotes (one from the TV, the other from the satellite) it is difficult to figure out what where.  And talk about a variety of settings and options and not necessary.  If there were buttons on the TV There, Here, Louder, Hush, Off / On, then life would be much simpler.  Need to do easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f1/4ea/517/4f14ea51778214da9f5bc04e49c362ef.png" alt="image">

      <i>Examples of overloaded and simple interfaces</i> <br><br>  But why, then, it's common people and ordinary people often don't understand each other.  For this, I made a different schedule. <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Nz77prXnLGs/TC-uWDVQ_JI/AAAAAAAAAgY/IvQh-iXY-X0/Zizn_etapi_IT.png" alt="IT's life"><br><br>  It differs in that inventions begin earlier, occur more intensively and end later.  The general similarity is that the active person at the end will get bored.  Of course, it is not necessary that in old age you will hate everything, but for most it is.  Naturally for each person life paths are different, but they have an approximate similarity. <br>  So I think next time, when a regular user will look at you in perplexity, not understanding what they want from him, and you will be indignant that the user does not distinguish the words Internet, browser and Yandex, recalling this article, say not ‚ÄúWell, you and noob ", and" Yes, now the interfaces are not sufficiently developed.  But you better understand this. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98187/</a></p>
