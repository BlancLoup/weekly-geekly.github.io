The matter is not the simplest: the specialized subtitle editor for some unknown reason did not work, it was necessary to edit the subtitle file separately, constantly reloading it in the video player. <br>  The exhaustion from the monotonous occupation turned into an apple and fell on a friend‚Äôs head.  The idea that was born as a result, I wrote down (something with some fantasy), and I am about to tell you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How are we working with files today (it will be about user files - text documents, video records, photos, etc.)?

      We store them in the file system, into which they fall from different programs, we shift them from place to place, sometimes we lose and look for <sup>3</sup> , then we open them with other programs, change, save, shift, delete. <br><br>  In fact, the user works as a part of the file system, as an interface slave, as an organizer-transmitter.  This is despite the fact that such a routine is really avoided, and there are ready-made examples - say, software packages from Adobe and Apple.  The photo categorizer takes pictures from the camera, sorts, and can directly transfer the selected frame to retouching to the photo editor program, and then return it back for storage or upload to the Internet.  The user is not even obliged to open the file manager. <br><br>  But there is no such integration outside the <em>packages</em> .  Rather, it occurs, but the user is forced to create it on their own - using scripts or plug-ins to programs.  Why not implement it at the <em>operating system</em> level? <br><br>  How comfortable it would be!  One of the possible scenarios: a torrent client (or a client of a multimedia online store) downloads a movie, broadcasts it to a media library, it indexes everything properly, lets the user know ‚ÄúYour movie has downloaded!‚Äù.  The user says that he wants to watch the movie, the library transfers the file to the player.  While viewing the user notices an interesting moment and decides to make an animated userpic out of it.  At his command, the movie file from the player is transferred to the video editor, the user cuts out a fragment, which is transmitted to a graphic editor for compression in .GIF.  The movie file is returned to the player, and the ready user floats to the Internet browser. <br><br>  To do this, the torrent client must know that there is a media library on the computer, it must be aware of the player, and he, in turn, must get acquainted with the video editor, etc.  Now it is not too easy, especially - if they are all created by different development teams. <br>  How to help them?  Probably need some details: <br><br><ol><li>  Standard I / O modules provided by the operating system ‚Äî so that one small utility (useful, but short) cannot break a long pipeline of work on a file.  The program should be able to accept files not only through the menu ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù or drag-n-drop, but also directly from another program, and this mechanism its author should not invent independently from zero.  No program should become a dead end from which the user behind his file can only retreat to the file manager. </li><li>  Such a system of registration of programs installed in the system, in which a new program not only tells which files it can open, but also what it can do with them. </li><li>  Open file formats that are understandable to all programs that participate in file-sharing - otherwise it simply will not work. </li><li>  For each program - the standard file transfer menu for further processing.  This menu lists the options for the manipulations that can be performed on this file, and the names of the tool programs.  Each program installed and registered as a file handler of a given type can add itself to this menu. </li><li>  Much more, what I do not even suspect. </li></ol><br><br>  I want to see a truly <em>intelligent</em> interaction between programs.  So that, say, the utility for recording discs, having received a movie at the entrance, compared its size with the proposed disc, informed the user that the film would not take it completely, turned to the media library and suggested how to ‚Äúfinish off‚Äù the disc, using the space as efficiently as possible. .  At the same time it is useful for the media library to know which films have already been recorded and which ones are waiting for the creation of a ‚Äúhard copy‚Äù.  Another example: an Internet browser that received a .JPG input from a graphic editor should understand that it is asked not to show a picture on the screen, but to substitute it in a form for publication. <br><br>  All this is an attempt to change the principle of communication with the computer: instead of messing around with materials (files) endlessly, sorting and preparing them, we can spend more time using the tools (programs) for the intended purpose. <br>  I hope that readers will either say that all this has already been implemented and works perfectly, or they will show why the idea is unrealizable, or ... what if there is someone among them who can put it into practice? <br><br><hr><br><br>  <sup>1</sup> LJ-user <a href="http://albin_.livejournal.com/">albin_</a> invented, LJ-user <a href="http://lead-and-aether.livejournal.com/">lead_and_aether</a> retold. <br>  <sup>2</sup> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0963194/">Repo!</a>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0963194/">The Genetic Opera</a> <br>  <sup>3</sup> Lost file?  Trying to open it through the "Last Documents" menu of the program, but does it say "File not found"?  So this is because you renamed or moved the file while the program was closed.  Go now to the file system, look for it. <br>  And why would the file system (after all, she has all the moves recorded) do not report when starting the program: ‚ÄúComrade program!  During your absence, the following files entrusted to you were moved and renamed ...;  their new location ...
