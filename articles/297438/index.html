  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile Marketing Trends 2016, Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The year is coming to an end, and for mobile marketers it was both exciting and hectic. <br>  Despite the fact that mobile advertising costs are projected to be more than $ 100 billion in the coming year, in early 2016, a sudden increase in the chances of ad blocking gives many in this industry a cause for concern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49b/e20/7f7/49be207f764f4e478e21439441c74943.png"><br><br>  One thing can be said for sure now: <b>mobile devices have become an integral part of our life and new advances in technology continue to strengthen this connection with consumers with their device</b> .  However, we have also become more demanding in our experience in everyday use of modern technologies, including mobile devices, and therefore for advertisers the task still remains difficult and rather vague (a kind of tilled field of both capabilities and unknown tools turns mobile marketing in a rather thorny way for a marketer).

      <b>1. Ad blocking</b> <br><br>  With the release of Apple iOS 9 at the beginning of this year, the ability to block ads has become a much more discussed topic. <a name="habracut"></a>  The reason why people block ads is the need to avoid interruption and annoyance from using their mobile device.  In the UK, the ad blocking rate increased from 15% to 18% between June and October 2015. Most publishers now consider this the most significant threat to their business (65%), advertising from scammers (35%), the growth of brands and agencies as creators content (35%). <br><br>  Ad blocking is considered a major threat to UK publishers. <br><br>  For 2016, it is expected that the discussion will continue.  In this case, a much larger number of marketers and publishers will take appropriate measures.  Despite the fact that mobile applications are not yet affected and advertising cannot be blocked in the application (which will give them a significant boost next year), publishers will begin to refuse users to place content on their resources due to threats of blocking.  This tactic is already being tested in The Washington Post, and in the meantime, Yahoo has taken a step towards stopping ad blocking for users when they view their email. <br><br>  <b>2. Targeting, review and research</b> <br><br>  Most mobile marketing platforms currently provide some form of targeting and reporting regarding the rotation of the ad campaigns themselves.  Targeting the right target audience at the right time (by location, gender, age, store visits, etc.) is already an impressive value for a strategy to achieve goals.  According to the Research Association, geo-targeting opportunities have given a tremendous boost to CTR performance, reaching almost twice the increase in CTR (industry average). <br><br>  By ‚Äúhooking‚Äù the right consumer at the right time, ultimately targeted and more accurate targeting gives companies a better chance of being noticed.  We expect that setting up these advertisements will not only help to please the user in searching the browser history, but will also determine his mood in the future. <br>  Marketers can begin to build their own information gathering platforms for consumers, given advanced targeting.  Beacon technology, which, for example, allows retailers to inform customers on mobile devices, has already been tested and successfully tested.  Sending an appropriate offer to consumers at the right time will help in even more accurate search results. <br>  The availability of mobile advertising visibility has increased this year.  Companies such as InMobi have increased product visibility to 100%, ensuring that ads are viewed by consumers.  Sizmek research earlier this year determined that visibility on mobile phones is higher than that of desktop computers, including advertising banners, flash banners, and high-resolution devices. <br><br>  However, measuring the quality of mobile advertising remains one of the biggest challenges for 2016, since advertising technologies are still fairly new and the measurement rules are not clearly defined.  The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) completed the development of a set of standard rules in the Mobile Advertising Dimension Guidelines and suggested some uniformity, but expanding the reach of mobile devices makes tracking and evaluating efforts even more difficult. <br><br>  Executive Director Marchex reports: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>As mobile advertising budgets continue to grow, we need to keep in mind that brands and agencies require good accountability.</i>  <i>These results confirm that effective measurement and definition of mobile advertising is a serious problem, and we expect the growing demand for analytics to help autonomize these actions</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  With the rest of the trends in mobile marketing for 2016, you can find out soon in the next publication. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297438/</a></p>
