Accordingly, the desire to see something in High Res also sometimes arises.  And at home on the TV there is <b>HDMI</b> , which sometimes needs to be shown something. <br></li><li>  Full keyboard.  I haven't looked at the keys for a long time.  But the man who invented in my old Acer to save me from the full arrows and keys Home, End, PgDn and PgUp - he clearly wanted to make me ill.  NEVER more!  Because I could not get used to this misery for two years. <br></li></ol>

      My expectations from <a href="http://msi.com/product/nb/S12T.html">MSI S12 were</a> completely justified, so I wanted to be sure to share, all of a sudden someone will come in handy too.  Under the cut, of course, there will be some photos, YouTube videos, campaigning, provocations and other information about how I see the ‚Äú <b>correct netbook</b> ‚Äù and why this instance is exactly ‚Äúit‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - <br><br>  I would also like to have: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Hard</b> matrix <b>cover</b> .  Before that, I had an Acer Aspire One AO725.  It was very scary to watch how it ‚Äúpushes‚Äù during closing and, especially, opening. <br></li><li>  <b>LAN</b> port and <b>3 USB</b> ports.  It was once two - it was not enough.  It used to be four, but not necessary, since in this case it was already easier to buy a hub.  It is desirable to have <b>USB 3.0</b> at least one of them.  LAN is required, as WiFi in the "field" conditions may not be. <br></li><li>  The ability to quickly disassemble and assemble.  It is important for me, because I like to look inside, I like to change what I don‚Äôt like.  For a guarantee, I usually ‚Äúput it on the device‚Äù within a couple of hours after purchase.  Therefore, the device should not be expensive, as I would be sorry if I suddenly break it.  And I do not want to get upset over trifles.  I'd rather fix it myself, if that, without this dreary wait from a service center with unclear prospects. </li><li>  The ability to "live" without battery for several hours.  No need ten, at work I have a power outlet, and at home too.  Just not to sweat about the battery for some normal time.  Sit in a cafe for a cup of coffee on the way to work, and then do not turn off the beech, so as not to load again on arrival.  Or watch a movie on TV without plugging in an adapter.  Or show a presentation at a meeting with the customer.  Three hours, I do not need more.  In this case, it is also desirable that the full charge time is two to three times less than the discharge time. <br></li><li>  Microphone input, I sometimes write music. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>&lt;Lyrics&gt;</b> <br>  I had to spend a lot of time on the <a href="http://market.yandex.ru/">Yandex Market</a> , <a href="http://newmans.ru/">Newmans</a> , <a href="http://citilink.ru/">Citilink</a> and other places to <a href=""><b>find a</b></a> solution that could please me.  But, it was worth it, although I ordered it from an <a href="http://rnd.utinet.ru/note/spo/showcase/node/2379223/">online store</a> , as we, in Rostov-on-Don, simply did not have anywhere at the time of searching for these devices. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A bunch of whining</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Still strained by the fact that all contextual advertising has now begun to try to sell me my already found beech.  And from those sites where I did not even go.  Of course, it was decided to clean Cookies, but since I didn‚Äôt want to figure out where and what from, I lost many valuable things. <br><br>  In addition, at the time of collection, the logistics company of the store refused to open the box before payment.  Hour negotiations with the store did not lead to anything, although at the time of the order, the operator swore and swore that I would not just be able to open, but I would be able to make sure that the entrails are the ones you need.  I had to take the risk - it was very scary, since the snowball wasted time if there was a brick there suddenly, it grew very uncommonly. <br><br>  Another disadvantage to the store‚Äôs karma was that they didn‚Äôt meet the delivery deadlines.  They referred to the logistics company and the May holidays.  After waiting for the cherished SMS all the tenth of May, I lost the precious opportunity to eat roasted meat with friends.  As a result, had to stay without lunch on a working day.  And I received nothing except a telephone apology and some bonuses for the next order, it is insulting. <br><br>  In general, it turned out somehow too angry.  You expect a normal relationship, but in the end you get only some kind of apology, which could simply not be if everyone did their job as expected.  It is, of course, understandable that ‚Äúfirst achieve it,‚Äù but it‚Äôs somehow already tired, all the same twenty-first century in the yard, and you can already, in the end, start reading some correct books. <br><br>  Although, of course, the girls are all polite and pleasant, and in vain I brought them to the state of "do not take the tube", because there really was not a brick.  I called them back later, said thank you, that everything is fine, I wished you successful work - the sound of a plate that fell from my shoulders was clearly heard in the receiver ... <br><br>  Also, the advantages of this store should certainly include a more than adequate price, a very convenient site and a desire to understand the problem with the operator. <br><br></div></div> <b>&lt;Lyrics /&gt;</b> <br><br>  Having finished with emotions, I will pass to a subject. <br><br>  For those who do not want to read anything, but want everything at once, I recommend watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3DMSI%2BS12">videos from Youtube</a> .

So it happened.  From positive things about packaging, I can only say that black color in my opinion looks stylish, and the presence of a pen is convenient.  On board the box was a complete specification, and the matrix lid was closed with a cloth that can be reused as a cover for it, if you want to be as careful as possible and do not scratch the gloss during transport. <br><br>  I ordered it on May 5, it came on May 12, that is, I have it for almost a week. <br><br>  <b>&lt;Feelings&gt;</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Full <b>keyboard</b> - a dream come true!  It occupies 2/3 of the plane, so the Touchpad does not deserve attention, it just is, they sacrificed it to make the keys the correct size. </li><li>  <b>The matrix is</b> very pleasant to look at, although not IPS, but there is no pixelation at all.  Viewing angles are also very much, sitting in a half-turn there are no changes at all, then it is also very "visible".  Gloss, however, glare slightly, but - this is normal. </li><li>  The aluminum die cap is Must Have.  Reliably </li><li>  The location of the headphone jack in the lower right corner is Best! </li><li>  Power connector in the top left.  The power supply is small and light.  The only thing that he has a thick cord from the unit to the outlet, and a connector with a euro plug.  I do not know about you, but I'm not comfortable.  Already found a compatible unit from ASUS on the radio market for 900 rubles. </li></ul><br><br>  I see no point in comparing with Intel‚Äôs laptops on a CPU, since these are solutions of a different level in general.  Anyone who understands why you need Linux, who read the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù by Charles Pezold and understands how it works, it will be clear that 4 Kabini kernels under Linux is an acceptable solution compared to 2 cores from Intel Mobile under Microsoft. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Although, of course, if you wish ... But the price tag is still.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Lenovo THINKPAD X230 <br>  Lenovo THINKPAD X230 Tablet <br>  Lenovo THINKPAD X240 Ultrabook <br><br>  Lenovo, by the way, has another Lenovo ThinkPad Edge e145, it is one on one like this. <br>  I thrashed for a long time, but the aluminum cap and the second screw won. <br></div></div><br><br>  Intel's "gain" from two memory channels, according to various estimates, gives a gain of 10-15% with typical use.  But - this is in theory.  In practice, budget-comparable models in Intel solutions will have DDR3 10600, rather than the 12800 used here.  By the way, AMD's memory controller is also compatible with lower slat frequencies, if needed.  That is, this "gain" at comparable prices of products will be very, very doubtful.  And, I note that AMD A4-5000 uses 2 slots per channel, while Intel's mobiles in the same conditions just have 2 channels.  What is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù to address ‚Äúall‚Äù memory on one bus, or on two?  In my opinion - the simpler, the better. <br><br>  And again, in comparable Intel solutions, you will have a maximum of 8 Gb.  It is clear that it seems like more and not necessary.  And I need, I have tasks such that I need Memory.  This is, for example, In Memory DB under Node.JS.  You may notice that there is an SSD, you can also make SWAP more.  But believe it or not, it‚Äôs not that. <br><br>  For me personally, Intel‚Äôs ‚Äúbudget‚Äù solutions, which can be compared at cost, look ‚Äúdismal.‚Äù  The graphics here are two times better.  I think that putting Windows on this laptop in general is a mistake.  And its modifications with touch screen are solutions that are understandable, for example, if you develop Soft under Touch.  By the way, there will be 10 finger touch. <br><br>  The ability to install a second screw for me is also a big plus.  Those who have no SSD yet, it is quite possible to buy a budget mSATA and insert it next to the factory screw.  SSD of this machine gives a double increase, it is simply physically necessary if you are going to do something, like software development.  Heavy Cal.  mat.  tasks like editing a computer, of course, will not pull, but NetBeans is spinning quite acceptable here. <br><br>  There is also a PCI bus multiplier in the BIOS, I‚Äôll tell you about it separately ... The fact is that, as rightly written in the comments on the market, the WiFi controller is bad here, especially if you have Linux.  It is built on the RTL8723ae chip.  Under Linux, this is ‚Äúbida, pichal‚Äù, because  it will <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsRealTek">not start</a> .  On Windows, everything will be ‚ÄúOk right away‚Äù.  But under Debian \ Ubuntu \ Mint, this card can be seen and defined on all the latest kernels without problems, but it itself ‚Äúpoint-blank‚Äù does not see a single network, and does not connect to the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù ones.  Since I didn‚Äôt manage to ‚Äúwin‚Äù the drivers running in the system, or ‚Äúget‚Äù drivers from the source codes found in various forums, it was decided to install another WiFi module. <br><br>  At first I bought a WiFi whistle <a href="http://www.dns-shop.ru/catalog/i155224/adapter-besprovodnoj-tp-link-tl-wn725n.html">TP-Link TL-WIN725N</a> .  By the way, a great device.  Compact, the network on 802.11n holds as stated, despite the microscopic size of the components (I took apart and looked).  The chip in it, too, RealTek, but the drivers got together and got up on this one here is the second <a href="http://interface31.ru/tech_it/2013/06/ustanovka-wi-fi-adaptera-v-ubuntu.html">link from google</a> .  The downside is that when updating the kernel, they will need to make &amp;&amp; make install again, this is normal, but it does not suit me. <br><br>  Since  I took S12 to replace my already old Acer Aspire One AO725 on an AMD C-60 stone, then I decided to just pull out the WiFi module from it, because the drivers for most Atheros chips in Linux are plowing.  But, it did not start ... Thinking a little bit of my head, I got into the BIOS and changed the bus multiplier from 32 to 128 cycles.  Voila :) <br><br>  Having made sure that it is possible to deal with WiFi, I still do not want to leave the old laptop without it, by simple search and based on the data <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCardsIntel">from here</a> it was decided to replace WiFi with the <a href="http://www.citilink.ru/catalog/net_equipment/netcards/859525/">INTEL 2230BNHMW</a> module. <br><br>  By the way, S12 understands very simple.  After removing the battery and the cover replacing the HDD and SO-DIMM, then unscrew all the screws ‚Äúin a circle‚Äù and remove the bottom cover.  The cogs are located strictly down, there are no side and other things, it is convenient.  In order to ‚Äúpry‚Äù a mediator for the guitar helps a lot, although the latches are not tight.  Be careful, because  the outputs for sound ‚Äúhinder‚Äù a little to remove the bottom cover, you just have to push them slightly into the wall.  From the loops you need to "fold" only one, which goes to the USB attached to the bottom being removed, and not to the board.  Yes, there is a heat pipe for CPU Cooler and a turbine :) <br><br>  Disassembled in the store, tk.  this is really a matter of five minutes.  It got up right away, on the multiplier 32. Wonderful WiFi 300N and BlueTooth 4.0 from the very inventor of WiFi.  The feeling was as if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt">Usain Bolt</a> ran over a hundred meter.  WiFi from Intel together with AMD stone, to which the technology reached :) The subsequent home testing didn‚Äôt reveal any problems either. <br><br>  I immediately replaced the thermal cement, but did not get a win, apparently the tube's heat capacity and turbine performance still take place.  The fan, that is, works quietly.  Not that he is not audible at all, but he is not annoying.  By the standards of Intel Based people, the stone, of course, will be lukewarm.  Without a load of 54-57, and with a load, the fan simply turns on and does not allow it to grow above 60. But this is quite normal for AMD.  Linux gives me that the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù temperature will be 70 degrees, and the shutdown will be at 100. For AMD, this is ok, there is nothing to fear.  My old C-60 worked in the range of 69-85 and turned off at 93 (it was a couple of times under the default windows that stood, because Acer saved a lot on the cooler there).  Here, the cooler is quite, everything is OK.  In addition, the <a href="http://lm-sensors.org/wiki/Devices">lm-sensors specs</a> suggest that everything will be fine on the latest kernels.  So I‚Äôll probably just wait for Mint 17 (June, sort of), or try Ubuntu 14.10. <br><br>  Yes, I also threw a memory bandwidth of 4 gigabytes and put in an <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/solid-state-drives-335-series.html">SSD</a> .  Naturally, because  I have Linux, I didn‚Äôt talk about any ‚Äúreinstallation‚Äù, and it all worked as before, just an order of magnitude faster. <br><br>  Subjectively, I now almost have a MacBook Air 11. The truth weighs a little more, 1.3 kg, not 1.1, and not so ‚Äústylish.‚Äù<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But then I have a normal keyboard, I can disassemble and assemble my computer in 5 minutes, and I can install 2 times more memory than on Air, and I don‚Äôt have Intel.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It remains to make it better than Air! To do this, you need to replace the stock matrix 1366x768, something Full HD. The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãremoved even faster than the case is disassembled. Just pick a decorative panel with a pick in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera and lead in a circle. There is nothing to fear, the latch is even easier. The matrix rests on four cogs, and the train leads only to it. The inscriptions on the sticker Model: M116XW05-V1FH, SN: FE104B116CZ01407. There is also an important E204356. Search by model suggests that you need to learn Korean. It's good that Chrome can translate old ladies. Since I did not find anything sane, I began to look for compatible Full HD. By tyke method I realized that I needed to search for compatible with 116XW05 on </font></font><a href="http://www.panelook.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">panelook</font></font></a> .   n116hse-ea1  TOP-FHD-116L-FLR-S. ,       N-.   , ,     .   30-pin LVDS,      .   ‚Äî   ,   ‚Äî . <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">  </b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30b/c35/0a0/30bc350a02590484e11236beeecbc59b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/54a/87d/bdd54a87d9589cc2c406db3ee0fac8cb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/887/a9a/1af/887a9a1afe3c0f7fcadc042ff21a7d4e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d90/ae3/171/d90ae317139c93196717e24132fb3a99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b3/2c0/34b/3b32c034b317196438c344496dda1e67.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d90/5c2/1ac/d905c21ac4dab78d1525af06455a6141.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><br> <b>&lt;  / &gt;</b> <br><br>   ,     ,   ‚Äî   ,       :) <br>   , . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223133/</a></p>
