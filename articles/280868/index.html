    <blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/njBVcW">VMware Tools Overview</a></b> </blockquote>  VMware virtualization technologies, on the basis of which the <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">IT-GRAD</a> public <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">cloud</a> is built, allow you to protect critical applications and data, ensure business continuity without the need to interrupt work and allocate specific time for maintenance through automatic disaster recovery of IT services.  VM Tools is a set of utilities that improves the performance of the guest OS of the virtual machine and improves its management.  In this article we will look at existing VM Tools, their types and talk about their useful properties. <cut><br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/280862/">The most interesting of the vSphere 6 arsenal</a></b> </blockquote>  About the sixth version of the VMware vSphere family of products for server virtualization.  In this release, the company not only managed to increase the quantitative indicators of virtual machines (memory, processors), but also add other interesting innovations. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/276805/">Our introduction to Cisco UCS</a></b> </blockquote>  The Cisco United Computing System (UCS) is a platform for modern data centers that combines computing and network resources, access to storage systems and virtualization tools into a single system and can significantly reduce the cost of operating data centers.  Let's look at the models that IT-GRAD has already met. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/IEsvZT">IaaS Virtual Storage</a></b> </blockquote>  In this post, we‚Äôll talk about the key features of NetApp virtual storage called the ONTAP Storage Virtual Machine (SVM).  You will learn about the SVM internals, how SVMs are created, and what you should know about the number of SVMs in a cluster. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vcloud-connector-gibridnoe-oblako-na-praktike-dlya-vsphere/">vCloud Connector: hybrid cloud in practice for vSphere</a></b> </blockquote>  It covers the basic vCloud Connector functionality and features of the vCenter Server Appliance.  A case study: a bunch of local infrastructure vSphere client companies and public cloud vCloud Director of the company IT-CITY (you can read the instructions on creating and configuring virtual machines in VMware vCloud Director here). <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/276807/">Virtualization and Virtual Data Centers: Basic Questions</a></b> </blockquote>  A data center is a single multi-component system that includes everything you need for a business: storage, network, computing resources.  In order for the business to develop as quickly as possible, you need to transform these resources into a data center that satisfies ever-changing needs and does not fail in emergency and unforeseen situations.  The article describes how to solve these problems. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277971/">How the VMware cloud works, as well as networking and network connectivity</a></b> </blockquote>  Recently, server-based virtualization platforms have become one of the most popular ways to deploy applications in data centers.  The article reveals the issues of VMware cloud implementation and networking. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/280864/">The near future of cloud technology and virtualization</a></b> </blockquote>  Clouds are waiting for a turning point, since many of the emerging technologies are already being implemented everywhere - over the next few years, approaches to the creation and operation of data centers will change beyond recognition.  About what the future holds for the clouds, read this article. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/dYqPFk">VMware Virtual SAN 6.1 Storage Cluster Configuration for Remote Office</a></b> </blockquote>  It discusses the solution architecture for creating VMware Virtual SAN 6.1 storage clusters.  This product allows you to solve many problems, among which is the organization of geographically stretched cluster storage between data centers, as well as the deployment of two node cluster storage, which is managed using a single console VMware vCenter Server. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/3Fbw7H">Virtual data center: virtualization levels</a></b> </blockquote>  The virtual data center model is often represented as layers arranged one above the other.  They are interdependent and together ensure the correct operation of the data center.  Resources at each level are pooled for later use by the hypervisor as directed by the administrator.  Let's take a closer look at the main layers of virtualization. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/250499/">How SSD caching by means of a hypervisor in the VMware cloud works</a></b> </blockquote>  VMware, with the release of VMware vSphere 5.1, announced several new initiatives in the field of virtual machine data storage, including the possibility of using a distributed cache on SSD-drives of local disks of ESXi servers.  This technology later became the full-featured vSphere Flash Read Cache (vFRC) feature of the VMware vSphere 5.5 platform.  It is time to consider this quite working tool in more detail. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/Q87uNe">IaaS and virtual data center against VPS and VDS</a></b> </blockquote>  In the modern world of abbreviations and technologies, it is quite easy to get lost in the wilds of VPS, VDS, VCD, ESX and others.  It became especially unclear with the options of virtual and cloud hosting: only people got used to different SaaS and IaaS, as virtual hosting technologies again became popular.  For this reason, this material deals with the differences between the virtual hosting of servers and the virtual data center. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/AAeFf9">Virtual data center and private cloud: what is the difference</a></b> </blockquote>  Although virtualization is a key technology in the private cloud, they are not synonymous.  The main differences between the two technologies. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/oNnl1q">NetApp and VMware Integration: Clones for Developers</a></b> </blockquote>  This article will discuss the benefits of integrating VMware virtualization environments with NetApp storage systems.  In particular, VAAI technology and connectivity options in software development projects will be considered. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/sniiBE">In the footsteps of the past VMworld Europe 2015</a></b> </blockquote>  Report on the trip "IT-GRAD" on VMworld.  All the most interesting from all venues of the event.  This material focuses on the technical parts of the event as the most interesting to the reader. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/279229/">Few of the containers</a></b> </blockquote>  What are containers, and why their size is more than necessary.  Guide to the creation of the smallest containers - microcontainers. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/276295/">Some areas of file system development</a></b> </blockquote>  The history of data management systems dates back to the advent of magnetic tapes, but they acquired a modern look with the advent of magnetic disks - progress never stands still.  A look at what the future of file systems could be. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/r62Gax">Cloud technologies for everyone: IaaS and SaaS for small, medium and large organizations</a></b> </blockquote>  The beauty of the cloud is that any company, regardless of size, can use it.  But the choice of specific cloud tools still depends on the size of the business.  How best to use the cloud in your company?  With the help of VMware virtualization technologies, IT-GRAD offers you to build exactly the server configuration that you need at the current time. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/72LlD4">Containers or virtual machines - which is better to choose for your company</a></b> </blockquote>  Yes, containers allow you to fit much more applications on one physical server than any virtual machine.  Virtual machines take up a lot of system resources.  Each of them contains not only the operating system, but also the virtual equipment necessary for operation.  But the question is somewhat more complicated than ‚Äúwhere will more applications fit‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="http://goo.gl/7EYK6p">Cloud Management with VMware vRealize Operations Insight</a></b> </blockquote>  VMware vRealize Operations Insight includes VMware vRealize Operations Manager, VMware vRealize Log Insight and vRealize Infrastructure Navigator.
