  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laser vision correction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rightly believing that the information can be useful to many residents of the Internet and Habr in particular, I can not share my successful (at the moment, after about two weeks, I can only judge this) the experience of passing through the above procedure, namely laser vision correction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The last * twenty years have passed for me under the sign of progressive myopia, finally stopping at around -6.25 / -6.25, and once I got tired of it all: I got tired of trying to find glasses in the morning to touch;  tired of regularly putting / removing lenses;  tired, in the end, to buy them regularly.  And, of course, tired of being eternal bespectacled in the eyes of others, wherever without it. <br><br>  Through the Internet and my wife with medical education, the best clinic of this profile was found in the country of my residence - <a href="http://www.gzzoc.com/">‚ÄúDepartment of Ophthalmology at the University.</a>  <a href="http://www.gzzoc.com/">Sun Yat-sen ‚Äùin Guangzhou / PRC</a> , the price tag for such procedures is (~ $ 1,700), one and a half to two times higher than the national average, which is naturally not without reason: taking into account the quality of technical equipment and personnel, among which professors and others predominate with 20+ years of ophthalmologic practice, one of which is generally the first to carry out laser correction in the country and, as a result, safety, comfort and quality resulting from all this, such an overestimation is fully justified, in my opinion . <br><br>  In short: from the call with the question ‚Äúwhen can I come to you‚Äù to, directly, the operation, passed, if my memory serves me, something for about a week: on the first day a standard check of visual acuity and fundus and something was done still, on the third, the verification is already direct for the possibility of a correction and, if it is still possible, by what method (to my surprise, there were several of them. But here I just said ‚Äúmake me sa-a-am the best of the suitable ones and I will be happy ", so with a choice for a long time to think not  It was done), and on the fifth and sixth (sorry, I do not remember exactly), in fact, everything was done.  More about the most interesting, namely about the process.

      On the morning of the day D, through a thick mechanized door that opens with a rfid ID by a nurse approaching her, you enter the ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù of the operating room, in which you wear a sort of green robe and plastic hat over your clothes with the help of the same nurse.  Having dressed, through the second such door you get into the training room, where, in complete silence, five more volunteers sit and are nervous.  Only then I realized that this was done, for sure, on purpose, because you see what will happen to you even before you try it personally, as well as the fact that it is not at all scary and painless.  In this room, you will be prepared for further action: they thoroughly wash their eyes and fill the four times with anesthetic droplets, after which they will pass (through another thick automatic door) into the sparkling whiteness directly to the operating room, where they will offer to lie down on the couch under a large and scary device. <br><br>  Another couple of drops of anesthesia and we proceed: all you need is to lie quietly and try not to move your eyes (however, random movements are not terrible, because the position of the eye is monitored by equipment with a frequency of&gt; 9000 times per second).  Look at the red dot.  The surgeon pushes something very briefly on the eye, except for pressure, absolutely nothing is felt.  The green laser turns on (which looks just like a flash) accompanied by knocking and clicking sounds and smells like burnt hair.  A minute later, the first eye is finished and the same thing is repeated with the second.  For the whole procedure from start to finish - no more than 5 minutes.  You get up from the couch, they close your eyes with plates with holes and politely send them home with a request to come in tomorrow morning.  By the way, through the holes it is already possible to clearly and clearly see the world around us and begin to rejoice and communicate with those who came to the consultation about how cool it is and in general :) But ... But after that anesthesia takes place for half an hour and the uniform disgrace begins - I called it one and a half hours hell: the wildest pain / pain in the eyes, accompanied by salty tears that can not be wiped (remember the plates, I only then realized that they were made on purpose so as not to be tempted to rub the eyes) ... Well, I had a hotel booked across the road, zash  I looked at the windows, took a couple of painkillers and fanned my face with improvised means and survived (at lunch), and by evening I already wrote my adventures to friends on Skype and Asechka from a mobile android, interfere. <br><br>  In the morning of the next day, everyone who had operated on the day before came to the removal of the plates and shared with those who are just waiting for their impressions.  Plates - wear overnight in the next week.  Drip several kinds of drops.  A week later - to check.  And that's all.  Hello, my new eyes. <br><br>  Of the post-effects now there is a rather strong ‚Äúblur‚Äù around direct light sources, which, as they say, will come to naught within six months.  But even if it does not come down, it is immeasurably better than what is described in one of the first paragraphs of this post. <br><br>  A few photos, despite the terrible phone quality: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/60bcc300/31c9ddb1/f7f9e05a/89a9ce17.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/da0fa232/232a1846/c92b4e34/686659be.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/280c17dd/0f668113/3fa3d3a2/b47e495a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/13fca6de/5d77fa7e/b08393a6/e4b89088.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/74e78385/8c5908ae/9d36a526/9c957525.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9ec36eb5/1f0062a7/64fa7fee/86100935.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4976ac21/0970f740/a74b8af1/abdea1bb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c4099e04/22f7532c/9270a560/d2361fab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fbe2e02d/30483832/628c60cb/06cdfaa5.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114965/</a></p>
