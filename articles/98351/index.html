Especially given the number of various online services and other free software that allows you to get a translation of the entire phrase or individual words.  It is clear that there is a problem with rare languages, but we are talking about the most common and popular in Russia - English and, probably, German. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/020/83d/d0302083d09340267ffa91786f05becb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, a good translation is not an easy money. <a name="habracut"></a>

      First, to understand the intricacies of the meanings of the same Google Translate is not easy.  And even with the successful passage of this maze, you get as a gift only a vague meaning of the cherished phrase - no more.  Other electronic translators may offer something more intricate, but the final result, for that matter, will be the same. <br><br>  The way out of this is simple, but it is suitable mainly for those who know a little foreign languages.  Even at the very beginning level.  This, of course, about electronic dictionaries. <br><br>  Paragon Software is known in Russia primarily for its backup solutions, as well as hard disk management.  However, the product line of our company is much wider.  Dictionary solutions for mobile devices Paragon Software also released for a long time, being also one of the world leaders in this segment. <br><br>  What has always distinguished us is excellent vocabulary content.  For example, SlovoEd for Mac OS in the new version, which will be released from day to day, includes 54 dictionaries for more than 20 languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom such famous publishers as PONS GmbH, Dario de Judicibus, Larousse Editorial, Millennium, Russian Media and others. . <br><br>  In the new version, we also significantly reworked the interface of the program, making it more convenient and understandable. <br><br>  The updated dictionaries have three modes of operation: <br>  ‚Ä¢ with the article; <br>  ‚Ä¢ without an article; <br>  ‚Ä¢ pop-up translation. <br><br><img src="http://s15.radikal.ru/i189/1007/29/4faac41aea3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case (with the article as shown above) the user can see both the list of words and the translation window, which allows him to perform additional navigation. <br><br>  Dictionary mode "without an article" due to its small size and compactness allows you to work with other open applications, while remaining on the PC screen: <br><br><img src="http://i079.radikal.ru/1007/81/52e0d3bddb15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, a pop-up translation, which is sometimes especially convenient.  In the settings you can also specify whether it will be displayed automatically, or by pressing the keys and hovering the mouse over a given word on the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f80/842/4be/f808424becf5e4d1aeb5df5768444773.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is done quite simply.  By default, a pop-up translation call is set in the dictionary settings by hovering the mouse cursor.  If you want to change these settings, just go to Settings&gt; Pop-up translation&gt; Transfer from other applications.  In the "Pop-up translation" section, you can select a key, which, when pressed with the mouse pointer, will trigger a pop-up translation.  In addition, you can set a dictionary call from the keyboard - a combination of keys, when you select a word and click on it, the dictionary will automatically open and a translation will be found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b26/c0e/9a9/b26c0e9a978f75c164fe908dd39f1ff2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Assistance in learning foreign languages</b> <br><br>  In fact, the functions of the updated ‚ÄúSlovoEd‚Äù on the translation of individual words and expressions do not end.  The program can and should be used by those who want to expand the range of familiar words, and indeed knowledge in foreign languages. <br><br>  How? <br><br>  First of all, the dictionary provides an opportunity to get a translation of the words entered in any form for Russian, English, Spanish and French directions.  For example, when typing nouns in different cases and numbers, verbs in different tenses and personal forms, etc.  You can also enter a whole phrase in the search bar, and all the found basic forms will be shown in the morphological article. <br><br>  Also in the new version of SlovoEd, you can listen to the words voiced by professional speakers, which will improve the pronunciation and develop the skills of perception of foreign speech.  By the way, sound modules are available for English, German, Spanish, Italian and French. <br><br>  If you forget how to spell a word, you can get a list of words from a dictionary that are similar in spelling to the entered one using such a search (see the picture below). <br><br><img src="http://s51.radikal.ru/i132/1007/1e/510d3f67e48c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Suppose you have a series of words that are often used but difficult to memorize.  In this case, add them to the dictionary bookmarks.  To do this, open the required article and click the ‚ÄúAdd bookmark‚Äù button on the toolbar. <br><br>  Also, with the installed ‚ÄúSlovoEdom‚Äù for Mac OS, you always have at your hands a table of irregular verbs.  This function is available for all editions of this dictionary containing the English and German directions. <br><br>  For dessert - the most interesting - "Test on the cards."  The program has a time-tested method of learning foreign words using cards, on one side of which words and expressions are written in a foreign language, and on the other hand, their translation. <br><br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i174/1007/dc/ef13c75564ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The program will record the result and when you answer all the test questions, the statistics will be displayed: the number of correct answers, the total number of cards, the number of words learned.  A word is considered learned if it has been tested 10 times and there have never been incorrect answers or the word has been shown at least 20 times.  At the same time, the number of correct answers is 4 times more than the wrong ones. <br><br>  The new ‚ÄúSlovoEd‚Äù for ‚Äúpoppies‚Äù will appear in the coming days.
