The social network plans to create a service that will allow anyone to conduct an online broadcast in video format directly from a smartphone.  Application development began about a year ago.  The creators want everyone to see the world with other people's eyes. <br><br>  With luck, on the day of his appearance, Periscope was able to demonstrate its charm.  In New York, there was a gas explosion in a residential building.  Broadcast of the burning building appeared in the app after a couple of minutes.  Even the television did not respond so quickly.

      Among other advantages over competitors, which Meerkat and YouTube consider, are the following: 24-hour video saving and the ability to comment on what is happening. <br><br>  Without a doubt, in the future it can be used for business, including for conducting technical conferences via Twitter.  How does it work now? <br><br>  We decided to offer you first the translation of the article by <b>Lee Price</b> (Lee Price), director of marketing strategy for Reputation Capital, which tells about the "bourgeois" practices of using Twitter at technical conferences, and then supplementing it with your own experience. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are passionate fans of the active use of Twitter during events, regardless of whether we are present as organizers, sponsors or just listeners,‚Äù writes Lee Price.  In her opinion, Twitter is a simple and effective way to create a community and new acquaintances at an event, and it‚Äôs hard not to agree.  Therefore, everyone who participates in the conference, regardless of their role, should stick to four simple tips for working with Twitter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/939/b03/238/939b03238eee4235a932f2cfac8adba1.png"><br><br>  <b>1. Use hashtag events in advance.</b> <br>  Choose a hashtag for your event, using it as often as possible even before the conference.  If you are a participant, not an organizer, then also before registering for an event, take a look at what is written on this hashtag. <br>  ‚ÄúWe have big screens with ribbons from Twitter to see what people are writing about during events,‚Äù says Sarah Rand from the National Retail Federation.  ‚ÄúDuring meetings, we encourage people to tweet.‚Äù  Hashtags for each event are created in advance to intrigue people, and it‚Äôs rather fun to see what kind of discussion they cause. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/679/56f/18d/67956f18dfb24c37a4199fd21d87b2fd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. Spin nicks and hashtags</b> <br>  Deb Evans from the company Deb Evans Consulting recommends that you always mention the Twitter user, including on and on the icons of each participant, so that they can easily take part in the discussions.  It would be a good idea to write the nicknames of the participants on badges, you can ask them to do it yourself.  We have many users write their twitter with pen in the format @ username on the badges. <br><br>  You can think of an extraordinary way to promote your username or the selected hashtag on Twitter.  How to do this?  At the bar with branded napkins or cup holders at happy hour (time when alcoholic beverages are sold at a discount)?  On the projector screen before the presentation?  T-shirts for your team?  Get creative and you will be amazed at the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4af/15b/e30/4af15be3004d410f8c4b96cf5a0ddd6c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Insist on uninterrupted Wi-Fi network at every event</b> <br>  If you are organizing an event for geeks, it seems elementary to provide a reliable wireless network.  However, many events have problems connecting to the wireless network, and no one can solve this problem.  When organizing your event, work all the details with the site's IT staff several times to make sure that the connection signal is strong and the network name and password are easy to remember (in no case use long alphanumeric passwords!).  Spread this information everywhere: post the leaves with the network name and password, show them in between presentations, put business cards with them at the front desk and in the bar ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30e/708/7f5/30e7087f5ad64920841a263b744ab3c3.png"><br><br>  <b>4. Share information on and after the event.</b> <br>  Display a stream of tweets on a large, visibility screen to encourage users to write tweets during the event.  Perhaps there may be some discussion due to user tweets.  Share a stream of the most interesting post-event tweets using RebelMouse or Storify.  Include ads with selected tweets in your next email newsletter, show them in the sidebar of your website or blog. <br><br>  As for our own practice, <b>Vladislav Orlikov,</b> General Director of Testing Laboratory LLC (www.sqalab.ru) will tell about it best of all: <br><br><blockquote>  - We, first of all, use twitter-tape as a feedback form about reports, about the quality of the organization of the event.  The tape may ask questions to the speakers, and the moderators voice them.  In the same place the key moments which speakers presented in the reports sounded.  Also, the tape is used to notify participants of any events at the event, for emergency notification, for example, if we find the lost thing. <br><br>  All this allows you to work very quickly.  In this case, the key information that was announced can be quickly found in the tape.  In case you did not have time to write. <br>  Are there any rules for using Twitter at technical conferences?  Not.  This social network provides many opportunities, everyone can use them as it is convenient for him, set up under certain circumstances or wishes. <br>  For broadcast, we use twijector.com.  Very convenient and to some extent an indispensable assistant. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59c/c87/894/59cc87894d8e4a1896e0c7f39b0393b6.jpg"><br><br>  How do you use Twitter, organizing or attending technical conferences?  We will be glad to your interesting experience in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257837/</a></p>
