  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bootstrapping like stupidity or cowardice?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I suddenly thought, and is not the desire to engage in bootstrapping an excuse for those people who are not really ready to do a real job?  I do not mean the people involved in building the next online store or small-town portal.  I mean people who proudly call what they do, ‚Äústart-up‚Äù and say that they will conquer the world. <br><br>  UPD: It turns out that not everyone on this blog knows the meaning of the word bootstrapping.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%258D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">bootstrapping</a> , bootstrapping.  There are startupers who sit around the kitchen and slowly make their projects, who say that they will do everything themselves, who do not need investments or who believe that what they are doing is already worth millions of dollars. <br><br>  Can bootstrapping conquer the world? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The basis of my reasoning was approximately as follows: <br><ul><li>  If you start a startup, then only to turn it into a really big business. </li><li>  There are no unique ideas, so the only real way to protect your idea is to implement it as quickly and as large as possible. </li><li>  In order to build a big business, it is necessary from the very beginning to set a goal to build a big business.  By postponing this task for later, there is too much risk of being late. </li><li>  If you are engaged in building a business, you must first set a goal, and then look for resources for its implementation.  Setting goals limited by current resources reduces the size of the future business and at the same time increases the possibility of being late. </li><li>  In any big business, one should not think about how to earn the first money as quickly as possible, but how to earn it during the whole process as much as possible.  In order to earn more, you usually have to spend a lot first.  But there is usually no such money when bootstrapping. </li><li>  Any Internet project is not only technological development, but also promotion and sales.  The costs of promotion and sales usually exceed the costs of development.  And about the need for these costs usually do not think, their real volumes are not estimated, and as a result they think that everyone can do it themselves. </li><li>  The goal of a business shareholder is to make as much money as possible.  The purpose of the author is to be the main one (to do everything himself, to have a controlling stake, to be the general director, etc.).  Personal ambitions almost always conflict with business goals: it is better to build Apple / Microsoft / Google and have 10% of the project than a small business in which to have 100%.  But Apple, Microsoft and Google without investment can not be built. </li></ul><br>  Hence the conclusion - people who are engaged in bootstrapping are engaged in it for the following reasons: <br><ul><li>  they cannot realistically assess the costs of creating a product and entering the market: it means that they are good developers, but bad businessmen; </li><li>  they are not ready to give up their current job and go headlong into their business: it means they don‚Äôt really believe in their project; </li><li>  they set a goal to start making some (not necessarily big) money: it means they don‚Äôt want to build a big business; </li><li>  they believe that they will manage to realize their idea faster than other people with teams and money: it means that they are prone to big and unjustified risks; </li><li>  they are not ready to give a stake in the project in exchange for real investments that help build a big business: it means that the level of personal ambitions is too high and it will sooner or later come into conflict with the goals of the business of making money; </li></ul><br>  Any of these reasons, and even more so - all of them together, leads me to the idea that people who dream of big business and are engaged in bootstrapping are either stupid people who don‚Äôt understand how a real business works, or cowards who don‚Äôt believe in their project and do not believe that it can get a big business.
