Choosing a portable battery, you can encounter a large number of negative reviews about the discrepancy between their declared capacity and the number of charged gadgets.  It would seem that by buying a 13,000 mAh charge, we need to charge our smartphone with a 2300 mAh battery about 5.5 times!  But not everything is so simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A bit of background </h3><br>  As a lover of gadgets and modern technologies, I have a smartphone and other good things.  And on a certain path I encountered one, in my opinion, a serious problem of advanced devices - they have a relatively short battery life.  Yes, I will not argue, there are ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù of the telephone industry, with 4000 mAh or more batteries.  But, often, such devices are extremely rare and have other drawbacks.  In any case, even if <a href="http://www.gramota.ru/spravka/letters/%3Frub%3Drubric_88">your</a> gadget can hold out until the evening (and my Nexus 5 c 2300 mAh is not from this list), sooner or later the question arises of buying a portable battery. <br><br>  Like many geeks, my hands have long been itching to purchase this type of device.  I also considered the options for buying boxing for 18650 batteries, as well as for a ready-made device (in which, with a huge amount of probability, those 18650 stand, as well as in laptop batteries).  As a result, there was a need to have a charged phone at work in the absence of an outlet, and a portable battery <a href="http://www.dfgroup.ru/products/df-trio-02">DF TRIO-02</a> was purchased. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/505/2e6/c5b/5052e6c5b0d942509a9b848e6f43e6e0.jpg"><br>  Frankly, there was not much time to choose and read reviews.  Just quickly ‚Äúwent through‚Äù one well-known online store <s>(the one that is in the group of companies along with the bank and the jeweler)</s> and was selected according to the following criteria: <br><ul><li>  required capacity </li><li>  price quality </li><li>  appearance (yes, you need to strive not only for ergonomics, but to enjoy aesthetically) </li></ul><br><h3>  Briefly about this very device </h3><br>  <i>Pros:</i> <i><br></i> <ol><li>  good capacity </li><li>  two exits on 5B, 1 A;  one exit 5B, 2.1 A </li><li>  microUSB battery charge input </li></ol><br>  Minuses: <br><ol><li>  Marky glossy case </li></ol><br><h3>  Capacity calculation arithmetic </h3><br>  For ease of calculation we introduce the following <b>assumptions</b> : <br><ol><li>  take the efficiency of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">the voltage converter</a> for 100% </li><li>  we take all the indicated capacities for real values </li><li>  we consider constant values ‚Äã‚Äãof current and voltage during charging </li><li>  charging the phone comes from the ideal 0% to 100% (without taking into account the residual charge that manufacturers put, etc.) </li></ol><br>  To eliminate inaccuracies let's look at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Wikipedia</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  The maximum possible battery charge is called the charging capacity, or simply capacity.  Battery capacity is the charge given by a fully charged battery when discharged to the lowest allowable voltage.  In the SI system, battery capacity is measured in pendants; in practice, an off-system unit is often used - ampere hour.  1 Ah = 3600 Cl.  Battery capacity is indicated by the manufacturer.  Not to be confused with the capacitor electrical capacity.

      Nowadays, energy capacity is indicated more and more often on batteries - energy given by a fully charged battery when discharged to the lowest allowable voltage.  In the SI system, it is measured in joules; in practice, a non-system unit is used - watt-hour.  1 TW = 3600 J. </blockquote><br>  On the package we have a proud inscription: "13000 mAh."  This is our charging capacity. <br>  Carefully looking at the sticker on the reverse side we see the following. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acd/452/8b9/acd4528b9bc249f78d5e7b2c728ef9fc.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Voltage:</b> 3.7 V. <br>  <b>Charging capacity:</b> 13000 mAh. <br>  <b>Energy capacity:</b> 48.1 Wh. <br><br>  It turns out that many <b>manufacturers indicate the stored charge in mAh (mAh), but the voltage of this device is also important.</b>  To the fullest extent, ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù is characterized by <u>stored energy</u> . <br><br>  Often people confuse the concept of <i>stored charge</i> and <i>stored energy</i> calling it ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù.  If high accuracy is not needed, then we can assume that the stored energy (in Wh) is approximately equal to the product of the stored charge (in Ah) by the average voltage (in Volts). <br><br>  <b>1 W ¬∑ h = 1 V ¬∑ 1 A ¬∑ h</b> <br><br>  Now, having understood the concepts, let's move on to our example: 48.1 The battery is 13 Ah (13000 mAh) multiplied by 3.7 V. So far, everything converges.  But, our device is charged from the output of 5 V. Therefore, the charge that our device is capable of issuing is located as a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%2528%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2529">quotient</a> from the stored energy and output voltage. <br>  48.1 Wh / 5 V = 9.62 Ah (9620 mAh). <br><br><h3>  We analyze </h3><br>  Now you can easily count "how many times I can charge my device."  So, the same Nexus 5 can be charged: <br>  9620 mAh / 2300 mAh = 4.18 <br>  Or, in other words, a <b>little more than 4 times</b> .  What vs 5.5 <br><br><h3>  Draw conclusions </h3><br>  The calculated reserve charge of 9620 mAh was 26% less than the 13000 mAh that we see on the box.  And 26% less than an inexperienced user expects.  Although, in fact, the manufacturer did not deceive us at all.  Just such a marketing ploy. <br><br>  Useful articles and sources: <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2591%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Electrical Capacity</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Electric battery</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Ampere hour</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364385/</a></p>
