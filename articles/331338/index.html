This time, the Guild gathered at a round table and discussed the work of the designer, professional difficulties and the future of the profession.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h3>  On the understanding of the design and profession of the designer </h3><br>  A designer is someone who comes up with a solution for a business problem, taking into account technical constraints, and produces a result based on data.  In this context, it is very difficult to separate the roles of the analyst and the designer, since the decision-making process always involves two stages: analysis of the available information and further synthesis. <br><br>  UX-design in general is not only about creating an interface and the like, but about how to do something well.  For example, to adjust the work of the state is also a design. <br><br>  Tatyana Subbotina, product specialist at Notamedia and Guild Master: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe data itself does not make any sense; it is collected and analyzed for a specific purpose.  And analytics without further design is also meaningless - just like design, which occurs without data confirmation: as a result, it is placed on the table. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  An important skill for development in the profession is, first of all, to be able to design your own life. <br><br><h3>  About product and professional ethics </h3><br>  It is important for the designer not only to understand the task correctly and solve it within the given framework, but also not to harm the user.  The optimal solution seeks a balance between customer benefits and user convenience. <br><br>  Many people advise to focus on the user's needs, but we should not forget about the benefits for the customer either. <br><br>  For a digital product, it can be difficult to determine the end point of readiness: in a sense, it is always ‚Äúalive‚Äù, this is its advantage and problem at the same time.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to focus on a specific goal: how many people use the product and whether it performs the task. <br><br>  To avoid perfectionism and eventually release a workable product, it is important not to be afraid to release solutions and test them.  This will require a sober assessment of opportunities and do not skimp on analytics. <br><br>  Tatyana Subbotina, product specialist at Notamedia and Guild Master: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMistakes always happen, and this still does not mean that the approach to work as a whole is incorrect.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  People trust the product when they clearly understand the specific benefits of it personally for themselves.  Correct positioning and adequate communication with users are as important as an interface. <br><br><h3>  About teamwork </h3><br>  In different companies, work on the product is organized in different ways: the functions of the designer can be performed by one specialist or the whole team.  A separate position for this role may not be at all - this does not mean that the process is built incorrectly. <br><br>  The designer is not only engaged in the development of documentation. <br><br>  It is important to be able to justify the decision for the client or the employer in terms of benefits for him: how the proposed option will increase the income or reduce the costs of the company. <br><br>  The interest on the part of the performer (fellow developer or vendor) to the work is no less important than the interest of the designer himself. <br><br>  Alexey Borodkin, head of the Guild, director of products at Notamedia: <br><blockquote>  "There must be a clear desire to benefit - indifference destroys the whole process of creating a product." </blockquote><br>  When preparing documentation it is useful to formulate the tasks as directly and clearly as possible.  Just write a little TK: you need to discuss it in detail with the performer and make sure that all tasks are understood correctly.  It is important to maintain constant contact with the team and check that everything is going according to plan, then there is no misunderstanding. <br><br><h3>  Summing up </h3><br>  A good designer always thinks first and foremost about the benefits of a solution for all parties involved.  Observation, the flexibility of thinking and the experience of colleagues help him to speak the same language with the whole team and develop his profession - the Guild is always ready to share it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331338/</a></p>
