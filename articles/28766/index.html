Killing children will not work as before.  Current age ratings do not allow. <br>  By the way, if you kill the plot npc, then it will recover after a while, just like in Oblivion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u>Crimes committed in one city will affect the attitude to you around the world or only in a particular city?</u> <br>  As in the previous parts, the ratio of the player to each player is different.  But if you committed a crime against a faction, such as Bratsva Steel, then in other cities the members of this fraternity will treat you accordingly. <br><br>  <u>How wide will the branches of dialogues and choices be?</u> <br>  For comparison, in the third part there will be 40,000 lines of dialogs, while in the first part there were a couple of thousand.  Those.  the possibilities of choice and reaction will be record high.

      <u>Tell us what changes will affect the system uniforms?</u>  <u>Will the interface with the parameters change, depending on the reservation?</u> <br>  An interesting innovation is that the helmet and the main part of the armor are now dressed separately, respectively, the possibility of combining.  The interface will not change. <br><br>  <u>What is the inventory system?</u>  <u>Will there be a restriction on free slots or restrictions only on total weight?</u> <br>  Just as before, the system is based on the total weight, which in turn depends on the characteristics of the hero.  The interface will be similar to Oblivion and Mass Effect - the division of things into categories. <br>  Cartridges will not have weight. <br><br>  <u>Will the game have some kind of level editor or sdk, like Oblivion?</u> <br>  Yes, this software will be.  On the disc with the game you will not find it, but it will be posted in the public domain. <br><br>  <u>What are the successes in the field of AI and simulations of public life?</u> <br>  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem is borrowed from Oblivion.  People also walk, eat, say, live in their homes.  Well, as usual - the system was slightly improved, additional actions, animation, etc. were added. <br>  Implemented such an interesting thing as a dynamic orientation on the terrain, when, as before, the npc had pre-programmed paths of walking, standing and havania.  You can see it in action by opening firing in the city - people will not cuddle up to the ground where they stood, but seek shelter.  And it is not known in advance what kind of shelter they will find for themselves. <br>  Also, caravans travel between cities, not along a fixed path, but choosing a route according to circumstances. <br><br>  <u>What does a map move look like?</u>  <u>Will there be encounters with enemies during the journey?</u> <br>  A system similar to Oblivion.  At the beginning of the game, you still do not know the map, so you need to scout it manually with your feet.  Accordingly, the rapid movement of the map is possible only in places where you have already been. <br>  There will be no attacks on the map.  But a system has been developed for generating random events during a foot movement, which developers are proud of, but do not say anything. <br><br>  <u>How do the skills on the combat system?</u> <br>  The accuracy of the shots depends on the skills (you will see shaking hands on the screen with your own eyes), and accordingly the damage that you inflict.  The state of the weapon also matters. <br><br>  <u>Do monsters fight among themselves if they are of different kinds?</u>  <u>And how long will they follow the player if they run away from them?</u> <br>  For monsters there will be no difference between a player or another type of monster.  Those.  amusing pictures of clashes between monsters will be. <br>  Lead a mob of mutants to the city will not work.  Having run after you for some time, they get bored and they will be left behind. <br><br>  <u>How much detail can you create your character?</u>  <u>Will it be possible to change some features already during the game?</u> <br>  You can create your face in detail, but you cannot customize the appearance of your body.  It is also possible to mark any number of tattoos on the body. <br>  During the game there will be ways to change the hairstyle. <br><br>  <u>Will the opportunity to sit, lie down, crouch or climb obstacles?</u> <br>  You can squat, nothing more. <br><br>  <u>What weather effects will be in the game?</u> <br>  There will be different types of clouds and nothing else.  The rains and storms the developers decided not to do. <br><br>  <u>Is the plot connected with the previous parts?</u> <br>  The plot is not connected with the previous parts and will not have common locations (unless a bar of broken hopes). <br><br>  <u>Is it possible to go through the whole game without weapons, using only hand-to-hand combat?</u>  <u>Does the level only affect the damage during hand-to-hand combat or do new strikes appear?</u> <br>  It is definitely possible to pass, but very difficult.  The level and skills only affect the available melee weapons, such as knives.  But there are perks that add and new tricks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28766/</a></p>
