  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple technology that increases conversion from mobile traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just do not laugh, a hundred years ago, when I did not understand anything in Internet marketing, I attracted customers for my small business with the help of one simple and effective thing.  I started a VKontakte group that represents my company and invited people there from the search.  That is, I went to the user invitations menu and stupidly clicked on the ‚ÄúInvite‚Äù button until it turned blue. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e86/fb1/d0a/e86fb1d0ac8442d89556676085b02899.jpg" alt="image" width="800"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No matter how silly it sounds now, but then it worked awesome.  I had a small training center and I managed to create a group of 20 students in such a moronic way in 2-3 days, and in a week I ran up to 3 such groups. <br>  True, by the end of the week was very sick finger.  But as time went on, and after some 1.5 years, the number of ‚Äúclever men‚Äù like me went too far beyond all acceptable limits.  In order to achieve the same results as before, I already had to mercilessly and doomedly peck it with spam through all possible channels, sending millions of messages a day using self-written prog (the development of which, by the way, had to be ordered for decent money). <br><br>  Yes, doctor, in my childhood I was a rabid spammer and you can beat me for it with a heavy stool.  Then it stopped working altogether and had to slowly become a marketer.

      When I launched my first startup, it never occurred to me that the interface needed to be adapted for mobile phones, and indeed, the word Usability was for me almost obscene.  I did not bother about such issues so much that the first screen of the clever internet education system that we were cutting then looked like an online game screensaver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a0/5bb/43c/9a05bb43c66240c8a18671d906964f48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, when there are about 50 projects behind my shoulders, I pull this interface from the far folder to neigh (although the ship is pretty). <br><br>  It was a very good time, people were simpler, more susceptible to advertising, (even the most stupid) less spoiled, in order to buy clothes in an ancient store, they were ready to go through a real quest called ‚ÄúFind this damn basket‚Äù. <br><br>  I miss this time, because it gave a lot of opportunities for delitants. <br><br>  Now everything is wrong.  Nowadays, if you advertise your product, it‚Äôs not enough for you to make an ordinary land and launch an advertisement, you need to get into your head your probable client, understand how he thinks and how his attention behaves when he visits the site.  But, if you can figure out how the user sitting at the computer works, then if he logged in from a mobile phone, this is already a problem.  What does the person who is browsing your site do now: riding the subway, sitting on a push or drinking whiskey - a million question.  Obviously, only one thing, in almost all cases, he is limited in time and his attention is scattered.  All the guys are furious who go to the site from mobile phones, merge the advertising budget and go out without even reading about your product.  The market urgently needs a simple customizable tool to stop losing these scattered visitors, because the share of mobile traffic, on many sites, is already far ahead of the desktop. <br><br>  Recently, we were invited to participate in one project, which is exactly what this is doing.  Meet <a href="http://clicktex-landing.ru/">‚Äúlicktex‚Äù</a> , a company that devotes its working life and sleepless startup days to solving the problem of conversion from mobile traffic.  They came up with a surprisingly simple solution, an adaptable panel for mobile phones, which appears at the bottom of the screen of smartphones from visitors to your site, allows you to quickly communicate with the manager and access any necessary information with one touch. <br><br> <a href="http://clicktex-landing.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cb/979/b77/3cb979b772c8431180a23d6e7887dca0.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  plus another half of the hundreds of functions that you can configure in your account, and if you do not have enough, you can create your own. <br><br>  With seeming simplicity, this solution really works, as evidenced by good customer reviews.  I will not continue to describe the merits of this panel, otherwise advertising will turn out too.  Just go and <a href="http://clicktex-landing.ru/">test yourself</a> for free.  Installation, by the way, takes only 5 minutes. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, the united team Generate.club and <a href="http://clicktex-landing.ru/">Clicktex</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308368/</a></p>
