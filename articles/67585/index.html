Differences mainly in machine tools, behind which meat works.  Someone as a tool acts as a jackhammer, someone has a shovel, and someone has a cattle-comp. <br><br>  Note: the instruction is made for meat, which at least once in life has opened and worked for source codes in PHP, and better, with foreign Indian cattle source codes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Do not kick much, just for the fan, you know ... =)</i>

    <br><h4>  So, here is the scheme: </h4><br>  1) It is necessary to wake up the meat at 7:00 am (for this you need to set the alarm).  When the meat hears some kind of nasty sound, it will immediately wake up. <br><br>  2) Drag it into the bathroom, as the meat is sleepy and you need to wake it up faster. <br><br>  3) Like a piece of meat a little bit oklemalsya in the bathroom it needs something to feed.  Due to the fact that there is nothing tasty in the fridge, tea with bread will come down for the meat.  Of course, bread is better to feed him with butter, since  it will give more protein and carbohydrates than regular bread.  This must be done so that the meat does not boom until lunch, that it wants to eat again. <br><br>  4) After the bread is fed, and the tea is drunk, you can begin to tighten the <s>rags on the body to</s> dress shirts, trousers and other attributes of the civilized world.  Because  meat can sweat, for example, in a cattle truck, it is better to spray it with deodorant.  The meat should feel comfortable among other meat, so it is recommended to still muffle this equestrian smelly smell. <br><br>  five).  Now, when the meat is dressed, you can take it outside and drag it to the nearest stop, where the so-called cattle trucks stop.  The cattle trucks, oddly enough, received just such a name from the phrase "cattle" and "carry."  Because  meat from the "real cattle" is not gone (the same instincts and reflexes), it is quite logical to call these metal boxes with engines just cattle trucks. <br><br>  6) After the meat with the crushed paws has successfully reached the place for it-like barge-haders, then it needs to be dragged a little more to the required floor and seated a computer behind the cattle-mill.  Everything, the preparatory stage is completed, it is time to proceed to a more serious stage - byllezhu. <br><br>  7) So, now we check the trash computer should be turned on and the Windows OS should be loaded.  If everything is in order, then you can take competent orders from the authorities and begin the next burly day. <br><br>  8) As soon as orders are received, you need to open a cattle editor, better Dreamweaver.  Drimiver is currently recognized as the most normal and standard tool for cattle burkala if you write on a <strike>bike</strike> language PHP + HTML.  So it is recommended to do shit scripts and other unnecessary programs for anyone in it. <br><br>  9) If the trimviver is already running, then open the desired project and start scouring the required file for directories in the directories.  Since cattle meat is used to writing all the programs from top to bottom without much logic, you can flush the shit code to the bottom, add conditions and throw new packets of shit html code. <br><br>  10) Now that the code is set up, you can open any browser.  Firewall is better, because  from drushlakov (especially version 6) already vomits all terrestrial cattle-progerskoe burlache.  As soon as the firefox is launched, you need to open the required file through the local host and see what has changed.  If, as usual, some kind of error is issued, the script can be dumped with special inserts, and more.  If the meat has found a pattern in what the problem is, then this is already a victory, you can fix the script.  This is once again pleased with the meat, because the "pumping" is increasing! <br><br>  11) The time goes on and on comes the long-awaited dinner.  Strange, but without really doing anything useful, the meat again wants to eat. <br><br>  12) Well, so be it, you need to drag the meat into the dining room, where the meat will be able to extend its life to burlach by eating.  Recommendation: before taking the meat to the dining room you need to hang a ribbon with a badge around your neck so that the meat feels more significant than the other cattle that just walks down the street.  Well, if the meat considers itself significant, then the mood for cattle-existence increases. <br><br>  13) After the meat has been dragged along the street and has a dose of social significance, then you can now feed it.  Meat loves to eat and soups and all that is on the second.  So the meat is not picky and can eat everything under the row.  Since the pieces of bread are free, you can take as much as you need, but more.  Scientists have noticed that the more the stomach is crammed with bread, the greater the feeling of fullness by the end of the redneck.  So what is recommended. <br><br>  14) Well, everything, if the stage of the prolongation of burlachy life is completed, you can go to walk the meat somewhere on the street.  On the street, there is a lot of opposite sex to meat, so you can again pull out your badge and walk with a confident gait of a pseudo-cosmonaut.  The mood of the meat is cheerful - and this is good news. <br><br>  15) Everything, time is coming for the completion of walks and the use of dinner - it's time to drag the meat again for the computer cattle machine. <br><br>  16) So, check: meat at the computer.  If the meat stables and asks for home, he needs to explain one simple truth (axiom) to him: ‚ÄúEveryone works this way, it means that it should also work as well.‚Äù  The meat meekly agrees and is no longer a koodyuch, writes shit scripts further. <br><br>  17) Time drags on.  The meat after dinner is rotten and it wants to sleep.  It is necessary to immediately explain to him that sleeping in front of other cattle IT-Schnick is not cultural, and that it is necessary to go on boiling. <br><br>  18) Having spent 4 hours under the line, the meat does not notice how much of the day has already been drained and that the long-awaited moment has come - returning to the kennel home. <br><br>  19) Well, it takes the meat to cut down the computer.  It is advisable to see which files remain unsaved and save them, since  rewrite the meat shit code will once again be in crowbars. <br><br>  20) Pull away the meat as well as in the morning at the bus stop, waiting for the cattle truck.  Next, we plant him in a cattle truck and drive home.  Note: if, on the way to a stop, the meat was seen by familiar guys: classmates, classmates, etc., then it is better for meat to pull out and boast a badge to raise their spirits, that life is not such a shit. <br><br>  21) Everything, meat at home, the main thing is that it is whole and unharmed (well, that the meat of the hunger is not prikopylesya).  It's probably time to ask again to devour.  Meat in the evening can be fed not very densely: borsch with bread will be enough.  If there is sour cream, then even better. <br><br>  22) So, the meat has eaten, you can now take it to the hall to watch the zombie box or take it back to the computer. <br><br>  23) After a certain time, the eyes begin to stick together in the meat and it begins to ask to sleep.  No question: you need to make the bed and put it and of course, do not forget to set the alarm for 7 hours :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67585/</a></p>
