  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mind games, or how we intellect were measured</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of the new year, I want to remember once more the positive things that the old year has brought.  For example, a couple of amusing facts: <br><ol><li>  During the research program of the Air Force, it was found that "if you watch programs that test participants' erudition, play intellectual board games and take a shower with your eyes closed, then after a week you can wise up by about 40%." </li><li>  When for one of the TV quizzes, passers-by were asked to name the most intelligent profession, the list included: a <s>shoemaker</s> , a <s>tailor</s> , a teacher, a scientist, a professor, a janitor (yes, I was surprised too), a doctor and - this is it, popular recognition!  - programmer.  Well, a couple more stereotypes: who works in an IT company?  Clearly, programmers (there is another option "computer scientists").  And what do they do in their free time?  Play computer games, of course! </li></ol><br>  Breaking down stereotypes is a great experience.  Regarding the most intelligent profession, however, this can and not do, but on the contrary - try to compete with other intellectuals, and not in a computer game, but face to face, so to speak, head to head.  Suddenly it will be possible to defeat scientists professors or even janitors themselves?  Well, who does not want to get the title of the most intelligent among colleagues?  To wise up - even if not by 40% (not everyone is ready to take a shower with eyes closed), but at least 10-15 - is also not bad, although not very much, I believe these British scientists ... In general, motivators for participating in battles there were plenty of intellects, and Veeam Software decided to organize a team of ‚ÄúWhat-Where-When‚Äù experts. <br><br>  Under the cut - the story of what came of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/637/35b/7d5/63735b7d52944f1fb5904b3f23b6d9fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  "Who in the world is all the <s>sweeter</s> smarter?" </h1><br>  The first season turned out to be very intense: the newly created, quite ‚Äúgreen‚Äù (literally and figuratively - see photo) team, some participants of which saw each other for the first time at the gaming table, won the IT-Telecom Spring Cup, played out in St. Petersburg St. Petersburg by Fast Lane.  In a serious struggle with the representatives of OLLY, VimpelCom, IT-grad, WestCall, the Summer and Autumn Cups were also conquered.  When handing the third final prize, the organizers complained that Veeam was killing intrigue in the competition, and asked them to put up another team next season :).

      <br>
      The framework of the ‚Äúindustry‚Äù tournament, therefore, became already cramped, I wanted to try my hand at games with other rivals - and the guys decided to declare themselves in the ‚Äú60 Seconds‚Äù Corporate League of the club opened in St. Petersburg.  (The name reflects the format of the competition - several teams play simultaneously, the presenter voices one of the questions selected by the editors, and after a minute of discussion, the teams hand out answer sheets.) <br><br>  In the Corporate League plays more than 30 teams, each of which acts under the brand of its company.  Among them are representatives of industrial enterprises, software industry, financial sector, a team of journalists, teachers, manufacturers of carbonated drinks and even confectioners!  It is allowed to have no more than two ‚Äúlegionnaires‚Äù (I‚Äôll say that Veeam does without them).  Many corporate team players have experience playing in the Higher and First League of St. Petersburg, but the rivals' authority was not at all embarrassed by the guys in green T-shirts: four debutants climbed to the highest step of the podium, and won silver in the final season, yielding very little - less than 1 point - the most experienced team of financiers. <br><br><h1>  ‚ÄúI have this answer to the question!‚Äù </h1><br>  Today, questions about how to become faster, <s>higher, stronger,</s> smarter and friendlier are answered by the owners of the Porcelain Owl - IT-Telecom Cup, vice-champions of the St. Petersburg Corporate League, the 60 Seconds Intellectual Club, members of the Veeam knowledge team. <br><br>  <i><b>Why do you play ChGK?</b></i>  <i><b>What attracts you to intellectual fights?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Dima Mordberg, technical support specialist:</b> Because thinking is fun! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/044/ba4/ade044ba47cc48c3b06d3cc904237f2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sasha Fatin, specialist of the department of educational programs:</b> It is interesting to compete with other teams.  I used to just watch how they play in a television club, but now you can play it yourself, try it like this. <br><br>  <b>Olga Slusarenko, technical writer:</b> Because I like the color and print of our team uniform, as well as delicious prizes :).  And, of course, the most charming and witty presenter of the games - ‚Äúthe man from the TV‚Äù, the owner of the Crystal Owl, the player of the television club ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùMikhail Skipsky!  But seriously, this is ‚Äúmy‚Äù sport: literally I feel how the adrenaline level rises during the game, and the feelings of the winner are not comparable with anything. <br><br>  <b>Denis Rudenko, manager of testing department, captain of the team:</b> I am generally attracted by a variety of games (Denis - the player of the football team Veeam - author's note), different areas of knowledge.  In ‚ÄúWhat-Where-When‚Äù is fascinating, thought develops;  I myself am interested in thinking about the question, and with the team game there are more ideas, plus additional emotions, communication.  Well, the sports component: many teams compete, the discussion time is limited - it adds even more excitement. <br><br>  <i><b>Do I have to be an IT person to get into the team?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Alexey Latypov, technical support specialist:</b> No, it is not necessary at all.  Moreover, the team benefits from joining us with a person with a different specialty, because he has knowledge that other members of the team do not have. <br><br>  <b>Olga:</b> We periodically play representatives of different departments - and marketing, and sales, and human resources.  So to become an expert there is a chance for everyone. <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> IT specialist to be completely optional.  After all, even in real ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùAre played by representatives of completely different professions.  The game itself does not presuppose any specialized knowledge.  To be successful in the game, you need a lively mind, diversified development, you need to read more, learn new things, take interest in the world around you, expand your horizons. <br><br>  <i><b>How did you get the idea to play for the Veeam team in What-Where-When?</b></i>  <i><b>Have you had any experience in intellectual contests before?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Ian Dimant, Test Engineer:</b> <br>  For several seasons I played with friends in the club ‚Äú60 seconds‚Äù, we started in the First League of Peter, where we took second place and moved to the Highest.  I learned that the Corporate League from the club "60 seconds" starts in St. Petersburg, and offered to try my hand at it. <br><br>  <b>Sasha:</b> There was a newsletter from the personnel department, from which I learned that a team of experts was being recruited, that is, anyone could sign up.  Before that, I did not play anything. <br><br>  <b>Olga:</b> And I saw an ad on the <a href="http://vk.com/veeam_team">Veeam page on the social network</a> .  I thought that there would be a lot of people who wanted to, and wrote that I could come as a fan, support the team, and when it turned out that there was a place at the gaming table, my joy knew no bounds.  Before, I just watched the games ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When?".  And I dreamed to play the most in ‚Äú60 seconds‚Äù for a long time, even when the very first league was just being created in St. Petersburg - then I was among the fans, we sat on the sidelines and tried to answer the questions that were heard, sometimes it worked.  This year, one might say, the dream came true. <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> <br>  I discovered the game ‚ÄúWhat-Where-When‚Äù as a child, watching with my parents on TV.  Then I thought that most of the questions imply subtle erudition, special knowledge in various fields, it seemed to me that this is the main essence of the game and the only question is how much you have already read.  And now I understand that watching and playing are different things.  And then when viewing it was just not clear how you can participate in it, live compared to the team had the feeling that you do not have time.  Not attracted.  For example, ‚ÄúOwn game‚Äù is more interesting in this respect to look - there you read the question faster from the presenter from the screen and you answer before the players.  However, when I myself participated in CPG, I realized that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game was different and I myself was very interested in playing it.  After some time, my friends - football fans and forecasters - organized the game via Skype, I began to play with them, I understood the concept of the game.  It turned out, was involved.  And then I saw a letter in the corporate newsletter and decided that once the opportunity to play itself goes into the hands - you need to take advantage and sign up for the team. <br><br>  <i><b>The training process of television club connoisseurs usually remains behind the scenes.</b></i>  <i><b>Reveal the secret of your team - how do you prepare for games?</b></i>  <i><b>Are you studying Wikipedia?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov, programmer:</b> Those who have the opportunity, bring to the training questions (from the base of CPP questions - author's note) that he liked, or which he invented.  I also tried to invent questions, but I realized that when I was drafted, I was drawn to special knowledge, but this is not true. <br><br>  <b>Dima: We</b> close the support cases! :-) At work, every day we use all the possibilities of our mind, we can say it prepares us for games. <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> Apart from the fact that we have a team training once a week, I also train myself - I play with friends over the Internet, sometimes I take a random package from the base, I also train on real games - I watch the games of the television club ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùOn the Internet in my mode: after the question is voiced, I pause the video and try to answer for the command.  Periodically even turns out.  I do not watch live, because  too distracting the process of discussion, prevents himself from thinking. <br><br>  <i><b>Was the initial goal - to win all?</b></i>  <i><b>Did the tournament strategy change during the season?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Sasha:</b> Initially, as far as I know, there was no such goal.  Later in the course of the games, when something began to turn out, they began to win - the excitement came, I wanted to win. <br><br>  <b>Maxim:</b> I personally have always been interested in winning.  Otherwise, what's the point of playing? <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> In the first games we, I think, tried to understand that we generally can as a team.  Then they won once, and another, they realized that we have the potential, that we can win. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/5e6/f57/2625e6f57bae402293c40e5f857cffc5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Rather, we did not change the style or tactics of the game, but gained experience, corrected something. <br><br>  <i><b>How do your colleagues relate to this hobby?</b></i>  <i><b>And the head?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> The leader is in the know, positive attitude :).  In our department, many guys are addicted to something, it's good that we are all different, and not only do we work.  Some were interested, but so far I have not actively campaigned for them to join the team.  It still takes time and interest to prepare, to play. <br><br>  <b>Dima:</b> Everyone is interested, but everyone is embarrassed to play themselves. <br><br>  <b>Alexey:</b> They support, they are interested in the results and questions, in general, very positively. <br><br>  <i><b>What is the most difficult for the captain?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> For the captain, this is rather not a difficulty, but a feature of his playing activity - he chooses the version, takes responsibility.  It's one thing - your personal mistakes, you're ready for them, and here because of your mistakes the team may suffer.  In the course of the game, you need not only to think for yourself, but also to cut off the wrong versions, to direct the discussion, to feel that the team needs at one time or another of the game - to raise your spirits, to joke, or a lot, to concentrate, something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/323/6db/dcb/3236dbdcb1d34b11b2df403ef97f1693.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>What questions do you like best?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Dima:</b> Beautiful questions that do not imply specific knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Aleksey:</b> Questions tied up on a play on words. <br><br>  <b>Olga:</b> Questions with handouts - they often contain images, you can practice your imaginative thinking.  And those which, even without knowing the right option, can be answered with humor (for the most ridiculous answer a special prize is relied - author).  For example, once there was such a question: ‚ÄúAccording to the scenario of one film, at midnight a young girl turns into a vampire, and they break <i>it</i> .  Call <i>them</i> . ‚ÄùThe team of teachers (!) Replied:‚Äú Moral foundations! ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> I like the questions beautiful, multi-level, if I may say so, when all the components of the question are intertwined, and you can approach the solution from different sides.  Of the simple and complex questions, I prefer the more complex ones. <br><br>  <b>Sasha:</b> Those that I know the answer to :). <br><br>  <i><b>What game is remembered more than others?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Maxim: A</b> cup on team issues (representatives of all Peter‚Äôs leagues played there - approx. Avt.) - because it was possible to measure strength with teams of other leagues, including the Highest. <br><br>  <b>Olga:</b> The very first IT Telecom cup game, we were there for the first time at the gaming table and played a team - and immediately won! <br>  <b>Denis:</b> I remember the first game in the Corporate League of St. Petersburg - how everything is organized, the specifics of the tournament, when you play for your company.  And the fact that we immediately performed successfully, taking second place, was very inspiring and helped us understand that we can play on equal terms with quite strong teams. <br><br>  <i><b>What is the main outcome of the season for you personally?</b></i>  <i><b>And what would you wish to colleagues-experts in the new year?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>Maxim:</b> I personally have increased self-esteem, as well as an assessment of the potential of the team as a whole.  I believe that we will be able to fight with the strongest teams of other leagues, because even in the last tournament, the team looked excellent against them.  Therefore, I wish the team win!  And rivals - fear and tremble! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ab/c8a/4be/2abc8a4bec8445b7883ff57c4af6db8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sasha:</b> The result - took second place, could not win the Corporate League.  I would like to win next year, of course!  And we are waiting for newcomers - there is already a second team, and, perhaps, there will be a third :). <br><br>  <b>Dima:</b> Hmm ... We achieved total annual revenue!  :) In general, it's just fun.  It is necessary to win, but it turned out sad - we did not win.  If we won, it would be the most important result, and so ... I would like more beautiful questions and beautiful answers.  And less stupid questions and stupid answers (in our support this is even more relevant :). <br><br>  <b>Jan:</b> First played for the corporate team, and successfully!  Still, the lag of 0.75 points from the winners at the end of the season is very, very good (albeit a shame, of course).  Thank you all for the game and a special thank you to the company, for the support of such undertakings is indescribably pleasant!  And by the way, our form turned out to be excellent too :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64c/4d4/b14/64c4d4b147dd44a585001c10f85e53da.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And I wish myself in the new year not to be late for the beginning of the game :). <br><br>  <b>Denis:</b> The main result is the appearance of the team itself and the opportunity to play in the tournament.  The team is interesting, all with different experiences, all relate differently, but we like to play together.  We can already show something, good results, we will grow further.  For me personally, this is a new experience of captaincy.  In the new year I want to wish everyone health and happiness, I always wish it, this is the main thing that a person should have.  And experts - to play on, improve and enjoy the game! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/496/b16/c6d/496b16c6de6140bd940238af531fef47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  Instead of an afterword </h1><br>  In the course of the season, it turned out that participation in intellectual battles has a positive effect on positions on the labor front: for example, people from different departments got to know each other personally - and with a total staff of several hundred people, not everyone has such a chance.  The guys tell each other what their department or team actually does, what projects they do, what tasks they solve - and now the testing engineer knows what the marketing automation team does, and the web projects analyst is aware of what they are working on in the educational programs department.  Informal communication in this sense is no less important than introductory presentations and mailing lists.  (And this is in addition to the fact that at a corporate event it is much more pleasant to joyfully greet familiar colleagues than to stand against a wall and bewildered by the question ‚ÄúWho are all these people ?!‚Äù :) <br><br>  In addition to raising the team spirit, other things are happening, sometimes surprising: for example, Alexey also learned during the interview that there is a team of experts in Veeam, and this became an additional plus point in favor of choosing a job.  And once the guys on the way to the game were discussing just the published article, which, one can say, created a sensation on Habr√© - and then it suddenly revealed that Sasha, who modestly and quietly sits in the neighborhood, wrote it!  Now he is one of the authors of a corporate blog, his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/247779/">posts are</a> always fun to read. <br><br>  So in the new year, play with us, play like us, play better than us - if you can! <br><br>  Thank you for the photos: <br><ul><li>  Veeam team members </li><li>  Intellectual club "60 seconds" ( <a href="http://club60sec.ru/">http://club60sec.ru/</a> ) </li><li>  Club Fast Lane Club ( <a href="http://fastlaneclub.ru/anonsy/igry_spb_2014/">http://fastlaneclub.ru/anonsy/igry_spb_2014/</a> ) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248075/</a></p>
