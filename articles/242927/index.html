Also, DAU's growth to 703 million and MAU to 1.12 billion. <br><br>  Despite all this, CFO David Wehner described a rather gloomy picture in the gaming direction of Facebook, saying that although there was an overall increase in payments, the players made 2% less money into the games for this quarter, and this percentage will only continue to grow . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, it is worth noting that on the above chart it is clearly seen that from advertising revenues continue to grow actively and overlap the internal payments of Facebook.  Also, there is not a word about Oculus in the report, although the R &amp; D budget has grown to $ 608 million, which is almost two times more than last year.

    <br><h4>  Million Unity Asset Store users </h4><br>  Not a week without Unity news!  Four years ago, the Asset Store was opened.  During this time, more than 15,000 assets and ready-made applications created by 3,800 developers were uploaded to the store, which saved a lot of money and time to other developers.  According <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/60282/unity-asset-store-heading-for-1-million-users/">to the</a> creators of the Asset Store, by the end of the year the number of developers using tools and models from the store to create their games will reach a million people! <br><br>  If all these models and tools were made by the developers themselves, they would spend an additional 6 million working days, which translates into finance - about 1.4 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d66/d05/f48/d66d05f48fe6497d935d6d4412e15905.png"><br><br>  It also gave developers the opportunity to earn money by selling their tools and assets. <br><br>  Well-known to Unity-developers, the NGUI and PlayMaker tools brought more than one thousand dollars to their creators, allowing them to earn extra income, and for some people the main income. <br><br>  Assess developer Shader Forge Joachim Holm√©r shared that finance received from asset sales allowed him to develop his full-time game for a year.  He also gets a huge positive charge, looking at the things that are created by developers using his tool, and from communication with the project community. <br><br>  Several good quality games have been released, made entirely from Asset Store models and tools.  For example, a game with the straightforward name <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stealth/id898620883%3Fmt%3D8">Stealth</a> for iOS.  About her wrote several major gaming publications. <br><br><br><h4>  Glu Mobile showed exceptional financial results thanks to Kim Kardashian: Hollywood </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/959/ead/a73/959eada73a6e495690837a8e071fff86.jpg"><br><br>  The game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, launched in the middle of the year, brought more <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/kim-kardashian-hollywood-earnings/">revenue</a> than all the company titles combined.  Since June, the game has been downloaded by almost 23 million users and played more than 1.2 billion sessions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/221/589/ff0/221589ff0a5d439589d0473260fed1ec.jpg"><br><br>  Used data from the report Glu Mobile.  The full version can be found <a href="http://t.co/cTlun2X70y">here</a> . <br><br><br><h4>  Ubisoft mobile sales grew </h4><br>  Ubisoft <a href="http://app2top.ru/money/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8-ubisoft-%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-45-47396.html">reported</a> for the second half of the 2015 fiscal year: mobile revenues increased by 45%. <br><br>  Total sales reached $ 611 million, which is 65% more than in the previous year; nevertheless, the company earned $ 156 million in the previous quarter, which is 43% less than in 2013, but higher than Ubisoft‚Äôs own expectations - $ 106 million. <br><br>  The company's total revenue for the first half reached $ 30 million, which is a very positive trend, considering that the company calculated losses of $ 124 million in the previous year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfd/11f/5e5/bfd11f5e53e14e5bb610c377e5d187cc.jpg"><br><br>  The main driver of growth is called Watchdogs, the number of sales of which exceeded 9 million copies.  In the mobile field, the company calls the main titles: Trials Frontier, Assassins Creed Pirates, Hungary Shark Evolution and games under the CSI franchise. <br><br><br><h4>  Kabam Launches Fresh Hunger Games </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4d/84d/8ba/a4d84d8ba5384d86b636f41bbabf369f.png"><br><br>  In one of the past news compilations, we already mentioned Kabam.  This time they <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/11/07/kabam-lionsgate-bring-hunger-games-panem-rising-mobile/">announced a</a> game based on the movie ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games,‚Äù and, yes, this is a clone of their project Heroes of Camelot with new graphics. <br><br>  Let's leave the jokes aside, an excellent strategy is to firmly occupy a niche and make a competition between their products.  Very cheap in development plus the use of a strong brand.  Sure, the project in any case will be profitable. <br><br>  We will not go into the details of the mechanics, this is a complete clone.  All that is in the heroes of Camelot, faithfully transferred here.  The graphics are nice and perfectly fit the style of the film. <br><br>  Well, the forecast is a joke: the next clone will be in the setting of the walking dead. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242927/</a></p>
