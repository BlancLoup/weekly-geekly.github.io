And along with purely technical problems, any administrator will sooner or later face problems of moral and personal plans. <br><br>  I want to give some tips to beginners, received once by me from smart people and on my own sad experience. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      Similar rules for the administrator. <br><br>  First, I have already spoken about this <a href="http://laradice.ru/%3Fp%3D4">in one of the past articles</a> and <a href="http://laradice.ru/%3Fp%3D51">repeated it repeatedly</a> - it is not worth personalizing.  On the administrator must be a mask of inaccessibility.  It is difficult to do at the beginning when the site is just developing, who, if not the administrator, will lead the first users and will help beginners to deal with the system, glitches and whims.  Ideally, you should gradually move away from communication with users, but this does not work out, because users become your buddies and friends.  And friends take time, everyone needs to explain and tell the next action, because everyone considers himself "special, approximate." <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Based on this first rule - the administrator must be unavailable.</strong>  <strong>Let the machine answer for it.</strong> <br><br>  But without friends, users can not be.  Who else but alfatesters will be innovations, at the moment when it is still emerging in the head.  Some changes are better not to do, and you understand this only after you have made them.  But when you have faithful assistants who are ready to listen and prompt, the chance to make a mistake is reduced. <br><br>  <strong>Because the second rule - find yourself friends on the site.</strong> <br><br>  Where there are friends, there are enemies, they will certainly be.  If you did not listen to the first advice - consider them your personal, if you listened to - the site as a whole.  And yet it is not clear which of them is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.  Enmity can be expressed in anything from trolling, petty pampering and irresistible flooding, ending with open confrontation and crusades against the administration and rules, with the aim of forcing the administration to dance to its tune. <br><br>  With the first fight you need to definitely - remove unwanted content and ban.  Without fights, without hanging onto the disgraceful board - this is precisely what the small dirty men want to be noticed.  Spend a few minutes to clean up after them - and they will not return. <br><br>  <strong>Hence the third rule - calm and only calm.</strong> <br><br>  The second category is a bit more difficult to fight.  They are dangerous because they can really cause spontaneous rallies, misinform users and create panic.  It is not strange that sometimes it is beneficial.  Because, as you know, firstly, ‚Äúblack PR is also PR‚Äù (the main thing is that some bad news should not be true, like, for example, recent events with bestpersons), secondly, it excites users, and -Third, a happy final is only a plus in the administration box.  The main thing here is not to miss the moment and react in time, exposing the indisputable evidence of his innocence. <br><br>  <strong>The fourth rule is to be a cowboy, shoot first.</strong> <br><br>  Another thing is when revolutionaries are right in their demands (and this happens, history knows).  The administration should be able to accept its wrongfulness and suggest constructive solutions.  But it is better not to allow such things and not to launch the site to such an extent that someone would indicate what and how to do on your own resource.  If you really got down to business - bring it to the end and react to the slightest change in mood.  Be aware of everything that is happening on the site. <br><br>  <strong>The sad rule number five - was called gruzdem - get into the body.</strong> <br><br>  Unforeseen situations can not be saved.  This is rather a philosophical question - one cannot foresee everything.  That is why you can never and never create hard and fast rules.  Firstly, any rule can be broken, and the more specifically it is made, the easier it is to find a counter-intake (the mat has been banned; well, replace the letters with numbers and exclamation marks ‚Äî that‚Äôs not already).  Second, by creating the rules, you first tie your hands to yourself.  Who else but an administrator must clearly follow certain settings on the site.  Therefore, the recipe - the more vague the rules, the harder it is to break them and the easier it is to be punished (guided by them, even if it is subjective, the administrator is allowed), now you are looking for counterpriests. <br><br>  <strong>The sixth rule suggests itself - the rules for fools.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>And finally, the last rule - be subjective!</strong>  For objectivity, you still can not hijack, so it is better to have an opinion than a bunch of strangers. <br><br>  Maybe I missed something? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37294/</a></p>
