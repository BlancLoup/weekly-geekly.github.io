  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where is the Internet ‚Äúliving in Russia well‚Äù?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet has gone so deeply into our daily life that we often already perceive it as an integral part of our world, akin to the atmosphere that has enveloped our planet, like water in a faucet.  Having occupied offices at the beginning, the world wide web quickly penetrated into our home space.  Given the depth of penetration of this technology, it is hard to believe that it actually originated in the entire post-Soviet space only 25 years ago - in the summer of 1990.  Thanks to the Soviet communication system developed and implemented in the USSR by using Internet addressing, on August 28, 1990, for workstations connected via ordinary telephone channels, it became possible to organize the first international modem communication session between the ‚Äúcountry of councils‚Äù and the capitalist world.  But the main factors of such rapid integration of network technologies into our lives were technical progress and the systematic fall in prices for this service.  Being for a long time accessible only to selected segments of the population due to the apparent high cost, the Internet becomes publicly available.  The employees of the providers' companies provide a fixed-line channel directly to our doorstep for a very nominal fee, while at the speeds of which the pioneers of this technology apparently could not have dreamed of.  Further in this article we will talk about how exactly the Internet became available in the former republican capitals of the country in which he took his first steps 25 years ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/990/3ba/e739903ba45647fb888a615ab8af482a.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Moscow </h4><br>  It was from this capital that on August 28, 1990, the first exchange of data packets via the Internet between the Kurchatov Institute and the Helsinki National University was made.  Being in the technical and political vanguard of the country, Moscow has not yet lost its leading position in the development of network infrastructure.  Many providers provide the entire existing range of network access services, ranging from the forgotten Dial-Up to the most advanced fiber-optic connections.  At the same time, high-speed connection prices are among the lowest in the review.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/476/fec/24b/476fec24b29e42ff85e9694cf392f4e7.png"><br><br><h4>  Minsk </h4><br>  The capital of Belarus, as well as its predecessor, has a well-developed IT infrastructure, and ordinary citizens of Minsk have access to the highest-speed networks.  However, due to certain reasons, the price of the provided access to the fixed network for citizens will be slightly higher than that of residents from other capitals - neighbors in the European region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/d49/6a2/7b9d496a2ff842678136936e5aef54c3.png"><br><br><h4>  Kishinev </h4><br>  In Soviet times, the capital of the agrarian region, it was in the Moldavian capital that the progress of the IT infrastructure was perhaps the most tangible.  As well as residents of advanced in many relations of Moscow, residents of Chisinau have access to all the benefits of civilization, among which, of course, fiber optics.  At the same time, the prices of providers for the most popular packages are very ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/6b8/6ab/bdb6b86abffb4efaabe1bd9d3004e1c5.png"><br><br><h4>  Riga </h4><br>  Despite the fact that the capital of Latvia has always been the most industrially developed, and even the most populations among the three Baltic republics were banal, this is the worst situation with access to the Internet, albeit very conditionally.  All three Baltic countries have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù neighborhood, because it is through their states that the main IT highways connecting the North-West of the Russian Federation with central Europe pass.  Residents of Riga have access to all types of fixed Internet connections, but the price for it is somewhat higher than that of its neighbors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/30f/026/c1630f02602f4937bbbd23327c59cb31.png"><br><br><h4>  Vilnius </h4><br>  The situation with the Lithuanian capital is very similar to that of Chisinau.  Being in many respects the most "non-Soviet" republic - Lithuania was on the periphery of the industrial and scientific development of the country, while most of the cities of the Union experienced a boom in the organization of new industries, institutions with advanced scientific trends, Vilnius was out of these processes.  At the turn of the millennia, this state of affairs led to the terrible state of the IT sector.  As soon as they had reached the technological impasse, the country's leadership, having managed to adequately assess the threats coming from the country's lag in the IT sector, took drastic measures to change the situation for the better.  Investments in the modernization and construction of new IT highways in the early 2000s gave their results and now Vilnius has taken a worthy place among its neighbors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff3/bd2/e8d/ff3bd2e8d1714c3ebb5b6c26124f809c.png"><br><br><h4>  Tallinn </h4><br>  The most progressive, regarding IT, is the capital among its neighbors.  Here, of course, the favorable geographical position played into the hands of the residents of Tallinn.  Besides the fact that the country is on the way of IT backbones from the Russian Federation to Europe, the position of the city and country leaders, aimed at building a new type of economy, tied primarily to the general availability of communications, played a big role in the availability of the Internet in Tallinn.  As a result, the Republican capital of the 1990 model, which is quite backward from the point of view of advanced technologies, has become an example for inheritance in the IT sector after 25 years.  Free WiFi networks throughout the city and more than adequate prices for connecting to a fixed fiber optic connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b15/a78/0e7/b15a780e76bd4d4e823dc8c2c53a0f19.png"><br><br><h4>  Kiev </h4><br>  Closes the list of cities in the European region, the capital of independent Ukraine.  Back in Soviet times, Kiev was one of the largest industrial and scientific centers in the country, thanks to which the IT sphere developed rapidly.  In the IT field, Kiev institutes were always at the forefront of scientific thought, preparing specialists of various technical specialties, developing technical means for storing and processing information.  In addition, the geographical location of Kiev and Ukraine as a whole played an important role in the current market of Internet services, making the city an important infrastructure hub in the operation of the main IT highways connecting the Russian Federation and European countries.  Of all the post-Soviet "capitals", it is Kiev that boasts the cheapest and highest-quality access to the world wide web. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b4/377/d6e/2b4377d6eadf4651ba585ce5f2402954.png"><br><br><h4>  Tbilisi </h4><br>  Opens a specific Caucasus region, the capital of Georgia.  In contrast to the Baltic states, the countries of the region received instead of a super-developed Europe, such neighbors as a semi-closed Iran and frankly backward, in terms of modern IT infrastructure, the Middle East.  However, it was Tbilisi that could become a peculiar growth point for the IT sector for the entire region.  The overall technological backwardness and poor quality of the Internet access services one way or another unites all three capitals.  In the case of Tbilisi, this generalization has the least force.  For very reasonable money, city residents have the opportunity to get access to the ‚Äúoptics‚Äù as well, and often the declared parameters of the channel will even correspond to the characteristics stated by the providers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/a29/fc0/ae3a29fc02084840b8e9c73bab5cf676.png"><br><br><h4>  Yerevan </h4><br>  All that has been said about Tbilisi is also valid for the capital of Armenia.  Wide channels at current prices for the widest mass.  However, since the country's IT infrastructure is connected to the world through Georgia, the quality of service provision in Yerevan will be somewhat worse and more expensive than its predecessor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f3/bd2/b8e/4f3bd2b8e7384112ac8344a859ca7190.png"><br><br><h4>  Baku </h4><br>  The two millionth city, the pearl of the Caspian Sea, did not suffer from the lack of attention of the central authorities in Soviet times.  Being aware of all the technical innovations, it was in Baku, already in 1991, that the first commercial Internet provider appeared.  Thus, the Bakuvians actually became one of the first who in the post-Soviet space was able to get free access to the worldwide network.  However, becoming hostage to the economic and political situation in the permanently depressed region, as well as as a result of insufficient attention to the country's IT sector, at the moment the picture with the Internet is not too rosy.  Although potential netizens have free access to broadband fixed-line channels, the price of this service may unpleasantly surprise guests even from neighboring Caucasian capitals.  At the same time, the parameters of the declared connection will not always correspond to the declared providers of the city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/663/938/c32/663938c328dc406694d26f22ed084336.png"><br><br><h4>  Almaty </h4><br>  Although this beautiful city has not been the capital of the Republic of Kazakhstan since 1997, it is still the largest city in the country.  Opening an excursion into Central Asia, Almaty can be called at the same time as the most prominent representative of the region, and the most dissimilar to its neighbors.  Literally right up to the beginning of the XXI century, the entire huge region had only point access to the Internet.  In all the capitals of the region, access to the Internet was not actually provided to citizens.  The difficult economic situation of the countries of the region after the reintegration processes with the economic and political core of the territories left its mark.  Since 2000, the development of IT infrastructure, both in Almaty and the country as a whole, has become a priority for the gaining strength of the state.  Huge investments in the laying of new highways, stimulated the construction of modern infrastructure virtually from scratch.  As a result of tremendous efforts, Almaty residents now have access to fast and very inexpensive Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78f/cd0/413/78fcd0413c8844d5979b05f2f4b929a8.png"><br><br><h4>  Bishkek </h4><br>  The capital of Kyrgyzstan, located just two hundred kilometers from the already mentioned Almaty.  Such a neighborhood for the citizens of Bishkek had a very positive impact on the ability to access the Internet.  Being more or less in orbit of the processes occurring in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan experienced all the same processes as their large neighbor.  At the moment, Bishkek residents have a fairly stable high-speed Internet, however, prices for the usual for Europe channel with unlimited traffic can be saddened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdf/9d6/0c4/fdf9d60c489a4b68ad0d58fa99486601.png"><br><br><h4>  Tashkent </h4><br>  The largest city of Central Asia.  Back in Soviet times, it was recognized as a leader in the region not only in terms of population, but also in industrial production and the introduction of advanced technologies, it was here that the largest number of regional universities were operating.  The scientific and industrial potential of the city, which was laid in it for decades, has suffered greatly as a result of the difficult economic situation of the country over the past 25 years.  The region‚Äôs underdeveloped IT infrastructure translates Tashkent‚Äôs access to the Internet to the category of luxury.  Although high-speed fixed connectivity is widely available, the price of channels is off the scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2f/f98/1e1/d2ff981e1f83415f85a5d82cc4af21d2.png"><br><br><h4>  Dushanbe </h4><br>  Being the capital of the poorest country in the region, high-quality high-speed Internet for Dushanbe residents is an unattainable luxury.  Being among the Pamir ranges, at a significant distance from the regional centers of the IT infrastructure, are valuable and the quality of Internet services do not meet the requirements of the modern world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6b/541/a94/a6b541a941f34942a3a1cf0e4eea4883.png"><br><br><h4>  Ashgabat </h4><br>  The city of love, the southern military-political outpost of the whole Soviet region, the capital of modern Neutral Turkmenistan, is now called Ashgabat.  Being always a semi-closed border town, advanced technologies in the field of communication and free circulation of information were not particularly welcomed here.  The absence of serious scientific and industrial institutions also did not stimulate the development of the IT sector in this city rich in southern colors.  With the independence of Turkmenistan, the situation in the country and directly in Ashgabat itself has only become more aggravated.  The whole range of highly controversial transformations that the state was experiencing did not improve the situation with the residents' access to the worldwide network, but on the contrary, completely deprived them of them.  Until 2007, the residents of Ashgabat, sandwiched on one side by steep Kopetdag ridges and the Karakum desert on the other, did not have access to the worldwide network.  However, progress cannot be stopped, and since 2007, with the political patronage of the respected leader of Neutral Turkmenistan, under the auspices of the Golden Age of Turkmen, a massive process of informatization of society has begun.  However, the years of oblivion for the technology were not in vain, and now in Ashgabat there is still a problem with full access to the Internet.  Tariffs for high-speed, fixed connection to the network are at a frankly inadequate level.  Given the fact that the majority of the population still has access to wireless 3G Internet for reasonable money, which is more in the lower tariffs, economy or politics, it is not entirely clear.  Nevertheless, it is these very impressive numbers close our today's review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2a/841/8fb/a2a8418fb1a945118681f946ff73a4bb.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260611/</a></p>
