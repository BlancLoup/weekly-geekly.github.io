Someone long and hard thinks and can not get off the ground. <br><br>  Some look at what competitors are doing and try to partially or completely repeat.  Not many people resort to creative thinking, not analytical.  Inspiration and brilliant ideas are most often visited when you just let go of your thoughts to float freely and become a creator.

      From my own experience I can say that the best ideas for my business visit me when I play sports, for example, just running.  At such times my mind is very clear. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was on the treadmill that I thought of developing my successful project in the network of federal franchises and later, having presented the idea to my colleagues at the meeting, I received their support and approval. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b0c/901/1b0/b0c9011b079a2e59e4838dfb660eb313.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each person finds ideas in different ways, it is important to find a way that will work exactly in your case. <br>  Here are five strategies that will help you learn how to discover new ideas and develop them into whole projects.  Try each! <br><br>  <b>1. Stay up to date with business news.</b> <br><br>  It is extremely important to keep abreast of business news, to understand what is happening in the world and in your industry in particular.  Read thematic publications, scroll through the pages in social networks.  All ways of obtaining information are good.  You need to know what your competitor is doing, what your potential customers are thinking about and what is happening in all branches of business. <br><br>  <b>2. Start small</b> <br><br>  Start by simply grabbing a pen or keyboard.  Everything.  The hardest thing behind.  Take and write down all the ideas that come to your mind. First you can be in a stupor, but you need to move yourself and write.  Sooner or later you will succeed, just start.  It looks like a tap that nobody used for a long time.  When you turn it on, the water may be slightly rusty and flow in a thin stream, but after a while the pressure will increase and the water will become clear. <br><br>  <i>Here's a little tip, think about what customers are doing with your product / service, and what results are they trying to achieve?</i>  <i>Take the opportunity to upgrade and improve your product to better serve customers.</i> <br><br>  <b>3. Find a way that clears your mind.</b> <br><br>  Some people go for a walk when they need to clear their minds, and some go on a weekend trip.  I prefer sports and almost always, when I come back from a run, I have a few ideas for my business. <br><br>  Since most of us cannot take weeks off every time we need inspiration, be sure to take the time for regular activities or trips. <br><br>  <b>4. Choose an effective way to fix ideas.</b> <br><br>  Depending on what activity you get the best ideas, you need to choose the best way to fix them. <br><br>  We all were disappointed by the forgotten, but such brilliant ideas that were not recorded in time.  I often use the voice recorder in the phone, because when I run, I do not want to stop and record.  It is much easier to press a button, speak a couple of sentences and continue your lesson. <br><br>  Keep a paper pen near your bed, many ideas come just before you go to bed.  And they must be fixed. <br><br>  <b>5. Receive feedback</b> <br><br>  After you have a formed idea, share it with colleagues, customers, partners.  Listen to their opinions and criticism.  The larger and more diverse the group of people you share with, the better.  After that you will have many different reactions that will help you to modernize the idea and really do something important.  I saw a lot of ideas that, in spite of their genius, did not receive the green light because they were not presented to the audience correctly - with confidence, enthusiasm and conviction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299766/</a></p>
