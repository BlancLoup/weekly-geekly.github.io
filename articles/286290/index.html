This survey also cited the opinions of respondents regarding the situation in the past, 2014.  The survey results are very interesting, because the answers are given by those who, figuratively speaking, are part of the Internet advertising market in Russia. <br><br>  But what does official statistics say?  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2015/02/27/rynok_internetreklamy_v_rossii_vyros_na_20_593243">Portal Cnews published analytics</a> on the Russian advertising market for 2014.  The results, despite all the problems that were felt last year, and are felt in this, are quite optimistic.  It turns out that last year the online advertising market in Russia grew by 20% in monetary terms. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, contextual and video advertising has become the main ‚Äúdrivers of progress‚Äù, but banner advertising continues to lose ground, and last year it showed negative dynamics.

      As for the total volume of the online advertising market, then in 2014 in Russia it grew to 81.4 billion rubles.  As mentioned above, this is 20% more than in 2013.  According to specialists of J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, the average annual market growth from 2012 to 2015 will be 16.5%.  ‚ÄúToday, the Internet advertising market is growing at the most intensive pace compared to other segments of the country's advertising market, such as advertising in the media, on radio and television.  The main driver of the online advertising market in the world is the growth of the Internet audience.  Despite the unstable economic situation in Russia, online advertising shows a positive trend, primarily due to contextual advertising, as well as through video advertising, ‚Äùanalysts of the company commented on the situation. <br><br>  As for the volume of each of the market segments, for example, the volume of such a segment as video advertising from 2012 to 2014 increased to 4.9 billion rubles.  In 2015, according to analysts, growth will continue, reaching a value of 20%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7d7/c72/11e/7d7c7211e90c5f3d8c13cec8e35f0571.jpg"><br>  Market volume of Internet advertising in the Russian Federation, billion rubles <br><br>  As for the total volume of the media advertising segment in 2014, it amounted to approximately 17 billion rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ba2/1a7/e4c/ba21a7e4c94f05926992323e93f63936.jpg"><br>  Contextual advertising in Russia, distribution by segments <br><br>  As you can see, the larger segment in 33% was taken by Mail.ru, a little smaller - by Yandex, from 19%. <br><br>  As for the growth rate of display advertising over the past year, they have slowed down somewhat.  However, the growth continues.  But with banner advertising, the situation is different - here we see a negative trend.  According to analysts, the main problem is the economic situation in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/08b/2f6/20c/08b2f620c3bc0eb570cc0bcf6caec55d.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe growth potential of the online advertising market due to the rapid growth of the audience has almost been exhausted, and in a situation of crisis and economic stagnation, advertisers who operate with large budgets translate them into television advertising, due to which the media advertising segment falls.  The exception is video advertising, which is the most dynamic segment of the market, in particular due to advertising on OTT (Over The Top) video services, ‚ÄùJ'son &amp; Partners Consulting experts said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286290/</a></p>
