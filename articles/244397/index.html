We understand your pain, brother.  You can not do it this way. <br><br>  We are on the verge of great change.  We do not know exactly how, but our world will change a lot.  It is criminal not to try to use the potential of virtual reality to the maximum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/a05/4ab/a8ca054ab7e34de29859abee3280eb9b.jpg">

      I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/225347/">wrote</a> about our experience of using the Oculus Rift in quests in reality.  We were the first in Russia to make an independent entertainment product with virtual reality glasses.  Cyberpunk opened in St. Petersburg in May, and there is still no product on the Russian market that is similar to ours. <br><br>  Since then, we have changed points from DK1 to DK2, updated virtual reality itself several times, adding special effects and even added a live cat to it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/5b6/cae/4645b6cae12a4168bb5a3fc845a9d12c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>About technology</b> <br>  In the production of quests in reality, we initially relied on advanced technology.  Developments that are full of media headlines, but which have not yet been implemented in large quantities - are being used here.  In addition to Oculus Rift, this is leap motion (gesture control), the MindWave neural interface (thought power control). <br><br>  This path is thorny, and we will share with you the experience, if suddenly you wondered whether to throw away a computer mouse, watching a movie like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af2/724/1e2/af27241e255d6f722764c5713c05f825.gif" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gby6hGZb3ww%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh46WY4YGhU4u4LKAJEWWo-QkJHkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It would seem that here it is - gesture control of a computer. <br><br>  However, despite the fact that Hewlett Packard already sells laptops with built-in leap motion, the tool itself is far from ideal.  In demos under leap motion, actions with unpredictable results look best (disperse a swarm of randomly flying moths).  The mini-games work well, where the palm practically does not move, the fingers are not involved, and you, changing the position of the palm, say, indicate the direction of the airplane's flight. <br><br>  In demos with more subtle actions (take an object with two fingers, press a small button with one finger) - sooner or later there always comes a stage when you just wave your hands to get at least some reaction.  The level of irritation quickly reaches the limit. <br><br>  Forget about using gestures with your fingers. <br><br>  You show two fingers, and you see - one, your fingers tremble unnaturally, the objects you touch also tremble, the hand turns inside out or disappears, and if you hold it with an edge to the leap motion - anything can happen.  These are the most frequent problems, and you cannot avoid them unless you write a super filter. <br><br>  In addition, the leap is sensitive to light. <br><br>  What can be implemented? <br><br>  In practice, swipe (palm movement) to the right and left, circular motion and compression of the palm into a fist work adequately.  (However, regular gestures can not use at all and write your detector.) In addition, you can determine the location of the hand and assign different actions to different zones.  Those.  the hand touches the door handle, and the door is already animated. <br><br>  Another interesting topic is the visualization of the hands themselves.  You can use ready-made hands, for example, skeletal, you can draw your own.  And you can shoot through the camera real - see video.  Although there are some nuances here. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcNax8nG_sY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhghkZPQzuwNr7aFvWdebGUdPbJGOg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Based on this experience, we are currently developing "Cyberpunk 2.0", a new version of our quest in reality.  In it, we completely remake the scenario of adventures in virtual reality and add leap motion. <br><br>  Something with leap motion we have already launched for commercial use.  In our new quest ‚ÄúLynch Court‚Äù, made based on David Lynch's film production, players need to master telekinesis, moving certain objects with the help of passes with their hands. <br><br>  Initially, we made this decision with Kinect, and here leap motion shows its main advantage.  The position of the hand, he tracks at times better.  Although one has to sacrifice space (leap sees no farther than half a meter, and Kinect sees the whole room), there are far fewer false positives. <br><br>  Yes, and do not think that the purpose of this article is to criticize the leap, we just write what is really done at the moment, and what will happen in the future, we, like you, are looking forward to.  Yes, and we are not the only ‚Äúfake‚Äù, because you can make hands in virtual reality in other ways.  But more about that some other time. <br><br>  PS By the way, we accept offers of cooperation from Moscow and other cities of Mother Russia and will gladly help you to make your own virtual quest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244397/</a></p>
