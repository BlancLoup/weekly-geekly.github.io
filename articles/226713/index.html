The conference is certainly a strong word, probably a mini-conference would be better said. <br><br>  Only four reports were read: <br><ul><li>  Domestic Cellular Microprocessor <b>Multiclet</b> </li><li>  Miniature drones - <b>ornithopters</b> </li><li>  <b>Quadcopters</b> </li><li>  San Francisco's <b>MakerFaire</b> DIY Enthusiast Festival Report </li></ul><br>  In fact, we conducted an experiment and tested our forces in organizing such events.  And I must say, the experiment was a success!  Now we are encouraged to scale :) <br><br>  Anticipating a large number of visitors (people 40-50), we preoccupied us in advance with a room that was more spacious than our modest hackspace.  And this time the city center for contemporary art (NCCA) helped us out.  The benefit of their building is a 10 minute walk from us. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      But back to the reports.  So, four topics. <br><br><h5>  1. Domestic Cellular Microprocessor Multiclet </h5><br>  <i>Speaker: Mikhail Bakhterev, <b>Multiclet</b></i> <br><br>  Hmm, how many domestic processors that can somehow compete with modern monsters from Intel and AMD do you know?  Only Elbrus-4C comes to mind, which is unlikely to be used in household PCs. <br><br>  But it turns out there is another domestic processor with a unique architecture, and its name is Multiclet.  Mikhail Bakhterev of the company of the same name told us about the peculiarities of this architecture. <br><br>  <i>Michael shows how a typical modern processor works.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/289/283/fcf/289283fcf020031eea209bea45b05ced.jpg"><br><br>  Multiclet is short for multicellular.  Each such processor contains a number of so-called cells.  The working model of the device has only 4 cells.  The plans are to create a chip with 256 cells. <br><br>  It is clear that processor cells can execute language instructions in parallel.  It uses an unusual approach to traditional architecture.  But besides parallelization, Multiclet has one more important feature that makes it very interesting for the space and military industry.  It lies in the fact that when individual cells fail, the processor continues to work.  Such a chip is not afraid of the bombing of high-energy particles (you never know, star wars). <br><br>  This feature allows you to adjust the processor power, turning off extra cells on the go.  And this is already useful for autonomous robots, who have an eternal shortage of energy. <br><br>  In general, the development is very interesting and promising.  I hope the authors will bring their brainchild to the commercial version, and soon we will see this processor in domestic devices and robots. <br><br><h5>  2. Miniature drones - ornithopters </h5><br>  <i>Speaker: Stepan Glushkov, <b>MakeItLab</b></i> <br><br>  The next report was extremely spectacular, and aroused a storm of emotions among our listeners.  This time it was about robots who really want to be like living insects. <br><br>  <i>Miniature ornithopter in Stepan‚Äôs hand</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bc/e50/9da/2bce509da7db0c536128967a133e372e.jpg"><br><br>  One of the few (and perhaps the only one) who in our country is engaged in such a difficult task - Stepan, <b>demonstrated his creatures in action:</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9IOj6KXq8KU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBW3WbcFXK43Se5k5PnD08_qj2AQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first was a four-winged ornithopter, battle-hardened, updated by Stepan especially for the conference.  A camera was installed on board the unmanned vehicle, the image from which was transmitted directly to the projector screen! <br><br>  Behind him rose the smallest ornithopter.  This robot already had two wings, and in flight it is very similar to a lost insect.  The same transparent wings, the same rapid flight. <br><br>  <i>Stepan is attacked by grateful listeners :)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/088/2ce/0f9/0882ce0f968cf25c0fc58bd8ea15ee40.jpg"><br><br>  Next in line is Stepan's micro ornithopter, with a powerful brushless motor on board and an integrated stabilization subsystem.  This machine will be able to hang in one place and move between waypoints.  But on the way to such an ornithopter there are still many unsolved problems, including the most important for all autonomous robots - food. <br><br><h5>  3. Quadcopters </h5><br>  <i>Speaker: Sergey Grischenko ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ssg1712/" class="user_link">ssg1712</a> ), <b>URTK</b></i> <br><br>  The topic of unmanned flights was picked up by our colleagues and the U.S.Popov Radio Engineering College: Sergey Grishchenko and Alexander Vasilyev.  In his report, Sergey described how a quadrocopter (and indeed any multicopter) works, how this machine is controlled, and how to make such a device yourself. <br><br>  <i>Different multicopter circuits</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fa/8fd/a94/6fa8fda94958bb9182a63eccb6e2a4d4.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, this report did not go without a demonstration of flying UAVs, which the authors did on their own.  Right in the hall, Alexander launched his miniature quadrocopter.  Despite the fact that his unit is not equipped with a full-fledged stabilization subsystem, the years of training allowed the owner to skillfully hold the car in almost one position. <br><br>  Big quadrocopter Sergey served as an excellent tool for the analysis of the principles of the on-board computer.  But the audience could only see the flight of this device on the street (see the end of the article). <br><br>  <i>Miniature quadcopter Alexandra Vasilyeva</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac1/c4e/438/ac1c4e4380d0eca03c9332e1e2c8fee2.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Heavy quadcopter Sergey Gryshchenko</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dc/b60/8c2/6dcb608c223c88214dccd4a63ae1a4f9.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Backlight</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8b/b75/cf2/b8bb75cf25fd2b4a21221bb64914b6cc.jpg"><br><br>  A few days after the report, the large quadcopter was successfully upgraded and lightened.  Now he flies longer and farther :) <br><br><h5>  4. A report about the DIY festival of MakerFaire enthusiasts in San Francisco </h5><br>  <i>Speaker: Oleg Evsegneev, <b>MakeItLab</b></i> <br><br>  Finally, at the end of our mini-conference, your humble servant told about the breathtaking event that I was able to visit in San Francisco.  The MakerFaire festival is truly the coolest event for all DIY enthusiasts. <br><br>  <i>The MakerFaire Tale in San Francisco</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87b/309/c88/87b309c8841aab1c6b26d6388b2561a0.jpg"><br><br>  MakerFaire is a mixture of fairs, exhibitions of DIY works, exhibitions of start-ups, various master classes and just entertainment.  And, of course, having a technical bias, absolutely all types of DIY were present at the festival.  Starting from embroidery and growing mushrooms (yes, mushrooms), ending with 3D printers and robots. <br><br>  Among the festival visitors there were traditionally many parents with children.  There were also many who first became acquainted with the world of DIY.  In general, one of the main objectives of MakerFaire - the popularization of technology, was fulfilled by 200%. <br><br>  <i>Note</i> .  A similar event will be held at the end of the summer in Moscow.  I do not know what will come of it, but in any case, it is nice to know that the maker movement in our country is supported by the organizers of large events.  Next year, it may be possible to organize something similar in our place in Yekaterinburg. <br><br><h5>  Flying in the fresh air </h5><br>  After my impetuous story, all the participants gathered in the courtyard of the center.  To exchange impressions, to see how quadrocopters fly. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6scNvtapg0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhisYXDL8kmEDpB88fRtaS0bLwJBrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Summing up</i> , I would say once again that the experiment with the organization of the mini-conference was a success.  According to estimates, at one point in the hall were up to 70 people (instead of the planned 40).  Of course, it was a bit crowded and stuffy.  Some were upset that there were no large humanoid robots at the conference (the word ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù was in the title).  But in general, I repeat, the mission was completed.  Everyone who wanted to know what kind of beast Multiclet.  We saw flights of unusual ornithopters, and available quadcopters. <br><br>  In the second half of July (after the Innoprom exhibition) we want to organize a robo-conference again.  If you have interesting projects that you want to talk about - we will be glad to see you among the speakers!  More information about the upcoming event will certainly appear in our <a href="http://vk.com/makeitlab">VK group</a> , on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/makeitlab">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/MakeItLab">Twitter</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226713/</a></p>
