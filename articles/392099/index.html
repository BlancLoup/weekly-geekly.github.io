Sometimes electronic map services are also mistaken.  But one thing - to come in or go in the wrong place, and quite another - <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2016/03/24/texas-wrong-house-torn-down-google-maps/">to lose</a> your own home.  By mistake, yes.  Homeowners residing in Texas, USA, requested repairs to the building because the house was damaged due to a tornado (back in 2015).  Until now, homeowners have been waiting for an insurance company decision.

      The building was located at 7601 Calypso Dr., as seen on the map.  Ironically, the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer%3Fmid%3DzZYcNLx_D6MU.kBtTH27a2RuU">Google Maps</a> map service <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer%3Fmid%3DzZYcNLx_D6MU.kBtTH27a2RuU">believes</a> that the house is also located here, which is actually located at 7601 Cousteau Dr ( <a href="http://maps.apple.com/maps%3Faddress%3D7601%2520Cousteau%2520Dr%2520Rowlett%2520TX%252075088-5321%2520United%2520States%26amp%3Bll%3D32.900234,-96.528119%26amp%3Bt%3Dh">Apple Maps</a> and <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/search/results%3Fpage%3D0%26amp%3BcenterOnResults%3D1%26amp%3Bslug%3D%252Fus%252Ftx%252Frowlett%252F75088%252F7601-cousteau-dr-32.900234,-96.528119%26amp%3Bquery%3D7601%2520Cousteau%2520Dr,%2520Rowlett,%2520TX%252075088">Mapquest</a> show everything correctly).  So, the first house had to be repaired, and the second one was to be demolished.  Both houses were located on neighboring streets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33e/dda/3ee/33edda3ee5864f04a08794b992329e7b.jpg"><br>  <i>Oops, that's for sure.</i>  <i>Screenshot Google Maps</i> <br><br>  The owner of the house, which had to be repaired, found out about the demolition of the building thanks to the call of her neighbor.  Lindsey Diaz (Lindsey Diaz) just agreed with the builders on the repair.  After calling the neighbor, she realized that there was nothing to repair.  Naturally, followed by a call to the company, which demolished the building by mistake.  But the team that destroyed her house sent her a screenshot from Google Maps, and considered the incident settled - so far no one even apologized to Diaz.  After everything cleared up, the demolition team destroyed the house at the correct address. <br><br>  The situation remains unclear so far - the company involved in the demolition of the house, does not respond to calls Linda, and does not comment on what happened.  The situation looks very unusual, if not to say wildly, so one should think that additional information about the incident will soon appear, and it will be possible to understand how the issue will be resolved.  In the meantime - look at the map, is your own home listed at the correct address? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392099/</a></p>
