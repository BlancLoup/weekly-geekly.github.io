  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ideal office for small business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of the habrayusers work in small companies of up to 15 people.  Such companies usually have no premises in the property and rent 1-2 rooms in office centers.  These rooms carry out functions and reception, and negotiation, and back office, and mini-kitchen.  They work here, relax, drink coffee with buns, and sometimes even have lunch. <br><br>  Most of the ‚Äúoffice centers‚Äù are the buildings of the former research institutes, design institutes, administrative buildings of the ruined factories, etc.  (The so-called office real estate class C and D).  Together with shabby walls, newly-minted offices inherited the Administration.  And if in many buildings the walls were plastered, the wallpaper was re-glued and the euro-windows were inserted, the Administration remained the same. <br>  A typical building administrator is an aunt of 50-55 years of age with a facial expression ‚Äúleave me alone, I have lunch!‚Äù An accountant of about the same age always comes along with the administrator.  The third typical character of the Administration is the manager grandfather, the most good-natured of the trinity.  But it is under the heel of the administrator and does not make independent decisions. <br>  There is also a building owner.  Mythical person, no one ever sees him.  It seems that he doesn‚Äôt care what happens in his office center, the main thing is to get money into a bank account. <br>  Soviet buildings inherited Soviet service.  We provide premises - the rest is your problem - this is usually the tacit attitude of the administration.  The situation is better in modern business centers, but even there the service is not always at its best, and so are administrations with quirks.  In addition, high rents discourage many companies from such offices. <br><br>  So what is the ideal office for a small company?  Let's dream a little. <br>  Comfortable workplace, not too high density of employees per square meters - this is something that can be organized by the forces of the tenant himself.  I would like to talk about things that depend on the landlord.

      <b>Recreation area inside the building</b> <br>  Since small companies do not have recreation areas for employees and meeting rooms for customers, such a place could be a corner in the corridor created on each floor.  A few chairs, a sofa, a couple of coffee tables are enough.  A water cooler would also be appropriate. <br><br>  <b>Animal Farm or lovely garden?</b> <br>  The courtyard of the building where our <a href="http://magwai.ru/">web studio Magway is</a> leasing an office now, we jokingly refer to the barnyard.  The asphalt was shifted there last 30 years ago, the garbage is not removed, in principle, piled up hills.  In rainy weather there is better not to walk at all.  For the sake of completeness, all that is missing are pigs wallowing in mud.  It would be great if a tile or a new asphalt were laid at this place, there were benches and a gazebo, and weed and flowers grew behind them.  At lunch, you could go outside to relax, relax a little and breathe the air. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Building mode</b> <br>  Alas, many buildings finish their work too early and are closed on Saturday-Sunday.  This is not always convenient.  The ideal schedule, in my opinion, from 8 to 21, Saturday is a working day.  The administration, out of habit, generally works from 8 to 16-45. <br><br>  <b>Nutrition</b> <br>  A couple of cafes with a varied menu.  The monotony of food quickly annoys.  Cafe owners often don‚Äôt rush to change the assortment of dishes - why, if office workers have nowhere to go, they will still walk, if there is nothing else nearby. <br>  In addition to the cafe, there must be a mini-store in the building: juices, water, ice cream, buns. <br><br>  <b>Internal LAN</b> <br>  I would be happy to discuss topical business issues with colleagues in the building at the internal forum.  Perhaps there would be new business contacts.  At the same forum I read news from the administration and expressed my wishes in the comments.  From the local server would download new music or contract templates, kindly laid out by the manager of the company from the second floor. <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br>  All buildings have security: frail men 45-60 years old.  Is there any sense from such guards in case of a real danger?  But the negative effect of them happens: they make it difficult for tenant customers to enter the building if access control is in effect. <br>  The guards perform the functions of a girl at the reception more - they tell you how to get there, is there such a tenant, record the names of the guests in the visitors' magazine ... Wouldn't it be better to give these functions to a pretty girl who would provide reference services to the building guests? <br><br>  <b>Air conditioning</b> <br>  Air conditioning put every office!  Installation pays off and faster plastic windows and plasterboard walls.  No need to shift this issue on the shoulders of the tenant.  In our office, in order to install an air conditioner, it is necessary to install a meter (of course at the expense of the tenant) and only then allow to install an air conditioner.  For electricity consumed by the air conditioner will be charged separately for this meter. <br><br>  <b>Toilets</b> <br>  Liquid soap, toilet paper - do not save on trifles.  The fact that the toilet should be clean, I think, it is not even worth mentioning. <br><br>  <b>Smoking room</b> <br>  Sick question for many offices.  There are no separate smoking rooms.  They smoke either in the toilets or on the stairs.  Both are bad because they stink. <br><br>  <b>Parking</b> <br>  If there are vacant spaces in front of the office, the administration should take care of the organization of a civilized parking lot, marking the places for cars.  Otherwise, an elemental arises. <br><br>  <b>Cleaning</b> <br>  Room cleaning should be included in the rental price or at least provided for an additional fee.  Even this is not everywhere.  Either clean yourself, or negotiate directly with a cleaner who cleans the corridors. <br><br>  <b>System administrators</b> <br>  Many small companies do not have their system administrators.  Invite private traders for one-time work or give the service to outsource.  Why not the Landlord organize computer support as an additional service?  It is beneficial for all: additional income to the lessor, the tenant has a system administrator at his side, who can quickly solve problems, do not have to wait until a person comes from an outsourcing company.  I think this service would be popular. <br>  Similarly, it is possible to offer accounting services, although it is more difficult here - companies are more tied to their permanent accountants-outsourcers and their proximity to the office is not so critical. <br><br>  <b>Other</b> <br>  Of course, on the territory of the office center can be ATMs, copy centers, bank branches, bars, sports clubs and boutiques.  But all this already refers to real estate categories A and B, although, if the ground floor space permits, no one bothers to attract such tenants to the building category C. <br><br>  An ideal office is, of course, not only the facilities mentioned above, but also a psychologically comfortable environment, a friendly team and interesting work.  Without this, even the most elegant office will not be a joy. <br><br>  What would you like to see in your office building? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62588/</a></p>
