  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication on the Internet: earlier and now (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  A little more than two days ago I conducted a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/202232/">survey</a> among the ‚Äúinhabitants‚Äù of Habr on the topic of communication on the Internet.  There was a lively discussion in the comments (more than 150 comments), which is good news.  I promised an infographic, but suddenly I remembered that I couldn‚Äôt draw and the designer from me wasn‚Äôt particularly good, so I‚Äôd better give the results of the survey in a more beautiful way, as well as attach my opinion. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Sort by </h4><br>  We will not retreat from the order presented in the survey.  It used to be 5-7 years ago.

    <h5>  Jabber </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/358/585/a5e/358585a5e9574a6a4db5619cae585924.gif"><br>  Initially, I thought that there would be a huge difference, because before, almost all of my friends had and used Jabber, which cannot be said about the current situation.  At the moment, among my friends there is not a single person who would use this service.  Honestly, the result of the survey I was very surprised. <br><br><h5>  IRC </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/318/e9e/210/318e9e2103b08f9ec8c669064bcc3f3f.gif"><br>  The result is quite predictable, because in order to use IRC, it is not enough just to pick up the client, connect to the network and chat.  You need to know a few commands that people do not really want to remember.  It also has quite a lot of inconvenience.  Take at least sending files according to the client-client scheme, which does not allow receiving files without a dedicated ‚Äúwhite‚Äù IP.  The inconvenience can also be attributed to the lack of smiles, sending pictures to the chat and other priblud modern means of communication. <br><br><h5>  ICQ </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3da/03a/dde/3da03adde94f2cd8570327f88ec960c2.gif"><br>  The popularity of ICQ just recently went off scale, which shows results, but something still shaken her position.  Perhaps this lack of less sane voice chat, or an abundance of spam.  And if you had a beautiful number, then a huge crowd of hackers attempted to lead him away, which created some discomfort. <br><br><h5>  AIM </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b8/a05/80f/7b8a0580f1e02a5bd573c5547608419b.gif"><br>  Apparently, including AIM in this list was a disastrous idea, since AIM, along with MSN, was not widely used in Russia. <br><br><h5>  E-mail </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1d/219/a93/d1d219a9304b3974ef1e24fdfafd3aeb.gif"><br>  Email stability is predictable, because it is simply impossible to come up with something more convenient or progressive. <br><br><h5>  Skype </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a9/d68/fae/3a9d68fae272e40926999c5face1ff21.gif"><br>  The largest increase in users received Skype.  This can be explained by combining voice and text chat, the possibility of holding conferences with several people, the possibility of holding video conferences, and you can always be sure that the file sent by you will reach the addressee, regardless of its IP address. <br><br>  But not everything is so cloudless.  Firstly, the abundance of advertising inside the program is, frankly, annoying.  Secondly, you cannot be sure that your message will reach the addressee if it is not online.  For a contact to receive a message, you both need to be online.  This creates certain inconveniences.  I will give an example from the comments: <br><blockquote>  - I bought tickets, come tomorrow at 7, 6 car.  Meet me </blockquote><br>  No one would wish such a situation. <br><br><h5>  Chats, forums </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd6/129/ad3/fd6129ad301751c4fce25595c632dfbe.gif"><br>  Social networks preempted chats.  Most likely, the decline almost in half (on the diagram) occurred just because of this.  As for the forums, they are alive and continue to be actively used.  True, most of them are thematic, because for simple communication people prefer to use social networks. <br><br><h5>  Social networks </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fa/4a3/705/2fa4a37053871211f9c2ea2b13f37d40.gif"><br>  Here we come to the most important thief of people from jabber, ICQ, IRC, forums and chats.  Social network is really very convenient, because it includes literally everything: text chat, audio recordings, video recordings, games, groups, advertising and much more.  Some all inclusive service.  It seems that everything is fine, all the information is in one place, but this medal has two sides.  Describe your opinion about the dark side of soc.  networks, I will not, because it can cause a big holivar.  I just say that nothing is perfect. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I want to thank all the habra people for participating in this small, but informative (for me) study. <br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202474/</a></p>
