Hardware solutions were not considered in principle because of cost, and all proprietary software solutions were eliminated for the same reason.  Only free software remained.  The benefit of free solutions is more than enough <br><br>  Since I started to get familiar with freeBSD free systems, I chose it.  Immediately I ask the habra people not to plant a holivar on BSD vs Linux - the main reason for choosing was a deeper knowledge of this system (I still cannot master Linux enough to be confident in the results of my work with it).  Actually, it was decided to organize the VPN on the basis of OpenVPN - again, I had to deal with it before, and I did not find any flaws.  And again I will ask without a holivar on PPTP - if there are supporters of such a decision, it is better to write your article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The customer also voiced the requirement for ease of management.  So that in which case the employees of the customer could correct the configs on a piece of paper for specific needs. <br>  Well, I needed full monitoring of the traffic passing between the networks and access through authorization in AD (the customer has Kerio Winroute Firewall on the main gateway) <br>  So, summing up the requirements, got the following: <br>  - Minimum equipment cost <br>  - Ease of management <br>  - Deployment speed <br>  - Access control <br>  Details of the solution - under the cut <br>  The task of easy management, naturally, was reduced to the choice of a distribution kit with a user-friendly web interface.  The choice fell on pfSense: <br><br>  1. Minimum requirements for hardware - works on PII / 128RAM; <br>  2. Stable, bug-free web-face - even an enikeyschik, superficially familiar with network technologies, will figure it out; <br>  3. Installation in 10 minutes - saving all settings in one XML file; <br>  4. In addition, as a bonus, a large amount of software, which is also controlled from the web interface and the whole set of software for FreeBSD, if something specific is needed.

      What we actually did in steps: <br>  1. Delivered to a virtual machine (on XEN) net FreeBSD 8.2, which was given one core and 256 memory <br>  2. OpenVPN is installed (just #pkg_add -r openvpn20) <br>  3. Compiled OpenVPN config with the following content: <br><br>  port 1194 # which port to knock clients <br>  proto udp our choice of UDP <br>  dev tap # was chosen for addressing reasons - I didn't want to see a bunch of tunnels <br><br>  #keys <br>  ca /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt <br>  cert /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/server.crt <br>  key /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/server.key <br>  dh /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/dh1024.pem <br><br>  # server`s IP <br>  server 10.17.0.0 255.255.0.0 # actually, server IP <br>  push "route 10.17.0.0 255.255.0.0" # route clients for our VPN <br>  push "route-gateway 10.17.0.1" For some reason it did not work without it, although it should <br>  client-config-dir ccd # directory in which client configs are located <br>  client-to-client # allow clients to see each other <br>  route 10.17.0.0 255.255.0.0 # route for our VPN <br>  #authentification <br>  tls-server # force TLS <br>  tls-auth keys / ta.key 0 <br>  tls-timeout 120 <br>  auth MD5 # force MD5 <br>  cipher BF-CBC # force to encrypt <br>  keepalive 10 120 <br>  comp-lzo # compress traffic <br>  max-clients 4000 # taken from the ceiling <br>  user nobody # for paranoia and system philosophy <br>  group nobody <br>  persist-key <br><br>  #logging <br>  status /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log <br>  log /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log <br>  verb 3 <br><br>  I do not think it is necessary to paint the configuration completely - there are enough specific articles. <br><br>  4. Actually, I added all this to autoload: <br><br>  server # more /etc/rc.conf <br><br>  defaultrouter = "192.168.0.247" <br>  gateway_enable = "YES" <br>  hostname = "server.nerv.local" <br>  ifconfig_re0 = "inet 192.168.0.244 netmask 255.255.255.0" <br>  keymap = "ru.koi8-r" <br>  sshd_enable = "YES" <br>  openvpn_enable = "YES" <br>  openvpn_if = "tap" <br>  openvpn_configfile = "/ usr / local / etc / openvpn / server" <br>  openvpn_dir = "/ usr / local / etc / openvpn" <br>  startroute_enable = "YES" <br><br>  IP distribution to clients is carried out from the ccd directory files - this is clear from the config on this, the entire server setup is complete - again I will not describe the generation of keys - this is all very correctly and detailed, for example, here: <a href="http://www.lissyara.su/articles/freebsd/security/openvpn/">www.lissyara.su/articles/freebsd/ security / openvpn</a> <br><br>  Only one line is written in the client file in the ccd directory: <br>  ifconfig-push 10.17.0.131 255.255.0.0 # give the client a specific address with a mask <br>  All operations to raise the combat server on the customer's hardware were completed in 20 minutes, not counting the creation of keys. <br><br>  It took some shamanism to set up clients - but they did not have to force enikeyschikov to touch the console.  In the article I just give instructions for action, which was issued to the customer: <br><br>  ========== OpenVPN client configuration on pfSense ====== <br>  1. System&gt; Cert Manager&gt; CA tab <br>  add new CA <br>  1. In the Descriptive name field enter an arbitrary identifier; <br>  2. in the Method list, select "Import an existing Certificate Autority" <br>  3. in the field Certificate data enter the contents of the ca.crt certificate <br>  save <br>  2. System&gt; Cert Manager&gt; Certificates tab <br>  add a new client certificate <br>  1. In the Method list, select ‚ÄúImport an existing Certificate‚Äù <br>  2. in the field Descriptive name enter an arbitrary identifier; <br>  3. in the field Certificate data enter the contents of the certificate name_client.crt <br>  4. in the field Private key data enter the contents of the file name_client.key <br>  save <br>  3. VPN menu&gt; OpenVPN&gt; Client tab <br>  add new connection <br>  1. In the list of Server Mode, select Peer to Peer (SSL / TLS) <br>  2. UDP protocol <br>  3. Device mode - TAP <br>  4. Interface - WAN <br>  5. local port - left blank <br>  6. server host or address enter the ip-address of the server <br>  7. server port 1194 <br>  8. proxy do not fill <br>  9. In the TLS Authentication section, uncheck the box (Automatically generate a shared TLS authentication key) <br>  10.In the field that opens, enter the contents of ta.key <br>  11.Peer Certificate Authority choose what you entered in section 1.1 <br>  12. In the Client Certificate list, select the one that you entered in section 2.2 <br>  13. In the Encryption algorithm list, select BF-CBC (128 bit) <br>  14. In the Compression field, put a tick (Compress tunnel packets using the LZO algorithm) <br>  15 in the Advanced field enter <br>  auth MD5 <br>  ns-cert-type server <br>  persist-key <br>  verb 3 <br>  save  If everything is done correctly, then in 15-45 seconds the connection will become active. <br>  4. Select the menu item Interfaces -&gt; (assign) <br>  1. Add a new interface with the "+" button <br>  2. Select the ovpnc1 interface in the drop-down list, press the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button <br>  3. Select the menu item Interfaces -&gt; OPT1, tick the ‚ÄúEnable interface‚Äù checkbox, click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù, click the ‚Äúapply change‚Äù button <br>  4. In the Description line, enter the VPN, select ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù in the Type list, enter the VPN client address in the ‚ÄúStatic IP configuration‚Äù field that appears and select the mask 16 (do not enter the gateway !!!) <br>  5. If there are checkmarks in the Private networks section - remove them and click the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button <br>  5. Select the menu item Firewall -&gt; NAT <br>  1. select the Outbound tab <br>  2. Put the mode switch to manual mode (right position) and press save <br>  3. In the NAT list, add a new option by pressing the "+" button <br>  4. In the Interface field, select OpenVPN (not VPN !!!) <br>  5. in the Source field enter the address of the local network (this is usually 192.168.x.0 / 24) and select the mask <br>  6. In the Destination field enter the network 10.17.0.0 and mask 16 <br>  7. In the Translation field, tick the Static port <br>  8. Press the SAVE button. <br>  ====================================== <br><br>  Naturally, pfSense should be configured as the main gateway on the client‚Äôs client side. <br><br>  And finally, the last step is setting up access from the customer's network to the customer's network: an OpenVPN client was raised on the customer's gateway (using the OpenVPN-GUI) and static routes to the networks were registered through the IP addresses of the network 10.17.0.0/16 <br><br>  That's all that was needed.  The only requirement for the simplicity of setting up this scheme is that the networks of all clients must be different.  For the customer, this condition turned out to be simple - where the networks coincided, everything was reconfigured without problems and completely remotely via the same VPN network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129510/</a></p>
