There are exceptions for the language exam, when a person has already studied in an American university or school, but for such people this branch is not even needed.

      So, I recommend to take these exams in turn: IELTS / TOEFL ==&gt; GRE / GMAT.  Because the second exam is more difficult, and successful passing the second exam requires at least upper-intermediate. <br><br>  What all the same to pass IELTS or TOEFL?  To begin with, let's designate that <b>99% of American universities accept IELTS</b> .  And the minimum threshold is on average 6.5 points in general, and at least 6.0 in each section.  Ivy League accepts a 7.0 overall and higher, while for medium and 5.5 it is enough, although such universities will not provide you with full funding.  But they will be pleased with a reasonable price and discounts on training.  Personally, I myself passed IELTS and it was necessary to type 6.5 overall.  Remember in the previous post I once said that all the cards made it so that I entered exactly Baylor?  So, this is the only university that has not set a minimum threshold for sections (in all other universities in each section it is allowed at 0.5 less than the overall).  And I filled up one section = (I remember when I saw the results I didn‚Äôt know whether to rejoice or not, because in spite of a sufficient total score, I didn‚Äôt know if they would accept the littered section. After specifying the satisfactory nature of my result to university representatives, I happily started preparing for I signed up for the next date (in two weeks) and began training. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Honestly, I don't know much about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Management_Admission_Test">GMAT</a> (Graduate Management Admission Test) - it‚Äôs mostly for an MBA.  Therefore, I will leave this topic (Google help).  But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations">GRE</a> (Graduate Record Examination) is required for all technical specialties.  GRE in turn happens <b>Subject</b> and <b>General</b> . <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt give up Subject Test: I didn‚Äôt even meet the program where it was required for the master.  This test tests knowledge in a specific area.  Perhaps needed for PhD or other specific programs. <br><br>  Better talk about General.  This is an online test for assessing the readiness to study for a master's degree, namely, mathematical and analytical skills are being tested.  This is what most programs require.  And it consists of three parts: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, Analytical Writing. <br><br>  <b>Verbal Reasoning</b> .  In short, consists of reading and vocabulary.  Reading is much more difficult than in IELTS, you need to get into the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa writer and understand his feelings and motives =) Vocabulary is just awful!  It seems to be a simple task - to insert the right words into the missing places.  However, I did not know almost any words suggested in the answer variants (o_O) This is explained by the fact that even a native speaker will not cope with the vocabulary of the test, because these words are not used in everyday life.  Even Americans learn these words using cards.  But do not worry, the commission does not look at verbal reasoning if you are submitting for example Computer Science like me.  Of course, they understand that this is not an indicator for us as foreign students, especially techies.  I filled up this section too, and not a bit disappointed: D I forgot to say that besides Analytical Writing, in 2 sections you will know the results immediately after testing is completed. <br><br>  <b>Quantitative Reasoning.</b>  This part is the most common mathematics with unusual problem statements and answer choices.  Therefore, you need to practice a little, to adapt.  In fact, even school knowledge is enough to successfully pass this section.  You need to get used to the types of tasks and learn the terminology.  At school, I was involved in the Olympiad in mathematics, and in undergraduate sports programming.  Therefore, having spent the day preparing, I scored (I do not remember exactly) somewhere from 165-167 out of 170. In fact, even if you answer all the questions incorrectly, you will get 130 =) In this connection, the <b>percentile</b> is important - how many people , scored less points.  I had 93%.  Some universities set the minimum threshold for GRE.  To simply enter the Ivy League, you need 90% or more, which is about 160 points out of 170. <br><br>  I think this section is the easiest for students in the post-Soviet space: a good school base since Soviet times.  There is even no trigonometry.  However, it seems I was mistaken in one economic task.  A cash flow schedule was provided for one firm, and a couple of questions needed to be answered. <br><br>  <b>Analytical Writing.</b>  As well as in IELTS, consists of two essays.  However, everything is much more complicated = ( <br><br>  The first part of the text is given.  For example, a small article from a scientific journal.  It is necessary to analyze the text and criticize the work of the author.  Indicate where the assumptions were true / wrong, what statements can be disputed and so on.  It is recommended to write an essay of <b>500-800 words in 30 minutes !!!</b>  Well at least the whole thing is typed on the keyboard. <br><br>  The second part, as in IELTS, is a discussion on a given topic.  True topics are more serious, requiring understanding or having working experience.  I already forgot my theme =) I remember that it was connected with top-level management. <br><br>  Strangely enough, I also filled up this part - 3.0 from 6.0: D But again, as I understood, the selection committee did not consider this section.  Just as in IELTS, before passing the GRE, you can specify up to 4-5 universities, to which the results should be sent - the results will be released within 10-15 calendar days.  In more detail about GRE it is necessary to study all the same.  This is a separate topic, about which you can talk and talk. <br><br>  In general, the picture of the necessary examinations is as follows.  I advise you to pass them, and have results on hand in November.  After all, it is because of them that I went only to one university, in which I managed. <br><br>  Ps GRE costs 200 green, so get ready yourself.  Why extra costs ^ _ ^ <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304254/</a></p>
