  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Servers of large registrar NIC.UA are withdrawn</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now representatives of the Security Service of Ukraine conduct a search and seizure of the servers of the large domain registrar NIC.UA from the data center.  About this, representatives of the company reported on Twitter: ‚ÄúNow government agencies are withdrawing our hosting servers from the data center, because of this, many have problems with hosting.  We will keep you informed. "  Later, the company promised that there should be no problems with client sites: ‚ÄúDomains are working and will work properly‚Äù.  Sites that used hosting are no longer available. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c3/ad5/1f0/2c3ad51f024098a1a59ffa8de760b461.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As the director of the company Andrei Khvetkevich said, the main equipment was located in the Datagroup data center.  The withdrawal is carried out by court order, however, neither the management of the data centers nor the company‚Äôs representatives showed it.  ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what is going on.  Informally, I heard that this is due to the fact that we had registered domains of some separatist sites.  Given that we usually always regularly block such resources according to the law, recently, for example, Gubarev.info blocked it, ‚ÄùHvetkevich noted.  According to him, it will be possible to find out more information when Datagroup will provide the equipment withdrawal act. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn short, the equipment was taken out of action.  In specialized mailings, these sites have been discussed since summer, ‚Äùnoted Maxim Tuliev, the head of‚Äú NetAssist ‚Äù, where, among other things, the company's equipment was seized.

Several tens of thousands of company clients suffered from such actions by law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  About the fact that law enforcement agencies are withdrawing servers, the company‚Äôs director Andrei Khvetkevich learned from a phone call from employees of one of the data centers at about 10 am <br><br>  Only by 14:00 was it possible to find out the official reason and get a copy of the court ruling.  It dealt with the fact that there are 5 separatist sites on the company's facilities, which should be turned off.  Physically sites are not located on the company's facilities - they are hosted elsewhere.  Only the domains of four of the five indicated sites are registered on NIC.UA. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn order to block a site that violates the legislation of Ukraine, a formal request from the relevant authorities is enough.  We regularly receive requests from the Security Service of Ukraine on such sites and block them.  Why this time the SBU decided not to send a request to us, but to withdraw the company's servers - I do not understand.  Sites of tens of thousands of our clients stopped working from these illegal actions, and the sites indicated in the court ruling continue to work, because in fact the sites themselves are not with us, only the domains, ‚Äùsays Andrei Khvetkevich. <br><br>  Representatives of the company received the list of the seized equipment only by 3 p.m.  The withdrawal protocol at the time of writing this press release has not yet been received. <br><br>  The court order was unreasonable, but gave the law enforcement agencies formal authority to seize the equipment. <br><br>  In our opinion, the judge simply did not delve into the requirements of the investigator of the SBU and did not fully study the case materials, as a result of which such an unreasonable decision was made.  The court rulings expressly state that separatist websites are served outside Ukraine, therefore, it does not make sense to withdraw equipment in Ukraine. <br><br>  Now lawyers of the company are trying to return the equipment in order to restore the work of clients' sites.  There is no information as to when the trial will take place, but we expected this to happen today, April 8th. <br><br>  We do not support separatist sites and always cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the framework of a well-developed and coordinated interaction algorithm. <br><br>  In August 2014, despite the absence of a court decision, we blocked the domain gubarev.org based on a reasoned request from the SBU.  We have made changes to our Public Offer and written agreements in order to provide a more effective response mechanism. <br><br>  Below we present the chronology of requests and responses of the Security Service of Ukraine, indicating that our company cooperated with law enforcement agencies promptly and within the framework of the Law. <br><br>  By domain odnarodyna.com.ua: <br><br>  1. 03/29/14 there was a request from the State Security Service of Ukraine "for information‚Äù: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4d/13f/d43/e4d13fd433f6b041d5ecceda9fa9d71c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Answer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/108/af3/0af/108af30af71ca39d236ea6d96c61bfc7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  01/20/15 was a customer request.  We wrote to the client that we would block the domain, we blocked it on 01/21/15.  Then they informed the person who applied about the work done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/2ae/d09/95d2aed09daadd1992ddb9f43c369b6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By domain slv.org.ua: <br><br>  10/17/14 There was a request from the Security Service of Ukraine (Department of Counter-Insection for Institutions in the Sphere of Information Security), received only a scan.  Block did not ask for a domain, just provide information.  Request: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2e/ba9/59d/e2eba959d6e8437f5d9d0a99505a83e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The corresponding answer was prepared by: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39e/0f5/ccc/39e0f5ccc8fc6030fdd17a906db847b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/165/635/15416563540698d37806e7224fb67dc9.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  Update 8 <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Information from Facebook by Andrey Khvetkevich</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> We found and studied all the requests / responses of the SBU. <br>  All requests that were to us with the request of blocking sites came from the Counterintelligence Department of the Security Service of the SBU.  These requests were sent ONLY in the form of a scanned copy to e-mail.  We still have not received the original requests. <br><br>  Other departments sent originals.  In particular, from the offices in Kharkov and Dnepropetrovka, we regularly received the originals and quickly responded to them.  The Dnipropetrovsk Department also provided an appropriately executed document for disabling the website gubarev.org and we immediately disconnected it. <br><br>  It was the Counterintelligence Department of the Security Service of Ukraine that never sent the originals.  All requests of this department begin with the heading ‚ÄúShchedo nadforya informatsii‚Äù.  All requests without a criminal proceedings number, without any information, on the basis of which we could, by law, block sites. <br><br>  At the same time, we were ready to block these sites and waited for the original request.  Prior to receiving the original request, we did not have the legal right to block resources.  Also, SBU officials repeatedly asked not to take any action until a court decision, in order not to destroy evidence for the investigation. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255185/</a></p>
