The package includes about 70,000 old spill names (without adult subjects and without new zones) with class 373.com pearls, faculty.com, carauctions.com, ibill.com, bikerentals.com, kitchenchef.com, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/baf/605/efd/baf605efd287fec0425fe044b646e6a4.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Both parties have agreed not to disclose the terms of the contract.  Perhaps in the future, someone with a falcon eye will be able to calculate the amount on the check from the financial reports.  But to whom it is interesting today, a cat has been presented with a guide on the valuation of such virtual assets with possible arguments that can be used during tenders.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Some basic data: <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://dnpric.es/stats/stats-by-broker/">brokerage league</a> , in the past, MostWantedDomains publicly reported about 236 sales totaling $ 5.6 million. This is about $ 24 thousand dollars for a sold domain. <br><br>  Given that the other two top players had already been acquired by GoDaddy before (AfterNIC and TDNAM), the seller was the 11th global domain dealer. <br><br>  In finance, there is no single method for calculating the value of real estate.  Sale, as a rule, will take place when either the seller is more desirable to quickly sell and throw off the price a little lower than the market price, or the seller has the opportunity to pay a premium premium.  In practice, use a variety of practices for evaluating and conducting trading, which are listed below. <br><br>  <b>1. Multiplier for past transactions</b> <br><br>  This year, GoDaddy has already acquired a similar portfolio of Marchex.  Then 200 thousand domain names sold for about $ 140.50 per share.  With such indicators 70 rear.  MostWantedDomains names were valued at $ 9.8 million. The seller most likely did not agree to this amount, since having sold only 0.05% of all assets, they realized the same figure. <br><br>  Perhaps the parties agreed on a different factor, which satisfied both the seller and the buyer. <br><br>  <b>2. Multiply past sales</b> <br><br>  Here the seller could suggest using the average price of historical sales.  In the case of this portfolio, it is $ 24 thousand. Managers of large domain arrays say that with such prices, 5% to 20% of domains will be really ‚Äúselling‚Äù.  Assuming that the parties have agreed on a 10% level of "corruption" at an average selling price of $ 12,000 each, the total estimate will be about $ 84 million, that is, about $ 1,200.00 per name when compared with method 1. <br><br>  One can speculate on how negotiations developed further.  Most likely, GoDaddy began to give other arguments to drop the price, and the seller laid out several hundred top-quality domains with a six- and seven-digit dollar valuation. <br><br>  In any case, the amount hardly exceeded the $ 80 million bar. <br><br>  <b>3. Discounted cash flow</b> <br><br>  We do not know what part of the past sales of MostWantedDomains was not disclosed by the company.  From experience, they say, it is at least 50%.  Let's offer that half, including other income from leasing, parking, and other operations. <br><br>  In this case, the company's revenues looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebe/6f7/1f5/ebe6f71f51ec4666ab48b2cf14f6f3a8.png"><br><br>  * - assuming that neatly.com sold for $ 100 thousand;  MostWantedDomains revealed only that it was a six-digit deal in 2015 <br><br>  It looks like in the past, the portfolio brought ¬± $ 1.5 million in cash annually.  Discounting at a rate of 10%, we get $ 15 million. <br><br>  GoDaddy could not agree with the multiplier (rate) and tried to reduce it from x10 to x5 (or 20% annually). <br><br>  The seller would definitely remember the terminal value of the portfolio, adding from $ 10 million to $ 20 million to the already discounted $ 5 million. <br><br>  As we see, based on the cash flow, the portfolio can be valued at around $ 5 million ... $ 20 million. <br><br>  A very delicate issue of terminal value is at hand to the seller.  Selling 50 domains per year, 70,000 names will be enough for a millennium.  No company in the world looks so far beyond the horizon.  And judging by the trends, average prices are constantly increasing, thereby increasing the future value of assets. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  With 95% confidence, it can be said that the transaction ranged from $ 10 million to $ 40 million. Given that the seller was very inclined to sell and that GoDaddy‚Äôs shares rose immediately after the purchase, the real price fell in the lower range, between $ 15 million and $ 30 million <br><br>  It turns out that GoDaddy wrote a check for about $ 22.5 million ¬± $ 7.5 million. <br><br>  I wonder if anyone has any other thoughts on this topic? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/272887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/272887/</a></p>
