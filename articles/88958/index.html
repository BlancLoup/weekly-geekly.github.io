  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New interfaces</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Analogs and prototypes of the proposed platform does not exist today.  That is why it is possible to operate only with approximate implementation terms - according to my calculations, it will take more than a year to develop - this, of course, is not only a ‚Äúsite‚Äù, but also adapted applications for computers and mobiles (like Picasa or Last.fm).  Test runs of the system can take place earlier.  Depending on the stage of ‚Äúbringing to mind‚Äù of the platform, as well as the level of execution, only about 150-250 thousand dollars will be spent on its creation.  The cost of monthly operation depends on the geography of work.  The principle of further expansion - the network.  When starting, for example, with centers in only two capitals (Moscow, Kiev) - each month it will be necessary to give another 15-20 thousand more, with a constant decrease in investments.  Payback - about a year and a half after launch.  The number of visits at the start - from 2-3 thousand per day.  Further growth is a comprehensive in the scale of the Internet audience in the region, where the network link of the common platform is located.  Type of activity - the media.  Economic calculation largely depends on the volume of investments.  The method of profit is the sale of banner advertising and placement of contextual advertising information. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most valuable and laborious is the creation of a platform.  A good example for an analogy: it is known that George Lucas first shot three final Star Wars series, and then waited twenty years until the special effects technology reached the level he needed to remove the three initial parts. <br><br>  In a broad sense, the technology of creating information sites for a long time were at a rudimentary level.  And it is still believed that the simpler the site, the more pleasant and comfortable it is to use.  The main focus is on compatibility in different browsers and minimal use of special effects.

      Frankly, for a long time this was the reason.  Indeed: it‚Äôs very cool when the news site loads in seconds, is easy to administer, and the site‚Äôs logic is extremely simple and predictable, and the text, pictures, and videos are presented in an aesthetic and attractive way. <br><br>  For some time it was interesting to develop just such projects.  To achieve a good balance between beauty and ease, to hone the style, combine texts, links, images for the best perception.  Some have worked out quite well: <br><br>  <a href="http://atv.odessa.ua/">http://atv.odessa.ua/</a> (created from scratch - from the idea to the final result. The regional TV site was quickly placed in the top in the region and quite successfully competes in traffic with the sites of the central republican TV channels, ahead of many) <br><br>  and <a href="http://revisor.od.ua/">http://revisor.od.ua/</a> (purchased from good friends in finished form and also displayed in the top in your region). <br><br>  For some time it seemed that the principles on which these projects were built were the ideal.  This, for example, the absence of completely inconvenient galleries with pictures.  It is much more convenient to watch the whole picture, right?  Here, for comparison: <br><br>  <a href="http://gallery.korrespondent.net/showbiz/2137">http://gallery.korrespondent.net/showbiz ...</a> (gallery on Ajax with meaningless numbering of photos, which, moreover, is incorrect in counting - at the beginning of the review it seems that 9 pictures will be shown, in the end it turns out that 164 photos are hidden there with the appropriate signature. Try to scroll through at least 20 pieces - you will understand what caused the displeasure. In addition, the curve Ajax is a bit - the numbers and navigation disappear during pereschelkivaniya). <br><br>  Or here, there are also a lot of pictures (it isn‚Äôt exactly how many, and is it necessary to indicate?) <br><br>  <a href="http://revisor.od.ua/news/Sady_porageniya_Niklaya_Serdyuka-003348/kpaba/">http://revisor.od.ua/news/Sady_porageniy ...</a> (Very different impression from a large number of photos, right?) <br><br>  The same pleasant feeling remains from watching a video on the ATV website.  This, by the way, is not just a video portal.  The uniqueness of the site of this channel is that almost all the produced content is laid out there, which is not done by any of the other Ukrainian TV channels.  Basically, they post only news.  At best, along with the video.  Otherwise, they start streaming, from which the fan in my laptop spins up and makes a noise like a Land Cruiser motor.  And on ‚ÄúATV‚Äù everything is beautiful - 100% of the TV programs produced are on the site.  In addition, it is not just a video or text.  This is exactly the video with the text.  That is, if I do not want to download a lot of videos - just read the program text or news: <br><br>  How here - <a href="http://atv.odessa.ua/programs/5/chto_sleduet_sdelat_s_duardom_gurvitsem_5054.html">http://atv.odessa.ua/programs/5/chto_sle ...</a> <br><br>  Conveniently! <br><br>  In addition, flash video technology is far from perfect.  For example, my iPhone will not be able to show the video.  Especially for such cases, instead of the player, the player is turned off and the inclusion of the Zhpegovskaya picture is turned on - that is, even on mobile devices the site will look completely working and beautiful, its structure is not broken.  It would seem a simple nuance, but not all take it into account. <br><br>  But in the top we are not only because of attention to detail.  For example, decryption of live broadcasts is a very laborious matter.  But we get great content indexing that you cannot provide with any super-tags. <br><br>  For these and many other reasons, the site of the regional TV channel ATV (broadcasting in Odessa alone) is ahead of many sites of TV channels that spread their signal throughout the country!  The task that was correctly implemented was set correctly. <br><br>  But life does not stand still.  And the Internet - all the more.  Therefore, there comes a time when in the news segment ‚Äúsimply and easily‚Äù will soon become uninteresting.  People get tired of templates, no matter how good they are.  It would seem that the site which thoroughly meets the needs of the user - the day after tomorrow runs the risk of becoming hopelessly outdated.  The reason is technology update. <br><br>  It is known for example that the new era of the Internet is connected with the html5 standard.  Among the main advantages are the incomparable freedom in managing the elements, a completely new level of performance of the supporting structures of the site, fundamentally new solutions in the design plan.  Now very little is known about this standard, but its prospects are very impressive. <br><br>  A few examples: instead of cumbersome and slow flash-video, Youtube started experimenting with the introduction of html5 (you can enable the new format here - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">http://www.youtube.com/html5</a> ).  I will say right away: the sensations are completely different.  The fact is that in my laptop they are felt physically purely - by fan promotion, which always means an increase in processor load.  So, when watching a video in html5 standard, the load on the processor is simply incomparable.  Breathe significantly, at times easier! <br><br>  Or, for example, a page made in html5 - previously this was unattainable without a flash: <br><br>  <a href="http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/canvas/">http://9elements.com/io/projects/html5/c ...</a> (a beautiful demonstration that very clearly depicts what a standard Internet site will be capable of in the coming years. One can imagine that every star in this planetarium is an independent a link, a fragment of video content, a picture, or another functional element. The main thing is that all this was done without a flash ‚Äî namely, flash over the years of the Internet‚Äôs development has been taboo for news resources because of its complexity, inflexibility and, paradoxically, static ‚Äî as in administration form, t  ak and in the form of indexing by search engines). <br><br>  It should be noted that now html5 only works in browsers that meet the requirements of modernity - for example, in new versions of Safari and Chrome.  However, given the promise of the project, compatibility support will soon become the standard for all browsers. <br><br>  What gives us html5?  A completely new, incredible level of freedom in site building - the implementation of many creative ideas.  Previously, a very narrow framework set the technical possibility of standardization.  Now the scope for creativity is disproportionately higher. <br><br>  But this is only the technological part.  Lyric preamble. <br><br>  The main part of the plan is in the innovative approach to information. <br><br>  The fact is that for the overwhelming majority of journalists, information is a sponge.  Got water - pressed.  Scored new - squeezed.  At the expense of these simple progressive movements breathing of news resources is provided.  But the trouble is that information flows are, in essence, Russian salad.  Selections of disparate facts that will never be brought together.  No internet journalist or editor has ever thought of putting together information about an earthquake in Chile and a sharp reduction in Chilean wine exports, until an important representative in the trade department declares this.  This, alas, is the truth of life and the truth of the working conditions of those who bring us news.  The fact is that in the present conditions, the goal of online journalism is not to clarify the essence and background of events.  The main task of the editor today is to ensure instantaneousness.  And that's what happens: dozens of top-sites of the country compete, like sprinters on a treadmill.  And the bill goes on for seconds - who previously will give unverified and unspecified information.  And it is especially funny how serious eminent news agencies are bypassed by ‚Äúon the turn‚Äù bloggers with cameras who were on the scene and did not hesitate to publish a more interesting, informative, picturesque event report than a whole agency with a huge budget and a bunch of formal restrictions. <br><br>  It has become fashionable to scold television a lot and often: they say, you watch television news, and you do not understand the true essence of events, the meaning of things that are happening.  I assure you, it will take several years - and the same stamp will fall on online journalism.  In fact, the main flaws of traditional mass media simply migrated to new media.  This is, first of all, a superficial look at information, consumer attitude towards it.  The symbol of such journalism is an ordinary parrot.  I heard - and conveyed with a distorted accent.  The parrot never thinks that it will say about the authenticity and interestingness of its message to the world, morphed into the popular idiom ‚ÄúAss-fool‚Äù.  He just talks when he is in the mood.  Parrot alien analysis, a serious approach to the topic, readiness to return to the published statement in order to show its value to the audience. <br><br>  For example, the Correspondent news site leading in the Ukrainian segment reports: ‚ÄúThe picture of Caravaggio stolen from the Odessa Museum was discovered at a Moscow auction‚Äù ( <a href="http://korrespondent.net/showbiz/1056973">http://korrespondent.net/showbiz/1056973 ...</a> We read. It turns out that the director of the robbed museum said literally: ‚Äú I do not have an answer to the question: what are they selling - our picture or a copy, or something else, but there is such information. "But we can‚Äôt stop our parrot. He heard from another parrot that it was the stolen masterpiece that surfaced in Moscow, nothing else. The parrot needs a beautiful, sonorous headline,  Nacha he will never fly to the top on his little wings. And this handsome man begins to caw, not paying attention to what is full of nonsense. Do you think the editors of the Korrespondent site contacted the museum itself to get a sensation? But why It‚Äôs necessary to spend as much as five minutes on a telephone conversation, to call from Odessa to Odessa! Why do so, when there are parrots in Odessa that will bring a sensation in their beak - they are also always ready to play this once and for all ‚Äúspoiled phone‚Äù ".  You go to the local site - and please take any ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù without asking, without noise and dust.  Several editorial changes - and the top ‚Äì news is ready.  A couple of thousand visits from news aggregators are already in your pocket.  Please note - in the news about the stolen canvas says that the picture surfaced on the Internet auction.  However, none of the hundreds of sources that relay a message has that link to the lot!  I am sure that none of the editors have even tried to find this picture on auction sites!  But it would be very easy to clarify the question - contact the director by phone and clarify the reference.  And at the same time to see what he says.  Maybe this lot does not exist and never existed. <br><br>  In general, it is not considered bad now to cook raw news.  This is how the information market works, it works according to the laws in which it feels comfortable.  If you go against the stream in this respect, you will pass as an eccentric and crazy nonconformist.  Why waste resources on phone calls, on clarifications, on investigations?  If you can plant a few robots that copy the news from other robots? <br><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs good to make news - this is not an innovation at all.  And there are still people who know how to work with the material.  Yes, this is not the case, not at all in professionalism. <br><br>  Know-how in another: if you see the imperfection of the market, change the market itself.  Change the principles of the functioning of your resource and the approach to collecting information. <br><br>  Actually, my development (we turn to the most important thing) consists in the technological, at the level of the most news platform, the ability to give an expandable wave of information.  Moreover, the merging of related categories and related topics will not take place as they are now with tags (when news about the Dow Jones index and about a small market in the vicinity of Kologriv fall into the same slot).  This is exclusively manual labor, with a clearly visualized binding to the matter of time. <br><br>  I will explain with a very accessible example.  In a post about searching for startups, you were advised to go to a certain event, and they brought the link - <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/blog/public/14776.html">http://startuppoint.ru/blog/public/14776 ...</a> <br><br>  This link is the actual announcement of the event and an invitation.  The event itself ended last week.  But the most recent comment to this news - ‚ÄúWho was?  Unsubscribe chtoli!  Interesting.  Could not get in: (‚Äù <br><br>  But pay attention - no one unsubscribed at this url-address, no one wanted to fool in order to bring the news to the degree of completion.  And this announcement hung on the Internet ... How the event ended - no one knows. <br><br>  Know-how lies in the fact that in the case of the implementation of the platform for this link, you are guaranteed to discover not only the announcement, but also the full report - with photos, describing how everything went.  No need to crawl on your knees on the Internet in search of information of interest because of the fact that someone was too lazy to bring their work to the end.  You are guaranteed to give results. <br><br>  Here's another example: ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya Pravda‚Äù happily reports - ‚ÄúNobody canceled the end of the world in 2012‚Äù - <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/24454.4/616928/">http://www.kp.ru/daily/24454.4/616928/</a> The article gives a number of predictions: that in 2012 the inversion of the poles of the Earth will occur, that a powerful flash will occur on the Sun and it is stated that anomalies are growing in the geomagnetic field of our planet.  Are you wondering if the predictions will come true?  Of course it's interesting.  But you intend to check it with your own experience and hope to find out from the news whether the apocalypse will happen or not.  However, by 2013 you, having sighed with relief, hardly remember the details.  Will the threat of pole reversal persist?  What is solar activity?  How will the geomagnetic field behave?  These questions will be forgotten and fade into the background.  The point of the innovation news platform is to combine the newly received information into one slot, connected by a logical chain ‚Äúforecast-result‚Äù.  Having visited the same url-address in 2013, you are guaranteed to receive expert comments on the questions asked a few years ago.  Perhaps you will hear the opinions of the same specialists who predicted the apocalypse - how will they get out, I wonder?  And if they disappear or refuse to speak, or turn into arthropods ciliates, leave for Australia, fly to the moon or, like Penza sectarians, dig up a dugout and wait for the end of the world - it will be even more interesting! <br><br>  Here, by the way, a selection of "Tapes.ru" about Penza sectarians is a prototype, the simplest sketch of how to treat news and combine information - <a href="http://www.lenta.ru/story/penza/">http://www.lenta.ru/story/penza/</a> - the new platform will combine completely different the way information: clearer and clearer - in the infographic timeline. <br><br>  Combining in its kaleidoscope a multitude of live, relevant information flows into a single space-time continuum, the new platform will make time travel an applied tool of modern man. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88958/</a></p>
