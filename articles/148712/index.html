And today we are pleased to name the six finalists of the Devcup of this year. <br><br>  The goal of Devcup is to find applications that will appeal to users, open for them new ways to use Evernote, will be perfectly implemented and easy to use.  Three weeks ago we finished accepting applications from the participants of Devcup, and our jury took up a difficult job: it was necessary to review hundreds of applications and select five star finalists.  Given the abundance of applications sent to us from very high-quality programs and services, the task turned out to be difficult.  The long evenings spent in the office, liters of coffee and heated debate eventually led the jury to an agreed opinion, and they presented five final appendices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Finalists </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e7/879/9d9/0e78799d9b78c87250193f46e78a8d80.png">

      <b>EV</b> (Brazil) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8624-ev">watch the video</a> <br><br>  Many of you use Evernote on smartphones and have access to your notes anywhere.  However, more than 4 billion people in the world still use regular phones, but they also do not neglect the fruits of technological progress, checking email and sending entries to Twitter and Facebook via SMS.  Thanks to EV, the ability to use Evernote from a mobile phone will appear with them.  EV - at first glance, a simple SMS client for Evernote, allowing you to link your mobile phone with an Evernote account.  Now you can create new notes, search for existing ones and set reminders via SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/924/b55/726/924b557265ac3370a6397257b4a57e76.png"><br><br>  <b>EverClip</b> (Hong Kong) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8289-everclip">watch video</a> <br><br>  Web pages fragments copied from the world wide web are the most popular type of notes in Evernote.  Millions of people use our web clippers daily for Chrome, IE, Firefox and Safari to save articles found on the Internet and any other information.  At the same time, the majority of mobile users until today did not have the opportunity to copy web pages.  EverClip is an iPhone application that has access to the clipboard and allows you to send everything you copy in the browser directly to your Evernote account.  You can copy any selected information to the iPhone, including images, no matter what application you have open. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e7/a39/8f4/2e7a398f4d99ef94053232a1b2e8457e.png"><br><br>  <b>KustomNote</b> (USA) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8372-kustomnote">watch the video</a> <br><br>  The lack of a clear storage structure in Evernote is one of those features that turn a service into a powerful and convenient tool.  We do not tell you how to use and organize information in Evernote, offering to arrange your digital memory in accordance with your preferences.  But sometimes it becomes necessary to perform a series of similar tasks or to place information in a new note in a special way.  KustomNote is a web service created for just such cases.  With it, you can use typical note templates or come up with your own, and then create structured notes in Evernote using a simple input form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36b/f7a/b09/36bf7ab09651feb2bc926d8fa24582e7.png"><br><br>  <b>LiveMinutes</b> (USA) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8662-liveminutes-remember-every-meeting">watch video</a> <br><br>  Despite the fact that Evernote is your personal and confidential assistant, quite often there is a need to share information in your account with a small group of people, for example, colleagues or relatives.  LiveMinutes is a powerful web-based collaboration service that allows you to share notes during online meetings, edit notes in real time together, and then save everything to Evernote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b23/96c/6ba/b2396c6ba66578877a6f8e28ee6229a6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>PlaceMe</b> (USA) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8693-placeme">Watch Video</a> <br><br>  Starting to use PlaceMe with Evernote, you will never forget about the places you visited.  PlaceMe is an iPhone app that records your travels and saves the total of the day with routes to Evernote.  Information is recorded automatically and completely confidential - the application is created so that you remember where you have been, and will not notify you of your whereabouts.  It doesn't matter if you want to find a restaurant where you had dinner during your last trip to San Francisco, or a hotel where you spent your holiday last year, PlaceMe will give you this information. <br><br>  <b>People's choice</b> <br>  The sixth finalist was determined by a user vote on the <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/">devcup.evernote.com</a> competition <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/">site</a> .  Spotwish Go has become a popular choice! .. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b79/375/f67/b79375f67a2ba68b0efaa35064ccf400.png"><br><br>  <b>Spotwish Go!</b>  (Brazil) - <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8667-spotwish-go">watch the video</a> <br><br>  Spotwish will help you organize a joint holiday with friends, invite them to have lunch or drive a ball.  You can attach photos and comments of your group to a scheduled event, and when it happens, all participants' notes on this event will be added to your Evernote account. <br><br><h3>  Lots of great ideas </h3><br>  During the qualifying round, we have seen many interesting applications that can be combined with common themes.  It should be noted that not all of them will suit all users, but these works illustrate well the options for using Evernote. <br><br>  Below we give examples of such topics and applications. <br><ul><li>  Learn from your notes using <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8675-retrospection-ios-app-for-reviewing-and-remembering-your-notes">Retrospection</a> and <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8244-revunote">RevuNote</a> . </li><li>  Plan and keep travel records with <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8608-tripcolor-social-travel-blogging">TripColor</a> and <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8674-likewhere">LikeWhere</a> . </li><li>  Keep a family diary using <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8579-family-journal">Family Journal</a> and <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8630-art-my-kid-made">Art My Kid Made</a> . </li><li>  Visualize notes in Evernote using <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8695-mohionote">MohioNote</a> and the <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8454-bubble-browser">Bubble Browser</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8601-taccto-interactive-meetings">Meet</a> more effectively with <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8601-taccto-interactive-meetings">Taccto</a> and <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8592-uberconference">√úberConference</a> . </li><li>  Quickly share notes using <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8600-snappi">Snappi</a> and <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8573-flynote">Flynote</a> . </li><li>  Work with Evernote from the command line using <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions/8317-geeknote-a-command-line-client-for-evernote">GeekNote</a> . </li></ul><br>  A full list of applications from Devcup participants is available on <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/submissions">our website</a> . <br><br><h3>  Next Stage: Evernote Trunk Conference </h3><br>  All the finalist teams were invited to our Evernote Trunk Conference (ETC), which will be held on August 24 in San Francisco.  There, participants will be able to personally present their applications and compete for three main prizes: $ 20,000 for the first place, $ 15,000 for the second, and $ 5,000 for the third.  Winners will be determined by ETC guests during the voting. <br><br><h3>  And further... </h3><br>  The presentations of the finalists at ETC have not yet completed the Devcup program this year.  The goal of the competition is to open new applications for users, so we will contact each developer who submitted his application, help develop the application and present their products in <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/trunk/">the Evernote Gallery</a> .  To inspire developers, we will offer special features to promote the best applications.  We will tell more about this on August 24 at ETC. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148712/</a></p>
