  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evening Mechmat MSU</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to share the experience of enrollment and training in the department of the second higher education at the Moscow State University.  He is an engineering stream or an evening department.  At one time, information was very necessary, but there were very few detailed reviews on the internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was in the academic year 2012/2013 - quite a while ago, now the situation could have changed a lot. <br><br>  First, a few words about admission.  Previously, there was an oral interview (until 2012), it was necessary to prove and tell all the school math + a little higher.  Since 2012, they have made a written exam, which, in my opinion, is more transparent and understandable.  Examples of tasks of past years are laid out on the website of the selection committee along with the decisions.  The tasks themselves are fairly simple, but, as usual, with the Mechmatovo horseshoes.  The meaning of the exam is more likely to make people who are preparing to enter think.  It is easy to pass - you need not get 2, i.e.  solve at least one problem.  I would advise you to treat the exam as an opportunity to test your readiness for learning, at the same time to repeat the main sections of school mathematics, logarithms, geometry, algebra.  The more you remember, the easier it will be to learn.  Otherwise, be prepared to completely "fall out" of the process in the first months of study.  Approximately 60-70% of the written exam will say that you are generally ready.  100% speaks of a very good "live" training.  Now, according to the site of the mekhmat, the options for full-time students are already offered at the entrance exam. <br><br>  Education, as can be seen on the <a href="http://master.math.msu.ru/second-degree/">evening Mechmat</a> site, goes 5 days a week from 18:30 to 21:50, full 2 ‚Äã‚Äãsemesters for 4 years.  The training program is close to the full-time program, in terms of coverage by topic, but the pace and depth of presentation differ greatly.  As one of the teachers put it, the ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù pace.  One of my fellow students had the opportunity to compare lectures on matan in the afternoon and evening part, it turned out that on the afternoon one more time was spent on each topic and everything was ‚Äúchewed on‚Äù.  We only covered the main issues on each topic and those quickly.  By the way, all the teachers of the evening department are the same ordinary staff members of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, who teach or teach in the full-time department.

      Sessions are held twice a year, at the end of the semester, like in full-time.  This is inconvenient, because  in the absence of control in the middle of the semester (colloquiums), by the end of the semester a decent amount of material accumulates and it becomes quite problematic to prepare for all topics.  But you can save debts, for failing exams do not deduct. <br><br>  Load, I think, is average.  Attendance at evening tuition, as well as during the daytime, is in many ways the key to success.  In all senses.  Those subjects that I studied, i.e.  I went to classes and did homework, I calmly handed over to the session, for what I scored - it was difficult to pass.  For example, as a programmer, I scored on programming in the first semester.  For the test, I had to write a couple of progs on C, which were checked for authorship and accepted, but did not pass the exam without preparation (there were specific topics - RSA encryption).  In general, everyone perfectly understands the situation of the evening students, and that the time has passed for the former popularity of the engineering stream in Soviet times, when it was in demand among graduates of technical colleges. <br><br>  After the 1st semester there were only those who, for various reasons, could devote evenings to education.  I learned 1 semester, and in another semester I listened, by and large, two courses - mat and discrete mathematics.  I quit precisely because of the lack of opportunity and unwillingness to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for 4 years of evenings of weekdays.  But I got what I wanted - I cooked lightly in the atmosphere of the mekhmat, talked, worked out, increased mathematical literacy, understood a number of things for myself. <br><br>  I have a technical education with secondary technical mathematics.  I was an excellent student in all mathematical subjects, but this did not at all create confidence and understanding of mathematics.  Therefore, I wanted to improve understanding and touch the real, possibly the best mathematical school in the country.  He asked the guys for what reasons they did.  There were such reasons - it is required at work, it is necessary for a career, it is necessary for some projects.  Some, like me, still had a complex of insufficient previous training, given the propensity to math and the desire to do it seriously. <br><br>  What are the advantages for myself: I used to read a book in mathematics was very difficult (except, perhaps, Fichtenholts).  However, after listening to a lecture, the same material in the book is perceived with a bang.  The training system creates in his head a picture of the relationship of disciplines and their main points, which was not in high school. <br><br>  In what minuses: now there is a tendency to more and more abstract presentation of all subjects, especially it concerns algebra.  This is clearly visible in the literature.  It is easy to read Fichtenholz, in his books there is an abundance of text and examples.  With the books of Zorich this will not work anymore, you will have to make your way through complex abstractions and examples for proof, and not the calculation of physical problems.  For practitioners and the uninitiated, this greatly complicates the understanding of basic disciplines.  But this is the trend of all modern mathematics.  For myself, I decided, whenever possible, to be guided by the publications of the 40s and 50s, after which they already move on to modern books. <br><br>  For a snack - books that are quite close to the courses readable and can be useful in the independent work of the lectures of the 1st course: <br><br>  <b>Matan</b> <br>  Zorich, 2-volumes, <br>  Fichtenholz, 3 volumes, <br>  Arkhipov Sadovniy Chubarikov, 1 volume, <br><br>  <b>Algebra</b> <br>  Kurosh, <br>  Winberg, <br>  Kostrikin, Introduction to Algebra <br><br>  <b>Geometry</b> <br>  Alexandrov, <br>  Modena, <br>  Delone <br><br>  <b>Discrete Math</b> <br>  Yablonsky </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344118/</a></p>
