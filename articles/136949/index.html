Someone was hacked in Dendy, someone was lucky to have Sega.  Someone dreamed about consoles, and those with whom they already had, besides playing games for hours, searching for friends and acquaintances of the game, exchanging "cartridges", buying something new.  I still remember trays on the market with a huge number of different cartridges, which then seemed innumerable wealth. <br>  In those 90s, the First Channel (then ORT) was broadcast - ‚ÄúDandy - New Reality‚Äù (although, at first it went on the 2x2 channel), later changing its name to simply ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù.  For us children, this was truly a window into another, new reality.  Sergei Suponev was leading it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/581/6ec/d64/5816ecd64dec09859577a959e408bba6.jpg"><br>  It was from this program that I learned that there are other consoles, besides Sega and Dendy, there are also Nintendo consoles, and even a Gameboy handheld prefix.  Pocket console - it was something unimaginable - to carry with you and play whenever you want, without a TV.  And this is an endless desire to play the game that you just saw on TV ...

      The games then were different, and their reviews were different, with modern Canobuvosti, I think, can not be compared.  Yes, and the creators were oriented on children.  It is now those children have grown up and the gaming audience has reached adults.  There were other programs about games, for example, ‚ÄúFrom the Screw‚Äù, but my memories of the ‚ÄúNew reality‚Äù are brighter.  In my opinion, the program about computer games that goes on the central TV channel, which broadcasts to the whole country - even now the event is rare and almost unique.  Especially if you remember the widespread lack of Internet and even cable television.  Now, when you can open YouTube at any time and see a lot of game reviews and game news, you realize that at the time the new release of the program was a whole event. <br><br>  A link from Wikipedia led to a site dedicated to Sergei Suponev and the programs he created.  There I found a recording of his programs.  After seeing a few - I remembered so many games ... I already forgot about the existence of many. <br><br>  I propose to remember this wonderful program together - a window to the ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKmSBsf0s38&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhinURii5ObYZIVmytbicl5CHwQ4Jw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  (many other entries are <a href="http://suponev.3dn.ru/blog/1-0-3">here</a> and <a href="http://www.novaya-realnost.ru/">here</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a0/651/bda/9a0651bda88fa94476797e7e9f7fe9d9.jpg"><br>  Let's honor the memory of Sergei Suponev.  He has not one good pass on his account (we all remember the Call of the Jungle).  In part, thanks to its popularization of computer games, more than a dozen (or even hundreds) of joysticks were broken. <br>  Today he would have turned 49 years old. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136949/</a></p>
