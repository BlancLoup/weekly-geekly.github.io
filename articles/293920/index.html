If any player takes ‚Äúthe whole game‚Äù to himself, then usually, the result of the game leaves much to be desired, the same is with the tools.  We all know that teamwork requires constant interaction and well-coordinated game, only then can we get synergy and achieve good results. <br><br>  The problem is that the marketing of most companies is focused on a single function or tool.  The tools do not agree with each other and do not work in a team, and therefore do not fulfill the MAIN task - sales.  It seems to be that time is spent on each instrument separately, and the return is quite insignificant.

      Imagine yourself a coach in this situation, you should get the most from your team of tools - increase the number or amount of sales.  Therefore, internet marketing should be comprehensive. <br><br>  For example, let's take the stage when a user has already reached your site (it doesn't matter if you attracted him from contextual advertising or some other channel), your further task is to convert it into a client.  It would seem that the task is simple, because the user has already found us, which means that he is already half our client.  At this stage, many marketers act differently.  Someone does a newsletter for everyone, someone gives discounts to all users, someone does nothing, etc.  Just in this place a turning point occurs, which can cost you 80-90% of lost clients and lost profit.  80-90% - on average, so many visitors leave the site without having made a targeted action. <br><br>  We give you an example of the Anivers studio campaign, which the studio implemented through the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Danivers">Carrot Quest</a> service (a service where eCRM, online chat, email newsletters and pop-up windows are integrated with each other).  The studio used 4 combined tools and got good results. <br><br><h3>  <b>e-CRM, pop-up, chat and email newsletters</b> </h3><br>  If you know what each user does on your site, then you understand that he is interested and due to what it can be transferred to the client.  Therefore, we have combined e-CRM (knowledge of the actions of each user on the site) with the main tools of Internet marketing: an online consultant for the site, email newsletters and pop-up windows. <br><br>  Consider the possibilities of such a merger on the example of the studio web projects Anivers <br><br>  <b>Situation:</b> Visitors enter the site, read various information, but most of them never send a request. <br><br>  <b>Solution:</b> Personalize communication with each user.  Determine the user segment, show the pop-up, make a distribution of 3 emails, make an offer and automate this process. <br><br><h3>  <b>Step 1 - User Segmentation</b> </h3><br>  The fact that not all visitors send an application is normal, because  many still study the information and make choices.  Most users need help and bring them to the purchase, but to do this, it is important to know each user, his motives and interests. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Danivers">Carrot Quest</a> service we collect all the information about the individual actions of each user on the site.  In other words, we read user behavior.  Here's what it looks like: <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd7/9bb/366/dd79bb366cec0ad9bf7480fe243adb2f.png" alt="image01" width="857" height="464"></a> <br><br><br><br><br><br>  Knowing what users are doing, we can automatically divide them into certain segments and continue to work individually with each. <br><br>  <b>So</b> , the user visits the Anivers website and after a while goes to the ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù section. <br><br>  Already at this stage we can understand what the visitor is interested in.  For example, we see that he is actively looking at the ‚Äúonline shopping‚Äù section, so he automatically falls into the ‚Äúonline store‚Äù segment.  Now we know due to what it can be brought to sale.  Things are easy. <br><br>  All the information that we will begin to ‚Äúsupply‚Äù to him in order to convert him into a customer, will relate to the subject of online stores. <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ab/1f5/bdf/6ab1f5bdf0512a0a2c37728e3845c526.jpg" alt="image021" width="897" height="721"></a> <br><br>  Agree, what kind of efficiency can we talk about if we ‚Äústuff‚Äù it with content about SaaS services or how to organize a webinar.  What is the use of it?  For other segments it would be interesting, but not for him.  In this case, he will never decide to buy from us. <br><br>  Remember, because this happened to everyone: you register in some service, and you immediately begin to overwhelm with irrelevant newsletters for you.  What do you say?  I personally will immediately unsubscribe or will ignore such letters. <br><br>  In fact, this is a constant mistake of most marketers.  They run the same campaigns and solutions for all users (chips, tools, texts, etc.).  People are not clones, so you need to know what interests them - to track user behavior on your site. <br><br><h3>  <b>Step 2 - collect leads by personal messaging</b> </h3><br>  We already know which segment the user belongs to and assume by what means it can be brought to the purchase. <br><br>  If up to this point the visitor has not left an email, we need to know him in order to convert it into a client using useful content.  To do this, we set up an automatic pop-up window, where we offer to leave your email.  For example, for obtaining useful articles about the creation or promotion of online stores.  This approach is very effective in lead generation, because  allows you to get contacts of potential customers without the use of intrusive advertising. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a35/bbd/516/a35bbd5164ec4ba5e858d2f5def2a226.png" alt="image03" width="362" height="296"></a> <br><br>  In this case, the conversion to the left email is almost 35%.  This is a remarkable result, considering that the average collection rate of emails using a pop-up window is usually in the range of 15-25%. <br><br>  If the address of the user never got you, our article on <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/carrot-quest/blog/9041/polzovatel-ne-ostavil-email-9-primerov-kak-ego-uderzhat-i-dovesti-do-pokupki">how to convert a visitor, if you do not know his email, will help you</a> . <br><br><h3>  <b>Step 3 - we work with the user by mail</b> </h3><br>  Further, a message of 3 letters with a benefit (trigger mailings) is automatically launched to the user's mail. <br><ol><li>  "25 errors when creating an online store" (sent in 1 day); </li><li>  ‚ÄúArticle-case about abandoned baskets‚Äù (after 3 days); </li><li>  ‚ÄúHow usability and design affect sales in the online store‚Äù (after 7 days). </li></ol><br>  We took the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe 3 letters from Neil Pattel, the founder of KISSmetrics.  He says that in most cases, reading a user of 3 letters or 3 articles is enough to understand the value of your product and become your customer. <br><br>  It is clear that for different markets this figure will be different, because  The decision process may be different. <br><br>  All the best email newsletters today contain almost no advertising, give the user a favor, show that you are an expert and he will come to you.  It is enough to follow the statistics and test various variants of letters. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/537/f7c/f83/537f7cf83385ec5bd5062ceb5e8c0f95.jpg" alt="image00" width="1639" height="85"></a> <br><br>  Such cycles of articles check the interest of users and ‚Äúheat up‚Äù them (they lead to the purchase).  After that you send your offer. <br><br><h3>  <b>Step 4 - the final touch and work with the client.</b> </h3><br>  A number of users begin to contact the company before they receive the last letter from the chain.  For the rest, the ‚ÄúSales Letter‚Äù comes into play in which special conditions of work are offered if the reader contacts the company within 30 days. <br><br>  As a result, many users respond (write to the company) directly from the email list.  This message comes to the operator in the chat, which sees all the information about the user (what letters he read, which segment is included, etc.).  With this information, operators with minimal effort make a personalized sale.  At this stage, most users are ready to make an order, operators simply help them with this. <br><br>  Users can communicate both from the mail and in the chat itself, the dialogs are saved in all channels.  Employees of the company continue to ‚Äúlead‚Äù the client in service throughout the entire order, retaining all the necessary information in their account in <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Danivers">Carrot Quest</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a27/650/285/a2765028590d782bdb69724f868f31be.jpg" alt="veiw" width="1310" height="510"></a> <br><br>  By creating and automating such a simple scenario, Anivers were able to increase the number of applications by almost 2.5 times (to be exact, by 2.3).  After that, Anivers had so many applications that there was a problem of their quick processing.  Plus, more importantly, by creating an image of the company as an expert in the eyes of readers, we managed to raise the average bill.  Importantly, the number of users attracted to the site was the same, that is, the additional money for attraction was not spent. <br><br>  Scenarios for ‚Äúheating up‚Äù leads and bringing them to purchase with the help of <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Danivers">Carrot Quest</a> can be created for almost any business on the Internet.  Only the use of tools and their sequence can differ. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293920/</a></p>
