      It was no coincidence that I remembered about the content manager, since quite recently we had such a situation.  In fact, the tasks in most cases are quite simple and using expensive photoshop for them is like a thermonuclear blast for digging a hole a meter deep.  On the other hand, they often go beyond what is offered by dozens of inexpensive or completely free program, which can be easily found on the net. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We tried quite a few utilities and after numerous experiments, it finally became clear - we would have Photoshop, but only for inexpensive).  The Adobe Corporation rightly considers Photoshop a professional cash cow and does not want to part with it for free.  We have almost come to terms with this fact ... But once, wandering through the wilds of the adobov site, I accidentally stumbled upon one software product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/378/054/118/378054118606fed9c8528693205c857d.png"><br>  <font color="#808080">This program is called Photoshop Elements 7. The presence of the word ‚Äúphotoshop‚Äù attracted me in the name of the program, and even more the price of 139 American rubles.</font>  <font color="#808080">Maybe this is the very program that we are looking for - I thought.</font> <br><br>  I thought about it, but I didn‚Äôt have much hope, knowing full well that this could be quite an expected marketing move.  Nevertheless, I followed the link to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopelwin/">program description page</a> .., on it I also did not find Photoshop, although I read everything from cover to cover.  From the laconic description it followed that this, the program is adapted for inexperienced users, is mainly intended to make the work and management of amateur photos as simple as possible - in short, our answer is picas :). <br><br>  With even more sad mood, I went to the download page of the trial version of the program.  And here I was again illuminated by a faint ray of hope :).  The fact is that I was offered to download a distribution kit weighing 450!  megabytes, and this is a lot for the manager of custom photos with advanced features, even by modern standards.  Maybe all the same photoshop? <br><br>  Inspired by the new hope, I secretly downloaded the distribution kit and not postponing the matter indefinitely, I immediately installed the program.  I was again disappointed; after downloading the program, I saw Pikas in Adobov.  Everything is automated so much that it‚Äôs nasty :). <br><br>  But I persist in searching, hoping in my heart for the natural laziness of the programmers :), who would rather choose to make ‚ÄúPicasa‚Äù from Photoshop than start everything from scratch.  And soon my perseverance was rewarded: by clicking on the "full" button, I got what I was looking for.  Here it is the coveted toolbar, which collects such native to the heart of any designer tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35e/8cb/1a6/35e8cb1a63a025e8d6e7b6cfd7193b87.png"><br>  <font color="#808080">At a cursory inspection, I found everything that is needed, not only the content manager, but also the technical designer.</font>  <font color="#808080">There is a standard set of tools and a palette with layers, masks, a standard set of filters, the ‚Äúsave for web‚Äù dialog ... and even the ability to save everything in psd format.</font> <br><br>  This article has several different goals, so I will not bore you with a description of the functionality of the program.  I can only say about the shortcomings.  Probably, an unusual interface type and rather high hardware requirements can be attributed to them.  But for an attractive price of $ 139 - I am willing to endure such deprivations :), and you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44790/</a></p>
