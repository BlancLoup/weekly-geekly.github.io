His personality attracts the attention of historians, writers, journalists and ordinary people, since the history of his reign is very unusual.  Pharaoh, he stayed only 9 years old, and began to rule Egypt as a teenager.  Tutankhamun did not live to be 20 years old, because he died from an unspecified illness.  Some historians believe that he was killed, but most likely he died from severe malaria.  In the course of DNA analysis, scientists <a href="http://rian.ru/science/20100217/209643072.html">discovered the causative agents of</a> this dangerous disease.

      About Tutankhamen first talked after his tomb was discovered.  She was found in the ‚ÄúValley of the Kings‚Äù near Thebes, and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/KV62">ancient robbers didn‚Äôt touch anything in it</a> , so the burial remains to this day.  Here, among the funeral accessories and utensils, many works of art of that era were discovered - various household items (gilded chariot, seats, beds, lamps), precious jewelry, clothing, writing utensils and even a bunch of his grandmother's hair.  On November 4, 1922, the entrance to the tomb of KV62 was cleared, at the entrance to the tomb of Ramses VI (the builders of the tomb of this Ramesseid, apparently, covered the way to the tomb of Tutankhamen, which explains its relative preservation).  Moreover, the seals on the doors were intact, which inspired serious hopes for the possibility of making the largest archaeological discovery of the century.  November 26, 1922 Howard Carter and Carnarvon became the first people in three millennia to descend into the tomb.  Among other artifacts found in the tomb, the iron dagger with no rust on the blade was particularly interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The dagger made of iron is generally a strange find for ancient Egypt - the fact is that it was rarely worked with iron here.  More and more with bronze, copper, gold and silver.  Plus, the dagger blade almost did not rust, which was very surprising to scientists.  The dagger itself is very beautiful - its scabbard is made of gold, the handle is also golden, and the pommel is decorated with rock crystal. <br><br>  Assumptions that the dagger is made of iron of extraterrestrial origin, have been expressed for a long time.  But now this assumption has been confirmed.  Scientists have studied the dagger using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer.  It turned out that in the dagger quite a lot of nickel and cobalt.  And this is - one of the evidence of extraterrestrial origin of the metal.  Specialists also analyzed the composition of known meteorites found within 2000 km from the coast of the Red Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEgypt, and found one meteorite, whose composition is almost similar to the composition of the metal from which the dagger was made.  This meteorite was found in 2000 on a limestone plateau 240 km west of Alexandria.  The results of their research, scientists published on Tuesday <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/maps.12664/full">edition of Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science</a> . <br><br>  As mentioned above, in ancient Egypt almost did not work with iron.  But in 2013, conducting excavations of tombs near the Nile in the northern part of Egypt, scientists found fragments of a meteorite, plus an iron-nickel alloy, turned by masters of antiquity into thin metal sheets.  This find dates from around 3200 BC.  Scientists concluded that the ancient Egyptians attached great importance to the meteoric iron.  From it, in particular, created ceremonial tools and elements of the ornament.  Also, experts have suggested that the Egyptians considered sacred "stones falling from the sky."  The material from which daggers were made (there were very few such daggers) was called by the ancient Egyptians "iron from the sky."  In fact, so they called any iron that they had at their disposal. <br><br>  As far as can be judged, an iron-nickel meteorite, from which some ceremonial tools, daggers and a number of other artifacts are made, fell in Epipt around the 13th century BC.  And he was regarded as a gift from the gods, which is not at all surprising. <br><br>  The dagger, which was found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, is made very high quality, which indicates the experience of working with iron from the masters who made it.  These people clearly knew what they were dealing with, and were aware of how to work with iron.  So the ‚Äúiron affairs of the master‚Äù were in ancient Egypt long before the onset of the Iron Age in Europe. <br><br>  This dagger is not the only artifact from the tomb of the young Pharaoh, made from the "gift of the gods."  The scarab from Tutankhamen‚Äôs funeral necklace is, in fact, glass formed when a meteorite falls onto sand under the influence of high temperature.  Such material is found only in the Western desert of Egypt.  And the Egyptians had to go almost 1000 kilometers to get it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0d/357/871/d0d357871473356158148e37ad76ea8b.jpg"><br><br>  Scientists will continue to study the artifacts of meteoric iron, related to the culture of ancient Egypt.  According to experts, they are hoping to understand what methods the Egyptians used to process meteoric iron and create iron weapons and ornaments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/535/36b/1f4/53536b1f4dbce03ca329dec479477d7b.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394643/</a></p>
