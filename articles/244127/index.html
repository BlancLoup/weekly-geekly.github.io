Well, the promised continuation follows below! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b># 8 Write for both people and search engines</b> <br><br>  Content marketing of the old school was more like a link building practice, but now it‚Äôs not.  In fact, if your approach will be only this, Google will not be very friendly to you.

      You have to create content using the very method on which the modern market is based.  Use the phrases that people use in search engines to find what they are looking for.  Thus, you will not only deal with those who do not know about you, but also with search engines. <br><br>  Do not create content only in order to get traffic and generate links - it smacks of spam, so hardly anyone would like it.  Create content that will be appreciated - one that people will like, and they will gladly share it with their friends. <br><br>  All this will only increase your traffic.  If you organically write links to content, then this is good, but do not put them at the head of your content strategy. <br><br>  <b># 9 Call for action</b> <br><br>  When organizing your content marketing, always call on your readers to action, because without it all your efforts will go to waste. <br><br>  Make sure your call is relevant and appropriate to the context.  It may contain a request: to download the electronic version of the book, to subscribe to the newsletter, to participate in a survey or purchase.  Do not add a call to action asking to buy after each piece of content - because you do not want to turn everything into a sale?  Do this only when it makes sense, and is considered appropriate for your audience. <br><br>  On the other hand, do not avoid mentioning your product or service at all, otherwise you will greatly reduce your payback.  Remember that the right context is the key to success. <br><br>  <b># 10 Always find new ideas.</b> <br><br>  Content marketing is a continuous activity in which you have to participate day after day, week after week, but someday there will come a time where you will start to feel a bit limited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/181/625/0a2/1816250a283443469c58fd6aec05971c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The key to salvation is the constant updating of your Swipe file.  Install Google Alerts.  Subscribe to blogs and magazines leading in your industry.  Pay attention to what people say in communities, forums, social networks and groups.  Make a list of questions that your own readers constantly ask you. <br><br>  Refer to this material for inspiration when you make your content plan.  Save the swipe file to your hard drive and remember that its contents cannot be copied without thinking. <br><br>  Content that has been rehashed and quickly compiled is very easy to find. <br><br>  <b># 11 Get support</b> <br><br>  Do not spend all your efforts in content marketing to create brand awareness.  In fact, you can have other people do it for you. <br><br>  Contact important and influential SEO users.  Before you ask to do something in return, you need to establish a good relationship with them.  At the right time, you can ask them to share part of the content with their ‚Äútribe‚Äù (which usually has hundreds or thousands of followers, if not millions). <br><br>  In addition to direct assistance, supporting you with ‚Äúbig cones‚Äù is like icing on the cake. <br><br>  Instead of creating new content each time, you can ask your readers to share their opinions using provocative or funny questions.  Such content created by the users themselves will only be to your advantage. <br><br>  Ultimately, the goal behind content marketing is to turn your users into your supporters.  They will spread your word and become an excellent support group for your brand.  When they praise you, it has a far greater impact than if you did. <br><br>  When your clients work instead of you, their actions look 100 times more reliable. <br><br>  <b># 12 Optimize landing pages for your content</b> <br><br>  The landing page is created with a special intention - for the reader to take a certain action, read some of the content, for example.  Templates for such pages include: a capture page (squeeze page), whose goal is to collect email addresses, a home page, a help page, or any other content-filled page.  For example, a message from a blog, video instruction or presentation. <br><br>  For your content marketing to work to its fullest, you need to take care of your landing pages.  They must be optimized, that is, you must make it so easy for the reader to find the most important information without having to look for it throughout the site.  There should be: a strong title and a single, but understandable, call-to-action, which should be designed so that people are happy to perform the action you need. <br><br>  All your landing pages should be credible, be reliable and emphasize your difference from other brands. <br><br>  <b># 13 Create such "buns", from which you can not refuse</b> <br><br>  If you think that you need to blog in order to have a successful content plan, you are mistaken.  In fact, you do not need to do this, although a blog provides quite big advantages for your business, if properly and professionally arranged.  Content marketing relies on the creation and distribution of content for business purposes. <br><br>  In addition to the usual blog posts, these can be: e-books, e-courses, webinars, real meetings, conversations, podcasts, white books, infographics, educational videos and presentations. <br><br>  Most of them, if not all, must be created so that people subscribe to your e-newsletter.  Thus, over time, they will serve you as the main means of generating sentences.  More importantly, you can have several offers developed for different distribution channels. <br><br>  <b># 14 Stop Looking for Instant Revenue</b> <br><br>  Of course, content marketing is designed for a long-term strategy.  Sometimes it is difficult to get some results instantly, and you get the feeling that nothing will come of it.  Do not despair.  Be consistent.  Schedule updates and follow them regularly. <br><br>  Make decisions for the future based on data analysis.  If you continue to do everything right, you are guaranteed to start seeing results. <br><br>  <b>Ready to start?</b> <br><br>  After all, content marketing is a process in which you create and distribute useful, relevant, and extremely valuable information to attract your target audience.  To make it all work, you must be consistent, have clear and predetermined intentions. <br><br>  Which of the above actions do you take today?
