  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search engine sanctions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Alchemists were intelligent people and sincerely yearned for knowledge.  But instead of strict empiricism, that is, experiments, analysis of the data obtained and hypothesizing on the principle of Occam's razor, they tried to impose imaginary principles of sympathetic magic on nature.  Matter is indifferent, it cannot be exorcised - only science can produce working technology.  But our brain, unfortunately, is prone to alchemical thinking - see, for example, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">list of cognitive impairments</a> .  SEO is one of the most "magical" areas: all SEOs state that they have the elixir of withdrawal in the TOP, but most often they sell poisonous pills from cinnabar to website owners. <br>  But the flow of targeted visitors from the TOP10 of Yandex and Google is so attractive that even many victims of barbaric pseudo-optimization do not give up trying to fix everything and become a top search engine.  What should you do if your site has suffered at the hands of negligent optimizers and has sunk into the abyss like a kraken? .. To diagnose a problem, have patience and start a working promotion cycle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is a sanction? </h4><br>  If the search engine notices that the site or its related elements are suspiciously changing, its algorithms may find it better to temporarily remove it from the list in order to make room for more honest and high-quality resources.  In most cases, the site simply goes beyond the top ten, but more severe and noticeable sanctions are imposed for serious violations. <br><br><h5>  Ban </h5><br>  The site is completely removed from the index, it is searched only by the URL of the main page. <br><ol><li>  It is imposed for violations related to doorway, viruses, cloaking, wrapping behavioral ranking factors, etc.  To bring a website under the ban without the knowledge of the owner is almost impossible, so if you run into it, blame it not only on black SEO officers, but also on yourself. </li><li>  The only way out is a complete reworking of the site: a new design, a new content, a new structure. </li></ol><br><h5>  Pessimization </h5><br>  In addition to throwing pages out of the index, search engines can artificially lower their rating - in this case, an increase in the budget for the purchase of links will not help until the cause of the punishment is eliminated. <br><ol><li>  The reduction in the search results can be imposed for a variety of misconduct - from not completely unique content to the ‚Äúreference explosion‚Äù (too sharp an increase in the reference mass without a sufficient share of links from supertrast resources). </li><li>  Remove huge texts with overwhelming number of occurrences of keywords, replace the text you copied or yours, get rid of non-original pictures, write unique titles for all pages, make a neat layout, remove extra advertising - in the overwhelming majority of cases, look carefully at the site to reveal reason for imposing sanctions. </li></ol><br><h5>  AGS </h5><br>  The ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù sanction intended to exclude from the index pages with copied content and low quality pages based on a set of other criteria.  Created to deal with sites that sell links - the more pages on the donor site, the more the owner earns, so he seeks to inflate their number.  And if it does this by dishonest methods, then the dozens of pages in the search engine index usually remain from the affected site (this can be seen in Yandex.Webmaster), even if the actual resource consists of hundreds and thousands of pages. <br><ol><li>  If you know that your site has really swollen due to pages with copied or automatically created content (texts, pictures, meta tags with the same content, etc.), clean it up: remove all garbage, and then increase the number of pages gradually, only original content account. </li><li>  Search engines are not infallible: if you are sure of the high quality of the excluded pages, write in support of a substantiated statement - there is a possibility that the AGS will be removed. </li></ol><br><h5>  Sandbox </h5><br>  Do you want to register a domain, create a website and get into the TOP10 by any competitive request?  It will not work - the guard is initially imposed on all young sites sanction.  Yandex believes that only sites of a year or older can qualify for the top ten for high-frequency queries. <br><ol><li>  The sanction is imposed on all new sites automatically. </li><li>  The fastest get to the TOP10 beginners with a regular update schedule with original content and links from reputable resources.  It is also important to start promotion with low-frequency requests, gradually moving to the MF, and in the absence of unreasonable stagnation on the threshold of the TOP, to HF. </li></ol><br><h5>  "You are the last" </h5><br>  The name of the sanction invented by the optimizers, which is imposed by ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù on the sites-plagiarists.  If you use someone else's content without reference to the source, then after a while, even for a long quotation in quotes, the site will be strictly pessimized.  At the same time, references to the original texts are not a panacea, as the weight of the pages flows through them, which makes it difficult to bring them to the TOP.  Therefore it is necessary to write only original articles, descriptions of goods, etc.  And you need to do the same if, for some reason, your site got under the filter ‚ÄúYou are the last‚Äù - this is the only way to return to the top of the list  To ensure that content costs do not breach the budget, each original text posted on your website must be protected with <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D1120756">Yandex.Webmaster.</a> <br><br><h5>  "You are spam" </h5><br>  The legendary hole in the Yandex ranking algorithm left an indelible mark on the fragile psyche of many SEOs.  Huge sheets of the text with hundreds of occurrences of keywords allowed to hold firmly in the TOP10, but since 2010, for inhuman texts necessarily imposed a sanction.  The recipe for the drug is obvious - high-quality thematic texts.

    <h5>  Affiliate filter </h5><br>  Put two or three sites in the TOP10 and get almost all customers?  Very difficult and risky undertaking.  Search engines quite cleverly determine that sites belong to the same owner: according to WHOIS, contact information and other not so obvious criteria (including the ‚Äúknockout‚Äù of competitors).  There will be only one in the issue, the rest of the affiliates will be strictly pessimized. <br><br>  <i>Attention!</i>  <i>Not always the absence of your site in the top ten is a consequence of the sanction.</i>  <i>It is possible that competitors are simply better yet - they invest more in content, design, working with behavioral ranking factors, use intelligent systems for building up and maintaining a reference mass, and so on.</i>  <i>Remember: sanctions manifest themselves either in excluding pages from the index, or in a sudden ejection of pages that have already risen to the TOP beyond the first 30-50 results.</i>  <i>Check the site, fix the problem and write in support of search engines - the magic philosopher's stone, which removes the ban and sanctions, does not exist.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160225/</a></p>
