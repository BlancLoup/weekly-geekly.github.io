This, for example, ZTE, Meizu, Lenovo, Xiaomi.

      Perhaps soon this number will join Ainol.  The other day, two tablets of this company came into my hands, and, you know, I was surprised ... and the price and quality. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KsbOsFJXKWA&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKpXpVk__73aIJ6ITzk4aRiH42hw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Ainol Spark and Venus, and they will be discussed, are cheap.  These are budget devices, and at the first price is about 10 thousand rubles, and at the second - about 5 thousand rubles.  Well, what kind of animals - read below (or watch the video). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbf/2dc/8eb/bbf2dc8ebca4587c7a246940f026c03d.png"><br><br>  Ainol Spark is a 9.7-inch tablet with a Retina-display and 4-core processor. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><br>  OS: Android 4.1 without add-ons <br>  Processor: Allwinner A31, 4 cores, 1000 MHz <br>  Video Processor: PowerVR SGX544 MP2 <br>  RAM: 2 GB (tests show 1.5 GB) <br>  Built-in memory: 16 GB <br>  Memory card support: microSDHC <br>  Cameras: 5 MP base, 0.3 MP frontal <br>  Dimensions: 241x185.6x10.6 mm (LxWxD) <br>  Weight: 642 g <br>  Screen: IPS 9.7 '2048x1536 <br>  Battery capacity: 10,000 mAh <br><br>  Spark, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162867">formerly known</a> as the Novo 9 FireWire, received the design of the original iPad (whatever you say, which is a fact).  That's just such a "first iPad" Retina-display and 4-core processor.  The tablet has just appeared on sale and will cost about 9-10 thousand rubles in Russia, and considering its functionality, this looks tempting. <br><br>  It is not clear that the material was used to make the back cover, but it does not feel like plastic, but not aluminum.  Apparently, this is some kind of special alloy.  I did not drop the tablet, so I can not say how durable it is, but the appearance and ergonomics inspire confidence.  And the assembly at a high level.  The only thing that disappointed was the ‚Äúinhibition‚Äù of the system.  The manufacturer responded with a promise to correct the flaws by updating the firmware, as now it is not fully optimized for the device.  Let's believe, after all, there was a pre-release version in my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f03/1bd/e87/f031bde872c00e1ae5e6f5f997d95dd2.png"><br><br>  Strangely enough, according to the ‚ÄúChinese tradition‚Äù, there are a lot of connectors, including USB, MicroHDMI and, of course, a place for an SD card (up to 32 GB). <br><br>  By the way, it's cool that the manufacturer positions the tablet for use in portrait mode. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  - Price (9-10 thousand rubles) <br>  - Really high-quality Retina-display with good viewing angles <br>  - Connector for SD card and HDMI <br>  - 4-core processor and 2 GB of RAM <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - No Bluetooth <br>  - Slightly slows down the interface (due to beta firmware, so it will be fixed) <br>  - Some applications from Play Market are not supported <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1e/81f/b6e/c1e81fb6e176fa6224512d1c54cc2e20.png"><br><br>  <b>Ainol Novo 7 Venus</b> <br><br>  This tablet went on sale a little earlier than Spark, but it is also worth attention (and there were no reviews on Habr√©).  The tablet costs about 5-5.5 thousand rubles, and for this money you get a really powerful device with a good design.  And if you are not confused by the unknown inscription ‚ÄúAinol‚Äù - then this option should be considered.  By the way, I will say in advance that I have already bought myself Ainol Venus (to me, it is true, I got a little less than 5 thousand rubles). <br><br>  She really lacks GPS, but in a familiar workshop during parsing we found there is not a connected GPS-receiver, so theoretically, when you buy an adapter for 20 bucks, you can connect GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/039/8bc/e4f/0398bce4f3e3e0f1eebe56de5e4e3e0f.png"><br><br>  I was struck by the speaker - it sounds very high quality and loud. <br><br>  <b>Note</b> : There are two versions of Venus - regular and lite.  In the photo and video, the Lite version can be distinguished by the back cover: there are diamonds instead of circles.  But there are differences in the insides - in the Lite-version, the processor is at 1000 MHz, and not at 1500. I did not hold the usual version in my hands, but I can say that the lightweight version works very fast. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the specifications: <br><br>  OS: Android 4.1 without add-ons <br>  Processor: Cortex A9, 4 cores, 1500 MHz or 1000 MHz (Lite version) <br>  Video Processor: Vivante GC1000 <br>  RAM: 1 GB <br>  Built-in memory: 16 GB <br>  Memory card support: microSDHC <br>  Cameras: 2 MP base, 0.3 MP front <br>  Dimensions: 186x127x11 mm (LxWxD) <br>  Weight: 320 g <br>  Screen: TFT IPS 7 '1280x800 <br>  Battery capacity: 4000 mAh <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  - Price (about 5 thousand rubles) <br>  - Connector for SD card and HDMI <br>  - HDMI wire to the set <br>  - 4-core processor <br>  - Nice design and lightness <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - No Bluetooth <br>  - The case crunches a little <br>  - Plastic (not glass) screen protection <br><br>  <b>General conclusions:</b> <br><br>  I spent about 2 weeks with both tablets, and I was so used to Venus that I decided to keep it.  He is cheap and he has a cool design.  Spark is also good, but I'm not used to 10-inch tablets at all.  In addition, Android 4.1 on Spark slowed down a bit, but the manufacturer stated that in the next couple of weeks there will be an update that fixes all the flaws. <br><br>  In general, Ainol shows the level, once again proving that the price may not affect the quality. <br><br>  <i>Useful links:</i> <br><br>  News about Ainol Novo 9 [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162867/">link</a> ] <br>  Review Ainol Novo 7 Fire [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150479/">link</a> ] <br>  Another Fire review [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150354/">link</a> ] <br>  Review Ainol V9000 HDX Megatron [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/75629/">link</a> ] <br><br>  The tablets I sold the store <a href="http://touchetta.ru/">Touchetta.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176091/</a></p>
