  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to put things in order if you run out of power</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://wengineer.ru/public/habr/power.jpg"><br><br>  Three years ago, I experienced a personality crisis.  Then a number of events occurred and it became unclear what was important, what I wanted and what to do next.  In such a state, a person does not have the strength and energy to come up with a plan to solve difficulties, apply emergency time-management techniques and take a step in the right direction. <br><br>  The energy supply is limited, and in a crisis or at a professional burnout this supply is limited to business and thought.  At the same time, undesirable and harmful works and thoughts lead to crisis and burnout.  Here is what I did: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every evening during the week I wrote down the events of the day in detail.  In the reverse <nobr>order -</nobr> from evening to morning, right up to washing your hands and bath.  Then, to each event added notes about the emotions that causes.  So, within seven days I made it clear for myself: what I love more and what's in the way.  What do consciously, and that on the <nobr>machine -</nobr> just to avoid.

      There are three types of cases: <br><br><ul><li>  Automatic affairs.  To the ridiculous: in the morning I could not remember where I had parked the car last night.  It was not pleasant to recognize myself as a biomass. <br><br></li><li>  Beloved affairs, they fill with energy.  These are done in one breath and with pleasure.  At that time, I was deploying a new configuration management system: I made a plan for installing on servers and clients, prepared distributions, thought out changes in configurations, described the stages of implementation, and launched the product.  I realized that I am happy when I do pilot projects, I bring benefits to the processes in the enterprise and to my colleagues. <br><br></li><li>  Harmful things cause sadness and frustration.  They are unpleasant to do, they seem to be strangers and take a good mood for a long time.  I realized that it was harmful to me to communicate with several people - communication was viscous and frustrating for the whole day. </li></ul><br><h4>  <b>rules</b> </h4><br><ol><li>  <b>Reject non-vital matters</b> .  I dropped cases that caused negative emotions, stopped the unwanted communication with several people, which I was upset for a long time. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Complete unfinished business and repay debts</b> .  I have compiled a list of cases that I have been postponing for a long time.  Part of the list completed.  He refused a couple of obligations, as he understood that the matter was not <nobr>profile - he</nobr> agreed to withdraw from the project, he transferred the cases to a colleague. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Do not start a single new business, while discarding unnecessary and ending unfinished business</b> .  As soon as I started to complete the cases from my list of unfinished ones, I received several proposals for participation in new projects.  Someone offered to understand the configuration of the new system, someone urgently needed a new site.  But I remembered the rules of the process and rejected the offers.  I am sure it helped in the end to save energy and recuperate. </li></ol><br>  Despite the simplicity of the process, I made a lot of discoveries for myself, realized what exactly makes you happy and helps you move toward goals.  It became easier to get rid of unnecessary things: after clearing the brain corrects itself, removes from <nobr>harmful -</nobr> we are so arranged. <br><br>  The crisis went into decline, because the forces became more and I spent them on something that again filled with energy.  Thus, forces emerged to come up with the first steps of a plan for solving difficulties, to apply emergency time-management techniques, the stages of which will be discussed in the next article. <br><br><h4>  <b>So, if you're in a similar situation, try</b> </h4><br><ol><li>  Week to write the events of the day.  Add to each event notes about the emotions that were experienced when doing. </li><li>  Identify in the events of the three groups: the affairs on the machine, favorite things, bad things. </li><li>  In the process to follow the rules: discard unwanted cases, complete unfinished, do not start new ones. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316726/</a></p>
