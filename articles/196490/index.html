  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronics Circle: Lesson Program</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week there was a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195340/">post</a> about organizing classes in electronics at school.  In this post, as promised, I will try to present my thoughts on the program and methods of conducting such classes. <br><br>  At the moment, we have already managed to hold three classes and even went to the championship in Robo-sumo (for now, of course, as spectators).  Therefore, I want to share my first impressions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c8d/003/07d/c8d00307d0feab60c18afab55428a162.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, this picture is not the result of three classes) <br><br><h5>  Caution High Voltage </h5><br>  For a start, it would be nice to think about the most common things.  For example, what will be the material base for training?  This largely depends on the technical equipment of the school and the room where the guys will make blinking LEDs and, a little later, terminators.  I will talk about a regular school, where in addition to the group, there are lessons during the day.  In the houses of creativity and various clubs, the situation is naturally different. <br>  There are several options: <br>  1. There is nothing in the classroom dedicated to classes, except for the 220 V socket.  The most difficult option.  It is necessary to look somewhere for the power supply for each person.  The unobvious problem is that before each session, all this low-voltage power supply network must first be connected (extension cords, power supply units themselves, wires to each table), and after that, remove everything back.  Somehow the class is not allowed to retool - financial responsibility, no one will be contacted.  The second option is to switch to programming as quickly as possible and then deal exclusively with them, and then only a computer and a projector are needed.  It is clear that this does not fit - the guys need something completely <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJO2P3lf94YI">different</a> . <br>  2. It happens that in school physics offices each desk is already equipped with a socket or a terminal block with 36 or 42 V. It is believed that this is a relatively safe voltage.  In this case, you only need to make <a href="http://forum.cxem.net/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D53820">power supplies</a> for 5 and / or 12 volts, which will be permanently installed on desks.  Sometimes it even happens that the teacher has the opportunity to change the voltage on the sockets of school desks with the help of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%2590%25D0%25A2%25D0%25A0">LATR</a> - generally an excellent option. <br>  By the way, you can find quite a lot of different soldering irons for voltage 12, 24.36 and 42V. <br>  3. Finally, it happens that the class has 5V power to each desk.  This is enough for most experiments, as well as for the operation of low-power devices, both analog and digital.  Typically, such power wiring is done independently by a physics teacher using rather thick wires (to prevent voltage drops significantly).

      Unfortunately, in my case, the office of physics refers to option number 1. There is a laptop on the teacher‚Äôs desk, an MFP, a TV, a VCR and music.  center, and above the head hanging projector.  Behind his back is a small white screen for the projector and, in fact, a blackboard.  There are no stacks of MacBooks, as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195340/">here,</a> there is not and is not expected.  Well, I will use what is.  The presence of the projector is very pleased - I have accumulated a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-CzICOTxV-U">lot of</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4B5l9vJOHjI">interesting</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCHFkZlYlWBc">videos</a> that are so rarely shown in physics lessons and they will be very useful for understanding the theory. <br>  For all these reasons, it was decided to provide each young radio amateur with a 5V power supply.  Most probably already have them: almost any charge from a phone, tablet, player, etc.  Who does not - I will distribute from their own stocks.  We also use <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_odkw%3DBattery%2BStorage%2BCase%2B4%2BX%2BAA%2Bwire%26_osacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.XBattery%2BStorage%2BCase%2BAA%2Bwire%26_nkw%3DBattery%2BStorage%2BCase%2BAA%2Bwire%26_sacat%3D0">battery packs</a> - convenient, mobile and safe.  This is what concerns the power supply.  About layouts, components and the rest - a little later.  In the near future I will discuss the ‚Äúmove‚Äù to the computer science office, because without computers it will soon be difficult. <br><br><h4>  Knowledge slice </h4><br>  No less important task is to determine the "initial conditions", that is, at least an approximate current level of knowledge of future engineers.  Without this, it seems to me, it will be difficult to set goals and even more so to accomplish them.  Even before our first meeting, I prepared a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/97952322/Questionnaire.doc">questionnaire</a> and distributed it at the first lesson.  Explained for what it is necessary and how to fill.  But still, I found out the main points in a conversation in the classroom: I asked about their lessons in physics, computer science and mathematics, about hobbies, about having experience in repairing something, about hobbies, the presence of radio amateurs in the family, and so on. <br>  The results are as follows: <br>  - most simply forgot to bring this form to the second lesson <br>  - two sixth-graders and one seventh-grader did it <br>  - ninth-graders scored at full strength <br>  - it is noticeable that between 6 and 7 class is a real abyss <br>  - Informatics consider that was not.  Maximum - office.  However, one guy said that there was something <a href="http://www.myrobot.ru/logo/aboutlogo.php">similar</a> and another one even wrote something in X <br>  - the level of English has not yet managed to understand, but what was in the questionnaires does not help on English-speaking resources.  Well, so far we will not get into datashiti. <br>  - everyone has a computer and the Internet <br>  - at once several people have a dad or grandfather - engineers and know what's what.  This is very good for me, I think it will be much more fun with them. <br>  - even ninth-graders are not completely sure how the battery is depicted in the diagram.  Those who are younger, did not see such things. <br><br>  Based on this, made the following conclusions: <br>  1. Start from the beginning.  You can not rely on the fact that all of them know what an electric current is, for example.  Well, that was clear from the start. <br>  2. Adhering to a clear plan and deadlines will be very difficult.  Judging by the way the guys brought me profiles) <br>  3. When we get to programming, we also need to start from scratch.  A little further, I will describe my thoughts in more detail. <br>  4. The English part of the network for them does not yet exist.  We'll have to refer only to Russian resources and documentation.  It is clear that I will not be able to motivate them to intensively learn English - the guys still do not understand why this is necessary. <br>  5. How can you actively use the Network.  For 4 hours a week, just do not tell and do not answer all the questions, but there are computers, phones or tablets.  Therefore, we must try to teach them to look for answers online, communicate with each other and ask me questions not only in class. <br><br>  I already started a <a href="http://goodsolder.livejournal.com/">diary</a> on LiveJournal, a YouTube channel for future videos and an account on Skype.  When at the last lesson I told about all this and asked to use it more actively, they all almost in one voice said that they needed a group on Vkontakte.  Well, we will have to meet each other, and I will make such a group a little later.  As I understood from conversations, the guys are much more likely to be on Vkontakte than on any other site (here I once again want to make a caustic remark, but I can't, I‚Äôm now a teacher =)) <br>  In the previous post there was a question about the video.  I tried to record the first two lessons, but doing it with a regular video camera turned out to be extremely inconvenient: a narrow angle of view and it was inconvenient to rearrange a tripod to shoot a board, then, for example, a mock-up board or some experiments.  In the near future I will try to get hold of an action camera and then it will be easier.  There are plans to post the most interesting on the YouTube channel. <br><br><h5>  Do you have a plan, Mr. Fix? </h5><br>  Now the main thing: what are we actually going to do and where to start?  I did not have a clear answer before we started classes.  I only roughly imagined possible options.  To date, 3 lessons have already passed, and I more or less understood the level of preparation of the children.  My cunning plan is this: <br>  - The very basics: what is electric current.  Try to link this concept with a conventional pipeline, that is, to use the hydrodynamic model (GDM) for visual and intuitive learning. <br>  - Power supply (battery) and wires.  The analogies in GDM are the pump, the water tank and the pipes. <br>  - Breadboard device. <br>  - The simplest scheme on a breadboard is a battery, wires and a light bulb. <br>  - The resistor and its effect on the light bulb and the whole circuit.  Analogies in GDM - narrow pipes. <br>  - Several resistors in different switching options. <br>  - LEDs;  buttons.  Simple schemes with them and analogies in GDM (valve and valve). <br>  - What is a microcircuit.  Take a simple board and clearly show where is the MS, resistors, buttons, conductors and power supply. <br>  - Analog and digital signal <br>  - Chips of standard logic (I will not dwell on it in too much detail, but still it needs to be done). <br>  - Simple counters, generators, registers, multiplexers, decoders, etc.  Several classes. <br>  - Capacity and inductance. <br>  - Arduino: what it is and why.  What is a microcontroller with links to MS standard logic. <br>  - Blink LED. <br>  - Then everything will be mixed up, depending on the project of a particular person: someone will squeak with the speaker, someone will turn the servo, display digits on the seven-segment indicators or handle an array of buttons. <br><br>  Like this.  First, common things that are needed for any crafts, then as questions and problems arise.  I plan to explain the concept of capacitance and inductance far from the beginning, most likely when ‚Äúcombat‚Äù tasks will arise.  The same with alternating current.  Somewhere in the distant future there will be radio waves, still very soon. <br>  The general point is to get a tangible result as quickly as possible.  From the very beginning, I suggested that the children divide their work into two parts: each has its own small project + one common project, but more difficult.  He also marked an approximate time for them - until the New Year holidays.  I believe that we must immediately get used to the presence of a time frame, otherwise it would be amorphous to do something incomprehensible than the whole year without a visible result. <br>  Now I am more and more inclined to unite the guys of 2-3 people on one project and abandon the general project in general.  If it is too long to dig into the theory and do nothing with your hands, then the interest will disappear very quickly and the people will simply run away. <br>  As correctly suggested in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195340/">comments</a> , wherever possible, I try to explain the theory using the analogy of electrical circuits and plumbing.  This is a well-known and well-proven method. It is much easier for a student to imagine a pump and a damper than invisible charge carriers and, for example, a diode. <br>  The focus will be on digital electronics, and analog things will be discussed as needed.  Therefore, I will try to start working with the Arduino as early as possible: it is much easier and faster to get a working device, and besides, you can make and program at home.  Why I chose Arduino, I think, understandable.  If not, I will answer in the comments. <br>  Thanks to several good people who responded to the first post, I managed to gather up 7 Arduino boards, and I already distributed them to some students.  Yes, as long as they do not know which side to take it from, but some will have time to read something about it on their own. <br><br><h5>  Start </h5><br>  For the three classes we have so far had time, but the first lesson was introductory and exclusively for gathering information, distributing questionnaires and talking about a difficult school life.  On the second, we started by drawing a battery + light circuit.  For almost everyone, this turned out to be an absolute Chinese literacy and I had to talk about how the elements are displayed on the charts.  Then, not without difficulty, they made up a similar chain, but ‚Äúin terms of the aqueduct‚Äù.  And then I tried to explain that it was impossible to leave it that way, and I definitely need to add a resistor.  Here was a tense (for me) moment: half began to actively yawn, the other half just looked at the board with complete incomprehension.  Therefore, it was decided to immediately proceed to the demonstration performance, and I got out a layout with resistors and a LED.  First I explained what the mockup is and how the contacts are connected in it.  Then, with the help of ninth-graders, with a detailed discussion of everything that happens, they assembled the circuit and connected the power supply.  But it is clear that this experience is not one of the most spectacular) And then I managed to get their attention: I suggested burning the LED by removing the resistor from the circuit.  When the word "burn" in the eyes appear sparks, and mouths blur in a smile.  So we went and fried this unfortunate LED, and at the same time everyone was able to make sure that it is properly heated.  After this explanation about the current, the resistor and their relationship went much more fun and more productive: now at least I understand what I was talking about. <br>  The third lesson was similar to the second, and it began with a repetition and various questions on my part.  Again, with difficulty, but almost without my help, we were able to draw a simple scheme of three elements.  Again almost correctly drawn GDM all this.  And then I told that the resistors are different and that the light bulb will shine differently depending on this.  On the layout, they checked all this immediately, poking different resistors.  And then somehow, but still almost independently, they figured out what would happen if you turn them on in parallel.  GDM here helps a lot, and what's important - no formulas were required.  For some reason, there were difficulties with the sequential inclusion.  Well, not all at once) <br>  The most important thing was that they began to discuss their future projects.  At first, half wanted to make a kind of ‚Äúrobot‚Äù, but after my leading questions and conversations, the guys began to gradually descend from heaven to earth.  So, for now, this is what they came up with for themselves: <br>  - roboruka with clip <br>  - battery charging <br>  - the robot driving on a strip <br>  - automatic pencil sharpener <br>  - simple radio-controlled machine <br><br>  And the fourth lesson did not take place.  Instead, I offered to go to the <a href="http://robofob.ru/robosport/">championship of Russia in Robo-sumo</a> !  As it seemed to me, it will be interesting for them and will be able to motivate.  However, as a result, only three out of about ten people went, despite the fact that the competitions were held almost at the same time as the occupation.  Maybe the parents were not allowed (for the trip it is necessary to have permission from the parents, which they do not mind), and maybe they just decided not to bother and stay at home, I do not know yet.  Unfortunately, the parents also showed almost no interest, only the mother of one sixth-grader went. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/45c/5c8/76d/45c5c876da829167b2e346ab2503f7ba.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Robo-sumo competition </h5><br>  Perhaps someone will be interested in how we went to these competitions.  A few days before that, I agreed to meet there with several people who wanted to meet and exchange experiences.  We got to MIEM, the guys sat in the hall and began to watch the ring with the help of two projectors (Sumoist robots are rather small, and even at close range it is difficult to see everything that is happening there).  Of course, it‚Äôs very cool that there are such events that you can easily come to and look at the work of such enthusiastic people and their robots.  I met Vladimir, who offered help in running the circle.  He also met Alexey, who has been conducting similar classes for the second year, but only on the basis of the library.  It was also interesting to hear about how it all began and what was the program of classes. <br>  When there was a short break in the competition program, I noticed that on the distant tables something was actively blinking in all colors.  He invited the guys to look - it turned out that these were stands assembled on breadboard boards.  Instead of a thousand words - a <a href="http://sotvorimvmeste.ru/">link to the forum</a> .  When I climbed the net in the summer and studied everything on the topic of circles, I hung on this forum for a long time.  This is exactly what you need for beginners!  A detailed description of the prototyping board itself, the ways of connecting power, making and laying wires made from a cheap cable, and most importantly, detailed <a href="http://sotvorimvmeste.ru/viewforum.php%3Ff%3D9%26sid%3Db609e38847647ddc6db87320072df1ef">tasks</a> for using standard logic chips.  In addition, the forum has a lot of useful things, and in the summer I read it all.  So in the competitions in Robo-sumo, I met a wonderful person, the head of the electronics class at the MEPhI student design research bureau, Vasily Vasilyevich Zuykov.  Fully passionate about his work man, with whom you can talk for more than one hour.  In the same place, he gave our mug a set of classes for his program: a breadboard, wires, a battery pack, a set of 155 series logic, and even his unusual and <a href="http://sotvorimvmeste.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D39%26t%3D84">functional business card</a> .  The photo in the title of the post is made just at this stand.  In the meantime, I tried to tell the guys something about the design of these circuits and the components used to build them, but the attention of the listeners all the time switched to robots who were traveling around the stage) Nothing, soon they will collect something similar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cd1/b21/29d/cd1b2129db3f90c229a456523e29eff5.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://tabun.everypony.ru/blog/computers/76579.html">Here is a good report</a> on the competitions themselves. <br><br><h5>  Thanks </h5><br>  I want to tell separately about how stormy and positive the reaction was to the first post.  A great number of people wrote to me, and I apologize if I didn‚Äôt manage to answer everyone in time.  Several people from other schools were asked to attend classes (unfortunately, at the moment this is not possible). <br>  I talked on Skype with the same novice teacher from Astana, as well as another person who has 10 years of practice in such matters. <br>  Ruslan wrote, who then went up to the school and handed over a whole package with useful pieces of iron: a soldering iron, several LCD indicators, LEDs, motors, power supplies, Arduino boards, and even 2 sets of TI's LaunchPad.  I wrote to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/usasha/" class="user_link">uSasha</a> , with whom I also met and who gave the children a complete set of radio control equipment, as well as the wonderful <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120231/">Meggy Jr RGB</a> board and programming cable.  Posted by Anatoly, who sent a GSM modem and an FPGA evaluation board. <br>  Vladimir, about whom I have already mentioned, generally offered his help in conducting classes!  I hope that everything will work out. <br>  Posted by Dmitry, who organized the circle "Radio Engineering" in a.  Milkovo Kamchatka Krai.  He also told a lot of interesting things about his adventures: it‚Äôs very difficult to organize such a thing when there is 300 km to the regional center and there are no specialized shops.  It would be great if he shared his experience with everyone. <br>  I <a href="http://robotclass.ru/">got</a> acquainted with Ilya and Oleg, the organizers of the <a href="http://robotclass.ru/">RobotKlass</a> project - also a great undertaking!  I met with Vitaliy, who has a decent experience in teaching programming to schoolchildren. <br>  Several people offered financial assistance, for which many thanks to them. <br>  And I was also very pleased that not only the strong half of humanity is interested in the topic, but also the beautiful one.  Alena, hello to you) <br>  And finally, I have just returned from a meeting with Alexey, Kirill and Alexander, who have been teaching robotics for several years now and with whom I met at Robo-sumo.  The guys are full of ideas, they already have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the children need and how to bring it to them (this is programming, and electronics, and design).  I learned a lot of new things.  I really hope that such experience sharing meetings will now take place on an ongoing basis. <br><br>  Here are how many people in these two weeks!  The impression was that the topic of additional education was concerned with a very decent number of people, at least in Moscow.  It is a sociable, extremely friendly and young community, whose members help each other.  Hooray! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196490/</a></p>
