Making a good mobile app is more difficult.  Creating a product from a mobile application is a more serious task.  In the article I want to share some observations on how to achieve this. <br><br>  Go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Feedback </h4><br>  The presence of user feedback indicates that someone is interested in your product.  In the case of a mobile application, feedback can be called a review or rating in the app store, a comment on your website or an email with wishes and (more often) criticism. <br><br>  For mobile applications, it is fair to say that people tend to post negative evaluations and reviews more often than write complimentary comments.  This is normal, although for many newbies this is very daunting.

      <i>The situation with negative reviews is very similar to the work of Habr: no matter how ingenious the article, anyway, some group of readers will put a minus (at best), or write that article XXX is nonsense, and the author is an incompetent freak.</i> <br><br>  In general, the essence is simple: provide users with the easiest way to send you feedback.  This may be the usual "send feedback" button;  A pop-up window, say, once a week, which asks you to write a few lines, etc.  The main thing is that the <i>desire to</i> receive feedback does not grow into a <i>requirement</i> for your users. <br><br>  And yes, all emails need to be answered :-) <br><br><h4>  You need to know what is happening with your application (and not only) </h4><br>  After the application is published in the store, many developers no longer take an active interest in what happens there, limiting themselves to a brief glance of the number of copies sold once a week. <br><br>  In fact, you need to keep track of all available information - the number of downloads, the average time spent working with the application, the geography of users, etc.  For these purposes, there are a large number of analytical tools that allow you to always keep your finger on the pulse. <br><br>  Statistics itself does not matter much, but it can help to answer such important questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How did the update of the application affect the rating and the number of downloads? </li><li>  How has the average usage time of applications changed? </li><li>  The download and purchase curve is growing, falling, stable, and for how long does it already last? </li><li>  How do bugs, promo, weather conditions and marketing activities affect the purchase / download of the application? </li></ul><br>  And in the context of comparing your application with the best (top apps) and similar (competitors) apps you can get answers to the following questions: <br><br><ul><li>  what applications are most often put in promo? </li><li>  What parameters (design, work speed, brand) most of all influence popularity? </li><li>  What are the average statistics for similar applications? </li></ul><br><h4>  The focus is not on functionality, but on convenience. </h4><br>  Of course, the application must perform some functionality.  But really popular are those applications that enable the user not only to solve the problem, but also to make it convenient. <br><br>  When developing our applications for each request for new functionality, we have a question: how to implement it so that the user is comfortable? <br><br>  There are some simple tips: <br><br><ul><li>  page nesting - as little as possible; </li><li>  the number of clicks (actions) for any scenario is no more than four or five (kill feature is no more than two or three); </li><li>  emphasis on content, not design; </li><li>  less is better, but faster than more, but longer (this applies to downloading content). </li></ul><br><h4>  Do not let users decide for you </h4><br>  Remember, the first advice was to listen to feedback.  So, to listen - does not mean blindly perform. <br><br>  The main principle of a mobile application is to do one thing, but better than anyone.  Leave multi-tasking and multi-windowing to desktop clients. <br><br>  Take for example Photoshop.  Practice shows that the average user needs 3-5% of the functionality of a full-featured Photoshop.  Therefore, <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a> for desktop and <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s%3FappId%3Deff2feae-cef3-42be-8bfc-f0d62b1d814e">Lomogram</a> for Windows Phone should be enough for the average user. <br><br><h4>  Talk to users in their own language </h4><br>  In simple terms, localize your applications.  If the application is more or less popular, there will probably be volunteers who will want to help you translate the application.  If there are no such volunteers - do not hesitate to ask about it on the website or in the application itself. <br><br>  And yet, do not localize the application using google translate.  It is better in any way than with him. <br><br><h4>  Think like a user, not a developer </h4><br>  ‚ÄúAnd let's turn on push notifications for the application‚Äú Non-boring wallpapers ‚Äù, integrate the application with all social networks, add geolocation and dating!  After all, this is functional and cool, and the user will surely appreciate the new feature of the mobile SDK! ‚Äù- so many application creators think. <br><br>  In fact, the end user doesn‚Äôt care deeply about the new SDKs, push notifications, or the super-mega-shader, if these ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù do not fit into the usual scenarios. <br><br><blockquote>  Write the code as if it would be accompanied by a violent psychopath who knows where you live. </blockquote><br>  I would say this: when developing your mobile application, be guided by users who understand mobile phones and software like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2e/c92/4c8/b2ec924c89f44f9250464be0746c3f60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162251/</a></p>
