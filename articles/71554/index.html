This is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  What is vending? <br></h4><br>  Vending is, literally, selling goods without a seller. <br><br>  Coffee vending machines, payment terminals and condom sales terminals are all vending. <br><br>  Vending machine is a misanthropic dream and a panacea for poor service, which is especially important in our harsh latitudes. <br><br>  However, in this article I would like to tell not about the advantages of vending machines - good, almost all of us are constantly confronted with them, but about how <s>to become the ruler of non-human robots to</s> organize our own vending business. <br><br><h4>  How to start your vending business. </h4><br>  So, you have decided that a vending machine is a good option for additional (and maybe even basic) earnings.  In this case, the procedure is as follows: <br><br>  1. you decide on the product your automaton will trade in, write a business plan where you designate your goals, prescribe expenses and expected incomes (even if you decide to start working alone, in self-discipline it will not be superfluous); <br><br>  2. register the PI. <br><br><h4>  How to register IP. </h4><br>  The question is relevant, regardless of whether you are going to start your vending machine or not, therefore I will set out below a brief educational program. <br><br>  The main thing that needs to be learned is that there is nothing complicated or frightening about it; registering your business yourself is quite simple and cheap.  Issue price - 300 rubles of state duty and 500-1000 rubles for notary services. <br>  So, come to the tax and get your hands on a questionnaire that you need to fill out and notarize and a notary and a receipt for the payment of state duty - 300 rubles. <br><br><blockquote>  Vending under the All-Russian Classifier of Types of Economic Activity (OKVED) is number 52.63 - other retail trade outside stores.  However, if you are not sure of your choice, then you can see <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D77392">what other</a> economic activities in this classifier are available: very informative reading. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Then you certify the questionnaire with any notary (depending on their <s>greed for</s> geographic location relative to the Moscow Ring Road, it will cost 500-1000 rubles), after which you take it to tax and after five more days you take your certificates. <br><br>  And two more actions that should be done without departing from the cash register when obtaining certificates: write an application to transfer you to the simplified taxation system (STS) and request an extract from the Unified State Register of Individual Entrepreneurs. <br><br>  The simplified tax system, as the name implies, makes life easier: paying a number of taxes ‚Äî on profits, VAT, on sales, on property of organizations, and Unified Social Tax ‚Äî are replaced by paying a single tax, calculated on the basis of business results for the tax period.  Permission to go to the "simplified" will come to you by mail within 10 days. <br><br>  As for the statement, you will need it when opening a bank account - which is desirable, since it is unlikely that you will be able to work with legal entities with legal entities.  The statement will be ready in five business days. <br><br>  Total, the price of opening your own business is about 1000 rubles and three trips to the tax, not including the notary and the bank. <br><br>  In my opinion, it does not look very scary.  And if you guess with time to visit the tax, then the special queues can be avoided. <br><br>  3. In parallel with the decision of legal formalities, you need to deal with the main issue: the choice of the location of the machine.  It‚Äôs impossible to place an automatic machine for free - the usual scheme of work is 10% of turnover or a fixed rate of 3-4 thousand rubles per month. <br><br>  However, you can try to put the machine in your office, agreeing with the boss (if you yourself are the boss, then life becomes even easier).  Put in your office a coffee machine or hand-washing machine (ask your colleagues what they need).  Let the vending machine work for you while you work for the company. <br><br>  4. Choose the machine itself. <br><br>  The cost of coffee machines - 100-200 thousand rubles, depending on the manufacturer, the amount of loading and options. <br>  The cost of snack machines - 100-150 thousand. <br><br>  The space for saving is unlimited - for example, you can buy a used car (but, in order not to ‚Äúfall‚Äù, it is advisable - still working at the outlet). <br><br>  It takes quite a bit of time machine - depending on the type of machine and sales, you need to visit it once every 3 days or daily, if it is, for example, a machine for selling freshly squeezed juices.  Vending machines selling snacks can be visited once a week. <br><br>  Giant tomagochi, which, if you take care of him, also brings money. <br><br>  However, you can not even bother with such concerns and hire an operator who will take care of maintaining your machine. <br><br><blockquote>  Statistics of vending returns, according to <a href="http://veq.ru/">veq.ru</a> , is as <a href="http://veq.ru/catalog/azy-vending/doc/309/">follows</a> : <br><br>  The purchase of ingredients will take about a quarter of your revenue.  Of the remaining amounts, you will have to pay salaries (if you hire another operator), rent a place and incur other expenses (for example, repair of an automatic machine). <br>  The average payback period of the vending machine is 16-18 months <br>  The average revenue from one vending machine is 11.6 thousand rubles per month <br>  <b>Profitability of the business of the vending operator - 29%</b> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Blog them.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andorro/" class="user_link">Andorro</a> and the portal " <a href="http://veq.ru/">Century Vending</a> ", especially for Habrahabr. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> A small clarification.  These publications are a joint project of my blog and the portal <a href="http://veq.ru/">veq.ru.</a>  We are not vending operators, manufacturers of vending machines or components for them, and we do not have the task of luring, engaging, turning, unwinding, etc. <br><br>  Our task is to tell about what is vending and help those who are interested in this topic and decide to become a vending operator.  Therefore, in the future we will definitely answer all the questions that have arisen, and we will pay special attention to critical comments, observations and objections. <br><br>  Thanks for the comments, stay tuned to ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/">My Business</a> ‚Äù or their blog.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andorro/" class="user_link">Andorro</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> The second material was released: " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/72750/">How to make money on the vending machine: legislation</a> ." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71554/</a></p>
