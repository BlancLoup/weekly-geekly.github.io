This post is my attempt to follow the cooled off tracks of the ‚Äústriped elephant‚Äù from the popular cartoon and finally describe my impressions of the most recent, the most flagship and simply the very communicator Samsung Galaxy S III.  Now I‚Äôve got enough of this new gadget, the variety of emotions diminished and the time to share my impressions has finally come. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c5/27d/8b4/3c527d8b4b33323c51a9f95f8db24dac.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Acquaintance with the device began very simply and ordinary.  About three weeks ago I had a long trip planned and it turned out that the Samsung Galaxy S III unexpectedly went with me, which left its mark on the whole review, making it more ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù than it could be.  At the time of the start, I had one of the communicators with a robot on the logo for quite a long time, so I was mainly interested in how much cooler and more interesting the novelty would be.  In connection with the trip I was at first very limited, so for some time the device was used as a normal communicator, from which only the necessary calls were made and the music was sometimes heard.  In the future, the communicator functionality was successfully mastered, which resulted in this material, the purpose of which is set to tell first of all about the personal impressions of this device.  But first things first. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/94f/f0f/1c694ff0fe902ef47689a7e772104cc7.jpg"><br><br>  The communicator comes in a small white cardboard box.  The name is printed on top of the box, on the bottom side there is a short listing of the technical characteristics of the device.  The manufacturer uses vegetable paints and water-based glue, which is very proud.  Both sides of the box are lined with stickers on one imei number, the second is just a seal.  Subjectively - the box looks nice, classic colors cannot look bad. <br>  Inside the box, the space is divided into compartments with black pieces of paper; in the top, the apparatus itself is covered with films on all sides.

All elements of the kit are made with high quality, and look pretty nice.  The bundled headset has three control buttons that allow you to answer the call and change the volume level (for example).  The length of the wire from the headphones is enough to easily put the phone in your trouser pocket or purse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fff/7e7/142/fff7e71427e29837cd415036e875b523.jpg"><br><br>  But this is not all, at the lowest level a battery is hidden, which you can not immediately notice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f87/84d/8e4/f8784d8e4f3df6e8555862fb15bbbcfb.jpg"><br><br>  The main technical characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy S III are as follows: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Samsung Exynos 4412 Quad, 1.4 GHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Video accelerator </td><td>  Mali 400 </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  1024MB </td></tr><tr><td>  Flash memory </td><td>  16/32 / 64GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Networking support </td><td>  GSM, HSPA + 21, DGE / GPRS (850/900/1800/1900 MHz), HSPA + 21 (850/900/1900/2100) <br>  Wi-Fi (a / b / g / n), Wi-Fi Direct. <br>  Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  NFC </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  Removable, 2100MAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  sAMOLED 720x1280, 4.8 inches. </td></tr><tr><td>  Connectors </td><td> Micro SIM, Micro SD (support memory cards up to 64GB), Micro USB (support MHL), Jack 3.5 mm. </td></tr><tr><td>  Camera </td><td>  The main 8MP (autofocus, flash), front 1.9Mpix. </td></tr><tr><td>  Positioning and sensors </td><td>  GPS (A-GPS), GLONASS, Accelerometer, compass, gyroscope, light sensor, barometer </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions and weight </td><td>  70.6 x 136.6 x 8.6mm, 133g. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  It's all good, Samsung Galaxy S III is packed what is called ‚Äúin full‚Äù.  It is time to twist the device in hand and write what will come of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c5/27d/8b4/3c527d8b4b33323c51a9f95f8db24dac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/147/21b/209/14721b209172879816474aaa35a4ee65.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec9/fcb/a59/ec9fcba592e5fdea1e764623a561cace.jpg"><br><br>  Sam Samsung Galaxy S III, to be honest, did not impress me with some revelations in terms of design.  Looking at him I want to say ‚Äúnice‚Äù, and that's all.  The body is completely plastic, the side panels ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù are also plastic snag.  Rear panel no frills: camera eye, ‚Äùflash‚Äù LED, speaker, logo.  In a word - a standard set.  The battery compartment cover is scary thin, simply because it is scary to open it for the first time - it bends very strongly and plays.  According to first impressions, there is nothing special in appearance, it is impossible to cling to some kind of "trick" of designers. <br><br>  On the other hand, when you start using the Samsung Galaxy S III comes the understanding that most of the front panel is occupied by the screen, and not its frame, the function buttons are made conveniently and are just under the fingers, the case is quite thin, without bumps under the camera or battery.  He took in his hand and "like a native."  The very first tactile impression is ‚ÄúVery slippery‚Äù and ‚Äúvery plastic‚Äù.  Due to the use of a shiny plastic case, the device slips in the palm of your hand and instantly zakaltsovyvatsya.  But a slippery screen cover is a definite plus, especially if you want to play something with touch controls.  The progress of the hardware buttons is soft, with a pronounced click.  In the course of using the Samsung Galaxy S III, the hardware switch-on button was spontaneously pressed a couple of times when the phone was in the pocket of jeans.  It's okay, but I would like a little more tight button.  As for the size of the Samsung Galaxy S III, quite a few copies have already been broken, for some people it is too big, for someone it is good.  I will say for myself - just right, it would be a little more, it would be even better. <br><br>  Turning on the device and quickly clicking through all the main issues, we get to the main menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64a/0f6/03b/64a0f603b3ff1916aaa8c075c409b947.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fdc/e5a/16f/fdce5a16f9c5cd2c9c50e8570cb1b79d.png"><br><br>  After gray adjustment screens, the menu looks very bright, attractive and a little ‚Äúrough‚Äù.  The last is the pen-tile display matrix, but after a short time, irregularities along the edges of the text and display objects stop noticing and everything falls into place, no discomfort.  On the contrary - viewing angles, brightness and contrast of the display are simply amazing.  In the minuses it is worth recording the blindness of the screen in direct sunlight, the information becomes difficult to see, especially if the brightness is set to low.  The scroll between the screens is carried out smoothly and without unpleasant brakes and twitches. <br><br>  On the screens themselves, nothing unexpected, the standard, according to Samsung, widgets are deployed, which are first replaced with their own, beloved ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4c/bc6/b3f/d4cbc6b3f369558fd60fd28f64034c77.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7f/bbe/6c4/f7fbbe6c419152b3c78e4c85ee2f891c.png"><br><br>  The Samsung Galaxy S III is preinstalled with the main set of everyday widgets, from which you can choose something you need.  In my case, Yandex weather was useful, Yandex traffic jams and a flashlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b22/fb0/3ea/b22fb03eade12ffc99f2b7237a8e15a8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10a/e67/6ba/10ae676ba3c305ec13ea72665affec7a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b22/fb0/3ea/b22fb03eade12ffc99f2b7237a8e15a8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a7/ecf/d78/2a7ecfd78c4a5f409909a0d37cfb9532.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f7/987/dda/8f7987dda24e7e873ab5b771a25c5cef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03d/7c6/d86/03d7c6d8630f2f7afd1fe9488246c8a8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39f/8dd/1ad/39f8dd1ad2ad4cae0ededb0633aa53f4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b8/cb5/b2c/6b8cb5b2cc20903a6ac05d2ce7c29782.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3f/5f6/14c/d3f5f614cc4d8a22aa09b190cbc1b4df.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bd/d3b/2f4/8bdd3b2f43a3b82c95c4459d70469db3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dab/5d0/da6/dab5d0da6ddb6606ab453f2ba3e12c8c.png"><br><br>  The lock screen can be configured to touch, use a pattern, enter a password, or recognize a face.  The last function is the most interesting, but, as practice has shown, it works only under normal lighting, and sometimes it is mistaken there.  The only noticed glitch is connected with it - when exiting from the sleep mode, the front camera does not always turn on, while the display shows a black rectangle instead of the face recognition area.  Re-blocking and removing the block solves the problem, but the unpleasant aftertaste remains.  If it is impossible to identify a person, you need to enter a pre-configured pattern key to unlock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/016/4fc/b3a/0164fcb3a6298b6cf0e59ff7f33b7252.png"><br><br>  From the pre-installed software, it is worth noting S Voice and Dropbox, the first one allows controlling the device with voice, the second one - to store up to 50GB of its files in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù.  Both, of course, require an Internet connection when working. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ada/17f/085/ada17f085bc07d2a66836ded00c42ec7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10a/e67/6ba/10ae676ba3c305ec13ea72665affec7a.png"><br><br>  Since the Samsung Galaxy S III traveled with me on a trip, the possibilities of satellite navigation with it were in demand in the first place.  It was hoped that the communicator would confidently and quickly search for satellites, providing reliable positioning.  Alas.  The first disappointment appeared already at the beginning of the journey, when Galaxy, outright lost by the time of a cold search for satellites to an unpretentious autonavigator.  At the same time, the search process was finally completed - the device had to be placed directly under the windshield.  In defense of the Samsung Galaxy S III, it‚Äôs worthwhile to say that the data transmission was turned off, respectively, A-GPS was not active.  With further use, navigation worked flawlessly, satellites, on average, looked for about a minute. <br><br>  The second most important point was the ease of use of the Samsung Galaxy S III for surfing sites.  With this, everything is in full openwork.  The built-in browser works smoothly, the desire to change to third-party did not arise.  A large high-resolution display allows you to read most sites without constant ‚Äútweaks‚Äù and dragging to increase text size, which greatly improves viewing comfort.  In general, what is necessary. <br><br>  Slightly less relevant for me was the duration of video playback, the convenience of the player and its omnivorous.  Here, too, joy and happiness, the built-in player ‚Äúeats the matryoshka‚Äù (sounds crazy, but this is just * .mkv format) and other main formats without any special problems.  For lovers of the strange - a tiny window with the current video, you can pull it into the main menu and drag across the screen, doing some actions along the way, for example typing SMS or note in notebook.  A full charge of the battery lasted for 9.5 hours of continuous playback of the test (1280x720 / MKV / H.264 / 2500Kbps) video at 100% screen brightness and the volume of external speakers set at 50%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f47/0d1/4c7/f470d14c7548415ad6f9217b73f57fa7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de4/659/684/de4659684c65921509873fce1f260e11.png"><br><br>  Speaking of sound.  The external speaker plays loudly and without wheezing, the quality of sound reproduction through the voice speaker also causes no complaints.  Volume reserve is sufficient.  You can also talk or listen to music through the headset with comfort, there is nothing to complain about. <br>  You can play on the Samsung Galaxy S III with relative comfort.  This is one of the few devices in which the touch circle for controlling the movement of a character does not cause me disgust and inconvenience.  A toy Tank Hero: Laser Wars, randomly picked up in the market, was passed in one breath and without much effort. <br><br>  The autonomy of the Samsung Galaxy S III depends on the mode in which it is used.  It so happened that for about a week I managed to talk about him for about 15-20 minutes a day and send several messages through social networks (Wi-fi) or via SMS.  In this mode, the Samsung Galaxy S III lasted 4 days.  So if you plan to use the device for some time as a regular phone, for calls, sms and rare network connections - the work time will not disappoint.  With intensive use, the battery will last for a day of use and something else will be left to reach the charge. <br><br>  Camera.  Not bad.  In terms of photo quality, the Samsung Galaxy S III camera can be comparable to digital cameras up to $ 100.  In good weather, you will get good shots.  With the quality of the video, too, everything is normal, to make a movie, which then will not be ashamed to show to friends, it will turn out easily and naturally. <br><br>  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/326/c4c/b64/326c4cb643b4902962bd2ee92671309b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c1/c98/b0a/8c1c98b0a4d4e50fc86e8f93f593eb5d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/058/00b/7b0/05800b7b00bd0c6d296ae7eb334007fe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76b/1b8/c61/76b1b8c6196db63f507a038256e4cf51.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bce/a06/755/bcea06755c63e1f5849fcf8d2d8dfad1.png"><br><br>  Video: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3f/2c3/620/f3f2c3620f28393a238d6742375dd0c9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ba/1d3/7d2/2ba1d37d2bd26ef2b6288fe9609faa31.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e54/056/3b5/e540563b5c53abc724f20c2b30804358.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e34/56a/9c3/e3456a9c319166f24d79f15c23bd7ced.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e34/56a/9c3/e3456a9c319166f24d79f15c23bd7ced.png"><br><br>  Photo examples: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/177/7ad/c06/1777adc0657b60411eb1a62264f76369.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f86/8d5/d86/f868d5d8667853e196759e921bf94d2e.jpg"><br><br>  Having played enough and mastered the device, I wanted to find out how fast the Samsung Galaxy S III is in synthetic tests.  The following tests were installed for verification: <b>Smartbench 2012</b> , <b>Quadrant Standard</b> , <b>AnTuTu Benchmark</b> .  The results do not disappoint, Samsung Galaxy S III is the top, by the current moment, product performance. <br><br>  <b>Smartbench 2012</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69d/a61/521/69da615211785fd0ca3fa5f3c92beb53.png"><br><br>  <b>Quadrant standard</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ef/31b/73d/3ef31b73d488e489e689738b213e6661.png"><br><br>  <b>AnTuTu Benchmark</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc0/212/db0/dc0212db0b4bb2abeb485fd77331f718.png"><br><br>  Dry residue: <br><br>  Samsung Galaxy S III is a communicator primarily for those who need everything and a little more.  If you are going to use it as the center of your mobile life, lie down and wake up with a mobile phone in your pocket - it will suit you perfectly.  You will have the opportunity to play the latest games without brakes, communicate through a bunch of social networks and instant messengers, use voice control and cloud technologies, and most importantly do it all with comfort, quickly and as you like.  With it, you can make good photos, take your favorite movies and music with you without bothering in most cases with a compression format supported.  For such opportunities, he can be forgiven as a modest design and materials of the case, as well as some software flaws.  Pluses here with a margin overlap cons.  However, if you already have a good communicator and you are happy with it, then it is unlikely that SGS III will make some kind of revolution in your mobile lifestyle, most of the improvements are evolutionary in nature and do not cause a wow effect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147409/</a></p>
