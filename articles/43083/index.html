  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet users discuss the second entry in the video blog of the president</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Thursday, the second blog post appeared in Dmitry Medvedev's video blog.  In it, the president describes his vision of the situation in connection with the global financial crisis and talks about new ways of communicating with the authorities. <br>  ‚ÄúI would like to talk about what the whole world is worrying about - the global financial crisis. Most countries have been faced with the fact that blunders - mistakes made by a number of states (and above all America) - have led to serious problems. The financial market and its impact on the global economy are very high. Therefore, the crisis that occurred in the United States ricocheted into the economy of almost all countries, "said the president in his opening remarks. <br>  Further, Medvedev spoke about the impact of the crisis on the situation in Russia and expressed the hope that our country would be able to avoid a "heavy circulation".  The foreign exchange reserves and the stabilization fund, which "were created specifically for such difficult periods," should help. <br>  The president also noted that during a crisis it is important not only to defend oneself from problems, but also ‚Äúto make the most of the opportunities that arise.  Dmitry Medvedev hopes that the formation of competitive companies will begin, financial institutions will begin to work more efficiently, and Russian companies will reduce production costs.  The president also recalled about "areas where we acted too slowly: it concerns education and health, judicial reform, technical regulation, the transition to" digital "- to digital technology."  Speaking about foreign policy issues, Medvedev noted the need "to develop new rules of the game in the global economy."  He proposes creating more financial centers, reserve currencies and collective decision-making mechanisms. " <a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the end of the video, the head of state spoke about the plans for the development of the video blog and thanked Internet users for the numerous responses about the first recording and ‚Äúthe desire to discuss issues important for our entire society with interest and responsibility.‚Äù In the future, Medvedev promises to ‚Äúdevelop interactive‚Äù and asserts the seriousness of the approach. to communicate with Internet users.  But everyone has already got the communication tools: ‚ÄúYou can write to me right now - and do it through the website,‚Äù Medvedev concludes his second entry. <br>  The record of the president, although it appeared in the evening, but immediately became a subject of discussion.  For example, users of the IT-oriented website habrahabr.ru were among the first to discuss the second presidential post on the blog. <br>  User DileSoft writes: "Today, more than two weeks after his first entry in the video blog, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev finally made the second issue. He described the situation in the country due to the financial crisis."  Further, the opportunity to write a letter to the president is noted - habr-users have already tried this opportunity and asked the head of state about "huge humanoid robots".  Under the link to the record, you can see the answer received by the user to the "joke" question.  But not everyone appreciated the joke - some users noted that state officials should not be distracted from work and that there are more important issues requiring the reaction of the authorities. <br>  The recording ends with a question about a picture on the president‚Äôs desktop and an interest in Medvedev‚Äôs technical preferences: <br>  ‚ÄúWhat else is interesting: this time we were not shown the president‚Äôs monitor, so we won‚Äôt find out if he changed the wallpaper from Yandex. Pictures. But now you can see that Medvedev uses a black MacBook.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://liberty.ru/events/Pol-zovateli-interneta-obsuzhdayut-vtoruyu-zapis-v-videobloge-prezidenta">liberty.ru/events/Pol-zovateli-interneta-obsuzhdayut-vtoruyu-zapis-v-videobloge-prezidenta</a> <br></div>
