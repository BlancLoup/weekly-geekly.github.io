  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bike about life-giving machine intelligence, or who is to blame for the domination of viruses?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the dogon to the old post about DDOS and Internet Gopnik (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/68131/) and also to the recent about the terrible Russian legislation (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it-politics/ 71317 /), I propose to play the following hypothetical situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Those who are too lazy to read the sheet about ‚Äúhypothetical situations‚Äù can immediately jump to conclusions. <br><br>  =================================== <br>  Suppose that the unprincipled owner of an online store, Ivanov, decided to enter into an unfair fight with competitors.  For this, he ordered the corrupt programmer Petrov a virus.  This virus does not do anything bad to the user personally, but makes bogus purchases from Ivanov‚Äôs competitors every month.  Competitors bring "goods" to the house at home, and they say: "Mistakes, someone played you.  I did not buy anything. ‚Äù <br><br>  Competitors, of course, suffer losses.  They now have to necessarily require the indication of a phone number, and call each customer.  There are delays in delivery - after all, without calling the buyer, you can not send the car to the warehouse.  Ivanov‚Äôs shop, at the same prices, is notable for its simplicity and speed of work, since Ivanov finds few live ‚Äújokers‚Äù (thanks to the coordinated work of the ‚ÄúK‚Äù department) and demands compensation for damage from them. 
      <br>

      <br>
      And who will find the department "K" competitors Ivanov?  Marivanna, a circus cashier, who put the infected solitaire on the work computer.  Well, what's her demand?  - Online store, speak?  Right on the Internet?  What internet?  And this is that Yandex ... No, I did not buy anything on Wednesday at 15:15.  In general, I was in the smoking room then - there was a full cell witnesses. <br><br>  Suppose now that through Marivanna, the ‚ÄúK‚Äù department went out to Ivanov and Petrov (yes, I know that I am taking bread from Andersen and Hoffmann).  Ivanov, by the way, is likely to be otmazhtsya - I supposedly ordered not a virus, but a marketing web two-zero solution, and I don‚Äôt distinguish viral nature from viral advertising.  I do not have a technical education ... But Petrov is waiting for the bunks for illegal entry into other people's computing systems. <br><br>  Will the arrest of Petrov lead to the fact that he no longer ‚Äúillegally penetrate‚Äù into users' computers?  No, it will not - the virus as it was walking on the Internet, and will walk.  It turns out that from the point of view of legislation, Petrov reincarnated into a malicious machine mind, walking on the net separately from the body of Peter.  That's interesting, and if, while Petrov is already sitting, his virus will destroy the data in the FSB network, will Petrov be given a deadline?  New crime after all, relapse! <br>  =================================== <br><br>  What am I talking about?  But what about: <br><br>  1. To judge and plant virus writers for the fact that they write a virus is illogical and useless.  This is the same as judging Dontsov for the preparation of domestic murders. <br><br>  2. It is also silly to judge hackers for writing hacking algorithms.  ‚ÄúA program intended for committing unlawful acts‚Äù is written most often not at all for committing these very actions, but for putting it on its website and getting plus signs in karma or their analogues. <br><br>  3. If you continue to allow users to renounce justice with the spell ‚ÄúI did not know that I have a virus on my computer‚Äù, then in the future such irresponsibility will result in total control.  The requirement to install a ‚ÄúChinese firewall‚Äù or its analogue on each computer will be legally approved. <br><br>  4. With users whose computers make up a botnet, one has to act as with users of torrents.  The first time is a warning, the second is disconnection from the Internet for a year.  Dixi. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71305/</a></p>
