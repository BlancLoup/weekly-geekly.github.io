  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia 101 Review - Flashlight with Player and $ 35 Phone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently needed a phone.  It is the phone, without the Internet, heaped iron and software parts.  To be able to call, do without charging at least a week and, most importantly, inexpensive.  Armed with a small amount of money, I went to the store, where my eyes fell among this apparatus.  Having felt it a little, I decided to buy it.  Under the impression of a three-month use of this technological device, made our brothers <s>smaller</s> Indians. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Specifications </h1><br>  So: <br><ul><li>  Screen: 3.7 " </li><li>  5 megapixel camera, flash, autofocus </li><li>  Support Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, 3G, GPS </li><li>  WAP, GPRS, EDGE support </li><li>  Mms </li></ul><br>  This is a complete list of all functions that are not in this phone.  But the manufacturer decided to compensate for the lack of all this with the following functionality: <br><ul><li>  LED flashlight (1 super bright LED, 56 lumens) </li><li>  MP3 player (playing MP3 audio files in bitrates from 32 kb / s to 320 kb / s) </li><li>  Support microSD memory cards up to 16GB </li><li>  FM radio range </li><li>  Undocumented ability to use as inertial driving tool </li><li>  <s>Opener and lighter</s> </li><li>  Phone with support for 2 sim cards </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Appearance </h1><br>  The phone has the appearance of a typical small plastic bar with a keyboard and various technological openings.  In an attempt to informally exert forces on the torsion of the case, he bravely holds on, only crushing with displeasure the battery cover.  This cover is worth mentioning separately.  After buying a new phone, when you try to get to its insides, you will most likely fail, because  the cap sits very tightly.  Personally, this process took me about 15 minutes, of which the first 10 minutes were spent trying to open it with my hands and 5 minutes to find a screwdriver.  That, on the other hand, cannot but rejoice, in the event of a fall, the phone will not scatter its innards into the surrounding space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e27/86e/097/e2786e097ff9ce41d26c3e2c70cd2cd7.png">

    <h1>  Torch </h1><br>  Nokia engineers faced a serious task of balancing the light-emitting diode light-emitting diode power consumption.  Fortunately, they managed to find the most optimal option: the flashlight is quite pleasant to use, and this is not a critical impact on the autonomous operation time of the device as a whole.  At night, his luminosity is enough to illuminate a section of space in front of him at a distance of up to 5 meters, on the subject of various obstacles and unexpected indentations.  Fully charging the battery lasts for about 19 hours of continuous photon radiation, together with the standby mode of the GSM module for one sim card. <br><br><h1>  Player </h1><br>  The player can play only audio files in MP3 format and only from a microSD card (since there is no internal memory).  The sound quality is still quite mediocre, even the missing equalizer does not save the situation, on a 12-point scale I rated it to 4 points.  From the pros: can play music in the background;  of the minuses: no rewind. <br>  Standard headphones - sucks, and can only be used as a headset or antenna for the radio (or for the "accidental" murder of audiophiles). <br><br><h1>  Phone </h1><br>  Two sim cards at the same time can only be used in standby mode.  When one of them is active, the second one is turned off, i.e.  talking on one SIM card, take the call to the second does not work.  Signal reception is pretty sure: I did not observe a signal loss in either urban setting or outside the city.  Although, especially for the test, I did not try to hide from the BS. <br><br><h1>  Autonomy </h1><br>  To check the survivability of the apparatus, the following tests were performed: <br><ul><li>  Lying mode with one sim card - 20 days </li><li>  Regular mode, 30 minutes of calls per day - 7-9 days </li><li>  Media Center mode, continuous music playback at maximum volume with a headset connected - 27 hours </li><li>  Light music mode, previous version + flashlight on - 16 hours. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Strength </h1><br>  The following strength tests were performed under actual use conditions: <br><ul><li>  Drop from a height of 1.5 meters onto a hard surface - 7 pieces </li><li>  Drop from a height of 3 meters - 1 piece </li><li>  Immersion in water for 20 seconds, followed by drying - 1 piece </li><li>  Dip and instillation into sand followed by cleaning - 1 piece </li></ul><br>  All tests were successfully completed, no serious damage was received.  The appearance is a bit spoiled - small scratches remain on the case after falling on hard surfaces. <br><br><h1>  Minuses </h1><br>  In the first models there was a problem with the firmware, which was treated by upgrading to a newer version.  But there may be a problem that the service center will be denied a flashing.  The only way out in this situation is to return or exchange for a new one within 14 days from the date of purchase.  Also, some models - a frank marriage, which refuses to work in a month or two. <br><br><h1>  To take or not to take? </h1><br>  In the commentary led models of the same price range and superior in parameters.  Judging by the reviews on various forums, the purchase of this phone is some lottery. <br><br>  <i>Next to the younger brother:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/365/75b/27c/36575b27c9464e502ae67cabfd21c4f4.png"><br><br>  <i>In full growth:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/467/9a4/3dc/4679a43dc44f356d734e9feffc5fdddd.png"><br><br>  <i>In the semi-open state:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efc/ea2/ef2/efcea2ef2fe3f38a448a622175f0db13.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148902/</a></p>
