  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4G networks affect 75% of GPS receivers: backstage wars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  American company LightSquared Inc.  in July 2010, it announced its intention to build a 4G mobile network in the US, which should have cost $ 17 billion, with the intention of leasing network facilities to existing mobile operators.  Given the wide penetration of broadband Internet access in the state, many then spoke of the company's bold plans and its contribution to the innovative future of America. <br><br>  However, there were people at the US Department of Defense, as well as at the US Department of Transportation, who had bothered to study the effects of 4G networks on existing wireless communications and technologies.  In April of this year, the Federal Communications Commission received an official request from the indicated ministries, in which it was proposed to consider the possibility of influencing the radiation of the future 4G network on the GPS equipment at the disposal of the population. <br><br>  According to the still unpublished results of the study, which fell into the hands of Bloomberg, it turned out that "... millions of GPS receivers are not compatible with the planned national 4G wireless network. The network radiation has harmful interference on most tested GPS receivers, and no additional research to confirm this fact is not required. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Curious is the following circumstance: Reston, a Virginia-based company, also offers high-speed mobile Internet to a potential audience of 260 million people, using almost 40,000 base stations, and its network operates at frequencies, most of which are reserved for global positioning satellites, but the company has no such problems.

      At the same time, LightSquared Inc., working on Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners' hedge fund money, faced indirect pressure from manufacturers of GPS equipment (there is a <a href="http://www.saveourgps.org/">GPS Rescue Coalition</a> ), which claim that 4G network radiation will literally wreak havoc among positioning system consumers, leading to the fact that automobile and / or aviation navigation will be in great danger due to incorrect or incorrect operation of GPS receivers. <br><br>  Thus, it can be concluded that the introduction of even the most advanced technologies on a wide market is not always a question of technological solution only, but also the issue of overcoming a multitude of business problems associated with the possibility of competition.  And the saddest thing here is that it‚Äôs not completely clear whether the signal of 4G stations influences GPS receivers or is it just a matter of squeezing a potential competitor from the market using the highest level lobby? <br><br>  [ <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-12/falcone-s-lightsquared-said-to-disrupt-75-of-gps-in-u-s-tests.html">Source</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134482/</a></p>
