The picture shows the device of the Chinese manufacturer <a href="http://www.e28.com/">E28</a> , which, according to the website The india street, will become the manufacturer of the hardware part of the phone from Google.  Earlier there were rumors that Google will create its phone based on the devices of the Taiwanese company HTC or Korean Samsung or LG. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In fact, the choice of the manufacturer of the ‚Äúbox‚Äù phone is a minor matter.  And what about Taiwan, what is China, and South Korea is one region.  If you take an objective picture, it becomes clear that Google plans to ‚Äútake its own way‚Äù far from the design of the device.  The choice of the phone manufacturer is dictated by its price and the possibility of mass production of the device.  China is ideal for creating a huge number of not expensive, but enough quality devices.

      Further we read very reasonable rumors about ‚ÄúGphone‚Äù: <br><br>  <em>Most sources agree that the produced phone will have a price of about $ 100 and at the same time have a touch screen.</em>  <em>Most likely, this figure is reliable, and became known thanks to the "leak".</em>  <em>The journalist rizzn.com suggested that the low price of the device is due to the presence of a similar technology to Google Ads, which can be found everywhere on the Internet.</em>  <em>His analytics look convincing, because Eric Schmidt, Google's SEO specialist, said earlier about his readiness to release free phones if people are willing to watch ads.</em>  <em>The source added that the Gphone will be compatible with the Google Talk service and will allow you to make free calls to anywhere in the world.</em>  <em>In addition, the built-in GPS device will use some kind of ‚Äúspecial version‚Äù of Google Maps, probably adapted for mobile use, which looks logical.</em>  <em>Also reported compatibility with the service GMail</em> <br>  Answers google.ru <br><br>  <em>Choosing an iPhone for the iPhone.</em>  <em>It is a phone that connects to a wide variety of technology platforms.</em>  <em>Click here to view add-on applications (see Facebook).</em> <br>  The india street <br><br>  That is, the main, expected, advantages of the phone from Google is the price (compare $ 100 for ‚ÄúGphone‚Äù and $ 500 for ‚ÄúIphone‚Äù at the beginning of sales), integration of Voip and GPS in one device (It seems that Google has plans to plant the whole world on cheap VoIP telephony), openness of the system (the operating system will be based on Linux), integration with all Google network technologies, and additionally, in each so cheap phone, Wi-Fi + GPS (‚ÄúGoogle maps‚Äù of course) in each phone. <br><br>  Not bad naborchik, is not it, we can say really revolutionary.  And if Google starts handing out phones for free, earning thanks to the built-in AdSense system, it will be a huge blow to the existing mobile telephony market, in fact a complete revolution, as well as a revolution in the marketing of goods and services. <br><br>  With such a phone and a set of Google services, it will very soon be able to take a leading position in the market and become a global telecommunications operator.  Everything is good, but only obsessive thoughts about the omnipresent control of the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù are coming to my head.  Some consider the rumors that Google is collecting an extensive dossier for each of its users and is cooperating with the US intelligence services paranoia, someone takes them seriously. <br>  But the fact that the creation of such a phone (VoIP telephony, software integrated with Google‚Äôs network services) will give the Company the potential for total control over the millions of users of the new super-device is extremely difficult to challenge. <br><br>  In essence, the only question is whether Google uses such an opportunity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15679/</a></p>
