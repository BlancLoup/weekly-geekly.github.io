  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Atmix Recall DCR 300 Recorder Review: Is Happiness for 1,500 Rubles?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For any person, the desire to save on the purchase of anything is absolutely normal.  This is especially true for motorists who have chosen the path of choosing a registrar.  On the one hand, the shelves are bursting with models with a price tag of up to 2-3 thousand rubles.  On the other hand, the devices are from the "five" and above.  The unenlightened driver reads on the "two thousand" box "Full HaDe", sees the same inscription on the package is much more expensive models and decides ... It is easy to guess about further actions on the principle "if not the difference, then ...". <br><br>  Using the example of at least two friends, I became aware of at least a few ‚Äútricks‚Äù of ultra-accessible recorders.  A great feature is skipping time between files.  Shooting goes - 3-4 seconds sink into oblivion - shooting resumes.  This, if I am not mistaken, is a consequence of the savings on the installation of a normal processor.  Users who are more or less versed in the subject are familiar with interpolation, when at best HD shooting is stretched to the size specified on the Full HD box.  In the worst case, the ‚Äúears‚Äù of the WVGA openly produce a collection of pixels. <br><br>  Therefore, now I would need to take some registrar of thousands for eight and begin to convince that it is not worth saving, but a quality thing will do its job and will not fail at the most crucial moment.  Instead, I‚Äôll tell you about the registrar for about 1,500 rubles ($ 50).  For about a week, the company in my car was Atmix Recall DCR 300. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39f/3f0/3ba/39f3f03bae57b7789cbb28239b355100.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Box and equipment </h5><br><br>  In good packaging registrar usually does not deserve attention.  But not in our case.  The whole (!) Bottom side of the box is devoted to tips on using a recorder.  Here and "the accident and the court", and "Disputes with the traffic police and the court," "Transfer video card to the traffic police and the court."  In addition, the same tips in a more concise form are set out on one of the sides of the package.  A good example of localization, given the fact that Atmix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot a Russian, but a Taiwanese brand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd8/ffc/b32/fd8ffcb32b3e5923e1448d0e4de10e28.jpg"><br>  It is easy to predict a complete set of such budget recorders: instruction, mounting, AV video cable, miniUSB cable and charger for the cigarette lighter.  I liked the last component because Atmix did not begin to make a USB port in the charging unit for sticking a single complete cable.  Instead, charging has its own wire.  A separate microUSB wire does not need to be broken between the machine and the computer. <br><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br><br>  Atmix Recall DCR 300 has a very scratchy screen.  Even if it would seem to do nothing with him, you still have what you see in the photo.  The same applies to the transparent plastic covering the camera.  Approximately it was written in one review.  But if you look closely, you can see that a thin-thin film is stuck on both sides.  And if you remove it, then there will be no problems with scratches.  In any case, in my weekly period, new ‚Äúmarks‚Äù did not appear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50c/bc3/d37/50cbc3d37d44457c91b75877a5fd8b87.jpg"><br>  I will not say anything special about the appearance.  More precisely, so - the device does not spoil the interior of the cabin, it does not look like a half "piece".  Thousands on three-four rubles looks.  If you consciously squeeze the back and the front side with force, a small crunching cannot be avoided.  However, to say that it somehow manifests itself in real use.  I can not.  The ends of the case and the rim of the front-facing camera are framed with glossy plastic, which looks good, but forces you to wipe the recorder from fingerprints at least once every couple of days. <br><br>  <i>[If you are tired of listing buttons and connectors, feel free to skip the bottom paragraph]</i> <br><br>  The front part contains a camera and four diodes of infrared illumination.  On the left side is a microSD memory card slot, a miniUSB connector and a recess with a reset button.  According to the law of meanness, on my tests, the recorders without the ‚Äúrezet‚Äù key were hanging up, and the models with those in existence behaved surprisingly ‚Äúcalmly‚Äù.  To the right in a vertical row there are four buttons arranged for working in the menu.  The topmost key ‚ÄúMODE‚Äù switches the photo / video and view the captured photo / video.  Above - the power button and the forced entry / confirmation in the menu.  Below is HDMI, AV-out and speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72a/c0b/fe7/72ac0bfe7995786e7910045f45852882.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eef/479/36f/eef47936f200d12b176e6f7be12c6c99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/abe/43a/1f2abe43ace1e16fe71059bcc95662b5.jpg"><br><br>  The mount absorbed all the features that I do not like in the registrar holders.  Point one is adjustment of position / tilt with screw clamps.  Is it really difficult to understand how versatile and convenient the hinged joints are?  And they, if anything, are not loosened up - competent manufacturers use a washer with adjustable degree of rigidity of the ‚Äúball‚Äù.  Point two is the junction of the recorder and the bracket.  Used screw - double sided.  On the one hand we twist it into the holder, on the other - we twist the recorder.  In the end, we need to get the position "face" exactly on the road.  The main disadvantage is that in order to turn to the left side (when the traffic cop approaches), it is necessary to make an almost double turn around the axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/956/019/e6b95601920cbd420685449ad7e90f4e.jpg"><br><br><h5>  In work </h5><br>  The registrar uses a 1.3 megapixel camera, so I did not place special reliance on getting a ‚Äúsuper-clear‚Äù video.  Available resolution options are 1440x1080, 1280x720P, 848x480 and 640x480 pixels.  Filming is conducted cyclically (I think everyone knows what it is) cut into 2, 5, 10 minutes or a continuous stream, the files are saved in AVI.  Of note is the presence of a G-sensor.  Last year, this module was found more likely in devices for at least 4-5 thousand rubles.  Who has forgotten - the accelerometer is triggered when an overload is indicative of an accident.  In this case, the current file is excluded from cyclic shooting and thus protected from accidental erasure.  According to the experience of previous recorders, I immediately reduced the sensitivity of the G-sensor, so I managed only a couple of false positives on potholes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec9/ccb/91c/ec9ccb91c701d3e342396b70c3623fa3.jpg"><br>  You can see the settings yourself on the recorder screen.  From the inconvenient - I would like the case to have separate buttons for installing protection on the file, as well as turning on / off the IR illumination.  In the course of the work, several important points were revealed.  The registrar resolutely did not want to skip seconds between the rollers, and also turned out to be resolutely opposed to hangs.  Regarding the latter - I hope that Atmix Recall DCR300 does not change for the worse after the period that the model was with me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ca/6fd/b7b/3ca6fdb7b49343d08bb56dd7777aada7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/226/1ee/181/2261ee181b3e381aca07c1ee7b00cf2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ea/bec/836/1eabec836fad90f66ba2c6bdcee0f786.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/538/35f/5bf/53835f5bf49970c357c65e8d74caa56d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccc/40e/429/ccc40e4293f2ac271387168e6203d776.jpg"><br><br>  Shooting starts as soon as the engine starts.  Accordingly, the recording stops at the end of the energy supply through the cigarette lighter.  I especially appreciate this automation after a number of ‚Äúsporty‚Äù recorders that require only manually specifying the beginning of the shooting.  According to the results of the shooting there is news both good and bad.  Recording is carried out explicitly without interpolation, ‚Äúfor everything‚Äù 1.3 Mp.  I can not say that the videos suffer from any obvious quality problems.  Let down the clarity - it is difficult to see the numbers of the car, the distance of "vigilance" does not exceed about five meters.  The second "joint" is manifested in the dark.  The recorder is deprived of automatic exposure adjustment.  Therefore, in order to get an acceptable picture at night, you need to go into the settings yourself every time. <br>  While I am not posting my videos (forgive me, technical problems with the laptop), however, I will soon insert videos with my own experience of communicating with the recorder. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFgnER4DRqQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4oM_ByZxLlIuVJYlM-Ny0ysrp7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTC2fDy9JRY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6QdKlinHwr2e8DUCDkx-UsG5bcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  In my opinion, Atmix Recall DCR 300 fits the definition of the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù.  On one weights more often - noname or little-known brands with potentially real ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù of defects, even hindering normal operation.  Atmix Recall DCR 300 "takes" just the fact that I did not find any special glitches and unstable work.  "Workhorse" - no more, no less.  Yes, and the G-sensor to boot.  There is a reason to criticize the model - an inconvenient bracket, the absence of autoexposure, optics that are average in quality of shooting and ... It seems to be all.  Therefore, if the driver is determined to meet the 1,500 - 2,000 rubles ($ 50-65), the Atmix Recall DCR 300 will not be the worst purchase. <br><br>  PS It is interesting that in addition to the immediate task, the DVR also pursues another good goal.  Atmix sends part of the money received from the sale of DVRs and other equipment to charity - the greening of the planet, etc.  Having learned about it, you begin to look at a small neat cube with great respect. <br><br>  And how much would Atmix Recall DCR 300 cost if the price of the model did not imply compulsory financing by the buyer of landscaping the planet? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181057/</a></p>
