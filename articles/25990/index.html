  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The art of killing dragons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once upon a time a boy lived in a small mountain village.  He was handsome, clever and very clever.  He quickly learned everything that adults living in the same village could teach him: he had long been able to make dishes from clay, weave, fish, was the best hunter and the most skillful rider. <br><br>  One day an old man came down from the highest mountain to the village and told him: <br><br>  - You have learned everything that your relatives can give you.  Come with me, and I will teach you the art of slaying dragons.  This is a very ancient art, and it requires a lot of time, effort and desire.  Few are able to master it.  But you are an unusual boy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the boy agreed.

        </script>
      <br>
      And then they left this village and retired to an abandoned castle, where the old man began to teach him the art of killing dragons.  It took the boy many years to master all the skills.  Even after the death of the elder, he persistently continued to train, following his advice from memory. <br><br>  And then one day he realized that he had mastered the art of killing dragons.  And then he went around all the forests of the Earth, all the fields and countries in search of a dragon and nowhere found him.  Then he decided to climb the highest mountain and explore the Earth from its height.  He spent a few more years of his life on the way to this mountain and on rising, but, having climbed the mountain, he did not see the dragon anywhere.  And then he realized that not a single dragon was left on Earth for a long time. <br><br>  And then he came down from the mountain to a small mountain village, where he found the smartest, most talented boy, who had long ago learned everything that the inhabitants of his village could tell him, and began to teach him the art of killing dragons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25990/</a></p>
