In Russia, again planted.  This time for Windows or Photoshop, since, as is well known in Russia, this is the most terrible crime.  The department for which, for example, judging from the statements of Mr. Chichvarkin (for some reason I believe him at 10,000 percent here), the prison cries stronger than any "pirate" teaches its careless citizens to honor the letter and spirit of the law. <br>  The next Ponosovs went under the show trials.  In the best Soviet traditions they plant for absolutely funny motifs.  What kind of unemployed shot down 2-3k rubles for installing Windows and 1C.  Bravo gentlemen!  Viva human rights system!  In our country, everything is so ahuen and honest that there is absolutely no one to plant?  Even so I will say. YOU @ @ $ $ and B @ # d WHAT?  Let's start with you?  Law enforcement system.  Head over to any police station, take a look at its infrastructure?  At home?  In the guard?  In city administrations?  What do we think you will see there?  Faded and old systemic yellows from time to time with pirated winxp or even win98.  Linux? ..! @ # $ Nd gentlemen, you don‚Äôt have Linux, @ @ $ $ @ yy don‚Äôt need it.  Since the transfer of the fleet of cars to free, even so, the cash costs of installing and maintaining the fleet will be fine.  At least in the initial stage of migration.  Instead, a student Vasya who is hired for cheaply downloaded windows downloaded from his home network of the p2p network is hired.  Moreover, purely Soviet, it all looks like this: Vasya, well, you will do everything there as it should!  Vasya but no money!  (with a smile).  <i>Here you have a penny on vodka and went out of here (s) Filatov.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  This Vasya differs from other Vasya indulgences in violation of the law.  The administration will never come to check, and if they come, they will of course put Vasya) Since the chief is naturally not an expert and this Vasya is naturally misled by this very one who will be counted over especially large damage and he will carry the stinky jacket for 3 years. terrible and harsh.  @ # $ built a wagon of money - you are an honorary citizen and dear lord.  Found illegal to earn on a piece of bread - you are a criminal.  That is, with some confidence we can talk about the selective operation of the law in Russia.  And he begins to act or not depends on who and why it is needed.  Let's put the head of administration of some city?  Or check Moscow's legality on.  Find a million percent.  250 very large sizes.  What will follow from this?  Nothing.  At best, Vasya will sit down - an admin who would be happy to put some Ubuntu on the computers of all these accountants, but they won't give it:  The answer is - Vasya, well, you do everything there to make it right!  Vasya but no money!  (with a smile).  And so almost everywhere.  The problem is that I repeat once again that the concept of tolerance for the law in Russia strictly corresponds to the financial status of a citizen.  If you are a slaughter, then you can take a car right on the road for a small debt on a mobile phone or rent, or not let it go to rest in some shitty Turkey.  I do not urge everyone to use pirated software and do not say that it is good.  In fact, everything is much more complicated. <br><br>  Pirate by no means leads to a drop in income of the company-developers.  But not linear.  For example, a company producing some kind of professional product like adobe punishes for piracy purely ostentatiously.  They just need to grow an army of future product buyers on burned copies.  Otherwise, it will not be needed by anyone for 33,000 rubles on the store shelf)) Therefore, adobe folds her eyes towards piracy as such and sometimes selectively punishing.  Another case is an inexpensive startup of a couple of people with some kind of software product with a narrow destination niche, it can be killed by pirated copies immediately.  I think that this problem of prisons and the law can no longer be resolved by refusing the concept: <br><br>  software product = money and go to the software product&gt; services associated with it = money. <br><br>  This scheme works fine in a number of industries related to, for example, operating systems and games and antivirus, but does not work well in a number of other areas.  Well, for example, for what to take money other than the cost in the case of Winrar? <br><br>  All this does not negate the sound logic: It is impossible to punish the use and installation of pirated software and not to punish the city or some other budget for @ # $.  This is how Russia sits, who is stolen for a bag of potatoes, and who is for 2 hens.  And corruption is growing and growing. <br><br> <code>....        2   7             146  2   (     )   273  1 (,     ).   , ,  ,         Microsoft  Adobe,     ,         ,    .    , ,  ,     .</code> <br> <br> <code>....   ,    ¬´-¬ª,      10              10  .    ,          (  146  3   ‚Äî    ).      ,          .  ,  ,  ,             Microsoft  ¬´1C¬ª. <br></code> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84188/</a></p>
