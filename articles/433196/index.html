Did you know that the delay in transmitting a visual signal from the retina to the visual cortex is 70 ms?  This means that you still have less time before the New Year than you thought.  Let's talk about the future - what you put under the tree.  We have prepared a gift guide where you can find interesting gadgets and devices for every taste.  We tell in more detail about some options under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/chipolo-plus/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Search tracker Chipolo Plus</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o_/mf/b0/o_mfb0jr0avkyl1ta87f_bnwdqu.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: scattered boom</i> <br><br>  Chipolo Keychain is a gadget that helps you quickly find lost items.  For example, the keys left in another pocket, the purse forgotten in a cafe, a bag piled with a pile of clothes.  Chipolo is attached to the thing that risks being lost, and connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth.  Chipolo application is installed on the smartphone.  Press the button in the application, in response, the key ring will emit a shrill trill with a volume of 100 dB. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      Bluetooth has its limits, in the case of Chipolo, the "zone of visibility" is 60 meters.  Caught outside these limits, the key chain will not ring.  His last location is recorded on the map, indicating where to return for the lost thing.  In addition, the Chipolo Community feature unites all tracker owners into a single ‚Äúsearch network‚Äù.  The location of the lost item in the system will be updated by the person passing by with the Chipolo application installed on the smartphone (of course, he will not see this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/oa/v9/ttoav9h6bj7wach2zk5oisvcqrm.jpeg"><br><br>  When the smartphone itself disappeared, and the keychain is at hand, the gadget needs to be compressed twice.  The application will make the phone ring even in silent mode.  If both are lost, then it‚Äôs time to choose the ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs help‚Äù option.  To do this, Chipolo needs to be synchronized with any other mobile device and collectively look for the loss. <br><br>  The keychain body is waterproof and protected from moisture by IPX5 standard.  The battery charge is enough for a year of work. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/xd-design/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Backpack XD Design Bobby Backpacks</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/mn/z7/frmnz7_3i0rmv8i52z0kfpqw9m4.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: owner of an expensive laptop, traveler, paranoid</i> <br><br>  We have <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/398999/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/404393/">told</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/415957/">about the</a> XD Design Bobby <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/415957/">backpacks</a> .  In short, this is a series of durable backpacks with a hidden zipper and without easily accessible external pockets.  From such a backpack you can easily pull out everything you need.  A pickpocket in public transport or on the street - no. <br><br>  Bobby models differ in size, volume, weight, appearance, available colors and the size of the compartment for a laptop. <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="130" align="left">  Title </td><td width="100" align="center">  Volume </td><td width="100" align="center">  Weight </td><td width="100" align="center">  Laptop compartment </td><td align="center">  Colors </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby original</a> </td><td align="center">  13 l </td><td align="center">  885 g </td><td align="center">  15.6 inches </td><td>  Black gray </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-compact/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby compact</a> </td><td align="center">  11 liters </td><td align="center">  820 g </td><td align="center">  14 inches </td><td>  Blue yellow, <br>  mint, blue, pink </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-bizz/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby bizz</a> </td><td align="center">  10 l </td><td align="center">  1200 g </td><td align="center">  15.6 inches </td><td>  The black </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-xl/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby xl</a> </td><td align="center">  15 l </td><td align="center">  900 g </td><td align="center">  17 inches </td><td>  Black gray </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-urban/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby urban</a> </td><td align="center">  27 l </td><td align="center">  1000 g </td><td align="center">  15.6 inches </td><td>  Gray </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-urban-lite/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Bobby urban lite</a> </td><td align="center">  22 l </td><td align="center">  1000 g </td><td align="center">  15.6 inches </td><td>  Black gray </td></tr></tbody></table>  In addition to protection against thieves, each Bobby has a weight distribution system to ease the load on the shoulders, a breathable backrest and hidden pockets with quick access.  Urban and Urban Lite have nets for attaching sports equipment or a tent.  The rest of the models have a USB port for a pilot bank outside under the strap to charge gadgets on the go. <br><br>  When you buy Bobby Original and Bobby Compact, you will receive a 7,500 mAh battery as a gift. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-mini-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Electric face brush Foreo LUNA mini 2</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i8/tf/zk/i8tfzkouks8jx-6jdctuaw9eris.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: your mom, wife, girlfriend - and yourself</i> <br><br>  Foreo LUNA mini 2 is an electric brush for cleansing the face, a cult gadget among Instagram users, beauty bloggers and lovers of beauty care products.  The funny thing vibrates with bristles at a speed of 9000 pulses per minute and gently removes sebum, makeup residues and dead cells from the skin surface. <br><br>  In our era of the indiscriminate photoshop, quality skin cleaning has become the last frontier that women of all ages are trying to conquer - and there is no contradiction in this.  Yes, ‚Äúacne‚Äù can be covered with a layer of makeup, which the clown Penny was envy.  The thicker the layer, the harder it is to wash it off, and the more problems appear later.  It is necessary to increase the volume of cosmetics again - a vicious spiral is obtained.  King's ideal evil was dormant for 30 years between appearances, which women in our lives cannot afford.  LUNA mini 2 brush solves the problem in two minute sessions - in the morning and in the evening. <br><br>  How is such a brush better than a finished set of cosmetics?  The fact that it is suitable for all skin types does not cause allergies and will not end up in the trash one month after the holiday.  The device is equipped with two types of bristles, thick for oily skin and thin for normal and dry.  They are located on both sides of the brush.  Managed by the gadget is also simple, with three buttons: one power and two switching intensity levels.  The device is powered by a battery that charges from the USB port in an hour.  The charge is enough for 300 sessions. <br><br>  The brush is made of non-porous silicone.  This is important: sponges and nylon brushes for the face change every couple of months, because bacteria multiply rapidly in them.  Non porous Foreo silicone, on the contrary, interferes with the growth of colonies of microorganisms.  LUNA mini 2 brush is enough to rinse under water, and it will be clean again. <br><br>  In the LUNA series there are other models - <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">more expensive</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-play-plus/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">cheaper</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-fofo/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">smarter</a> , as well as the male version of <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-mini-2-for-men/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">LUNA mini 2</a> and a separate <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-2-for-men/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">LUNA 2 for MEN</a> .  Both facilitate subsequent shaving. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/lesvet-cosmic/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">LeSvet Cosmic Levitating Lamp</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/g8/go/h_g8goupviovuwhlyugekq42t5k.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: a universal gift</i> <br><br>  Lovers of magnetic levitation is dedicated to: a soaring light bulb with a whole string of LEDs.  The LeSvet Cosmic lamp is so called because the twenty LEDs inside the glass bulb resemble a constellation.  First, it is beautiful, and secondly - romantic. <br><br>  The light bulb is burning and levitating above a wooden stand thanks to a well-known magnetic induction stunt.  The lamp is not very bright, its luminous flux is only 200 lumens.  LeSvet Cosmic should be used as a night light or decorative accent. <br><br>  The height of levitation is 15‚Äì17 millimeters, the light bulb slowly rotates in flight.  Power is supplied to a wooden base from a 220 volt network. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/ugears/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Wooden constructors Ugears</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/dz/px/asdzpxnahkpkt_vgbhqontlx94u.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: a universal gift</i> <br><br>  Ugears wood constructors have the rare ability to please everyone (or at least many).  Models are assembled without glue and tools from parts cut on a laser machine.  Due to the high accuracy, all elements are tightly connected to each other and do not jump out of the grooves, if it was not so intended by the designers. <br><br>  Almost all assembled models are driven by ingenious mechanisms.  Gears and other moving parts are clearly visible through the openwork design, which makes Ugears look like skeleton watches.  Steampunk served as another source of inspiration for the creators of the designers, but in the end it turned out to be a very special, unlike anything else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9s/jz/09/9sjz09xpbbuzz6oynv2wtnbye-m.jpeg"><br><br>  Ugears are trains, vintage cars and trucks, carriages and tractor units, windmills, mechanical horses, sailboats, a working safe, various boxes and even a working model of a wheel lyre.  Assembly time depends on the number of parts and the complexity of a particular model.  The simplest are going for a couple of hours. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-tread/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Multitul-bracelet Leatherman Tread</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vn/bb/96/vnbb96gqkn6abs8cxo5vi7hgatq.jpeg"><br>  <i>To give: best friend or father</i> <br><br>  Leatherman Tread - a hybrid of a multitool and a bracelet, or a wearable multitool.  Each of its links is equipped with several miniature tools: a screwdriver, a wrench, a bottle opener, a blade.  To use the multitool for its intended purpose, you need to remove it from your hand, select the appropriate tool and bend the bracelet at the link with it. <br><br>  There are 11 links in total, and 29 tools. Each link is cast from stainless steel and is connected to other elements in a random order and quantity.  Tread can be collected under the wrist of any size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2x/4t/0u/2x4t0ut-q58kerdjwtiwa0gskse.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to convenience, the main reason for creating Tread were airplanes.  An ordinary multitool cannot be brought on board a ship, or to Disneyland, or to another place with mandatory inspection and metal detectors.  And Leatherman Tread - you can. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ft/kq/sc/ftkqsc0qxjgorihtkoiidrgeepq.jpeg"><br><br>  The bracelet has two options, black and gray (metallic).  Black has a special diamond coating.  In addition to Tread, there are other multitools of the famous company in the catalog, in particular, <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-wave-plus-nylon/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Leatherman Wave Plus</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-style-ps/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Style</a> , <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-surge-nylon/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Surge</a> and <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-charge-plus-tti-nylon/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dny1801">Charge</a> . <br><br>  Up to December 31, the entire Madrobots product range has a 10% discount on the NYHBR promo code.
