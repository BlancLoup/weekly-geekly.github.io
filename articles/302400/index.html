It turned out 24 reports on mobile development: Android, iOS and cross-platform.  To carefully study them all, you need to spend almost an hour of time, so we prepared a small guide on the program, which itself divided into three areas, not tied to the platform: <br><ul><li>  On the Edge; </li><li>  Hardcore; </li><li>  Software Craftsmanship; </li></ul><br>  However, this post is not only about the conference - each of the reports falls into the program because of one or another ‚Äúsin‚Äù that is common among programmers.  Let's see more ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c50/955/138/c50955138daf4007aee0d55c542d8d4d.jpg"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Sin 0: Adoration of silver bullet. </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b6/dec/1de/2b6dec1de864453e9d6c237d37b48746.jpg"></div>

      Yes, this is the eternal expectation of new versions of our favorite tools, frameworks, technical solutions or even development approaches.  Silver bullet syndrome in programmers in the blood, and, obviously, is transmitted by airborne droplets. <br><br>  True, new versions of iOS bring not only pleasant surprises, but the deadline will not wait for Java 9 on Android (and we are waiting for something like this) - we need to work here and now.  The truth is that we already have a full clip, albeit not silver, but deadly effective cartridges, and it was to them that we decided to devote the lion's share of our reports: why wait, when everything is ready?  Take and write code. <br><br>  It will be better, you say?  And you will be absolutely right!  However, even now we have the tools for those who crave for safe, reusable and maintainable code in iOS development, a direct route to Swift - using the example of generics and Application Coordinators, we will consider the tools of iOS developers that are not used in new projects due to the fact that it simply was not in Objective-C or not much is said about it.  A detailed interview about what buns and rakes laid out in Swift, can be read <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/301600/">here</a></b> . <br><br>  The same goes for Android: only the main problem of the platform is its fragmentation.  And Google has rolled out its solution a long time ago in the form of the concept of Material Design - a set of approaches that give us the opportunity to make a beautiful, lively application without being a genius in design.  What does the developer have to do with this?  Given that 77 percent of applications get bad marks due to the fact that they look terrible, regardless of the optimization, the correct backend or wide functionality.  How to cope with this, <b><a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/ivanov_elsinga/">tell</a></b> Wiebe Elsinga (Android GDE / UX Expert) and Vladimir Ivanov, who in practice implements Material Design into their applications.  By the way, you can read a great interview on this topic <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/283230/">here</a></b> . <br><br>  We will also talk about current (and most importantly, already working!) Frameworks: <br><br>  Egor Tolstoy (Rambler &amp; Co) <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/tolstoy/">will tell about Typhoon</a> ; <br>  Igor Vasilenko (Yota) - <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/vasilenko">about ReactiveCocoa</a> ; <br>  Kirill Popov (Odnoklassniki) - <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/popov">about when ready-made libraries are better than their native ‚Äúbikes‚Äù on the example of Fresco</a> ; <br>  Denis Kretov and Maxim Evtukh (Notissimus) - <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/kretov">how they managed to reduce development time for several platforms using Xamarin and MvvmCross</a> . <br><h3>  Sin 1: Knowledge of "high level". </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/d38/1c3/9c7d381c3e2743659c367529b8ebe787.jpg"></div><br><br>  There are at least 2 types of developers: those who like to build high-level architectural "castles in the air" and those who bury themselves for the most "do not want" in the jungle of low-level optimizations.  The first type programmers often forget that not only driver developers should understand low-level nuances: you should always understand how your code will behave on a particular platform, on a particular VM.  And this is a very common "cant", although among the participants of our conferences there are many developers of the second type: those who like to work closer to the OS.  Among the speakers, too - this time we have a quarter of the reports under the label "hardcore": about the "guts", virtual machines, languages ‚Äã‚Äãand programming approaches. <br><br>  Two reports, one for each platform, are allocated to the reactive approach: Matvey Malkov already did an ‚Äúintroductory report‚Äù about reactive Android for Android <a href="https://youtu.be/Eatfi4am0HU">last year</a> , this time it‚Äôs about the mistakes that developers make and what is the correct reactive Android programming (by the way, there is a <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/282784">recent interview</a></b> on this subject).  In iOS, Yevgeny Rtishchev (Sberbank-Technology) will tell about the reactive approach <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/rtishchev/">in the report ‚ÄúReactive MVVM‚Äù</a> <br><br>  We talked about Swift in the last section, since there‚Äôs not much of a move in the iOS world.  But from the point of view of the choice of available development languages, Android provides an extensive ‚Äúmenu‚Äù: in addition to Java 7 and 8 (in the foreseeable future), applications written in Kotlin and Scala go into sales.  About the pros and cons of mobile development in these languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill tell <b><a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/zhulanov/">Jan Zhulanov (JetBrains)</a></b> and <b><a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/malkov/">Matvey Malkov (for more than a year, writing on Scala)</a></b> . <br><br>  Well, the last two reports in this category are devoted to Android internals: <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/polishchuk">Dmitry Polishchuk's report on the subtleties and rakes in working with the Android multimedia subsystem</a> and <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/rozumyansky/">Mikhail Rozumyansky's presentation ‚ÄúBytecode weaving 101‚Äù</a> , in which bytecode code generation is given, bytecode patching in general and advantages and disadvantages compared with standard annotation processing. <br><br><h3>  Sin 2: Laziness and conservatism. </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/ebf/e86/9abebfe86bbd49fca98892bca67c10a5.jpg"></div><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat nonsense?  The first point is about silver bullets, and the third is about conservatism? ‚ÄùYes, that‚Äôs right!  We are waiting for some decisions, we study them with enthusiasm and joy, but all this works only <i>where we are interested</i> .  However, the fate of any developer is full of surprises: all the time there are a lot of changes that have to be studied.  And no <i>one wants that</i> . <br><br>  However, the technological stack of the mobile developer is updated even faster: Material Design, Swift 3.0, React, Kotlin, new versions of virtual machines and operating systems - just manage to watch and master: all this takes time and effort.  At Mobius, we have prepared for you a squeeze of important news so that you do not spend dozens of hours surfing the Internet and trying to filter out useful things from tons of information "noise". <br><br>  The simplest example: Google i / o 2016 - hundreds of disparate articles and announcements, one repeats the other, and the third distorts the second - while most of this is designed for geeks and sympathizers.  To be honest, we never managed to find a single source with all the important information for the programmer from the conference, so personally I would be happy to listen to the <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/nekludov/">report with the ‚Äúhot news‚Äù for developers</a> .  from the mouth of Denis Neklyudov, Android GDE.  And as a seed, you can read <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/282960">an interview with Denis about Android N.</a></b> <br><br>  The second example: it is very difficult to assess the prospects of certain technologies independently.  After all, we all believed in the success of Google Glass, and where are they now?  On the other hand, the <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/302152/">VR or Android theme of off-the-phones is growing and evolving</a></b> , becoming an industry.  Is it time to move in this direction?  This will be a couple of reports: <br><ul><li>  Korshak Alexander on the practical application and development for Cardboard </li><li>  Alexey Rybakov about Android TV Gaming (Vulkan API, Nvidia Gameworks, etc.) </li></ul><br>  The third topic you should know, but which you don‚Äôt really want to delve into, is security: <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/rytin/">Boris Ryutin will tell you about the latest iOS and Android features in this area</a> . <br><br>  Of course, an inquisitive reader, having come to this line, having considered the reports in the program and in the article, will find that the checksum has not converged.  Yes, because in fact there are four sins, and in the last sin many people do not want to admit to themselves: <br><br><h4>  Sin 3: No one likes to code. </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/252/081/5db/2520815db32c4931ae7da55623d41239.png"></div><br><br>  Yes, no one likes coding - everyone loves to solve interesting problems and puzzle over algorithmic problems or optimization.  And who will write?  In any case, on Mobius we have several reports <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/matsyuk">on writing test code</a> , <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/skliarevskii">on practical ‚Äúacceleration‚Äù of your applications</a> , <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/tsyganov">on fast management of a set of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù and their configurations</a> , and also <a href="http://mobiusconf.com/talks/diagileva">on practical typography in iOS</a> . <br><br><h3>  What is the result? </h3><br><br>  There will be no indulgences, but for every sin we have something to say.  If you know something that is worth talking about at the conference, but there is no such thing in the program - feel free to contact us, next time we will try to do everything at the highest level. <br><br>  <b>See you at the conference!</b> <br><br>  PS if you want to Mobius, but do not get to St. Petersburg, we have an <b><a href="http://mobiusconf.com/registration">online broadcast</a></b> . <br>  PPS If you want to look at the reports of past Mobius, they are already all posted on our <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MobiusConf/playlists">YouTube channel</a></b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302400/</a></p>
