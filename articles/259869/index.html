Initially, the idea was simply to make a stub to give the made crafts a less ‚Äúleaky‚Äù look, but in fact received almost a ‚ÄúPandora‚Äôs box‚Äù in the field of cubic engineering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/600/004/104600004d2341398d2d175a4202614c.jpg"><br><br>  But it all started with the development of a panel for the formation of mosaic panels of base cubes.  The panels could additionally be printed in different colors and form a smoother surface than just a surface of cubes with holes of square cross section. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The panels turned out to be quite successful and, when tested, kept themselves well on horizontal surfaces, but it was necessary to decide what type of connection to leave, everywhere there were pros and cons.  We decided to roll the die, the one that the ‚Äúbones‚Äù with dots from 1 to 6. There was NOT a cube !!!  No, of course, you can run a program to generate random numbers, glue, cut, etc ... but there is NO physical cube now, there are many cubes with four holes on each face.  And there are a lot of such cubes!

It was clear that the "bones" in his pocket, but you can still fold the dominoes.  Everything, it defined the further course of thought with these panels. <br><br>  Numbers were formed for the test, six letters of the Russian alphabet, and finally a cube was assembled to throw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48f/baf/eff/48fbafeffd8044f79f2ef6ff1e703eb4.jpg"><br><br>  Cubes look great.  On the light outer surface, a black base allows the future user to clearly see what is depicted on the upper face of the cube.  The problems of the ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù cube were revealed ... the panels are moving away.  Of course, they can be glued, but then the cube for another purpose can no longer be used.  That is why this time we post the previously generated only <a href="http://3d.masterkit.ru/shop/library">stl files</a> with dominoes, but we‚Äôll post the new panel, which has already been developed, with the next release, on Thursday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/cd4/0cc/723cd40cc4dd4fa7930ea2cda087816e.jpg"><br><br>  We printed the entire alphabet on our <a href="http://3d.masterkit.ru/shop/3d-printers">park of 3D printers</a> .  Each panel was printed successively in two colors and traditionally without building supports.  Two-color printing of course greatly increased the complexity, due to the time to replace the plastic in each session, but the result was worth it.  Each panel is about one and a half grams, i.e.  about 10 grams will be added to the cube on six sides. <br><br>  In our opinion it turned out very cool.  VARIOUS, CONSENT and two SIGNS ‚Äú‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù were printed in different colors.  This even gave a certain completeness, and someone said ‚Äúfabrication‚Äù, the resulting alphabet. <br><br>  Further more.  Vowel and consonant panels were collected in different cubes and remembered how teachers play letters with children.  For example, they take all the cubes of the VOICE and, according to a randomly drawn set, students should come up with the words adding the consonants "from the head". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cce/496/7f8/cce4967f8d884777b1c90ae0c3550bbb.jpg"><br><br>  Also played with ACCORD letters.  Consonant cubes are thrown, and vowels are thought out from the head.  The one who writes down or calls the most words in the allotted time wins.  There are many different methodical materials on the games with letters on the Internet, from the well-known Erudite to ... we do not know where to, but we will definitely make a selection and about it. <br><br>  Since Master Keith still relates not only to 3D printing, but also to electronics, and earlier in posts about Kubotronik you asked to add the ability to form electrical circuits and make containers for various devices, we are doing this, but for now we offer the concept of the game -constructor, probably, after all, it will be a board game.  The game still has the working title ‚ÄúCIRCUIT‚Äù and it will need to build electrical circuits according to the tasks.  View of the first six blocks, we present to you in the photo below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/37f/5c1/81e37f5c1131409d8c7097daa87af49e.jpg"><br><br>  Assumed several options.  From a purely board game, in which one of the adults will control the rules, to a real designer with radio components installed in Kubotronic units.  At the moment, we have developed 2 types of electrical connection between the blocks, which are being tested. <br><br>  Also now we are solving the issue of the location of the parts on the cubes, since  we want to minimize the consumption of plastic and, accordingly, the volume of 3D printing, in order to make the game CIRCUITS as low as possible.  Remember, at the beginning of the appearance of Kubotronik, there was the thesis: "TO MAKE CHEAPERS AT HOME CHECKING IN the store", we will try to follow this <br><br>  PS As we wrote above, now only <a href="http://3d.masterkit.ru/shop/library">stl files of</a> panels with dominoes, and panels of letters, geometry, arithmetic and others will be made already with the new snapping mechanism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259869/</a></p>
