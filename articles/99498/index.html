But the future of search is for users to get relevant information even before they know that they need this information.  One of the oldest developers of the search algorithm Google, Amit Singel, wants to develop a mechanism that will allow you to know in advance about user preferences. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps in the future, your Google account will be allowed to collect more information about the features of your life and the lives of your loved ones.  Birthdays and anniversaries, consumer preferences, hobbies and favorite foods.  At the same time, she will know your location in order to provide information about the places closest to you where you can meet your needs. <br><br>  Singel is confident that this can make our lives easier.  For example, your wife's birthday is coming.  If you use a new algorithm, you will automatically be added this event to the calendar and set a reminder.  In this case, the algorithm will analyze the consumer preferences of your wife, examining her activity in social networks and search queries, and selects for you a list of products that you could get her as a desired gift.

      If you would like to buy some popular gadget for a particular day, for example, a birthday, the algorithm will understand your behavior and, after analyzing the information that demand will be increased, will recommend you make a purchase in advance and even determine the desired order time so that you can to the desired date. <br><br>  On the other hand, ‚Äúsearch without search‚Äù can provide you with a personalized and frequently updated news service that will collect information from social networks and other sites.  She will be able to warn you about events that may harm you (for example, natural disasters near you) as quickly as possible, since information about such events appears on Twitter much earlier than traditional media. <br><br>  Frequent updates of personalized information will help you, for example, track down traffic jams on your way to a meeting in advance and suggest an alternative route or warn you to leave in advance. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSingel follows from the emerging trend in the study of the behavior of the user of the worldwide network in order to find ways to personalize search results.  For example, Yahoo researchers have demonstrated that even basic demographic information about a user submitting a search query will help reduce the number of irrelevant links and provide exactly the information that the user most likely wanted to receive. <br><br>  But within the framework of the existing technology, it is difficult to enter the market with a similar product, as the problem of personal data protection arises.  Google knows this firsthand, as many of its users are worried and feel offended when the company is trying by all means to get the most personal information by any means. <br><br>  Singel believes that if ‚Äúsearch without search‚Äù is implemented, then at the forefront should be the problem of keeping information about the private life of people intact and you need to give users complete control over the information that the algorithm will have. <br>  And although Google believes that such a system can save users 15 minutes of time per day, which they would have to spend on a traditional search, Singel stresses that ‚Äúsearch without search‚Äù is not a product in development, but only his personal dream.  At the same time, it is worth noting that Singel‚Äôs other dreams that he had over the past 10 years at the helm of developing Google algorithms, including smart context-sensitive search, translation modules and location-sensitive search, have already come true. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19186-innovation-google-may-know-your-desires-before-you-do.html">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99498/</a></p>
