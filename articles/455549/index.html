At the official F8 conference on April 30 and May 1, the first persons of the company announced innovations.  Among other things, focus on the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos/f8-2019/day-1-keynote/">formation of personal space</a> . <br><blockquote>  It‚Äôs easier to feel belonging when you are in small communities and among your closest friends.  As the world grows larger and more connected, we need this sense of closeness more than ever. </blockquote>  If we translate it into understandable Russian, then in perspective Facebook will develop: <br><br><ul><li>  groups, </li><li>  Storis, </li><li>  messenger. </li></ul><br>  Today we will talk about how to use groups for promotion.  And the first thing to remember: Facebook's organic traffic went almost entirely to groups.

      Yes, yes, I recently wrote an article <a href="https://d-sant.com/blog-dsant/ne-sozdavajte-gruppy-v-fejsbuk-ne-tratte-3-goda-na-bespoleznyj-aktiv/">‚ÄúDo not create groups‚Äù</a> .  And I don‚Äôt give up its meaning at all: do not create groups - use existing ones.  Because there is also the second article <a href="https://d-sant.com/blog-dsant/kak-rabotaet-gruppa-les-vokrug-gory/">‚ÄúHow the group works: the forest around the mountain‚Äù</a> , in which I vividly show how illiterate management of the group leads to the degradation of the community.  Facebook groups are an interesting tool with rich features.  Which should be able to use.  Misunderstanding of the mechanism of work leads to disastrous results.  Today we‚Äôll talk about this: how to use groups for personal advancement. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Groups - the current reality of Facebook </h2><br>  Traffic and volume of content in groups is growing.  Almost all organic traffic and activity goes to the community.  Small and large, closed and open.  In Messenger including. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/te/h9/asteh9pl8rvuklntqo1fqce_7fi.jpeg"><br><br>  The coverage of the post within the group is much higher than in the tape.  Even if you use a link to an external site ‚Äî and Facebook doesn‚Äôt like it ‚Äî even in this case, coverage from a group where almost 6,000 participants provide coverage of 800+ views and 104 transitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n6/ay/s1/n6ays1y00xdt0cytl0fkbxb1z0a.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l0/t7/fr/l0t7frk_z8s2zgpmo_co4q7oa54.jpeg"><br><br>  Given that you can announce a new blog article in several groups at once, the aggregate coverage and traffic turned out to be quite decent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/nt/fv/wkntfvh6jkojsbyizntcoevea2k.jpeg"><br><br>  To achieve the same results and even more, a blog on a separate site is not needed.  All the work can be done within Facebook.  Before you step by step plan. <br><br><h2>  How to use groups for personal promotion </h2><br>  The first thing to understand: the group does not need to create.  Group administration is a separate story.  Difficult, long and routine. <br><blockquote>  Groups should be used - foreign groups </blockquote>  The second important point: interesting content is welcomed in all the appropriate groups.  If you have something to say, on business and professionally, do not hesitate, write, share and tell.  Agree with the administration about the announcements of events, LIVE-broadcasts, webinars, etc. All that are ready to tell and show, share with everything.  But pre-agree with the administration.  There may be claims in terms of quality, competence or reliability.  But in 9 cases out of 10 the administration gives the go-ahead.  The most difficult thing is for the audience of the group to accept you.  Social control is the most difficult filter. <br><br>  Third.  Use notes (notes): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/hn/kq/brhnkqwddzpnh4ufhxtd8_slumi.jpeg"><br><br>  What it is?  - Built-in ability to publish longreads, long detailed articles with the ability to design, format text, insert videos and pictures.  This is an opportunity to create full-fledged detailed articles on your personal page (profile) or business page and share in different groups and not only in groups, and not only in Facebook.  Such articles are successfully opened even by unauthorized users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/-i/a9/bh-ia9bmjjvw6hhn5ylgzxjw7i8.jpeg"><br><br>  Share links to notes can be in other social networks, forums, chat rooms, instant messengers, in personal correspondence. <br><br><h3>  Step-by-step work algorithm </h3><br><ol><li>  Make content.  Article, well-designed, with pictures, you can with the video. </li><li>  Publish on a personal or business page. </li><li>  Make an intriguing announcement in different groups and chat rooms. </li><li>  After 5 days, count the views and interactions. </li><li>  Perform work on bugs. </li><li>  Repeat the cycle. </li></ol><br>  This is a simple algorithm for personal promotion on Facebook.  Methodical and quality grind all the problems. <br><br><h2>  How to use the group for business projects </h2><br>  To understand how the group is built into the sales funnel, he invented the following visual model: ‚ÄúManor and yard‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zp/ws/ey/zpwseyvkctqpbdtbknshuetyejc.jpeg"><br><br>  Business has a business page.  The group in this case is embedded in the infrastructure of the business page.  The nature of the relationship between the group and the business page, as between the facade and the courtyard behind the house. <br><br>  On the facade there is a signboard, a signboard, a name, a showcase, an entrance group.  The facade attracts people to go from the street, meet, learn the contents. <br><br>  In the backyard we organize parties, events.  We invite clients, people with whom we already know, who know us.  At the party, the informal atmosphere - in contrast to the front part.  Here we have fun, discuss various rumors, gossip, share experiences, laugh at the jokes.  Here the emotional degree is completely different.  Although much depends on the nature of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/f5/s_/jxf5s_2okmxnb-it68tdwdnbmd4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the courtyard, you can present a new product, a new product or product, open a wolf hunting season, or open a sales training course.  When all the participants of the party have become softened, emotionally warmed up, you can make a presentation of the product. <br><br>  But each party has a number of hard and fast rules that maintain a friendly atmosphere and protect them from becoming a depressive drunk.  The group created for commercial purposes has a number of fundamental differences from industry or entertainment communities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/dk/4z/szdk4z_--tk6e2kqs0iyonmbao4.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  The group exists for a limited time.  Like every party free beer and roast meat ends one day. </li><li>  Narrow topic.  All participants are invited in advance to discuss a narrow topic.  To be in time for a limited time to maximize the topic. </li><li>  Restrictions on publication rights.  Almost always publish posts can only administration.  The entire focus of attention is only on the owners of the party.  They knocked on a glass and drew attention to themselves. </li><li>  Mandatory identification of participants.  Name, phone, email.  Only famous people who have been pre-filtered. </li></ul><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  This is the final part of a triptych about Facebook groups.  In three parts, I slightly revealed the contents of the webinar about Wings of Icarus course groups - a promotion strategy on Facebook without an advertising budget. <br><br>  The main idea that all three parts carry is: Facebook is a complex system and requires creative approach, methodical work and constant search for the best option for you.  Personal experience is the best teacher. <br><br>  Groups in current realities are one of the most promising tools.  Opportunities and use cases - innumerable quantity.  And it is not necessary to create a group.  To get the benefit immediately and now, you need to use ready-made, existing groups.  In 9 out of 10 cases, the administration will only be happy to publish high-quality professional articles.  Interaction with the audience of the group will allow you to understand the demands and needs of customers, to realize something hidden, implicit and undocumented desires.  Groups are an excellent option for native advertising, guerrilla marketing, and in the case of info-products, training courses, they work as learning platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/cn/wl/gfcnwlghqlypoimqh9z0mgxe40s.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dt/gk/0k/dtgk0kdl4asulsjsjlkxsmastau.jpeg"><br><br>  The end result of working with groups will be building a network of sites to promote your content.  Formed a table with statistics for each publication in each group and an understanding of where and what is best to publish, how to communicate with the audience, pack knowledge, announce articles.  You create your own marketing web within Facebook.  And it does not require special knowledge, spend money on advertising or hire a specialist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455549/</a></p>
