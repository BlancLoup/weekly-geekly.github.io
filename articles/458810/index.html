This includes WordPerfect text editor, WinDVD media player, WinZip archiver, and Pinnacle Studio video editing software.  The number of third-party programs owned by Corel, exceeds 15. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCorel has achieved a unique positioning in the market, constantly expanding its impressive portfolio of IT solutions.  KKR is looking forward to working with Corel management to stimulate further business growth, using the extensive experience of the mergers and acquisitions team to launch a new chapter of innovation and growth on a global scale, ‚Äùsaid <b>John Park, member of the KKR Council.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄùKKR, first of all, recognizes the value of our employees and their impressive achievements, especially from the point of view of our work with clients, technological innovation and successfully implemented strategies of acquisitions and acquisitions of other companies.  Thanks to KKR support and a shared vision, new exciting opportunities are opening up for our company, products and users, ‚Äùsaid <b>Patrick Nichols, CEO of Corel</b> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúCorel has been an important part of the Vector Capital family for many years, and we are pleased to have achieved a fantastic result for our investors with selling KKR,‚Äù commented <b>Alex Sluski, founder and chief investment officer of Vector Capital</b> .  During this time, Corel completed several transformational acquisitions, increased revenues and significantly improved its profitability.  We are confident that Corel has found a worthy partner in the face of KKR and wish them continued success together. ‚Äù <br><br>  For KKR, Corel is mainly invested in the KKR Americas XII Foundation. <br>  Corel and Vector Capital were represented by Sidley Austin LLP during this transaction, while Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP and Deloitte represented KKR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/oq/s5/zvoqs5tztwus8saii_uohxpmp8o.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The KKR investment group was founded in 1976.
