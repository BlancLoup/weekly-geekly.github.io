With each new round of continuous business expansion, it is becoming increasingly difficult to personally control all the nuances of the work of their subordinates.  Managers who had previously been able to communicate with each of their employees suddenly find themselves in an endless series of calls and letters requiring immediate response.  Delegation of authority is fine, but I want to be able to directly objectively evaluate those people who join the ranks of the company.  It is at this stage that various automated control, testing and evaluation systems come to us. <br><br>  I have experience in introducing specialized software for theoretical testing.  I must say that such systems greatly facilitate the assessment of personnel on the necessary indicators. <br>  <b>Main advantages:</b> <br><ul><li>  mass character (scaled as the company grows) </li><li>  lack of subjectivity of the examiner </li><li>  business continuity (testing takes no more than 15 minutes, which is easily realized during working hours) </li><li>  geographical distribution (testing in remote branches does not require special organization, except for a stable VPN) </li></ul><br>  However, when it becomes necessary to evaluate the quality of service, a problem arises.  Testing is impossible to assess customer satisfaction with the work of company employees.  Under habracut you will find one possible solution to the problem.  I just want to warn you - for now, this is only a bare concept that I would like to discuss with the community. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How to evaluate the attitude of the client to the employee? </h4><br>  First you need to decide on what method we will consider our "likes".  In some large supermarkets, it is customary to throw squares with employee numbers or something similar into special boxes.  Also often there are paper questionnaires with a bunch of items where you can write a detailed description.  This system does not immediately look very rational: <br><ul><li>  manual counting of votes, which increases the burden on employees and requires a lot of resources </li><li>  does not scale well in big companies </li><li>  poor aggregation of results; a lot of work will be needed to put together the statistics of all branches </li><li>  ease of cheating both positive and negative </li><li>  requires complex actions on the part of the client and, as a result, detailed reviews will only come from those who are dissatisfied (the golden rule ‚Äúdon't care‚Äù) </li><li>  you need to either plant an employee for cutting these pieces of paper with scissors or order tons of waste paper from the printing house </li></ul><br>  Separately, we touch the important point about the potential cheating.  We work with real people, not with perfect abstractions.  As a result, any team is a fancy intertwining of likes and dislikes.  The falsification of results may be in a positive way (my salary depends on it! I will add more pieces of paper to my basket, no one will notice), and maybe even a negative one (it always seemed to me that they were overpaying. Let this salary be cut down, they will know!) .

    <h4>  System requirements </h4><br>  So, we come to the conclusion that in our ideal system everything should be built on maximum automation of the whole process.  At the same time, the system should provide a reasonable level of protection, which will not allow an ordinary employee to distort the results, but at the same time not complicate the assessment process excessively (remember the story about the <a href="http://www.xakep.ru/post/35784/">hacker and the salt</a> sink?).  As additional requirements, we add cross-platform (server-side work on Linux will save on licenses), a web interface on end terminals (allows you to use almost anything from tablets to all-in-one boxes), a normal SQL database (will allow us to create arbitrary queries, forming required statistics).  The system should be extremely easy to handle for the end user.  Here we add all the above items related to scalability. <br><br><h4>  Architecture </h4><br>  Immediately I warn you - I am a doctor.  If I now formulate strange and not quite adequate things - please correct me.  So: <br><ul><li>  System core - provides the logic of the whole complex and the interaction of its elements </li><li>  SLQ database - stores and structures all accumulated material </li><li>  Web-interface - serves to connect terminal modules and interact with the system core </li><li>  The terminal part at the reception / reception - allows you to print the same voting sheets </li><li>  Terminal part for voting - allows you to express your attitude to the attendant and give a detailed comment if necessary </li><li>  The terminal part of the analyst - for access to the head / analyst to the results </li></ul><br><h4>  Usage example </h4><br>  Since the profile of my company is medical services, I will tell on the example of a medical reception. <br><br>  The client contacts the reception desk where an administrative girl smiles at him while making out a reception.  We are already using a special complex that provides for recording patients and keeping electronic records of the disease.  Having an electronic schedule in hand, the registrar, in addition to the reception design, immediately prints a voting form. <br>  The blank looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/991/523/fd7/991523fd7bcab84f1f17d7f2e3514d4b.png"><br>  The QR code contains the following information: <br>  123967642 - a unique admission identifier, by which all information can be retrieved from the database, including the patient's full name, the full name of all employees who worked with the client and other data.  Thus, the employee will not be able to fake a vote.  Each code is unique and can be used once. <br><br>  After taking the patient can express his opinion at a special stand.  The rack is something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed7/aae/1a4/ed7aae1a4ffdbbdffbf6f2349a59328d.jpg"><br>  The only addition is a webcam, built-in monoblock or individual. <br><br>  When a patient brings a leaflet with a QR code to the webcam, photos of all the employees who accompanied the service, a brief description of them (full name, position), large buttons liked / disliked, small buttons to leave feedback and get help.  It is also possible to mark the option "Like / Dislike everything" for speeding up.  The touch screen and keyboard are only used to enter a detailed review / complaint.  This achieves minimalism and simplicity for the client.  If desired, the client can leave a video message on reception, if he does not want to enter it from the keyboard. <br><br>  A side function of the terminal during inactivity - showing advertising of the company's services and informational support (schedule, assistance with discounts, promotions, telephones, etc.) <br><br>  The analyst summarizes with a certain frequency and receives the following information: <br><br>  <b>Employee Friendly Index</b> <br>  Some generalized criterion for assessing how well an employee interacts with a client.  Based on this indicator, it is possible to draw conclusions about changes in employee salaries, the need for training to improve service quality, etc. <br><br>  <b>Patient Satisfaction Index</b> <br>  With a negative index, you can try to contact the patient and get feedback on his problems.  You can also try to develop a program to encourage dissatisfied patients to increase their loyalty (to offer bonuses, discounts, etc.) <br><br>  <b>Patient Group Satisfaction Index</b> <br>  On a group of patients, you can explore global trends.  Example: the indices were approximately equal in the male and female clientele.  However, since last month there has been a sharp decline among women.  After studying, it is concluded that a new nurse is now working in the gynecology department, who is extremely unfriendly to patients. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  This complex will require certain costs for development and implementation, however, it will allow to significantly monitor the quality of service and respond to various situations in a timely manner.  It will also allow the evaluation to be carried out continuously, without wasting staff effort on manually rewriting the results from table to table for a report to management. <br>  I want to get constructive criticism of the concept.  It would be interesting to hear your ideas on this. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  Amended the article.  Thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/antelle/" class="user_link">Antelle</a> for simplifying the idea with admission identifiers, and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/edogs/" class="user_link">edogs</a> for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa video message and a useful comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210234/</a></p>
