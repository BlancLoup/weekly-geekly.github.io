      1. We bought a piece of iron for the price of a bottle of good vodka that should act as a router and does it not work or does it work sloppy?  <i>Blame the provider!</i> <br>  2. Are we so cool that we put Ubuntu or some other widely used distribution kit and the boys with the puncher who are connecting do not want to make ifconfig to see the subscriber's MAC?  <i>Ayayay what a bad provider!</i> <br>  3. Viruses ate Our Windows and nothing except the ICMP interface goes?  <i>Of course, bad support is not willing to cure viruses on the phone and heal the user's karma remotely!</i> <br>  4. We have EXTREMELY disconnected the network card and we are indignant that a boy who came through the city floor on foot requires $ 1.25 / 10 hryvnia / 38 rubles for a call?  <i>Rigging and provider lawlessness!</i> <br>  5. We intended (how?) Too little speed to New Guinea - where is our promised megabit for 30 hryvnia / 100 rubles?  <i>Provider holds us for fools!</i> <br>  6. SUDDENLY from the account evaporated gig traffic in money equivalent?  We did not <b>swing</b> anything <b>!</b>  We just listened to music in contact, watched a video on YouTube, talked to relatives on Skype and looked at aunts on different sites.  <b>But we did not download anything</b> for what we were withdrawn money?  <i>The provider is robbing us!</i> <br><br>  Are you funny?  Maybe sad? <br>  I am sad - let's mourn together. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I can recall many more situations emerging in the comments and causing a storm of indignation among the same hamsters and housewives.  Most of all it is a shame to see such on such resource as Habr.  It is really embarrassing and disgusting to see how people who identify themselves in the IT sphere write such shameful comments and posts. <br><br>  Let's start debriefing from the point of view of this most notorious provider with its so hated technical support based on real-life daily statistics? <br><br>  Several adequate people all the same, timidly stated that according to statistics, 95% of the problems are customer‚Äôs problems with his hands and equipment and to demand free support in these 95% of cases is at least silly.  I am forced to disagree - according to statistics, at best, only every 50th customer‚Äôs call signals real problems from the provider. <br><br>  Call statistics for today from our support (KTB / Docsis / FTTB) status from 9 am to 15 days: <br>  - 11 calls with the wording "Internet does not work" <br>  - 2 calls with the wording ‚Äúboys pay money for you?‚Äù <br>  - 6 calls with the reason "does not show the TV" <br>  - 3 calls with the reason "badly shows the TV" <br>  - 2 calls with the wording ‚ÄúI changed the home router / mother with the integrated network card - I want to dictate the fresh MAC‚Äù <br><br>  Let's see what a more detailed examination are these "problems with the provider"? <br><br>  out of 11 calls with the wording "Internet does not work" <br><br>  Solved by phone: <br>  - 3 disabled network adapters (for me, user motivation is always a mystery) <br>  - 3 forgotten payments for the Internet (oh how unexpectedly a new month came 15 days ago), one of them with the scandal <i>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt use unlimited last month why should I pay this month ??!‚Äù</i> - there is a point in the price list about freezing - defrosting an account if the service is not used - but who reads them?  And so the telepathic provider is not to blame. <br>  - 2 reinstalled Windows users decided that installing drivers on a network adapter (nfors / yukon) is optional <br>  - 1 dropped twisted pair from network card <br>  - 2 "unscrewed in the process of permutations without authorization" F-ki from Docsis modem <br><br>  from 2 calls with the phrase ‚Äúboys, what do you pay money for?‚Äù: <br><br>  Solved by phone: <br>  - 1 Windows drop in BSOD when trying to get an ip by DHCP <br><br>  A small digression on how a home call is made: <br>  If the support sees that the client does not know where the ‚Äústart‚Äù button is located or cannot find where ‚Äú2 monitors with the inscription - LAN connection‚Äù due to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where the watch is,‚Äù he can offer unobtrusively (there is an average maximum once a month) send to the user a ‚Äúqualified specialist to solve the problem‚Äù.  Why once a month?  Because users, who are very pleased, often understand that it is impossible to undertake something personally and ask themselves to ‚Äúsend us a boy‚Äù <br>  After ‚Äúsend us a boy‚Äù you should always talk: <br>  <i>- The call is charged if the problem is on the client side</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes, I know, send - I really need the Internet</i> <br><br>  All people who have access to the phone in this company are trained on the first phrase without departing from the text.  Then pretends to be one of the "boys" of the appropriate qualification (someone smells smell from the noise on the highway, someone can dig out in Windows and calm the user firewall), where he is, update the time to reach the client, specify the address, telephone. <br><br>  Requested the expulsion of boys at home: <br>  - a self-appointed relative, a guru of the user, an aipishka of the type 123.123.123.1, followed by a scandal ‚Äúfor which I have 10 hryvnias ($ 1.2), have you become completely bummed?‚Äù <br><br>  Moving on to the television problems of the morning: <br><br>  out of 6 calls with the reason "does not show the TV" <br>  - 3 disabled after a two-month delay defaulter <br>  - 1 coax crushed by the cabinet <br>  - 1 mystically gnawed coax (mystical because there are no domestic animals) <br>  - 1 new TV - boys punctured the aunt for auto tuning and went on about their business for free - the call was on the way for lunch <br><br>  out of 3 calls with the cause ‚Äúbadly shows the TV‚Äù: <br><br>  - 1 cut off an illegal neighbor - the access cable was restored for free (the contract states that everything inside the apartment is a user, everything outside is ours) <br>  - 1 in a private house 4 TVs through 3 Chinese splitters - why would they work perfectly? <br>  - 1 was not at home <br><br>  And the nice part of the story: <br><br>  - 2 calls with the wording ‚ÄúI changed the home router / mother with the integrated network card - I want to dictate the fresh MAC‚Äù <br>  ended with 4 clicks on billing and thank-you. <br><br>  We look into the handicraft system of tickets and see the fresh 2 applications already processed by support from users.  I quote literally, with preservation of the author's style for connoisseurs of the Ukrainian language: <br><br>  - ‚Äúon call on s—ñti‚Äù <br>  - ‚Äúpermanently hang and glitch‚Äù <br><br>  Here is such a rosy picture of the guiltyness of the whole provider emerges for part-time work.  And so every day.  Every day I see evil support in a smoking room, every day I see sad girls on the phone of which 3 times a week are obliged to obscenely thankful customers.  Every day I see gloomy installers returning from the subscriber who decided that 2 hours of drilling reinforced concrete, and laying 80 meters of UTP on dovecotes where pigeons really live and die, crawling in space 50 cm in height 10 of which takes a litter is not worth 30 hryvnia (120 rubles) which they asked for two (!).  Sometimes this is confirmed by angry complaints to the authorities and all existing instances with the text ‚Äútse reketiri vimagali for change of money from 30 hryvnias per tenant for the subscriber's line‚Äù. <br><br>  The post of the administrator saves from communication with customers very well, but sometimes they get to me.  For myself, I divide them into 2 categories - clients from communication with whom I can not experience anything but pleasure and extremely obstinate still seeking redirects from support providers to me with the argument ‚Äúgive me some co-operative‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, there are customers conversation with which sounds like: <br><br>  - I have Linux (Makos / Solaris) <br>  - So what? <br><br>  Yes, yes, this is a categorically correct answer, he immediately sorts people into those who ‚Äúhave Linux ‚Äî be afraid‚Äù and those who are interested in finding out the MTU or DNS addresses of servers that they want <b>to</b> register in /etc/resolv.conf <br><br>  With the first one, the conversation is rather brief - dhcp under your ubunt (distr - 99% ubunt, 1% suzya) know how to configure?  Mac dictate?  Not?  Then one of the younger administrators will go to you - but this is for a fee.  (Did you wait for a telephone girl trained on tuning sysctl, understanding snmp and with deep knowledge of FreeBSD / Solaris administration? Are you ready to pay for keeping such a girl?) <br><br>  With the latter, the conversation usually ends with the dictation of dns, defaultedgeyvayu under the methodical cloning of the carcass or emax on the other end of the wire (distr - dzhent or debian).  Sometimes, if the client has a cheerful mood and he himself keeps up the conversation (some sociable debians are), it is nice and easy to talk about fry vs Linux or iptables vs ipfw vs pf. <br><br>  There are still gloomy corporate employees setting up their branches with frey and tsiska simply dictating the poppy device and not asking for only occasional dns. <br><br>  In two years of full-fledged administration combined with permanent sawing, billing has already been heard from clients and about ‚Äúyou robbing us‚Äù several times.  For some reason, this is upon closer inspection flow-cat |  Flow-print turned out to be either spam traffic on port 25, or a self-renewed Windows / antivirus, or, most often, a simple misunderstanding of what traffic really is (well, I didn‚Äôt download anything - just like YouTube for 3 hours). <br><br>  Measurements of speed with any speed tests or jump of something unknown where have already firmly entered the normal life of a provider.  It‚Äôs impossible to get at least the rudiments of understanding of routing and why it‚Äôs pouring from one place on the 4 Mbit / s promised to it and from the other on incomplete 16 Kbps.  Those who are able to dial traceroute google.com with such support questions do not call.  The rest is useless to explain and more expensive.  Yes, there are cases when it is possible to turn the routing to the needs of a specific client, rassovyvat his session in one of several existing channels (well, there is so much easier for a corporate vpn), but this is a completely different service and it costs quite different money that a typical user will pay not ready because of a banal misunderstanding, and even if there is no need to be honest, he does not need it. <br><br>  The reason is not in the user.  And not even in the mentality as it may seem - these are all secondary causes.  The primary reason lies only in the fact that the <b>user does not understand</b> .  Does not understand too much in order to properly treat the provider: <br><br>  - for what he pays money? <br>  - what kind of speed do they sell him and how do they measure it? <br>  - why is 40 minutes of walking on foot to him and as many more back because of the user's inability to turn on their own lace in the device cost 60 rubles? <br>  To bring this to consciousness is impossible and there is no need.  Everyone is accustomed to and just do their job - they buy hardware, change burned switches and cmts, solder optics, crimp coaxial, write a fashionable system ticket in order for the user to tell which <b>provider is bad</b> . <br><br>  There are good users who know where all the same ‚Äúcontrol panel‚Äù and call support to say that the Internet does not work in the house because the electricity is simply turned off - these are really the people for whom you want to throw off prices, make promotions and make new services every season.  There will never be a majority or even more than 10%, but these are users who really appreciate quality service and are ready to pay for it. <br><br>  I apologize for my Russian - I was not taught in my school. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70305/</a></p>
