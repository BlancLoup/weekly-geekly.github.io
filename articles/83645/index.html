  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Journey to Mars One Way</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://www.manatee.k12.fl.us/sites/elementary/samoset/mathlabplanets_files/PIA01592mars.jpg" alt="image">  When Neil Armstrong in 1969 made a "giant step for humanity", setting foot on the moon, the entire population of the Earth hoped that it was the beginning of the exploration of the planets, first close, then distant, then other systems.  However, 40 years have passed, and man has not advanced in space exploration.  As before, all its activity in this matter occurs in near-earth orbit.  Most often, the enthusiasm of scientists and astronauts is not comparable with the budget that governments are willing to provide for space exploration.  For example, the NASA budget for 2010 does not provide for any serious research or breakthroughs. <br><br>  And all require some kind of breakthrough, some step forward.  The landing of another astronaut on the surface of the moon no longer keeps millions of people at television screens.  Everyone, both scientists and simple <i>onlookers,</i> wants more.  And, of course, everyone looks to Mars in the first place.  This is the closest planet to us and has very similar parameters that may well be suitable for creating and maintaining life.  So why are we not there yet? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No government is willing to fork out on such a journey, let alone the complexity of planning and implementing such an expedition and creating the necessary equipment, etc.  In the coming decades, no one plans anything like that. <br><br>  American physicist Paul Davis at a conference organized by NASA, put forward a very interesting theory, according to which a trip to Mars is possible, moreover, it is necessary.  And if the space institutions of several large countries unite, this expedition will be easily organized from a financial point of view, moreover, the organization of the journey will take ‚Äúonly‚Äù 20 years.

      The first expedition will (according to the Davis plan) consist of only four people, of course, scientists and engineers.  The peculiarity is that it will be a one way trip - without even planning or the possibility of returning back to Earth.  However, this is not a voluntary suicide.  On the contrary, the pioneers will have to establish a colony, which over time will be able to turn a settlement, then into a town, and so on. <br><br>  If you do not plan a trip back, you can save up to 80% of the cost of fuel and equipment.  The sources of energy and equipment needed on the surface of Mars can be sent in advance, in an unmanned shuttle, and only when confirmation of its successful landing will be received can you send people to the Red Planet. <br>  In the future, the necessary resources will be sent from Earth every 2 years, also in unmanned ships. <br>  This, of course, will be a risky expedition, but no more dangerous than climbing or parachuting. <br>  Naturally, gradually, more people will be sent to Mars and over the course of a couple of centuries the colony will develop enough to exist without support from Earth (of course, this does not mean that support MUST cease). <br><br>  Unfortunately, the life expectancy of the first Martians will be quite short, due to the high background radiation, the lack of advanced medical technology and low gravity. <br>  However, the fact that taking off and landing are the most dangerous stages of any space mission can be cited as an argument ‚Äúfor‚Äù.  Left on Mars, the researchers did not put themselves at risk for the second time. <br><br>  Paul Davis talked about this idea to many scientists and, according to him, everyone spoke of her very positively.  If you wonder who wants to voluntarily leave the Earth forever and rush into dangerous uncertainty, then you will be surprised how many young and not very young scientists admitted that they would not refuse to participate in such an expedition to Mars if there was such an opportunity. <br><br>  So from a scientific and financial point of view, it all makes sense.  One question remains: WHY? <br><br>  A settlement on Mars will not only increase our knowledge of the geology of Mars, it is not among the main objectives.  If there are microorganisms on Mars (and there is enough evidence for this), their research can revolutionize biology, medicine and biotechnology. <br><br>  Mars will also be an excellent base for the subsequent study of the main asteroid belt.  After the colony becomes independent, it can be considered as a back-up of the Earth‚Äôs population in the event of a cataclysm.  Recently, our planet has experienced a lot of epidemics, dangers from comets and asteroids, world wars, global warming and many other terrible.  So, if the Earth is destined to die in one of the more powerful versions of the above cataclysms, the Martian settlement will be the very island on which the intelligent life in the solar system will remain. <br><br>  Thus, the implementation of the theory of Paul Davis is real and achievable at the present stage of human development.  Maybe he will be able to convince the world powers of the expediency of such an expedition, and then, perhaps, during your lifetime,% username%, a person will set foot on the red Martian soil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/526/b42/382/526b42382337491029b15821eae04655.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83645/</a></p>
