  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Designers from the Nervous System printed a translucent dress on a 3D printer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, clothing designers have often experimented with 3D technologies, creating very effective, but not very practical, devices, such as an <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/58417/dita-fon-teese-ipad-n-3d-printer/">evening dress</a> for the star of burlesque Dita Von Teese.  Not long ago, successive designers from the American company Nervous System presented an entire online service for modeling clothes, and recently demonstrated its capabilities by printing a light and very playful dress.  The thing turned out to be so airy and enticing that the New York Museum of Modern Art is already interested in it, requesting accompanying videos and design software along with the prototype itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef3/dfd/e02/ef3dfde020864f4286f68478253cb26c.png"><br><br>  The guys from the Nervous System for some reason call their technology ‚Äú4D printing‚Äù, although the well-known method of selective laser sintering (SLS), which uses nylon powder as a material, was used to create the dress.  Since they have not yet acquired their Nervous System production, they used the services of <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a> , a former Philips division, to print a test sample.  By the way, the already mentioned Dita Von Teese dress was printed there. <a name="habracut"></a>

      According to the developers, the full production cycle took about 48 hours.  The 3D model of the dress consists of 2279 triangles of different sizes, connected to each other with the help of 3316 microscopic loops.  The resulting design did not require assembly: the creators needed only to remove the folded dress from the powder form, thoroughly clean it, straighten and carefully design all the loops.  "Without departing from the cash register" they dressed a beautiful assistant in it, having organized a spectacular photo session surrounded by 3d printers and mysterious employees in respirators and white coats. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wdRswasftfI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhKfRWixNfUzuRNvL1YSUEUxrjefg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Unlike traditional fabrics, dress material is not uniform in its structure.  Its different parts differ in the degree of stiffness, flexibility, size of fragments and holes, as well as in the pattern that nylon triangles form.  To create virtual clothes Nervous System developed a special application Kinematics.  In it, anyone can create a virtual model of a dress, skirt or T-shirt from scratch, adjusting it to a specific figure.  To do this, you need to scan the body of the future owner, which will be used in the application as a virtual dummy.  Kinematics Cloth allows you to select a specific model of the dress, adjust its length, type of cut, pattern and fit to a virtual dummy with millimeter accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/e5e/a91/740e5ea91da642889cc1597bda64853c.jpg"><br><br>  Another tool included in the Kinematics package is called the Kinematics Fold.  It allows you to fold a full-size model of the dress into a compact 3D prototype that corresponds to the working volume of most SLS printers.  The calculation of this transformation is carried out in the open physics engine <a href="http://ode.org/">Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)</a> .  As a result, Kinematics Fold reduces the size of the dress by 85%, turning it into a mysterious artifact, which is then so fun to dig out from the depths of nylon powder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f8/3de/1a3/5f83de1a36fa47929d4fdea568ed34e4.jpg"><br><br>  However, technology technology, and the commercial goal of the project is quite transparent.  As you might guess, all these enticing photos with half-naked dancers and videos with long-legged beauties are just a competent promotion, demonstrating the capabilities of the Nervous System and, mainly, advertising the Kinematics Cloth application.  The team hopes that now their service will gain wide popularity and are preparing for an influx of customers rushing to make their ladies happy for Christmas with a translucent 3D outfit.  It is difficult to say whether this project will be accompanied by commercial success, but it has already entered the history of modern art. <br><br>  Author: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/%2BAndreyGasilin/posts">Andrey Gasilin</a> <br>  Source: <a href="http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/blog/%3Fp%3D6280">Nervous System</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364423/</a></p>
