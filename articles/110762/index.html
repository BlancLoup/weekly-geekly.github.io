At least that's what he called his site ( <a href="http://danhatesspam.com/">Danhatesspam.com</a> ).  But in fact, he is probably the only person in the world who, as a child, rejoices at every new spam letter that has entered his mailbox.  More precisely, in one of hundreds of his mailboxes. <br><br>  The fact is that Daniel Belsham has been earning a living from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101226/ap_on_hi_te/us_anti_spam_crusader">anti-spam activity</a> since 2002.  The main source of income is compensation for lawsuits, which he has won <a href="http://danhatesspam.com/smallclaims.html">42</a> since 2002.  Even more lawsuits are now in production and are a guarantee of Dan‚Äôs comfortable existence in the coming years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Daniel Balsam worked as a marketer until 2002, when he was finally given suggestions to enlarge his penis and chest, which were in tons in the mailbox.  Then he decided to quit his job, graduate from law college and start a career as a lawyer.  In the same 2002, Dan launched the site Danhatesspam.com and began to sue spammers.

      He received a cherished law degree only in 2008, and by that time a couple of dozen spamming scalps had already accumulated on his trophy shelf.  And no less important - more than $ 1 million of honestly earned dollars in the form of compensation for damage.  This is quite enough for life, and in the future, Daniel hopes to significantly increase his income.  He specializes in showdowns with large companies, which are more likely to pay a small amount by their standards, so as not to bring the matter to a huge collective action in court.  Thus, Daniel is satisfied with small victories of several thousand or tens of thousands of dollars each. <br><br>  For example, in November, he received $ 4,000 from Various Inc.  (owner of the erotic dating service AdultFriendFinder.com), who sent to each of his four mailboxes one letter with the same content: ‚ÄúHello my name is Rebecca, I love you‚Äù.  This is the fourth time the company Various Inc.  pays Daniel compensation for a similar claim.  In the latter case, the company filed an appeal, which will be considered on January 5. <br><br>  At the trial against the spam company Trancos Inc.  in March 2010, it turned out that an advanced lawyer owns more than 100 mailboxes.  He is a kind of "spamming hunter".  By the way, some colleagues from among the ill-wishers mock Dan for such tactics and even open parody sites ( <a href="http://danhatespam.com/">one such</a> Dan managed to sue recently).  A number of lawsuits were also filed against him by semi-legal spammers, mainly related to the disclosure of confidential information regarding the terms of the agreement. <br><br>  But Belsam is not discouraged and continues the sacred struggle with spammers, which has proven so profitable.  The list of won claims on his website is periodically updated.  ‚ÄúDo not want to get on this list?  - it says on the page - do not send me spam! ‚Äù.  Well, here again, Daniel cunning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110762/</a></p>
