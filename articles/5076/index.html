  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobil Must Die (Fri.)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yes, I do not like mobile phones and am not afraid to admit it to the whole world in general and to the Shabana district in particular.  Huge goosebumps run over me when my mobile phone vibrates in my pocket anxiously.  My eyeballs fill with blood at the sight of a person chatting hands-free.  I am arranging a bloody Massacre for children, who in public transport decided to listen to all the tunes of their mobile friend.  Children, of course, flowers, children, of course, joy, but got it!  How can I survive in this hostile mobile world? <br><br>  Of course, I'm exaggerating.  Everything is not so bad, especially when I remember to drink a portion of valerian for the night.  And I am absolutely not going to dispute the fact that mobile phones are a very convenient and modern thing.  Why should I lie on the rail of progress?  Business people without a small telephone in their inner jacket pocket feel probably inferior.  And I, on the contrary, - with a mobile phone in my pocket, feel discomfort and agular mlyavasts.  I see that the paranoids immediately start up: ‚ÄúThis same electromagnetic radiation severely affects your ... hmm ... internal organs!  You can not carry a mobile phone in your pocket!  It can only be in the arm extended two meters from the body! ‚ÄùBut that's not the point. <br><br>  First, now I can be reached at any point of our blue-eyed.  And if I decide to make a total roaming out of mazahist motives, then at any point of the land.  I hate this feature of a mobile phone.  If I have a mobile phone, then I need to answer the calls.  What, turn it off and carry in your pocket like a key chain?  Even such a perverted hamster, like me, is unlikely to want to use this expensive and, most importantly, a big key chain.  Yes, and you have to call, report: ‚ÄúI had to run into the club on business, now I‚Äôll quickly sink a liter of whiskey, then take the girl off and after three hours I'm at home.  Honey, don't worry.  With tears in my eyes I remember the telephoneless childhood: ‚ÄúMom, we will go for a walk with the guys, I will be in the evening‚Äù, and later: ‚ÄúI could not warn that I would come at three in the morning because there was not a single payphone nearby.  What did you do so late?  Football was played, Avseev's ball glows in the dark.  Mom, don't worry. ‚Äù  Feel the difference?  And now, after all, do not hide and hide.  Sometimes, of course, you can use: ‚ÄúOh, and I did not hear you calling me,‚Äù or: ‚ÄúI have outgoing disconnected - I can not call back,‚Äù and best of all: ‚ÄúThe subscriber died or is about to die.‚Äù  But this is not our method, because you can lie only for reasons of humanism.

      Secondly, mobiles have long been successfully and successfully crowding out normal human communication, when you can strike the eye and the interlocutor.  Let me give you an example: for the last three months, one of my best friends, Maxim, talked with me exclusively by a magic handset - a mobile phone.  He has no time to visit me (from his place to my house about three hundred meters), it is much easier to chat on the phone.  I already began to forget what he looks like.  Yes, and glav.red.  ‚ÄúKV‚Äù Sergey Poznyak, for example, constantly swears for delaying articles by phone.  No, to come and personally break on the heaters.  Live communication all the same!
