  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exercise for continuous improvement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to analytical agencies in 2012, the companies spent almost $ 300 billion on trainings, seminars and conferences.  And next year they plan to spend even more.  Why do companies spend so much money?  Probably because they believe that these investments will help employees develop professionally, and therefore do their job better.  But is there really such a dependency? <a name="habracut"></a>  Is the manager attending the training on managing people really starting to manage better?  Communicating with people who attended trainings, and even thinking about myself, I discovered a sad fact.  After some time, most of what was heard and tested at the training is forgotten and is not applied in practice.  It happens that after training you find yourself in a situation in which you behave differently from what you were taught.  And you think why did this happen?  I was taught how to behave.  I will express my opinion on why this is happening and what can be done about it. <br><br>  Being engaged in many years of sports, I found an analogy with him.  Consider a cool player who gives phenomenal passes and performs the most accurate shots on goal.  In order for him to do it freely, he spent many hours and completed thousands (and maybe millions) of exercises.  These thousands of exercises helped him bring the passes and strikes to automatism.  And during the game, he does not think about them.  Let us return to our trainings and imagine that this footballer, before becoming cool, attended the training, where he was given a complete theory of strikes, passes and conducted several practical exercises.  After that, he was simply sent to play a lot, hoping that everything he learned in one day would be applied on the field.  Personally, I do not believe that in such a situation he would become cool.  But with traditional corporate training this is exactly what happens. <br><br>  In order not to look like a football player who visited the training once, you need to perform regular exercises that will help to consolidate and bring to the automatism skills and knowledge from the trainings.  Once, I do not remember where and when, I heard about one such.  I will share it.

      The center of the exercise is a memory card, elements of which are questions and areas over which you need to work.  Those.  need to wonder.  what I want to improve, what I need to constantly think about and where there might be problems.  Exercise is to open this map every day before starting work and remind yourself of problem areas.  Of course, just looking at the map is not enough, you need to strive to bring it to life.  And how to do it, a separate story.  This exercise fits very well with Japanese Kaizen philosophy, the essence of which is continuous improvement. <br><br>  Consider a specific example on a manager who seeks to continuously improve himself and the environment for which he is responsible.  Suppose he identifies several areas for improvement: personal qualities, processes, teams, and personal time management.  And for each direction he asks specific questions and topics.  The map may look like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7fd/49d/83e/7fd49d83ed25a13999fa547598ded031.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can make a similar map based on your goals and objectives. <br><br>  I suppose that such an exercise is not for everyone, but before deny, I urge to try.  There is a chance that you will like it.  It will be interesting to see the comments of those who try. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172891/</a></p>
