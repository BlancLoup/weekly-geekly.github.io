    <h5>  Specifications </h5><br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 117.5 x 58.5 x 11.9mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 130 grams <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm QSD8650 Snapdragon with a frequency of 1GHz <br>  <b>Base operating system:</b> Android OS 2.1 with HTC Sense <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512MB <br>  <b>Internal memory:</b> 8GB <br>  <b>Display:</b> AMOLED 3.7 "with 480x800 WVGA resolution <br>  <b>Network:</b> CDMA2000, 1xRTT / 1xEVDO / 1xEVDO rev.  A <br>  <b>Peripherals:</b> GPS, Bluetooth 2.1 with FTP / OPP, Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / (n?), 3.5mm stereo jack, micro-USB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 8 megapixels, autofocus, flash <br>  <b>Memory</b> cards <b>:</b> microSD with format support (SD2.0), cards up to 32GB are supported <br><br>  <b>Equipment.</b> <br>  As far as I understand, the times of cool bundles for CDMA phones are over on the HTC Touch Pro.  In a very small box they showed up: the device itself, usb-cord, battery, charging and 4 books of "waste paper".  There was not even a memory card for at least 2GB, which was in the HTC Hero, not to mention the 16GB card that came with the Motorola Droid.  Although, in fact, this is offset by 8GB of internal memory.  After a while it was found out on the phone screen that there is also a glued-in protective film, very convenient, thanks. <br><br><h5>  General view and first impressions. </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/8314/69807692.png"></div><br>  After the Moto Droid, the phone was very nice in the hand.  The absence of 40 extra grams in weight is very sensitive.  The position in the hand feels as if the phone is slightly arched.  The body is very well fitted, no shifts, gaps, etc. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/2114/28678769.png"></div><br>  To the touch, the material of the back cover is like rubberized plastic, very pleasant.  The front part looks like a very hard plastic, but I will not say for sure, not an expert, so if anyone knows, please correct. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/9905/93603063.png"></div><br>  Removing the back cover does not want to return it to its place.  The inner part is painted in a very bright red color.  To change the memory card, you do not need to turn off the phone and remove the battery, and I consider this practice of hiding a memory card to be flawed, although I understand that this is required for hamsters. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/2717/85770131.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/5494/36104181.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4537/51732369.png"></div><br>  A little tar.  No matter how beautiful it all looked, the case seems to be unreliable.  Very much, I'm not sure that when you first fall light on a hard surface, the back end will scatter, too thin and delicate.  Check the time.  The second spoon is the location of the microUSB.  When the device is on recharging, the cord interferes with the normal position in the hand. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/8355/61015685.png"></div><br><br><h5>  Display. </h5><br>  Just indescribably.  3.7 inches fit in a compact case with thin sides.  Color rendering on a great level.  No words only emotions.  Just great playback of high-resolution videos from Youtube; viewing is a pleasure.  Someone will say - "Fuu, again gloss!", But I can not imagine a matte display on such devices.  The prints, of course, remain, but they are also easily erased.  By the way, HTC, well, at least they would have put a rag for the screen, taking care of the user and all that! <br><br><h5>  The first experience of use. </h5><br><h6>  Phone and phone book: </h6><br>  I have more than 300-400 contacts divided by groups of companies, so the phone book is a very important parameter for me.  Before Incredible, I had a Motorola Droid with a naked Android 2.1.  Prior to this HTC Hero with 1.6.  Neither the droid nor the HTC Hero didn‚Äôt suit me the standard book.  Droid didn‚Äôt breakdown into groups, and Hero generally slowed down with Sense, and the problem with the small screen affected.  On HTC Incredible, the problem has disappeared ... no, it‚Äôs not just that it has disappeared, it just does not exist ... This notebook fully satisfies my needs.  Groups of Companies, in each Group contacts.  With 280 contacts scored, there is not even a mention of brakes, the phone works out instantly both when searching from a book and when searching for ‚Äúauto-substitution‚Äù when dialing a number.  Bravo - Sense! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/3572/27557046.png"></div><br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> no existing programs to date replace normal work with the contact book.</i>  <i>Either they are slowing down or they are buggy, or just uncomfortable to use in terms of the interface.</i> <br><br><h6>  Web Surfing: </h6><br>  On the Droid-e, everything was fine with this, but it still affects the increase in processor speed and memory increase.  I do not use the standard browser, but I immediately put a more advanced one - Dolphin Browser (not HD), which makes it more comfortable to work with Starchers. <br>  What really enjoyed working with Flash.  Well, finally, from my favorite cartoons site, you can watch Futurama and Simpsons directly.  But the wife rejected, as the game Vkontakte does not open.  :) <br><br><h6>  Gugloservisy: </h6><br>  There is nothing special to describe here, all Google services work flawlessly.  Of particular note is the practice of working with GMail.  Affects processor power, opening file attachments, displaying pictures - just great.  Moto Droid did not allow so comfortable work. <br><br><h6>  8 megapixel camera: </h6><br>  8 mpx - WOW ?!  This is probably the weakest point of the device.  Well, when will HTC finally start installing normal cameras?  The quality of photos, compared with Moto Droid - terrible.  Here are two photos for comparison (full size links): MotoDroid - on the left, HTC - on the right. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img816.imageshack.us/img816/9400/24613466.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://img816.imageshack.us/img816/3602/20410764.png"></a> <br><br>  If you do not use autofocus, in principle, more or less quality can be achieved, but all the same - sucks.  The video is similar. <br>  But thanks for the flash - a great flashlight ... :) <br><br><h6>  1x network and EVDO: </h6><br>  One of the reasons for parting with the Moto Droid is a very poor-quality microphone and proximity sensor to the ear.  After ear dialing the phone number during the conversation the tenth time - begins to bother.  In HTC Incredible - as in the HTC Droid Eris - this problem is not present.  The microphone is just great, the sound of the speaker is clear, but the volume is still not enough (tested when driving at 110-130 on the highway with an open window, as well as when talking in a cafe during a football match). <br>  I don‚Äôt know how-where, but in our Odessa and Odessa region I could not find an area without EVDO coverage from Intertelecom.  Data transfer rate from 1.5 to 2.1 Mbit.  Always in touch, always access to mail and twitter.  Actually, maybe I was just lucky with my place of residence.  :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/322/84497857.png"></div><br><br><h6>  Battery: </h6><br>  The eternal problem is the battery.  This time a pleasant surprise.  With infrequent conversations (about 30-35 minutes a day), with EVDO turned on, updates every five minutes (mail, twitter, checking programs), the battery lasted two days (day, night, day).  But this is rarely the case, so we check under load.  A toy with good graphics (iCommando) put the battery in just ... 4 hours!  This was even more surprising, since the Moto Droid is already in 1 hour 20 minutes under the same conditions.  In general, I liked the battery, but there are more on ebay and advanced ones. <br>  <i><b>Note: it is</b> suggested that it is due to the lower consumption of AMOLED displays and an increased operating time is achieved.</i>  <i>If anyone understands this more, I will be glad to comment.</i> <br><br><h6>  Periphery: </h6><br>  <b>GPS</b> - as always works perfectly.  Downloading and maintaining a constant ephemeris allows the device to open the location with a cold start in 20 seconds.  Constantly enabled GPS and using it in conjunction with Google Latitude reduces the possibility of using the phone to 1 daylight day, which is basically enough, considering that on Moto Droid the estimated time was no more than 5-6 hours with GPS turned on. <br>  <b>Wi-Fi.</b>  As with the camera - it's a shame here.  Why not put the Wi-Fi 802.11n standard?  Because of this, I had to install an old router, since the entire home network was transferred to 802.11n and for the sake of a single device, it would not work to slow down.  Although considering that the cost of traffic is cheap, and in the 700Mb package, I don‚Äôt remember when I turned on the last time Wi-Fi.  <b>In the comments, microKat suggested that 802.11n hardware is supported, but not unlocked by the manufacturer in the firmware.</b>  <b>In custom firmware has already been implemented, but so far you do not want to use raw.</b> <br>  <b>Bluetooth</b>  So I couldn‚Äôt quickly set up Bluetooth to send and receive files, but I don‚Äôt use it, because these experiences are still ahead. <br><br><h5>  BARREL of tar: </h5><br>  Unfortunately, HTC no longer has confidence in Android OS updates, but I really hope that they will correct their attitude at least to the flagship model and upgrade to 2.2 or 2.x will not have to wait six months, or even a year.  While acquiring this device, I reconciled beforehand that there would be no updates. <br><br><h5>  Summarizing (IMHO): </h5><br>  It may sound loud, but I will say. <br>  <b>Bravo HTC!</b>  <b>It is the FIRST device which combined in itself convenient use, both the TELEPHONE, and the INTERNET.</b> <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> And last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude that in Ukraine there are such companies as Intertelecom and People.Net, which allow you to use good and high-quality Internet not for fabulous money.  GSM operators have someone to learn from.  <b>Do not take for advertising!</b>  <b>And then I was already counted among Inter's advertisers.</b> <br><br>  <b>PS-2:</b> If you are interested in any more questions about it, ask in a personal or in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98521/</a></p>
