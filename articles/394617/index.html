After the raid on the Ghetto, the former leader of the local gang licked his wounds and tried not to leave his shelter unnecessarily. <br><br>  - Chef, how are you?  - Erik, his new assistant, entered the room, one of those few who managed to get out of the old sewer through the old sewers. <br><br>  “Okay,” Tommy rose from his seat to stretch his sore muscles. <br><br>  After the raid, he began to drink and drink a lot.  Almost two weeks of hard drinking, the feelings, almost brought him to the grave, but Thomas managed to pull himself together. <br><br>  And now he wanted only one thing - revenge. <br><br>  Several night raids on military bases and they managed to acquire enough explosives to level half of the city.  But, the saddest thing is that Joe never returned, and there was no news either from Commander Matthew or from the head camp. <br><br>  “Better tell me,” Tommy asked Eric. “Is everything ready with us?” <br><br>  The fighter froze.  As soon as Tommy left the bout, he made it clear that the escape from the ghetto was only a postponement of their death, and not a miraculous salvation.  The only question is how they all die.  Some left immediately, a couple more people in a few days.  Tommy did not hold anyone because he could not make his people die for his ideas. <br><br>  - Done, something is ready, only strange things are happening. <br><br>  - What do you mean?  - Tommy asked. <br><br>  “They whispered to me here that a couple of weeks ago someone brutally killed Little One,” Eric answered, “they tied me to a wall and broke half of the bones with a blow on the back.  If I did not know that you, the chief, have been here all this time, I would have thought that it was you who dealt with this rat.  Whoever it was, he was damn strong.  And angry. <br><br>  - Yes?  Right half the bones? <br><br>  “It feels like a sledgehammer has been lowered around his neck,” Eric answered. “Yes, and his scum were killed by the polls, in the Ghetto now another redistribution of power.” <br><br>  Thomas sat back at the table. <br><br>  “There’s a bastard and a road,” he finally said, “without such as Small, this world will become a little cleaner, although I don’t believe that it can save anything.” <br><br>  He wanted to drink.  Again plunge into the sweet dope of alcohol, where the border between reality and hope is blurred.  Where they are not destroyed by telepaths, where his friends, and most importantly Joe, are still with him. <br><br>  He slapped his hands over his knees, rose and, waving his hand at Eric, followed him, and went into the room, which they called the armory. <br><br>  On the tables made of old plywood and boxes, the explosives prepared by his people were neatly lying: stacks of charges with remote fuses and two dozen suicide belts.  A little distance away, the stolen weapons and battle suits stood against the wall.  Surprisingly, they even managed to get a prototype, which climbed onto their giant commander, which the latter was extremely pleased with. <br><br>  Erik stands still behind the chief, waiting for his verdict, but Tommy was silent. <br><br>  - Today we have what?  Friday?  “Finally, Tommy broke the silence,” gather the guys in the cafeteria, we need to discuss our plan again.  And say goodbye. <br><br>  Within fifteen minutes, everyone was assembled.  Baby Tommy looked around the room, breathed deeply and started. <br><br>  - Guys, I think that for almost all those present it will be the last day.  If someone is not ready to die, he believes that everything will get better and he will be able to find a place in this city - I do not hold and do not blame anyone. <br><br>  Tommy was silent, waiting for at least some reaction.  Nobody even moved - everyone who wanted to leave was already gone.  Only those who lost everything during the Ghetto storming were left: families, loved ones and, most importantly, hope. <br><br>  “Well,” the giant looked around the room once more, “then we will assume that you are all ready.”  Guys - do not meddle on the rampage.  Let our attack be suicidal and have one goal - to sow chaos and destruction, remember: the longer you stay alive, the more you can do.  Have everyone broken up into pairs? <br><br>  The fighters in the room according buzzed. <br><br>  - Ok, then let's get ready.  Time is short, only five hours left until the curfew. <br><br>  ** <br><br>  Deimos and Adikia walked slowly along the streets of the Capital. <br><br>  - See this?  - Deimos jabbed a finger at one of the loudspeakers on the street pillar. <br><br>  “Yes, of course,” the girl replied, “they are notified about the beginning of the curfew or about any restrictions. <br><br>  “Aha,” Deimos thought, “so now we are going to the garrison location.” <br><br>  The closer to the center, the more soldiers they met on the way.  Deimos allowed Adikia to rest and averted their eyes independently and effortlessly.  As if two ghosts, not noticed by anyone, they passed through the checkpoint and moved to the headquarters building. <br><br>  - What have we forgotten here at all?  - Asked Adikia, although she already guessed. <br><br>  - Remote control system warning of the city, of course.  How do you feel about riots? <br><br>  Adikia shivered. <br><br>  - There will be a lot of blood, the soldiers simply crush the rioters. <br><br>  “They won't if they are left to themselves,” Deimos replied and closed his eyes a little. <br><br>  Adikia saw how the soldiers of the guard froze, and after a few seconds, holding bayonet knives, opened their veins.  The sight was so terrible that the girl simply lowered her head and continued to move after Deimos. <br><br>  They walked through the corridors and stairs covered in blood, and finally found themselves in the control room. <br><br>  Deimos threw the corpse on duty on the floor and sat down in a chair in a businesslike manner.  A few movements and a lamp was lit above his head, signaling that the microphone was on. <br><br>  - Hello, residents of our beautiful Capital, - he spoke loudly, clearly and confidently, - I appeal to all of you, and first of all, to those who live outside the "Ring of Life".  Today is a wonderland, friends.  And I urge you, everyone who values ​​their freedom and the lives of their children and relatives, to go to the nearest checkpoint.  Kill soldiers, residents of the capital!  Slay bastards fattening on your grief, living in the skyscrapers of the center!  Do not be afraid of anything!  The headquarters of the capital’s garrison has been destroyed; no one will come to the rescue of this garbage that calls itself your protectors. <br><br>  Kill marauders and other rabble!  I give you the opportunity to make this city cleaner and better, I give you the opportunity to get justice for myself and my family. <br><br>  How many of your friends, acquaintances, relatives rotted in the cells?  How many wives were raped and killed in uniforms with impunity? <br><br>  I know that your discontent has been ripening for a long time and today you have a chance to get revenge!  Get up, go to the streets, take clubs, trim pipe, make Molotov cocktails!  Disassemble the walls and turn their debris into a formidable weapon!  The army is not a divine pantheon, they are just people!  And the blood of the army rabble is as red as the blood of each of you! <br><br>  I am not a resistance.  I am not a provocateur.  I am one of you, deceived and trampled by the current regime! <br><br>  I am waiting for you at the Council building, in the very center of this anthill, which is proudly called the capital!  Come tonight, and together we will announce the new order! <br><br>  He finished his speech and turned off the microphone.  There was silence in the room - Adikia did not dare to speak.  She had expected something similar, but she always believed that they would cope with Deimos together, up to their elbows in blood, but together.  Now he tried to turn this multi-million city into a burning hell. <br><br>  “You think,” she finally said, “will it work?” <br><br>  “I will say more — I’m sure it will work,” Deimos got up from his chair and walked over to the girl, “one night, there, in our shelter, while you were sleeping, I touched the mind of the people around.  And you know what I saw?  I saw pain, hate, fear. <br><br>  He went out into the corridor, but stopped and spoke again: <br><br>  - And it gives a chance.  Gives them a chance to stop feeling like a victim, revenge.  On the square in front of the council building we will have many guests. <br><br>  Deimos put his hand in his pocket and took out two syringes with EP-22.  The maximum non-lethal dose that will drive him crazy by morning. <br><br>  He looked at the poison in his hands, took off the caps and, sticking the needles right through the pant leg into his leg, and slowly began to lower the pistons. <br><br>  “That's it,” he smiled cheerfully at Adikia, “we have about three or four hours, maybe five.”  And then God help you, honey. <br><br>  Without waiting for an answer, he just went down the corridor to the exit. <br><br>  “Yes, help won't hurt me,” Adikia thought. <br><br>  ** <br><br>  Oliver saw Matt and Melissa open the doors of the body and, having already decided to run to them, he noticed how his comrades were slowly kneeling.  He was already thinking of calling out to distract the attention of the attackers and give Matt a chance how the shot rang out. <br><br>  Oliver saw how Melissa fell on his side and slowly, as if in slow motion, fell to the ground. <br><br>  There was no time to think.  Oliver jerked up the railgun, in the store of which there were still a few blanks, and began to sew the body around the place where, as he thought, the enemy might be. <br><br>  At some point, Matt jerked, suddenly stood up and raised his machine gun.  Apparently, Oliver got someone. <br><br>  The first thing that saw Steel General, going to the car - the body of Melissa.  He was still indulging in the hope that she was just injured, but he knew perfectly well - she, like Matt, was in combat armor and the only place where she could be hurt was her head. <br><br>  In the place of the bullet's exit, the skull of the woman was torn apart and there was no hope that she could survive. <br><br>  Next to her, on the ground lay a man, not lightly dressed for the weather, but in the back was a girl, wheezing, choking on her own blood.  The railgun ingot went through the chest, another one almost tore off the arm and the fact that she was still conscious and clinging to life was a miracle. <br><br>  “Give me one reason not to shoot you right now, you are a piece of shit,” said a man lying on the ground through Matt’s teeth. <br><br>  Apparently, he was more fortunate than his companion, and remained intact. <br><br>  The girl in the back convulsively twitched for the last time and fell silent. <br><br>  “My name is Richard O'Connell,” the man began to rise slowly, holding his hands as high as possible so as not to provoke Matt and Oliver. <br><br>  - How how?  “Matt asked, surprised, Richard O'Connell?”  Colonel Richard O'Connell? <br><br>  “Yes,” he answered, puzzled. This old man seemed to know him, but Richard could not understand where he came from. <br><br>  - Do you know him?  - asked Oliver. <br><br>  “I heard,” Matt answered quietly, “James told me about him before he shot himself.”  Melly his ... - Commander stopped short, - was his subordinate. <br><br>  O'Connell understood less and less what was happening. <br><br>  - Melly?  Melissa?  - Richard asked. <br><br>  Matt just nodded glumly at the corpse next to him. <br><br>  The colonel blew himself up, nearly falling over his aching foot, and rushed to the corpse.  When he turned the body face up, Richard realized that it was she.  His Melissa. <br><br>  He quietly pressed the body of a woman to his chest without making a sound. <br><br>  “Subordinate?  Not sure, Oliver thought. <br><br>  “Melly, honey,” O'Connell threw away a strand of reddish hair and looked into the woman’s dead, glassy eyes. <br><br>  - We have no time to say goodbye.  Colonel, we need to leave, go with us - Matt took Richard by the arm and gently raised him to his feet, forcing him to release Melissa's body - this is war, - he continued, - in the war, soldiers die, and she was a soldier.  Come on. <br><br>  Richard almost got himself under control and followed Matt.  The old commander nodded to Oliver at the carcass in the car, hinting that he should also be unloaded. <br><br>  - Oliver, go in the back, cover.  There was some kind of movement on the base, it is necessary to bring down, ”he added out loud. <br><br>  The steel general nodded in agreement, approached the car and, seizing Astrea's body by the legs, as if the bag had pulled him to the ground, placing him next to Melissa’s corpse. <br><br>  “She was a telepath?”  Like Melly?  - Oliver asked O'Connell. <br><br>  - Yes, probably one of the strongest. <br><br>  “I see,” said Matt.  Now he finally understood what had happened a few minutes ago.  “Okay, load and throw.” <br><br>  Rising into the body, Oliver nearly slipped in a pool of blood, but he stood on his feet.  Matt and Richard dumped the corpses of the driver and the soldier out of the cab and settled in their places.  Matt was already turning the engine on when Steel General knocked his fist into the cab. <br><br>  - I have a few shells, and the batteries are planted!  - He shouted to Matt. <br><br>  - So take care of the cartridges!  We still need this barrel!  “Matt shouted back and began to turn the truck around,” so you’re a colonel of counterintelligence, right?  - He calmly turned to Richard, who was sitting quietly in the passenger seat, lost in his own thoughts. <br><br>  “Yes,” he answered Matt. <br><br>  “James Harris advised me to find you,” Matt decided not to advertise the fact that the adviser was his brother. <br><br>  - And who are you anyway? <br><br>  Matt paused for a second.  He finally turned the car around and they began to pick up speed.  They had driven away only about fifty meters away, like an explosion at the place of an ambush, a thundering explosion. <br><br>  - And what is this?  - shouted to Oliver Matt. <br><br>  - I do not know!  - I heard from the body - but on the road clean. <br><br>  - Well, to hell with him!  - The commander answered, - make sure that there is no chase! <br><br>  - Got it! <br><br>  Richard silently watched these negotiations.  The fact that Astreya's collar worked, he decided not to spread. <br><br>  - So who are you?  - The colonel repeated his question. <br><br>  - My name is Matthew, I am the commander of the resistance forces, and there, in the back, Oliver Steele. <br><br>  - Steel General?  - Richard was surprised - I heard that he had left the partisans. <br><br>  “Yes, I tried,” Matt replied, “but I found him and tried to return him.”  True, there is nowhere to return. <br><br>  - In terms of? <br><br>  “Melissa once told us that the army conducted a full-scale operation.”  The ghettos and our camps in the north were destroyed. <br><br>  “I haven't heard anything about it, but I heard that you, Matthew, were missing.” <br><br>  - Oh, we have traitors?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  “Let's just say it was all at the level of rumors,” O'Connell answered evasively.  He did not want to say that he had his scammers in the camp of resistance. <br><br>  “Counselor Harris said we should find you.”  You can help reconcile the resistance and the government. <br><br>  Richard just smiled. <br><br>  - In order to reconcile these two camps, you will need to send to the light at least half of all officials and leaders.  Although, - he said, - Deimos copes with it very well. <br><br>  - Deimos? <br><br>  - Do you know each other? <br><br>  “Yes,” Matt answered slowly, “we met at Mike Ivor’s research center.”  There they patched Oliver, a couple of weeks ago he was seriously wounded by tramps. <br><br>  “That's it,” Richard considered what he had heard, “and when did he leave?” <br><br>  - A week ago, after that, they took us almost immediately into custody, only today they escaped. <br><br>  Richard looked at Matt carefully.  He has not yet decided whether to trust this couple.  But if they really are Commander Matthew and Oliver Steele - they'll have to. <br><br>  “So, what has Deimos already done?”  - Trying not to be distracted from the road, Matt asked. <br><br>  “He broke into a closed party of the army command in one of the central casinos,” O'Connell replied. <br><br>  - So what? <br><br>  - He scored a telescopic baton two dozen people. <br><br>  - One? <br><br>  - Well, I, with his abilities, I am even surprised that he resorted to such crude methods. <br><br>  - And who is he at all?  - asked Matt another question. <br><br>  “Before serving on Ivor, he served in the army, was a captain,” Richard replied. <br><br>  - Wow. <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  The car made the last turn and drove out of the forest belt, behind which the Capital appeared.  At first, neither Matt nor Richard understood what was wrong, but after looking closely, they noticed that the city was engulfed in fire. <br><br>  ** <br>  Tommy and his fighters had already dispersed to different parts of the city and, hiding explosives in their bags, and, under the clothes, had their weapons, they each set their sights on their checkpoint. <br><br>  The soldiers were relaxed - who would dare to attack them? <br><br>  But Little Tommy is out of luck.  Specifically, at its point stood a young lieutenant, apparently, immediately after the academy.  He was still not fed up with sleepy duty and chased the fighters so that they would not relax too much. <br><br>  “Damn,” Tommy hissed under his breath, “he managed. <br><br>  The curfew was about to begin, and he had no time to change his position. <br><br>  Their plan was extremely simple: everyone simultaneously launched an attack on seven roadblocks in the south and southeast of the “Ring of Life”.  Tommy and two mini-detachments under the leadership of Eric divert attention to themselves, imitating a breakthrough to the center, while the rest are distributed along the "Ring" and lay the shells under the key buildings and skyscrapers that they can reach.  The belts of suicide bombers were, as the technician called them, "the last argument."  Launched with a stable plastid, they could easily withstand both the impact of fire and the direct hit - they detonated solely from an electrical discharge. <br><br>  One of the speakers on the pole near the checkpoint quietly hissed, now there will be an announcement of the occurrence of a curfew in five minutes.  The giant has already reached for the machine gun, hidden under the jacket, ready to attack. <br><br>  But instead of the usual words, Tommy heard someone a little like an army announcer or automatic recording. <br><br>  - Hello, residents of our beautiful capital, I appeal to all of you, and first of all, to those who live outside the "Ring of Life."  Today is a wonderland, friends ... <br><br>  The longer Tommy listened to the voice that was heard from the speakers all over the city, the more he could not believe what was happening. <br><br>  "Who is it?
