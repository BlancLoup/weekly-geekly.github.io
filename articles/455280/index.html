His article, in fact, is a brief confession, and I think that this kind of confession is needed by people who are confronted with psychiatry, and people who have experienced similar conditions, but have not applied to psychiatry. <br><br>  Based on my experience, I want to say right away - the experiences described in the article are characteristic, first of all, for thyroiditis - an increased titer of antibodies to thyroid hormones.

      The thyroid gland and its hormones (partly the pituitary hormones) are responsible for the rate of mental activity.  What happened to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/masterdak/" class="user_link">masterdak</a> is associated with a rapid increase in the rate of mental activity, which in psychiatry is called a manic state, mania or hypomania.  These terms the patient probably had to hear, just like the concept of "influx of thoughts." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the "influx of thoughts" and hypomania in real psychiatric practice do not differentiate.  Such a condition is still referred to as ‚Äúendogenous‚Äù (internal, having no objective reason) and is treated as schizophrenia, which the author can verify by reading the instructions for the drugs he takes. <br>  These drugs can only worsen the condition of the thyroid gland, and autoimmune processes in general. <br><br>  Laboratory tests confirming my point of view are not performed in public hospitals.  The first thing to advise is to make two elementary analyzes in any clinic: <br><br><ol><li>  antibodies to thyroid stimulating hormone </li><li>  antibodies to peroxide hormone. </li></ol><br>  If one of the reasons for such mental states lies in physiological problems (the second, in any case, psychological), then you yourself, and no one else can prevent the recurrence of such attacks in the future. <br><br>  Proceeding from the description, I consider the most likely physiological cause of the author's conditions to be thyroiditis, but the cause can also be congenital neurological problems.  In my opinion, the state characteristic of such problems is better described in the comments of the user <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/zuek/" class="user_link">zuek</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI started building the system somewhere in the second grade - I noticed a heightened emotionality - I was obviously offended more and faster than my peers, I was ready to demolish any harassment from a nice person, but in general it seemed to me that I didn‚Äôt react to the events adequately - too emotional. <br><br>  One may doubt such an atypical for an eight-year-old boy to mine-dig, but it was just that, I was just trying to figure out why I have no friends, why love is unrequited, and most of all I wanted to stop worrying about a headache over all sorts of trivia. <br><br>  Then I would start to observe my closest environment in order to replicate their behavior - it was this first conscious decision to replicate other people's reactions and grew into a ‚Äúsupra-brain."  At first, I kind of thought of the most likely reaction from the side of that guy, and then reacted according to the model, now I suspect that this was something akin to autistic disorders ... ‚Äù </blockquote>  Increased emotional vulnerability, about which <b>masterdak</b> did not write <b>anything</b> , is most often associated with minimal organic disorders of the nervous system, usually resulting from birth trauma or hemodynamic disturbances in the pregnant woman‚Äôs body. <br><br>  Something like this happens: <br>  The capillaries supplying blood to the nerve cells are very narrow vessels.  At the slightest malfunction in the maternal labor or increase of blood viscosity, they fall down and die, and in their place the so-called gliosis, microscopic scars, is formed. <br>  If this were to occur in the skin tissue, inflammation would first occur, and in its place - scar tissue.  The brain is an aseptic environment, there are no bacteria here, there is no inflammation in the strict sense of the word, but the body‚Äôs defense systems will still struggle with the microtubule. <br><br>  The vessel is dead, therefore, gliosis is a zone of hypoxia (oxygen starvation).  The brain fights this situation in two ways: firstly, it increases the amount of antibodies to its own proteins, trying to neutralize them in the zone of one (or many) microtubules, and secondly, the nerve cell forms collaterals, bypassing the scar area.  Antibodies to its own protein structures make it difficult in this zone the synthesis of substances that regulate the nerve impulse (biogenic amines).  An excess of ‚Äúbypass branches‚Äù of a neuron makes it difficult for a nerve impulse to pass, creating an area of ‚Äã‚Äãexcessive tension of the nervous tissue. <br>  This is a simplified description of the processes leading to what neurologists call "residual organic encephalopathy."  With increasing levels of antibodies, something similar happens in the thyroid gland. <br><br>  I do not make diagnoses without examination.  Relying on your posts, I only try to explain what happens in such situations with the human nervous system.  And I do this only because all these processes are not of interest to domestic psychiatry. <br>  Psychiatrists, de facto, since the mid-fifties of the last century, treat almost all patients only for schizophrenia. <br><br>  <b>Zuek</b> , before moving on to the discussion of the ‚Äúoverbrain,‚Äù describes himself as a <i>quiet moderately drinking gray</i> .  ‚ÄúSilent grayness‚Äù is the only result that a person can get if he is ‚Äútreated‚Äù with alcohol.  Unfortunately, not only alcohol.  Anyone who is familiar with people who are constantly taking psychotropic drugs is well aware that the result is the same - "quiet gray." <br><br>  I think that <b>zuek</b> addiction to alcohol is not accidental.  Alcohol is the perfect natural antioxidant.  Patients suffering from increased emotional vulnerability or sudden mood swings, very often quickly discover that alcohol stabilizes their mental state.  Moreover, having some experience, I can say that all cases of alcoholism, occurring before the age of thirty years, without exception, have almost no relation to alcohol dependence (almost because psychological factors always play a role).  In all such cases, MRI, EEG and clinical examination allow finding residual-organic encephalopathy. <br><br><h2>  Hello from the Pavlovsk sessions </h2><br>  The diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder today is a form of demagoguery intended for the patient.  The doctor does not want to tell the patient that he suffers from schizophrenia, it is painfully a hopeless and difficult to explain diagnosis. <br><br>  The non-standard professor is also trying to treat schizophrenia: <br><blockquote>  We are going to another professor who is rumored to use non-standard methods of treatment.  He writes on the leaflet the formula for recovery: remove the zyprexa, add the scheme of ariprisol plus antidepressant, transcendental meditation and yoga therapy.  I do not believe in all this, but he insists on trying </blockquote>  Zyprexa, like aprizol, are atypical antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia. <br><br>  It is quite difficult for an uninitiated in the sacrament of psychiatric vocabulary to explain what happens to doctors.  This story began in 1951-1952 at the Pavlov Sessions of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  The notorious sessions led to the autocracy in psychiatry of one system of ideas and one person - Academician of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">A.V. Snezhnevsky</a> , who played the same role in psychiatry that Academician TD Lysenko had before him in Russian genetics and selection. <br><br>  Unlike genetics, dealing with completely material living structures, in psychiatry, based on abstract metaphorical descriptions, nothing has changed since that time. <br><br>  Speaking at the Pavlovsk sessions, Academician Snezhnevsky suggested the existence of some factor x, which affects the improper formation of conditioned reflexes in patients with schizophrenia.  Later this point of view was not confirmed: there was no factor x that distorts reflexes, and the role of conditioned reflexes in a person‚Äôs psychic life turned out to be much smaller than that suggested by IP Pavlov. <br><br>  At the same Pavlov sessions, Snezhnevsky argued that all mental disorders are a single process, that is, they are one disease, which manifests itself only slightly at different stages of human life.  The non-existent ‚Äúdestruction of the conditioned-reflex arc‚Äù was declared to be the cause of the non-existent ‚Äúsingle endogenous-functional psychosis‚Äù.  This psychosis was schizophrenia. <br><br>  The author of this term - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Eigen Bleuler</a> , forty years before Snezhnevsky described the disease with unknown causes.  Snezhnevsky absolutized this diagnosis, making it the only diagnosis of the "Moscow psychiatric school."  Of course, I simplify a lot - this is a topic for a whole book, which I hope to finish one day. <br><br>  Imagine how convenient and profitable the practical doctor is?  There is only one disease, there are about twenty essential drugs for its treatment.  You don‚Äôt need to understand what is happening with a person - you simply choose one or several (even worse) antipsychotics, and prescribe to the patient for life, because the ‚Äúsingle psychosis‚Äù dies only with the patient. <br><br>  The orders of the Ministry of Health about the standards of medical care secured this simple position, making it mandatory. <br><br>  Additionally, it can be noted that in 1956, at a conference in Sweden, Academician Snezhnevsky spoke to an international audience with his concept of a single psychosis and sluggish schizophrenia, which the world professional community did not accept.  It is clear that since then, Soviet psychiatrists began to develop purely original domestic psychiatry.  The concept of "sluggish schizophrenia" included everything that before Academician Snezhnevsky was called "neurosis", "obsession", "psychopathy" or "personality disorder".  All that foreign colleagues considered a mild or psychological level of mental disorders, has become a form of an incurable, mysterious disease.  Over time, ‚Äúcircular psychosis,‚Äù which today is called bipolar affective disorder, was also attributed to the same disease. <br><br>  Nervous system disorders, all problems caused by emotional reactivity, encephalopathies, problems of the thyroid gland (and other internal organs) were referred by psychiatry to the number of comorbid disorders.  This mysterious word means an underlying disorder of the underlying disease.  All somatic or neurological disorders do not cause mental problems by themselves, but only provoke in you, dear gentlemen, the onset of schizophrenia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSingle psychosis‚Äù is now and everywhere implied ‚Äî even when your children are diagnosed with ‚Äúchildhood hypermobility syndrome‚Äù or ‚Äúearly childhood autism‚Äù - they are being treated for schizophrenia.  Do not forget to carefully read the instructions to the drugs! <br>  But it's not only that. <br><br>  Being engaged in teaching self-hypnosis and self-hypnosis, I have great respect for meditation, but meditating at the same time, while taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, at least, is meaningless. <br><br>  The pharmacological effect of these drugs is some kind of pathological meditation.  So you can call the feeling of stupidity, dullness and confusion, which cause, in particular, zyprexa and ariprizol. <br><br>  Like any drug, they forcefully create an altered state of consciousness, against the background of which, it is almost impossible to cause arbitrary relaxation (not to mention transcendence beyond the limits of one's body).  Such attempts can lead either to depression, associated with the inability to experience those sublime feelings that the meditator speaks about, or to false sensations (up to hallucinations) related to what a person is trying to invent, to construct what he cannot feel. <br>  Either neuroleptics - or yoga and meditation, one of two things. <br><br><h2>  "Bipolar disorder" </h2><br>  Let's try to analyze what is happening with the author of the article without taking into account schizophrenological speculation. <br><br>  The increase in emotional and intellectual load causes a feeling of constant internal tension, ending with a sense of its special role in the universe.  In the hospital, a young man remains excited, starting with a typical influx of thoughts and continuing in the form of some euphoria and disinhibition.  These phenomena occur and pass fairly quickly with the appointment of neuroleptics. <br><br>  The Soviet psychiatric school, which developed to Snezhnevsky‚Äôs autocracy, considered such an influx of thoughts to be part of the psychoorganic syndrome, that is, the syndrome caused by neurological or somatic problems. <br><br>  But we have not yet discussed the psychological problems behind the symptoms. <br><blockquote>  Deeper and deeper plunging into a stream of thoughts, I became more and more clear, as it seemed to me, began to understand the universe.  I began to feel that I was approaching God.  From this euphoria began: the ultimate level of happiness.  I looked at the clock, the evening was approaching: a time when Catholics begin to celebrate Christmas.  My wife sent me to the store.  On the way, I congratulated everyone on Christmas.  Feeling close to God, I was truly happy, it seemed to me that I could do anything. </blockquote>  In this quote, you can trace the mechanism of mental attack, similar to epileptic.  The tension is perceived by the consciousness as anxiety.  Anxious thoughts are doubts in yourself and in your ability to answer for everything you do.  The psyche knows one single way of liberation from disturbing thoughts - the feeling of one‚Äôs own greatness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/aw/r9/vrawr94trbmwjsvs4gox4z2-vf8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Ilya Kutoboi.</i>  <i><a href="https://takiedela.ru/2016/04/nashestvie-khikikomori/">Hikikomori Invasion</a></i> <br><br>  The experiences of the <b>masterdak</b> , in the clinical sense of the word, are not nonsense.  Crazy syndrome requires the emergence in the patient's mind of fundamentally new ideas and conclusions that were previously absent.  It may seem to you that this is happening, but in reality, each of us, in dreams and fantasies, at any age wants to feel his own omnipotence or "closeness to God."  This is a normal part of our consciousness.  I think that we call it ‚Äúself-confidence‚Äù.  Not to mention that the desire for closeness to the gods can be called the main content of all world religions. <br><br>  So, the stress caused by physiological factors causes anxiety and painful self-doubt.  The weakened nervous tissue abruptly relieves tension freeing the mind from doubts and anxieties.  On the surface of consciousness are thoughts that used to be just dreams. <br><br>  It is possible to continue the physiological and mental explanation of what is happening with the author, but I am afraid that my answer is already too great.  The main thing is that both <b>masterdak</b> and <b>zuek</b> write that these conditions are amenable to self-regulation through psychological efforts, which means that their conditions are not related to endogenous psychosis. <br><br>  Psychoorganic syndrome leaves a person with opportunities for psychological self-regulation.  The Moscow Schizophrenology School believes that ‚Äúendogenous psychosis‚Äù precludes such a possibility.  The psychiatrist of this school does not consider you as a person at all.  You are a psychosis, therefore, there is simply no one to regulate emotions and behavior ... <br><blockquote>  ... to track my own jumps, I compiled a list of markers, when triggered, I increased the dose of zyprex and in order not to fly away again.  At first there were few markers, then there was a lot of them and they migrated, I called them signs of that side: <br><br>  1. excessive religiousness <br>  2. thoughts develop too fast <br>  3. communication where there are none <br>  4. easy way to get overclocks <br>  5. grandiose meaning <br>  6. I got a connection to the universe <br>  7. I am the chosen one and can drastically change the world <br>  8. I am healthy and not sick <br>  9. no need to take medication <br>  10. feelings of bliss and unreality of what is happening. </blockquote><br>  For me, this is an important quotation, because it confirms my deep conviction that the main form of prevention of mental illness today is to teach a person how to use elementary, basic principles of thinking and logic. <br><br>  Drawing up such criteria can be for many a quick and effective way of self-treatment. <br><br>  It is important not to be limited to the same criteria.  Each criterion must comply with the principle of attitude to life and a brief strategy for the action of psychological efforts to return to normalcy. <br><br>  For example, the main for me from the described criteria is point seven: ‚ÄúI am the chosen one and can radically change the world‚Äù.  It is always an illusion, no matter how it is evaluated - as a psychiatric pathology or spiritual revelation. <br><br>  Man cannot be God, - a phrase that you can understand, like this one, should be ready, if you evaluate the criterion as positive. <br><blockquote>  My wife insisted to go to the capital of the republic for advice - so that I would not be like a vegetable.  The psychiatrist asks the right questions: do you have ups and downs - I say yes, and this is the key to understanding what I am sick of - bipolar disorder is an incurable disease, mania changes with depression in places, and such swings drive people from side to side . </blockquote>  Self confidence or doubt alone can speak of bipolar disorder, but for this it is necessary that a period of extreme self confidence and a period of endless doubts gradually replace each other and last long enough (months).  If these periods are short-lived and are replaced by jerks, the person needs to look for somatic or neurological problems that cause sudden mood swings. <br><br>  Even if I am mistaken in my assumptions about the author of the text, I have encouraging information: the psychiatrist who described the manic-depressive psychosis (bipolar disorder), <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Emil Kraepelin</a> , did not consider it an incurable disease.  On the contrary, German psychiatry has always believed that this disorder disappears without a trace.  And there were no psychotropic drugs at the time of Kraepelin - this psychosis was treated with sanatorium conditions, water procedures, hypnosis and ... world travel. <br><blockquote>  ... and if something of this works immediately increase the dose of medication.  So I lived 8 years.  Compiled test questions <br>  1. how likely my company will be the greatest in history - if the probability is 100% anxiety, you need to raise the dose again <br>  2. whether you need to read books for professional growth - if there is no anxiety <br>  3. How likely we will exceed the peak results of previous years - if 100% is also anxiety. </blockquote>  Attempts to use the criteria of self-esteem, not for organizing your own thinking, but for regulating the doses of drugs, can only lead a person to return to a psychiatric hospital. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNadmozg‚Äù <b>zuek</b> , for example, can work effectively by itself, but as soon as <b>zuek</b> starts drinking alcohol, all self-regulation stops, alcohol becomes the regulator. <br><br>  Most often, I have to deal with one main problem of self-regulation: patients do not do anything systematically.  In order to use the ‚Äúsuper-brain‚Äù it is necessary to accustom yourself to apply the formulated principles in any life situation, and this is much more complicated and much slower than taking a psychotropic pill or a drug. <br><br>  In order for a person to learn how to alleviate neurological symptoms, not only correct diagnostics and correct treatment are needed, but daily, continuing for years exercises aimed at relaxing and reducing anxiety are needed.  Unfortunately, I am convinced that the author of the article recalled his criteria from time to time, and did not at all try to think through affirmations ‚Äî positive principles of thinking that help overcome critical mental states. <br><br><h2>  Side effects </h2><br>
