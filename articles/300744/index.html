      Probably thought you, recruiters are lazy, and the leaders are stupid.  The first is too lazy to read all the incoming resume, the second can not see your talents, experience and abilities. <br><br>  No, dear applicants.  I hasten to disappoint you.  Most likely, you yourself have compiled your resume in such a way that no one wants to invite you for an interview. <br>  How do I know this?  Yes, because five minutes ago I was reading Curriculum Vitae, some of which were disappointing, annoying or laughing at me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  No, I do not want to say that all responses were bad.  We conducted quite a few interviews and even hired several people. <br>  But I do not leave the feeling that those employed could be much more if the applicants would tell about themselves a little in other words and in much more detail.  And others could save my time and choose a job more appropriate for their experience. <br><br>  <b>So, I sent the following options summary:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Representatives of completely different specialties.</i>  I wrote a Web-developer, director of web-sales and web-marketing, an engineer of the test department, an intern in the field of information technology, a novice specialist / trainee, an engineer in telecommunications.  Why did they do it?  (I recall that in the job description there were only two requirements - good knowledge of C ++ and Qt) Probably ‚Äúrelying on Russian perhaps.‚Äù  And what if a ride, they suddenly take it. </li><li>  <i>Novice programmers.</i>  I myself was once a green novice and was eager to learn from real tasks.  Alas, this is not an option for our company.  We need to quickly increase the functionality, there is no time to learn.  Here in a couple of years, when we become even more, let's take a dozen talented students for internships.  In the meantime, it is better to pay attention to the vacancies where the intern is obviously looking. </li><li>  <i>Too self-confident.</i>  ‚ÄúQt don't know yet,‚Äù they write, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm ready to learn quickly.‚Äù  No thanks, don't.  The reasons described in the previous paragraph.  In addition, the venerable programmer (as opposed to a trainee student) wants a decent salary for the period of study. </li><li>  <i>Laconic</i>  My favorite category.  ‚ÄúCreated an information system in C ++ and Oracle‚Äù - this is a typical description of the activities of concise candidates for each job.  One resume consisted of 5 such lines, differing only in the names of companies and years of recruitment and dismissal.  What can I, as a potential employer, extract from this information?  How well does a person know C ++?  What exactly did he do on it?  And anyway, where is the Qt? </li><li>  <i>Writers.</i>  These people write a lot, but that is interesting to them, but not to me.  One friend told me which games he created for MS-DOS.  And why do I need this information?  Or was a resume written for a company for which MS-DOS was needed, and then it was sent to us? </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What do you need to write in a resume to generate interest from a potential employer?</b> <br><br>  If you see that you do not fit the critical requirements, then nothing.  The likelihood that the company will search, search, will not find anyone decent and will take you to study, is between 0 and 1 percent. <br>  And in the case when you did something about what the applicant wants from you, you need to not be lazy and write a fresh resume.  In which state what exactly and how was done, what tasks were performed, what skill you gained. <br>  If the program is publicly available, then give it a link.  If you wrote something for yourself - attach a piece of code. <br><br>  <i>And be sure to write a cover letter (aka Cover Letter).</i> <br>  A resume without a cover letter seems typical, sent to dozens of companies.  Perhaps the applicant did not even get acquainted with the profile of a potential employer, did not understand whether he wanted to work there, and sent just for good luck. <br>  In the cover letter again briefly describe how your experience and skills will be useful in an open position.  A letter with the text ‚ÄúI ask you to consider my candidacy for the XXX position‚Äù makes a repulsive impression, such as the default proposes to insert hh.ru.  The reaction to such a letter is as follows: dear applicant, you did not want to waste time on me, why should I spend time on you? <br><br>  In general, do not be lazy, try to imagine what your future employer wants to read in a resume - and you will have an interesting job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300744/</a></p>
