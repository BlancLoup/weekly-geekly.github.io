  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What gives servers 10 Gbps Ethernet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Against the background of the rapid development of Internet technologies, the rapid change of generations of cellular communications and all-round progress in various fields, high-speed data transmission technologies over copper wires in recent years have demonstrated depressing conservatism.  The bandwidth of 10 or more gigabits per second has been achieved technologically for a long time, however, 10-gigabit Ethernet, as a logical development of the most mass technology today, is still largely exotic, inaccessible to the mass user.  But it is quite likely that the situation will change seriously in the near future.  As part of the development of its telecommunications product line, HP relies on 10-gigabit Ethernet technology, which promises to make high-speed data transfer much ‚Äúcloser to the people‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3c036109/62e426c1/f72c07be/43e75669.jpg" align="left">  10 Gigabit Ethernet is an excellent technology that underlies the heterogeneous and converged networks in the data center.  Like its predecessor, it is great for the IP protocol, and the most familiar applications are web data transmission, email organization, device management, IP telephony and video on demand.  Equally important is the full support of the iSCSI server protocol for organizing interaction between servers, data storage systems and clients.  Now at a higher speed. <br><br>  Key features of any modern network are data transfer rates and low latency.  This is what customers, operators, administrators, and in general all those who work with networks want.  10 Gigabit Ethernet has both characteristics, while providing ample opportunities for redundancy and convergence of traffic.

      The fact is that most of the already existing network architectures use different types of network protocols to transmit various types of traffic.  Different types of network protocols and inter-layer connections complicate the process of operating networks and greatly increase the likelihood of errors, especially if you try to tie them together.  That is why the Association of Standards of the International Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-SA) in the development of 10-gigabit Ethernet has taken into account the fact that the technology will be used to combine local (LAN), urban (MAN), distributed (WAN) and regional (RAN ) networks.  An important component here is the ability to use an existing Ethernet infrastructure in the process of a smooth transition to a newer technology. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/120c321a/249c62de/6cc2b54f/31f7ee84.jpg"></div><br>  What are the factors affecting new data transfer technologies today? <br><br>  First of all, there is the need for inter-layer aggregation to reduce costs, bandwidth requirements, which grow with the performance of multi-core processors, applications that are sensitive to data transfer speeds, such as video on demand, backup and network storage.  In addition, cluster calculations are added to the list, which go hand in hand with the financial sector and the rapid growth of consolidation of computing resources, fueled by improved software for virtualization and the need for more network ports.  All this, by and large, and there are reasons for the transition to 10-Gigabit Ethernet, because the technology was created and works with a direct guide to the satisfaction of just such requests.  Reliability is also not forgotten - 10-Gigabit Ethernet only works in full-duplex mode, supporting the functionality of traffic quality of service (QoS) and the corresponding mechanisms for allocating the necessary bandwidth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e4e2094a/647181aa/d1d256ec/135882ad.jpg"><br>  A separate important topic is the interoperability of 10 Gigabit Ethernet and the usual Gigabit Ethernet.  All HP networking products are designed with backward compatibility in order to support existing Ethernet standards and future CEE (Converged Enhanced Ethernet).  All SFP + connectors in HP 10 GB VC interconnect modules and interface cards also support Gigabit Ethernet.  When a gigabit transceiver is connected to the SFP + slot, a module or card, consider the transceiver's EEPROM and automatically set the gigabit mode of operation.  The EEPROM provides all the characteristics of the device, 1 or 10 Gbit / s throughput, copper or optics, long or short range.  The same thing happens when you connect a 10-gigabit transceiver.  An interface card or switch will know how to handle a 10-gigabit connection immediately after installing the transceiver into the slot. <br><br>  Compatibility includes passive direct attach cables.  They are passive because the active circuit of the signal repeater is not built into the connector.  The cables in this case are of type Twinax, several standard lengths and are supplied with SFP + connectors on both sides.  Optionally, the passive connector in such cables can have an embedded EEPROM for automatic detection of cable characteristics.  Twinax cables are an inexpensive solution for distances not exceeding seven meters, in contrast to optical cables operating at distances from 80 to 300 meters.  Using Twinax means more careful planning, because the interface cards or switches may simply not have the data to automatically detect the type of cable and adjust the data rate. <br><br>  Obviously, in a small blog post it is impossible to immediately reveal the full potential of the technology.  As new products become available and 10-gigabit Ethernet spreads, we will return to this topic more than once.  In any case, the future of data transfer within data centers is inextricably linked with 10 Gigabit Ethernet technology, and the development of new HP products comes with an obligatory account of this fact. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118324/</a></p>
