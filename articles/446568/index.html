  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Large-scale update CMS Umbraco 8: what's new</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In late February, Umbraco was updated to version 8.0.  We love this CMS, because in it you can create an intuitive structure for any site, so we could not get past this news. <br><br>  In the eighth version of the CMS, new features have appeared, the interface has also been redesigned - it has become nicer and friendlier.  What is worth only a reminder about saving changes, which moved from the bottom of the screen to the center!  Just kidding, of course, this is not the main innovation, but purely visually CMS has become much more pleasant. <br><br>  Updates have been waiting for almost 5 years, and a month ago it finally appeared in the release.  Let's take a look at what has changed. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/ka/-w/xjka-w5612cqvq3guex8pvn024u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In each version of Umbraco, the creators' desire for simplification was clearly visible: easier to expand, easier to edit, easier to publish, easier to use.  In general, it seems that their motto is to make both developers and content editors working for Umbraco feel most comfortable and as little as possible steamed up. <br><br>  This trend has continued in version 8.0. <br><br><h2>  Three new features </h2><br>  In the eighth version, Umbraco introduced three new features: <br><br><ol><li>  Infinity Editing - unlimited editing. </li><li>  Language Variants - language options. </li><li>  Content Apps - content apps. </li></ol><br>  In addition, they cleared the code base and improved the performance and stability of the CMS.  All this makes significant differences between the new version and the previous - seventh. <br><br><h3>  1. Unlimited editing </h3><br>  Thanks to this feature, you can easily navigate your tasks in the Umbraco backoffice.  The function is useful for content editors and developers, as it simplifies the editing process and makes it intuitive. <br><br>  For example, if you need to add an image, there is no need to go to a separate section of multimedia to load it or edit it - everything happens right on the same page. <br><br>  Here we opened the page content and added a photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/iv/lo/pzivlorc1htjzhj7ie42nxzpx9e.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we decided to look at the parameters of the photo and correct it.  We click on the photo and the editor window opens right on top of the current page.  No need to go anywhere, open the folder with the image in a separate tab.  Everything is done right here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ri/hn/u3/rihnu38hpgonavh0cuntocbkyjw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then they saved the changes and continued to work on the same page, without losing context or being distracted by unnecessary manipulations.  And so with everything. <br><br>  Also on one page moved all the tabs.  If before the fields for the title, content, seo and other parameters were separate, now all this is displayed on the same page. <br><blockquote>  Editing has become one-page. </blockquote><h3>  2. Language Variants - multilingual content management </h3><br>  In Umbraco 8, you can say goodbye to crutches, workarounds and difficult synchronization with external packages - regular companions of developers who make websites with two or more interface languages ‚Äã‚Äãand content.  In the new version, the management of language options has become part of the CMS. <br><br>  New built-in functions: <br><br><ul><li>  row editing blocks; </li><li>  the ability to switch between languages ‚Äã‚Äãin preview mode for easy comparison; </li><li>  ability to customize the required languages, the choice of the default default language </li><li>  the ability to create multilingual content not even individual pages.  and individual fields; </li><li>  it is not necessary to specify additional pages for seo in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãmanually in meta tags, now it happens automatically. </li></ul><br>  So, for example, you can create pages in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/43/6q/8t/436q8ttmf3zg7vob_v6bonrnc4s.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This greatly simplifies the creation and updating of multilingual content. <br><br>  In previous versions of Umbraco, you had to search for each element and manually create a separate tree for the second language.  Now you can do it immediately and not pile up a complex structure. <br><br><h3>  3. Content Apps - an opportunity to improve content using deep data </h3><br>  In Umbraco 8, potential tools appeared for collecting, measuring and analyzing content: how popular is the publication, how many people downloaded the instructions or price list, how readable are the articles on the site, whether the keywords, title and description are true.  Now all this information can be seen in the backoffice. <br><br>  This is like a personal assistant who is always ready to provide up-to-date statistics and give practical advice on improving the content. <br><br>  Previously, each field could be a separate application.  In the 8th version, we made a small application that relates exclusively to specific content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wy/ln/o6/wylno6ema2igxnzqpnfowypkvr8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also an opportunity to connect the applications developed by the community.  For example, they have already made an application that adds instructions for content managers to a page.  In the future, for sure the list of such applications will expand.  The application that loads seo and analytics data immediately on the page will definitely be in demand. <br><br>  In general, Content Apps is a great foundation for further expansion of applications by the developers themselves. <br><br><h2>  Cleaning the source code base </h2><br>  Umbraco 8 has been under development for five years.  One of the reasons for this was the need to thoroughly clean the codebase.  In principle, the developers of Umbraco 8 succeeded - here is now a less complex source code, which is convenient to work with. <br><br>  Removed obsolete items that are already harmful to use.  Some built-in functionality began to require less attention, the syntax became more elegant.  For example, ‚Äúget property value‚Äù became just ‚Äúvalue‚Äù, and stuff like that. <br><br><h2>  Another pair of chips that we like in Umbraco </h2><br>  <b>Grid Layout</b> is not a new feature, it has been preserved from previous versions.  This is a convenient and flexible editor that allows you to insert different types of content in a predefined layout: titles, quotes, images, videos, etc. <br><br>  <b>Work with images</b> .  At the CMS level, it is possible to program that one image is used in different formats, depending on the media and the situations where it is displayed.  This removes the load from the content-maker - he doesn‚Äôt need to manually crop the photo for different formats each time.  Still set up automatic placement of watermarks and automatic optimization of images. <br><br>  <b>Right</b> .  Setting rights is very flexible and at the same time strict.  You can set permissions for a specific user to edit only a specific page or even a specific field.  You can send a content editor: for example, when selecting images for a cover, immediately open the folder with allowed images and do not start up in other folders to avoid errors. <br><br>  In general, the new version of Umbraco 8 has become more convenient and easier to use.  Now we are actively testing it, looking for bugs and inaccuracies that cannot be avoided in such a large-scale update.  As soon as all the little things are found and fixed, we will begin to develop new projects already at the G8. <br><br>  If you want more details about Umbraco - welcome in the comments: tell us what exactly you are interested in, and we will write about it in the following posts.  Umbraco is a really handy CMS, which Russian developers unfairly bypass.  And I would like to tell you more about its features and capabilities to anyone who is interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446568/</a></p>
