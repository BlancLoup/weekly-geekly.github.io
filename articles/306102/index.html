  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitrix24: an inconspicuous CRM that works for you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just recently there was another update <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrr"><strong>Bitrix24</strong></a> .  It concerns for the most part CRM, obtaining leads and omnichanalnosti.  Of course, I wanted to tell about it, but it turned out somehow dry, it was necessary to test it in combat conditions and already consider real cases.  We rolled out an update for one of our old customers a bit earlier than the others, and asked the head of the sales department and the sysadmin to tell about how they use CRM in Bitrix24 to share their opinion on the latest changes in the system.  The story came out alive, today we publish it almost completely, with some of our notes. <br><br>  So, today a total CRM update in Bitrix24 is on the air: all leads are collected in CRM without a manager, 1C-tracker pulls sales data from all sources, online chat runs on the site ( <em>for all users it will be available in the fall - Bitrix24 note</em> ) and again, instantly transfers everything to the system.  The line between online and offline is erased - an inconspicuous CRM and a powerful network of communications come into play, from which not a single lead will go <s>live</s> unprocessed.  And, of course, omnicanality - the ability through CRM to communicate with the client from any source, without switching to channels, lost leads and messages. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/bitrix/blog/306102/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a43/143/cf0/a43143cf05d8aa78020b7da59fc3dc00.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Customer base: collect and save</font> </h2><br>  <b>To begin with, I was pleased in the first place.</b>  I do not want to write with stamps, I will say, as I see: the new <strong><a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrr">Bitrix24</a></strong> draws leads from all possible sources.  Of course, in press releases this can be called intellectual interaction with all channels, but it will not convey even a part of the essence.  Just think: he (!) Pulls leads, collects them, puts them in CRM - and it doesn't matter in what time zone or country they contacted the company.  That is, you no longer lose a single message.  And you work inconspicuous CRM.  Something like that, I imagined automation.

And the higher it is, the more expensive it is to attract and retain each of our clients.  It is important for us not only to guide the client through all stages of the sale, but also to keep him for further interaction, for example, pre-sales.  It was about these, in general, trivial goals that we implemented Bitrix24 a couple of years ago.  During this time, he has changed a lot, but the last update is just wow.  How did we work until this June? <br><br><ul><li>  A lead is being created - not yet a client, but already a person / company who has shown interest in a product or service.  The information on it is recorded, including the status, the possible amount of the transaction, the source.  When a lead is established, the status and source should be given special attention - in the future, using these two parameters, you can analyze the effectiveness of customer acquisition channels. <br><br></li><li>  After interacting with the lead, in the event of a positive result on its basis, you can create a contact and company - this is how a new element of the client base appears.  He can send commercial offers, set tasks on it, make deals. <br><br></li><li>  After completion of the transaction, the client remains in the database and you need to continue to work with him - to make additional sales, to offer complementary goods and services.  The fact is that such a client is not at all worthwhile in terms of attracting, but his retention can bring additional income. <br></li></ul><br>  At the present stage of development of communications, the problem with the greatest weight is to get a lead, not to miss it, because a potential client can appear not only by sending a form on the site, but also via a chat message, a question on a social network, etc.  Honestly, our managers could not cope with such a flow - and it was very insulting to go to Facebook and find several overdue requests for a price or questions on the presence of expensive positions.  You can blame salespeople or PR man, but objectively - when you start active promotion, you will not be able to keep track of all channels.  We didn‚Äôt even think that the decision would come to us by itself, with the new update of Bitrix24. <br><br>  What is now called open lines also saves employees time - they no longer need to retell each other the content of communication or ask again what to answer to the client: you can connect another employee to the communication (including the hidden one) or redirect the client to more competent a specific question to colleagues (for example, during the presentation of the product, the sales manager may refer the technical question to the engineer). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/924/737/d029247376a34fdf996782655263973d.png"><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Work in CRM: high bets on big sales</font> </h2><br>  CRM is doing nothing now, but for our company its main purpose is to solve current problems, which will lead to an increase in sales.  Our <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dhabrr">Bitrix24</a> focuses on this.  In most companies, and ours is not an exception, the client's processing scenario is as follows: lead - qualification lead - potential client - negotiation - deal - additional sale.  Without fixing reliable and accurate information on each stage, it is more difficult to move on to the next one.  And clients often fall off at some of the stages due to the fact that the manager forgot something, for example, to send a control, call back or even lost the application.  But Bitrix24 does not allow it to be done - there the whole chain is automated, and the manager leads the client according to a predetermined scheme. <br><br>  So let's take our manager Nastya and see how it works.  We go to Bitrix24 and see that there have been appeals from Facebook, there is a registration from the site and a question from VKontakte.  This is Nastina's direction and therefore she should take appeals to work.  What is most interesting, we neither she nor other managers have access to social networks and Telegram - this is the work of the SMM-manager and nobody delves into it.  And he, in turn, is not interested in sales requests - he periodically monitored them and sent them in batches, overdue and relevant.  Now the problem is solved.  By the way, VKontakte appeal from the Primorsky Territory, we have a difference of +7 hours, we could not answer it, and it would easily have sunk in other messages of our public. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/b89/37c/3a3b8937c54ce261c0df3b77565851f2.png">  Next Nastya connected with these leads, calls and one chat were fixed.  In the end, the two asked for a price, went further along the funnel.  One of them after getting acquainted with the price list asked for an invoice, the other - while talking about discounts, he has a big lot.  That is, in fact, we have two hot clients.  What would have happened if they had not been answered immediately, but in five days, when at the end of the week the PR manager would have looked at the messages in social networks?  No one will guarantee that during this time the lead will not get to the agile competitor. <br><br>  By the way, about efficiency - I personally was very pleased with the chat on the site, it has a good conversion, about 10%, because this is already a live communication, the user is appealing motivated. <br>  Created an online chat in Bitrix24 and hung it on the site.  In principle, the chat of another developer was with us before, but at best, the manager managed to answer in 5 minutes, and that was considered good.  Well, it happens, I was distracted, a lot of outside affairs, it‚Äôs impossible to monitor a separate service all the time.  But with Bitrix24 everything somehow works differently.  An employee sits, examines applications, and here a message from a client falls into his chat: ‚ÄúDo you have delivery all over Russia?‚Äù.  The manager immediately responds and responds without switching anywhere: ‚ÄúWell, of course.  Directly to your village Perepelkino deliver.  Courier.  Then he makes a CP, bills the client.  And all this with a couple of clicks, because  Bitrix24 has already created a lead for this client, brought all the available data. <br><br><hr><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who are not yet familiar with CRM in Bitrix24, we list the main functions.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br><ul><li>  <b>All leads are counted</b> , which are then transformed into customers.  The source of the lead, its interest, need, contacts is recorded. <br><br></li><li>  In further relations with clients, <b>orders and payments are tracked</b> in CRM <b>, bills and commercial offers are billed</b> , i.e.  held deals.  Speaking of bills.  Online payments have penetrated into all areas of commerce and our team seems logical to use them in CRM - now you can not send the invoice in PDF format, just send a link to the document.  For each account, the system generates an individual link: you simply send it to the client, and he pays the bill through the connected payment systems. <br><br></li><li>  <b>There are communication with the client.</b>  And now, besides the traditional virtual PBX and client‚Äôs personal account, Bitrix24 added the ability to communicate via chat on the site and the mechanism of open lines.  The system aims to ensure that each call goes to the right manager or is redirected to his mobile phone.  At the same time, the client‚Äôs card is raised along with the call ‚Äî the manager sees the profile and conducts subject-matter negotiations on current data. <br><br></li><li> <b>The work of managers is automated through business processes.</b>  The Bitrix24 includes a visual process editor in which you can easily create chains of task execution by selecting the necessary elements.  This is a convenient and understandable constructor that does not require special knowledge.  However, if you go to assign the execution of a script in PHP in the logic of the process, it is also very simple - you embed a piece of code directly into the block. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Monitoring and scheduling is carried out</b> using task tools and a calendar.  Directly from CRM, you can set tasks with reference to customers and contacts, schedule meetings and calls.  Thus, employees will not forget about any interaction. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The reporting is based on the results of the period.</b>  The days when the reports were only a beautiful picture for the authorities or partners are already passing away.  In Bitrix24, everyone can use them.  This is an important tool for analyzing the work done, summarizing and planning.  In particular, in the new version of Bitrix24, the sales funnel has changed - a favorite report of the commercial service and management, clear, simple and at the same time informative.  Now these are multi-defrosting, which are built for different products with different types of sales. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Conducted correspondence.</b>  In the new version, each employee can connect their mailbox to the email tracker and record the history of correspondence with customers in CRM.  The tracker recognizes new incoming and outgoing contacts and automatically saves them as leads.  Thus, all information is accumulated in CRM. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Web forms are used</b> - another novelty in Bitrix24, which will appeal not only to owners of online stores (for them it‚Äôs just a must have), but also to everyone who wants to collect leads from sites and landing pages.  And again - you do not need to be a programmer to create forms: purchases, feedback, customer profiles, loan applications, registration on the site, pre-order, etc.  The chain is simple: choose a set of fields for a form from CRM entities - upload the form to the site - the filling results are automatically saved in CRM, the responsible manager receives notifications.  It is possible to create forms with payment.  A nice and useful thing - forms can be viewed using form analytics in Yandex.Metrica, which means there is always an opportunity to evaluate the result and make corrections. <br><br></li><li>  <b>There is a mobile version of CRM</b> , whose interface is fully updated, it has become more convenient and user-friendly.  Directly during a conversation, you can create a deal, add products or services, invoice.  In case you are afraid of forgetting something, all conversations are automatically recorded and saved in CRM - after returning to the office, you can listen to them again. <br></li></ul><br></div></div><br><hr><br>  In general, Bitriks24 unites not only company employees, but also collects all interactions that can lead to sales: phone calls, messages on social networks, chat rooms on the site, calls via web forms.  To miss a client is almost impossible.  Each manager can get access to a detailed portrait of the client in CRM, segments, reports on appeals, speed and quality of responses to requests.  This allows you to understand your customer, adjust your sales strategy and impacts, to sell.  In fact - to form a loyal customer, almost a friend.  It is very important to us, because competitors are looking for pricing methods of struggle, we take quality and high loyalty. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/650/4ec/64f/6504ec64fc26416b049e6e1f921a70a5.png"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0079db">Integration for full automation</font> </h2><br>  For more comprehensive business coverage and integrated automation, the CRM system should be able to integrate with third-party applications.  This will allow collecting even more accurate information and building a true omnichannel, which is especially important in retail and service.  Bitrix24 supports integration and allows you to create new ones using the API. <br><br>  Integration we discussed with the sysadmin of the same company.  It administers the network, writes scripts, and deals with information security issues - in general, it pulls the infrastructure. <br><br><h4>  <strong>Integration with the site</strong> </h4><br>  Our site works on the 1C-Bitrix platform - it was a custom development, but now I am developing and administering it.  Salespeople are happy that for several weeks now all requests from the site (leads) are automatically downloaded to CRM, they do not need to collect and add them manually.  We have a feedback form on the site, a separate questionnaire questionnaire, you can subscribe to the newsletter and now Bitrix24 chat, before there was another one.  Everyone who interacts with the forms, immediately fall into the CRM. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#4f4f4f"><em>By the way, if your site is running on a different platform, you can use web forms, from which information will get into CRM.</em></font> <font color="#4f4f4f"><em><br><br></em></font> <h4>  <strong>Integration of CRM with an online store</strong> </h4><br>  Establish a CRM connection with your online store (if it works on the 1C-Bitrix platform).  Your managers will be able to process orders received from the online store directly in CRM.  Accounting and analysis of customer information will help increase the volume of repeat sales.  If the platform is different or even there is no website at all, the forms can still be used - they are created from your Bitrix24 with an address ending in .bitrix24.com and are available on a public page. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjxTjat5myE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQKGInrDkEPyLAbtTQmpnx8-FDyg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <strong>Integration with 1C</strong> </h4><br>  Thanks to integration with "1C" in your CRM is always the current catalog of products.  CRM managers are always aware of the progress of payment of bills, and they do not need to bother the accountant. <br>  Another free update for all Bitrix24 tariffs: using the 1C tracker, you can record in CRM not only online, but also traditional sales, using information from 1C, offline sales go to CRM.  For example, the home appliance store sold the iron offline, the information about the sale came in 1C, from there it was automatically transferred to CRM.  That is, data on sales from all sources imperceptibly fall into CRM.  This is exactly the same omni-channel, when you can collect data from all sales channels and build informative and accurate analytics. </blockquote><br><h4>  <strong>Marketplace</strong> </h4><br>  At the same time we talked to the sysadmin about the merketplaise and his experience in it. <br><br>  You can find everything in <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/apps/">the application store</a> Bitrix24: document designer, checking contractors, various mail services, calendars, exchange rates, dialers, cards, call scripts, warehouse programs, support, connectors for many applications that are popular with business and much more.  Something paid, something for free.  The marketplace creates almost limitless possibilities for working with Bitrix24 - it‚Äôs definitely worth looking through, especially since all applications are divided into categories and you can only find what you need for your business.  I like.  I have not yet posted my own, but I think it is just around the corner. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#4f4f4f">As of 2016, the Russian market offers a huge amount of CRM.</font>  <font color="#4f4f4f">At the same time, most of the programs do not correspond to this name, since they are either primitive and do not contain even a third of the functions, or are large-scale and are almost ERP-systems.</font>  <font color="#4f4f4f">Bitriks24 approached the question differently: we made a CRM module of an integrated corporate social network and even called it ‚Äúimperceptible CRM‚Äù - simply because the client is placed at the center of the business, but relations with him develop in conjunction with all other relationships.</font>  <font color="#4f4f4f">It is convenient for business, it is clear to employees, it ensures customer satisfaction.</font> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306102/</a></p>
