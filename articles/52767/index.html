  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I will not be successful</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For some time I actively read books and articles about various methods of achieving success.  These materials were completely different: brochures ‚Äúhow to change yourself in 10 days‚Äù, articles on some Internet resources, books from the series ‚Äúhelp yourself‚Äù, simple textbooks on psychology, notes of successful people. <br><br>  After reading, realizing, and having tried something, I came to the conclusion: I will not be successful. <br><br><h5>  Why? </h5><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will try to present systematically. <br>  Here's what I can't do:

      <b>Plan of the day</b> <br>  I can't plan my day!  Everything is constantly changing.  I did not have time to plan the laundry on a Saturday morning, as I met my old friend on Friday evening. <br>  I did not have time to decide to write a couple of other unit tests, as I urgently need to fix the bug to the deme, which, by the way, already today, because there is time 8 hours ago. <br><br>  <b>Take and do method</b> <br>  I can not take and do!  More precisely, it turns out to do it only once.  Then somehow it is forgotten that you have to get up and do a run, call your parents, throw out the garbage. <br>  Once, it was almost possible to follow the advice, get up and quit my job.  So far, glad that almost. <br><br>  <b>Write all thoughts in a notebook</b> <br>  I can not!  An amazing thing: when the notebook with you, no thoughts.  But if this infection has remained somewhere, then so much must be written down! <br>  But worst of all, when everything matched: there is a thought, and a notebook, you pull out a moleskin, a pen, you write something and immediately notice the suspicious look of colleagues and friends.  And then explain that this is such a method to become successful. <br><br>  <b>SMART, SQ 3 R., CRC-cards and PR.O.CH.</b> <br>  These approaches do not work for me!  These are different methods.  For different situations.  But every time I stumble about the same thing: how to decipher these letters and how to cram a problem into a given structure. <br>  For now, I remember that in what order I should write, while I think of how to describe the problem in narrow terms, I forget the original task. <br><br>  <b>Mindmap</b> <br>  I can't use the mental map!  Draw turns out.  Only in the process of drawing all the power goes to drawing, and not to solve the problem. <br>  And drawing such a map with a colleague is just awful: a lot of people were arguing about what is the result of what and how best to arrange it all.  Probably, we have very different mentality. <br><br>  <b>Goal setting and analysis</b> <br>  I cannot decide by whom I see myself in 10 years and how to come to this!  A couple of years ago I could not even imagine what I would do and where I would be right now.  And five years ago I was very afraid to fill up mate.  an  or not find a job in the specialty. <br>  But, honestly, the worst thing is when you have to answer not only what is your goal, but how to reach it.  A dozen ways come to mind.  And you know for sure that at first you try one, it doesn't work, you combine the first one with the fifth and seventh, you try again, change something again.  But there is no concrete plan. <br><br>  <b>Autotraining</b> <br>  I can‚Äôt convince myself of anything!  I can‚Äôt convince myself of anything! <br>  Seriously.  I do not feel the heat in my right leg.  I really want, but I do not feel.  I cannot lie to myself that I am smarter, more beautiful and more successful than others.  When I say these words, some voice inside the nasal words: "who are you fooling about?".  B-rr. <br><br>  <b>The rules of a successful person</b> <br>  I can not follow the rules of a successful person!  Moreover, I do not understand what it means to ‚Äúthink positively,‚Äù ‚Äútreat everything with humor,‚Äù ‚Äúsurround yourself with smart people,‚Äù and so on.  I not only constantly forget these formulas, but I cannot draw any conclusions from them either.  They are probably too deep.  Like the sound of one hand clapping ... <br><br>  <b>Correct dictionary</b> <br>  I can‚Äôt use a dictionary of successful people!  Well, you know, instead of ‚Äúweather is a nightmare,‚Äù you should say ‚Äúyesterday the weather was better.‚Äù  Or instead of "fool" to say "ordinary abilities."  I probably can't do it because, firstly, it is easier to call a spade a spade, and, secondly, it is very easy to forget the ‚Äúright‚Äù momentum.  So it turns out ‚Äútoday his abilities are more usual than yesterday.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The life of wonderful people</b> <br>  I cannot use knowledge of the biography of successful people.  Often I find a lot of similar.  However, I am always very different from one or another successful person: he finished Stanford, but I didn‚Äôt, he was lucky to meet a brilliant partner, but I didn‚Äôt, he managed to sign a contract with a large company, but I haven‚Äôt offered any deals yet.  Perhaps this all will happen to me.  But it will be a completely different biography. <br><br>  <b>Tests and Lists</b> <br>  I cannot use the results of tests and lists.  Well, with tests everything is clear to me.  It is impossible to conclude from the fact that my personality type is INTJ.  Honestly, I knew it without a test. <br>  But the lists are quite a misfortune: I am compiling a list of ‚Äúfive things that prevent me from achieving my main goal.‚Äù  I look at him.  New thoughts do not appear.  I already know all this.  Just wrote on a piece of paper.  Insight does not come. <br><br>  Probably something is wrong with me.  Probably, I cannot believe in the methods that have helped thousands of people.  Probably, I will never be successful. <br><br>  Will you become? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Before answering this question, I highly recommend scrolling through the comments.  There are many interesting opinions and sensible thoughts. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52767/</a></p>
