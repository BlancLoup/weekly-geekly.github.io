Culture to lead an active and healthy lifestyle in the entire post-Soviet space and at Habr√© itself grows by leaps and bounds and, the higher the well-being, the more sport.  This is an axiom. <br><br>  In the West, this topic is not new, and for a long time there has been a whole bunch of serious sports trackers.  It would seem that both quantity and quality should satisfy the market.  Actually it is.  Getting there is already difficult, but we had reasons to try.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8f/f30/29f/e8ff3029f1a9feba41efa06f93584c21.jpeg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  3 years ago, being IT people with a good background, we got sick with running and bicycles.  We quickly joined the sports crowd and realized what was happening.  Once (as is usually the case), while running in the forest, we thought about it - what if we make our own national sports tracker?  Suppose there are a million of them in the west, but there is no one of their own, but a big country ... <br><br>  Having a sufficiently powerful IT resource and a desire to thank the sport for a new quality of life that it gave us, we decided to start.  The pleasure (fuel) from the creation was the same as from a workout on a summer day on a bicycle in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%258D%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">aerobic zone</a> (from there and the name, by the way). <br><br>  Taking into account such serious and no longer young competitors (one million people) like Nike +, Endomondo, Sport Tracker, RunKeeper, Strava and another +100, we thought about how expedient it would be to go with them to the frontal one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bf/fbb/148/5bffbb148caa9c0e35f75ece4eca2b1a.jpg"><br><br>  The trick was that it didn‚Äôt have to do this, and if it were, it would have ended very badly for us.  The fact is that they were not interested in the Russian market.  For example, the European Endomondo, which is very close to Russia, refused to Russify its web interface (although there is even Polish), and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/110793/">Gipis</a> , seemingly made by our compatriots in Russia, for some reason did not want to look in our direction and left for west.  No localization and no interest. <br><br>  Empty niche is not the best sign!  The situation in Russia is very bad with a massive, even aerobic sport, and no one wanted to get involved in a laborious, expensive and very long development.  Many factors had to coincide in order to decide on this.  But our mosaic has developed.  That's why we made the FIRST NATIONAL SPORTS TRACKER of domestic production. <br><br>  1) Not localized, but real Russian. <br><br>  2) <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alex-99197/aerobia">Russian coach</a> .  And the voice is not synthesized, but alive, and, moreover, very pleasant. <br><br>  3) Support Yandex maps, and it is very relevant for athletes in the regions.  It is nowhere else yet. <br><br>  4) Strong friendship with popular Russian social networks: Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki.  And of course, Facebook and Twitter.  Do sports and laid out training, huskies are provided. <br><br>  5) Finally, it is very important - we want to gather in one place all our athletes and sports fans and create a national table of records and achievements. <br><br>  This is the main leitmotif of the project and we will carry this cross to the end.  Of course, now not everyone will go with us, giving preference to more sophisticated and stable Western trackers, but there are definitely people who will be interested in our main idea.  And as the project grows, other athletes from all the trackers will catch up, teaming up in one place. <br><br>  By the way, the chip is not only in one hundred percent localization of the service.  Aerobia will evolve along its own path and scenario, depending on what the local market requires of it.  As mentioned above, it is foolish to challenge such a giant as Nike + and make a tracker for the masses (this is their niche) or, on the contrary, try to compete with the very advanced (not for all) Sport Tracker.  Aerobia will be different. <br><br>  <b>So the main idea is the <a href="http://www.aerobia.ru/">FIRST NATIONAL SPORT TRACKER</a> .</b>  <b>What is now and what next?</b> <br><br>  Now <a href="http://www.aerobia.ru/">Aerobia</a> develops in two directions at once.  The first direction is the tracker itself.  The second is something like a sports social network.  That is to hang out on Aerobia and to be socially involved is literally good for health, since the time spent there is converted into sport and, accordingly, into health and longevity.  Here is such a formula, but more on that later. <br><br>  The tracker itself today has an entire core set for both professional and amateur.  For those who once a year, riding in jeans on a bike or running in sneakers for basketball, Aerobia will be too sporty.  Still, we are for those involved or decided to play sports regularly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4e/a8e/8be/b4ea8e8beeb420d5664859350b5b86e3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/140/587/77d/14058777de1cadd38d87d8565e144551.png"><br><br>  Probably, it does not make sense to meticulously chew the tracker functionality, since the people here are knowledgeable and quickly delve into (by the principle - reconnaissance in force).  Therefore, the following theses and differences will be described below. <br><br>  Now we have two applications for iPhone and Android (WM in the future).  They are designed to register training routes, report on the distance traveled and time, as well as to monitor the training of their friends.  Our application is simple as T-34, it is both a plus and a minus at the same time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e06/a8e/b9d/e06a8eb9daab8bfff750d85057076157.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89a/eec/87d/89aeec87df6b1cc78ed5ab7c9606019c.png"><br><br>  But after a few months, completely new applications are coming out.  The user will have the opportunity to customize their data fields for training, there will be support for Google maps (now only Yandex), the ability to take photos directly from the scene, social functions will be added.  The rest is a secret. <br><br>  For advanced users, there is support for all Garmin .GPX, .TCX and FIT devices.  Now we are doing support for the popular in Russia Polar.  You can also transfer data from other trackers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90b/faf/363/90bfaf363eb80921435dc2c3c3597f54.jpg"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe web service itself is to conduct and analyze in detail (planning in the future) your own training diary (map, speed, time, calories, heart rate, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a8/56a/a8b/9a856aa8bc6ea1325d3db31a51874b44.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f32/585/4ad/f325854ada5399b0ecde3d1ad00c907d.png"><br><br>  You can show the results of your workouts to friends both within Aerobia and in popular networks - VK, Facebook, Twitter, OK (likes are provided, verified).  As a rule, users are active and often comment on the results of training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c8/40b/57c/9c840b57c5b0e16bf65faac0373c5f74.png"><br><br>  We can compare your result with the result of other people (up to three people).  On other trackers, we have not seen this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d50/7d0/f0a/d507d0f0afa31b37d2ed4b6c4c65aa25.png"><br><br>  There are TOP records for running, biking and cross-country skiing.  In others, we did not find this either.  By the way, this function is often used <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed7/91d/cb5/ed791dcb5b44ad963add1b987a65d6e5.png"><br><br>  Aerobia automatically tracks your own records and informs you about it.  Motivates seriously. <br>  You can see which of your friends was doing the most this month. <br><br>  You can always find your like-minded people in the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù section (it is not necessary to register). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/569/ab9/556/569ab955638e2887d38936a377b6fda8.png"><br><br>  This is a very brief overview of the main differences and functions.  Much more will be, much in the process.  By the way, this can be monitored in the "what's new" section, but for this you need to register.  For those who want to learn more, you can read reviews <a href="http://www.twentysix.ru/blog/industry/107306.html">here</a> . <br><br>  And now about the second, very important direction of the project - <b>SOCIALITY</b> .  This is the main distinctive feature of the entire ‚Äúhundred‚Äù western trackers.  This is a great experiment - to make Sports Social Network based on the tracker.  Of course, this is a dream, and how it will turn out is unknown.  But I really want people to share their experiences, write about their preparations for marathons, how they chose a bike, upload photos of routes, throw training videos from GoPro cameras (external video hosting), like, comment and communicate, motivating each other . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e35/8b3/b75/e358b3b75318350236f9672b8f03c6e6.png"><br><br>  Aerobia is not a cold calculation of developer holdings.  This is a project with the soul and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpopularizing sports in Russia. <br><br>  There is still a lot of work.  Do not judge strictly.  Amen. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.aerobia.ru/">www.aerobia.ru</a> <br><br>  Here we also have <br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Aerobia">facebook</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/aerobia">In contact with</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173925/</a></p>
