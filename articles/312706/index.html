Fortunately for us, there are simple techniques that we can use to not disappear in this abyss and build a dynamic and modern interface that helps people solve problems. <br><br>  In the report, Zack will show a technique with which you can embed JavaScript components inside pages that rely on the server to create islands of interactivity.  It can be used in an existing system, adding only 20KB of archived JavaScript and some common sense. <br><br>  We think it's worth knowing!  Under the cut, Zack answers our questions about technology and life.  As usual, we publish the answers in the original and our free translation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How did you get into Ruby development?</b> <br><br>  I graduated from college in 2002, right after the dot-com crash, and could not find a job in the technology field.  Because of this, in my career there was a ten-year hook related to the disassembly of the mail.  Manual first;  then using machines that sort the mail;  then preparing the data that is printed in the mail;  later creating prediction models for address selection.  The first models I created were in Excel, then I started using static sql scripts when my models became so popular that I could no longer use Excel (120 GB of these addresses only in one of my tables).  I chose Ruby and Rails, because I needed to create reports on zip codes, there are no for i = 1 loops in sql;  i &lt;10 ... When I started learning Ruby, I was hooked, I quit my job to become a Ruby developer in 3 months. <br><br>  I graduated from college in 2002, right after the crash and I couldn‚Äôt get a job in tech.  This threw my career path on a 10 year long detour into sorting mail;  It‚Äôs not a problem.  I can't use Excel anymore.  (120gigabytes of data tables.) I don‚Äôt provide loops.  Once I started learning Ruby, I‚Äôve been a Ruby developer within 3 months. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  My team in Table XI just launched <a href="https://www.thespicehouse.com/">thespicehouse.com</a> .  I am very proud of how we combined the traditional Rails application with small islands of interactivity.  Now I am preparing a series of tutorials and posts to help people create beautiful dynamic UI using no more javascript than necessary. <br><br>  My team at Table XI just launched <a href="https://www.thespicehouse.com/">www.thespicehouse.com</a> .  I‚Äôm pretty proud of the Rails app.  If you‚Äôre more interested, you‚Äôll be more comfortable than ever. <br><br>  <b>What is missing from Rails in your opinion?</b> <br><br>  All 2014 I wrote on Clojure (Script), all 2015 - on JavaScript which used JSON API from the Golang services.  In 2016, I returned to Rails after a two-year gap, and I was happy more than ever!  Other stacks have Sinatra clones, but they rarely give developers a pleasant work experience like Rails.  Allow me to say that I am tired again and again in my work on database migration, XSS protection, link helpers, and asset manifest.  During these two years outside the Rails ecosystem, I had the feeling that I lived without a toilet and hot water.  But for all that, Rails needs the support of tools that are already used in the NPM ecosystem.  Asset pipeline is difficult to use partially, and even harder to get rid of it.  The problem is that without tools based on Npm, it‚Äôs impossible for a rail worker to simply take and use CSS compilers, modules for ES6 and hot-swappable modules.  If I worked in a grocery company, I would have spent the time to throw out Sprokets and replace them with Npm, but I do dozens of projects.  Replacing the Sprockets in each one will require too much work. <br><br>  I spent 2014 writing Clojure (Script) and 2015 writing JavaScript that consumed a JSON API from Golang services.  2016 I can't be happier.  Other programming cultures have Sinatra clones but they rarely have a good Rails-like developer experience.  Let me tell you what you need, and how much hassled over and over again.  It was a rainy day.  That being said, Rails needs the tooling that's made available to NPM.  The asset pipeline is a harder to get rid of.  It is a problem that I‚Äôm not in trouble.  If I‚Äôm working on a workflow, I‚Äôm looking at what I‚Äôve been working on.  Replacing the sprockets for each project. <br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  In fact, lately I have been writing more in JavaScript than in Ruby, although in my heart I consider myself a ruby.  I would write Standard ML all day if it pleased users. <br><br>  I actually write more javascript than Ruby these days, though I consider myself a Ruby at heart.  If you‚Äôre so delight users. <br><br>  <b>What technology, in your opinion, will be the most promising in the near future?</b> <br><br>  Views that can be rendered both on the server and on the client.  For example, this is Meteor JS or React.  I do not think that one of these technologies will ‚Äúwin‚Äù, they are difficult to use effectively on projects with limited budgets.  But I am sure that we are waiting for the omnipresent rendering. <br><br>  Views that can be rendered on the server or client.  Think Meteor JS or React.  I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm thinking of those technologies. <br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b> <br><br>  OSS is the only way to solve complex problems.  Privacy kills software innovations.  OSS is the only way to solve hard problems.  Secrecy kills software innovation. <br><br>  <b>What was the last thing you learned from the world of web development?</b> <br><br>  I try not to follow the technology news.  You will never see me on Reddit or Hacker News, because it takes too much time and takes energy that can be spent on in-depth study.  I recently read about the history of Unix and the C language, because I want to figure out how we came to where we are now.  This <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html">book</a> was published in 2003. It is not new, but I liked it! <br><br>  I try to write to developer news.  You‚Äôll never find out what you‚Äôre learning about.  I‚Äôm going to read about the history of Unix and the C programming language lately.  Here's the book, published in 2003. <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html">www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/index.html</a> Not really news but I'm enjoying it! <br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  I sometimes listen to Shop Talk Show, in principle, that's all. <br><br>  Talk Shows <br><br>  <b>Last read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  I just finished ‚ÄúC of the 21st Century‚Äù and now took up the ‚ÄúArt of Unix programming‚Äù.  I want to understand the story, how we came to what is now.  I think it's time to learn C, which controls the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat I use. <br><br>  I just finished 21st Century C Programming.  I want to understand it. <br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Make sites.  Plan 25% more time than usual for your work and spend this time trying to figure out how to make it even better.  You are suspicious of every line of code you write.  Trying to justify the use of every feature, every heme, every abstraction.  At least a year to be a real TDD fanatic, and then not write tests for half a year.  The most important thing is to fight for your users.  You are the only one who will do this. <br><br>  Build websites.  If you are comfortable with it, take it 25%.  Be suspicious of every line of code you write.  Try to justify pulling out, every gem, and every darling abstraction.  Spend at least one year, then spend 6 months writing no tests at all.  Most importantly, fight for your users.  You're the only one who will. <br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  We all get tired of the code.  We must have hobbies that are not related to programming, and friends who do not know how to write code.  Do not work too much.  And when you understand how to do this - let me know?  :) <br><br>  Getting tired of coding happens to all of us.  How do you know how to code.  I don‚Äôt know how to do that. <br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had a couple of months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  I would create a series of high-quality screencasts or write a book about how I created Rails applications ‚Äúenriched‚Äù with JavaScript. <br><br>  I build JavaScript enriched Rails apps. <br><br>  <b>What do you generally expect from the conference?</b> <br><br>  I have never been to Russia, so I want to see as many sights as possible and meet as many wonderful people as possible.  I also want to take the opportunity to personally thank Matz, because if Ruby had not been so cool, I might not have been a developer today. <br><br>  I have been able to meet as many people as I can.  Matz because I don‚Äôt want to be a programmer today. <br><br>  If you want to talk to Zach personally, there is no place to postpone the purchase of a ticket, the last places are left!  Registration is <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">here</a> , the ticket price is 9000 rubles. <br><br>  Thanks to the companies that support the conference: <br><br><blockquote> General partner: <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a> <br>  Gold Partners: <a href="http://rambler-co.ru/">Rambler &amp; Co</a> , <a href="http://www.at-consulting.ru/">AT-Consulting</a> and <a href="http://npoprogress.com/">Progress</a> <br>  Silver Partner: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> <br>  Bronze Partners: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> , <a href="http://www.voltmobi.com/ru/">VoltMobi</a> , <a href="http://restream.rt.ru/">Restrim</a> , <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">InSales</a> and <a href="http://www.seendex.ru/">Seendex.</a> <br>  Beer partner supporting traditional afterparty - <a href="https://cloudcastle.ru/">CloudCastle</a> </blockquote><br>  See you at <b><a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub</a></b> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312706/</a></p>
