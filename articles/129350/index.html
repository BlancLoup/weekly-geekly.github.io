  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 - Attempt # 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I‚Äôm driving recently on the subway, and an uncle standing nearby is reading something on Fujitsu Siemens under Windows Mobile.  From time to time he looks at my tablet on Android with interest ... We talked.  While we reached the center, he told me his story of acquaintance with robotic tablets - I did not like it.  ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù - I ask.  He says, he took hold of the Samsung Galaxy Tab (the very first) - it tupit even stronger than the Windows machine.  Well, I told him about the fact that the industry has long made a step forward, a bunch of other ‚Äútablets‚Äù have appeared, and the second version of the seven-inch Taba is coming out soon - thin, powerful, on the third Android and most importantly - still capable of calling.  I did not have time anymore - my stop was, so I am telling here. <br><br><img src="http://www.nomobile.ru/upload/iblock/27a/samsung_galaxy_tab_7-7_645_1.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is what? </h4><br>  Samsung‚Äôs first tablet, although occasionally caught in the eyes of public transport, can hardly be called successful.  There were some good decisions in it, but he didn‚Äôt have enough performance to run Android 2.x, which in principle wasn‚Äôt intended for tablets.  But the new Galaxy Tab 7.7 is another matter.  Well, that is, in theory it should be.  In practice, so far everything is not so rosy: an engineering sample that has stayed with me for half a day, with its own, to put it mildly, slowness, hinted that it was far from final software.  But in terms of iron, everything is just fine: the quirky screen Super AMOLED Plus, a powerful processor in the Samsung Exynos, GSM-module ... However, let's get better in order!

    <h4>  Design </h4><br>  The gadget looks like a tablet and a phone at the same time.  For the tablet speak heavily rounded corners and a large screen.  For the phone - everything else: the speaker for calls, the webcam on the short side of the device, the characteristic backdrop and the location of controls.  Is that the Home button under the display is missing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/774/49e/c0d/77449ec0d8b41f28371c7eab579f124d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To be honest, I don‚Äôt understand at all how the court could decide to ban sales of 7.7 in most EU countries, because it looks like an iPad.  Immediately full of details that make it just unlike the Apple gadget! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c6/d89/d9e/0c6d89d9e53f31e99c83720731c7d6a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Screen Galaxy Tab 7.7 has a diagonal of 7.7 inches (surprisingly, right? =) And a resolution of 1280x800 pixels.  And the last is really surprising: perhaps only iPhone 4 and Galaxy Note can boast of their density.  Being somewhere on the Prospectus of the World in the transition from radial to annular, you can reassure yourself that the pixels on the screen of the tablet are even tighter than you!  But then, thanks to these "poor fellows", the picture is juicy and clear. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Unlike the models 10.1 and 8.9, the new ‚ÄúSeven‚Äù is built on another chipset - Samsung Exynos, which, for example, also has the Galaxy S II smartphone.  For graphics in the Galaxy Tab 7.7, the Mali-400 chip is responsible.  For the speed of the system - gigabytes of DDR-2 RAM.  In synthetic tests, this bundle "does" NVIDIA Tegra 2, and in practice, there is a feeling that solves some problems a little faster.  In general, the difference is almost not visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fa/e93/329/7fae933292bda9616fcf4c2203d8dbcd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for memory, a Flash array with a capacity from 16 to 64 GB is installed here, and in addition there is an opportunity to expand it with a microSD card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e32/7af/13b/e327af13b9e6e5f1d8edb3af6eee7cf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  About the software can only say one thing.  The device runs on Android 3.2 with TouchWiz shell.  What will be the final set of applications, "we are not given to predict."  Although, judging by the presence of the IR port, there will most likely be proprietary software for managing household appliances. <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4><br>  5100 mAh - is it a lot or a little?  For the phone, perhaps, a lot, but for the tablet?  This question could only be answered by chasing a gadget for several days.  Well, at least a day ... I only had 5 hours to meet him, during which time he was discharged by 35%, so I can only estimate roughly.  Galaxy Tab 10.1 has a 7000 mAh battery and lasts for 12 hours of active use.  But there is more screen, it is made on a different (more voracious) technology, and the iron is not Samsung, but from NVIDIA.  In addition, there is in nature a smart Galaxy S II with a 1700 mAh battery, built on the same chipset, only its screen diagonal is two times smaller.  From this we can conclude that 7.7 will work for at least 12 hours, and maybe more.  Let's hope for the best! <br><br><h4>  Competitor </h4><br>  As a competitor for the Galaxy Tab 7.7, only HTC Flyer is now, since all the other seven-inch tablets are in the wrong weight category - their performance is at a clearly lower level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/780/4a2/d97/7804a2d97748ac4b019ee2488b9c3aa3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  No matter how bitter for me (a fan of HTC products with experience), 7.7 still wins on points.  Flyer can trump both the unusual appearance and the Sense shell, but so far there is Android 2.x and a very weak battery.  Samsung corny takes manufacturability. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Something like the second attempt by Samsung to make a compact tablet.  If we turn a blind eye to the so far frankly soft software, this time we managed to clearly better than the first: the gadget has become thinner, more powerful, it works now on the third Android, there is a telephone module, the tablet has a good battery ... It‚Äôs just sales.  Companies need not be late with shipping to stores and set an adequate price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/922/8d9/3bc/9228d93bc2bb21068082fb105537ef2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS Thanks to an unknown fellow traveler for the dialogue!  I just did not know which lead to write to the material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129350/</a></p>
