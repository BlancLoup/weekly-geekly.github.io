The main problem is the impossibility of the existence of the ideal manager described in the books, who will easily solve any problem in any conditions.  The concept of "management" is blurry and often given and understood in different ways.  The author gives his universal definition to management: "this is ensuring the <u>effectiveness</u> and <u>efficiency of the</u> organization in the <u>short</u> and <u>long</u> term."  It should be applicable to any kind of organization, be it a family, a non-profit organization, a firm, or a government. <br><br>  This definition implies 4 main management functions: production (P), administration (A), entrepreneurship (E) and integration (I).  Together, they are called PAEI-code, which is used to assess the management style of a manager.  No one is perfect and can not be strong at once in all four components, but they are required for the successful activity of the organization. <br><br>  The way out is a complementary team of managers, each member of which is strong in one or several directions, and together they completely cover the entire PAEI code.  But this approach is complicated by the relationships of people using different management styles.

      The book discusses the difficulties of creating such a team, the inevitability of conflicts and their benefits, ways of turning destructive conflicts into constructive ones, the role of a leader, organizational structure and a look at the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company.  It gives a vision of how you can change the approach to training managers in universities and companies.  In addition, the author constantly reinforces his ideas with the extensive experience of ‚Äúhealing‚Äù various organizations in many countries, showing how the world is constantly changing and how its methodology allows us to adapt and survive in these conditions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Current state of affairs </h4><br>  Management as a profession is rapidly developing the last century, but the ideal still does not exist.  Tales of him are not reflected in life.  Educational literature assigns dozens of responsibilities to a manager, implying the ability to do everything at once.  In practice, all people have disadvantages and weak points, this is passed on to be considered and to look for workarounds.  Management is too complicated a process to be managed by one person.  It is better to perform individual functions well than to do everything mediocre <br><br>  Another problem is that there is no generally accepted definition of the word "management."  There are millions of managers, but there is no definition.  In practice, such arrangements as hierarchy, the one-pointedness of the process from top to bottom, the inheritance of the elect (the value component), and individual management work are often understood as managing.  Different understanding of the process is connected with the peculiarities of the social-political structure (the USSR and Yugoslavia with their communism, the USA and Israel with their culture of individualism and Japan, focused on interpersonal relations), various translations of the word manage and the confusion they cause. <br><br>  The author considers the discrete division of people into workers and managers to be wrong.  By management, he understands a process in which people who are not in managerial positions and do not have subordinates can take part.  This should not be a one-sided process of ‚Äúmanaging the subordinates,‚Äù but an entry into the dialogue.  The problem is in the current formulation of the question: it describes how the control should look, and not why and how to arrive at it.  The new paradigm requires a connection with reality, the ability to control this reality, universality, free from value judgments. <br><br><h4>  New paradigm </h4><br>  The goal of all organizations is the same - to meet the needs of their customers.  Only the effectiveness of this process is measured differently.  Without this goal, striving only to survive, it would be like cancer.  An organization needs to be managed so that it has existed for thousands of years, such as the church.  Four functions of the PAEI code are necessary and sufficient for such control.  Production (P) provides performance in the short term, administration (A) - short-term efficiency, entrepreneurship (E) and integration (I) - respectively, performance and efficiency in the long term.  (E) is associated with the risk of creativity.  (I) determines the atmosphere in the organization, its viability and value system.  In this paper, these codes correspond to the questions: what is (P), how is (A), when / why (E) and who (I).  Without these questions, any solution risks being half-baked. <br><br>  In a healthy company, all four functions are performed at the proper level.  It is functional, systematized, anticipating external changes, a single organism.  If any of the functions is missing, then the company is sick.  And in diseases, its predictable causes, symptoms and consequences.  For example, countries with excessive administration or integration and insufficient entrepreneurship are considered (USSR and Japan).  Depending on the stage of the life cycle in organizations, there are imbalances in the management style.  So, in young companies, (P) and (E) usually prevail, to which (A) is added when growing up, in old age we have a pronounced (A) bureaucracy.  To survive this aging you need to make a constant rejuvenation and style adjustment.  As with vitamins, for proper effect, the intake of PAEI functions must be balanced. <br><br>  Consider individual management styles.  Capital letter indicates strengths, and lowercase - performed at a satisfactory level.  It is important for the manufacturer (Paei) to know his client, his needs, market characteristics, technology, he needs motivation to achieve results, the ability to bring the work to the end.  The administrator (pAei) does not deal with the production himself, but forces the whole system to work, attention to detail is important to him, organization of the process, avoiding the invention of bicycles, strict adherence to procedures, he adheres to the budget, monitors deadlines, oversees implementation, anticipates problems and breaks insane ideas in dust and dust, covers the rear, serves those who achieve results.  Entrepreneur (E) plans for the future, works with changing realities, makes implementation plans for (A), works today to get results tomorrow, puts forward many successful and not-so-good ideas, torn between them, is ready to act and risk, he knows what he wants and why, always sees the goal.  He has the gift to see through the fog, he does not need to see the entire elephant, already by one big ear and trunk he understands what it is, it requires a creative approach, supplementing the available information with something of his own, without creativity, even after seeing the entire elephant, doubts remain , the need to touch and measure it.  The integrator (I) gives people the communication they need with their own kind, turns the mechanistic system into an organic one, unites people, achieves teamwork, compensates for the shortcomings of one member of a group with the advantages of others, turns individual entrepreneurship into a group, allows an organization to relive its leaders, protects the global interests of the company , the most creative work of all, because it is connected with other people, looking for deep, not superficial, does not allow the indispensability of people, subtly feels others  Dei, understands what is said and what is meant.  Without (I) the skill of not being a leader.  The given tasks are not performed by themselves, someone has to deal with them, this is the management, regardless of the position or being on the company‚Äôs staff. <br><br>  Definitions are given, but the ideal is not visible.  And it will not be visible, perfection is not possible, since everything is subject to change.  To be good at the same time, it can not be such constantly.  Another reason is that these functions conflict with each other.  Coinciding with time, they reduce each other‚Äôs effectiveness.  (P) and (E) threaten each other.  Control (A) affects productivity (P), more generally, it is a struggle of form and function.  (A) is mechanistic, (I) requires organic.  (P) requires urgency, and (i) calls for tolerance.  (E) is eager for change, and (I) is looking for harmony, which he parses (E).  The opposite happened in Japan, where (I) won for a long time and successfully (E), the family supplanted the revolution.  (A) c (E) is conservatism versus radicalism.  The only useful incompatibility is obtained when (I) inhibits growth (A).  All these "vitamins" are interdependent, the lack of one limits the effectiveness of others. <br><br>  Recalling the need for a complete PAEI code, consider the consequences of the lack of any function.  For simplicity, the most extreme manifestations are considered.  The lone hero (P ---) will go right through, punching the walls, will not cope with the administration, has no creativity, does not generate ideas, does not care about the work of the team, works all day long, measures success with the intensity of his work, understands everything literally , hates meetings, does everything only by himself, transfers work when it is too late and failure has happened, confuses quality with quantity, its employees are running errands, people are tools, does not see the big picture.  The bureaucrat (-A--) is too focused on details, does not take risks, the schedule is sacred for him, sees value, but does not understand value, only control over what is happening is important, works with his fellows, spends a lot of time on meetings and trivia, impedes New projects, makes colleagues to work around, his typical answer is: ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù.  Pyro (--E-) is always torn between decisions and obsessed with innovation, the main question: "Why not?", The schedule of his work is not known to anyone, has no plan, subordinates applaud him, but do nothing, because tomorrow plans change, cannot concentrate, looks for the guilty, loves chaos, completely ignores details, soars in the clouds and does not see what is happening on earth, uses numbers only for guidance, contradicts itself, is emotional, does not tolerate doubts in its ideas, does not can listen to others, exaggerates, budget for not  on does not matter.  A hot supporter (--- I) is a politician, there is no opinion, strangers adhere only while it is profitable, he is only interested in apparent agreement with others, does not solve deep-seated problems, does not accept solutions that make the situation more intense, even if they are necessary, always with communicates, modifies the received information with its accents and details, it cannot be brought out to clean water, he is always dodgy and evasive, works with people who are alike, using people as agents for probing the soil around.  Dead stump (----) is obtained from the above, is not able to perform any function, compliant, friendly, safe, people tolerate him and do not offend, he has no initiative, the only goal is to save his place, to avoid change and new work, he does not resist, agrees to everything and does nothing, looks for ways to show his own significance, acts purely mechanically, does not complain.  all the work done is water, an imitation of activity, his subordinates are the same dead stumps, he does not leave the organization himself, either he is removed, or he dies. <br><br><h4>  Complementary team </h4><br>  In order to achieve the completeness of the PAEI-code, and it requires exactly full coverage of all functions at a good level, you need to put together a team from carriers of different styles, the strengths of which can be combined to get the full PAEI.  It makes no sense to clone their advantages, if there is no one to close the disadvantages that everyone has.  In such a team, the participants should not have dashes, and the team itself should not have a mediocre level of performing any of the functions.  People with dashes will not be able to hear others, styles of others should be accepted and welcomed.  Team members are aware of their disadvantages and seek to compensate for them.  The group does not imply equality, it needs a leader and it disposes to individual leadership.  In such a group, it is good to consult about the problems, since other participants will most likely have their own different opinion.  The difficulty here is only that it is necessary to put up with each other's styles, and this is far from easy.  Decisions should be honestly criticized from the standpoint of all four functions, conflict can not be avoided.  Sources of conflict: purpose, information and reward. <br><br>  Management styles vary in a number of areas: structured or not process, local and global focus, slow or fast speed, priority to a process or result.  Most conflicts between carriers of opposite styles (P - I, A - E), but not everything goes smoothly among neighbors.  Another reason is different attitudes and the use of words (yes / no / maybe), due to which there are different interpretations.  There are different ways of expressing agreement or disagreement, which are understood by the participants in the discussion in their own way.  People confuse the real, the desired and the desired.  Here you need a translator.  To understand an opponent, you need to take into account his style. <br><br>  So, conflict is inevitable.  Is it bad?  Not always, the presence of a conflict shows the effectiveness of management, the main thing is to know the measure and use it constructively.  If employees do not get along, then they spend energy on internal conflicts, and in fact could be engaged in external marketing.  It is important to increase the ratio of external and internal energy consumption.  It is necessary to make people‚Äôs differences work for us, not against.  This can be achieved only by creating in the team an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect.  Then conditions favorable for learning are created and the conflict is considered not as a threat, but as an opportunity to learn something new.  We are growing due to disagreements.  Even if a different approach is unpleasant, it still makes it possible to develop at the expense of new ideas.  In most cases, a conflict discussion can be completed by mutual decision-making, moreover, it will be even better after sharpening by two different people.  The potential of such a group is higher than the capabilities of individual participants.  But if two people absolutely agree on everything, then you can do without one of them. <br><br>  Even if the decision was made, it still needs to be implemented.  This requires a common interest of all participants in the process, but it is difficult to constantly maintain it, since the interests of people are often opposite.  One way out is to strive for a common interest in the long term.  Then participants can come to terms with the local disadvantage of the situation for themselves in the name of future benefits, because everyone is working for a common large-scale goal. <br><br>  For trust and respect we must accept those who are not like us.  This is not easy, as it is difficult to communicate and understand them.  You need to be able to listen, you need patience, sometimes it is painful.  Tolerance begins with patience.  Once again - all these sacrifices in the name of something new.  When they trust, having made a decision, the team members disagree to introduce it, rather than look at each other, expecting a stab in the back.  It is important to make a thoughtful collective decision and then quickly implement it, rather than accept it alone and introduce eternity.  The possibility of forming such an atmosphere is determined by four factors: (1) the right people are the most valuable asset, now it is fashionable and true, they are difficult to find and painful to lose, it is much easier to change material objects, the right people need to be sent to competitors, (2) the process requires skill communicate in all PAEI languages, and, one-on-one, and in a group conversation, (3) structure - short-term tasks should be separated from long-term ones, at the intersection of interests, managers can harm each other, (4) common views and values ‚Äã‚Äãare marginal  A solid stone of an organization striving for trust and respect, the decisive role is played by the leaders, since it is they who form the culture. <br><br>  Another important rule: slow down during a conflict.  It is better to solve the problem slowly but surely, rather than fly into a ravine at speed.  Typical abnormal behaviors include irritation, raising your voice, interrupting and tapping your fist on the table during stubborn argumentation.  The result of this behavior is a destructive conflict.  The best and most successful leaders are becoming calmer and calmer with an escalation of the conflict.  The author calls this a duck theory of management: outwardly imperturbable duck very quickly goes through under the water.  Conflict does not need to be avoided, but it is necessary to delve into it as deeply as possible. <br><br><h4>  Structure and Roles </h4><br>  Will there be enough correct team to achieve the goals of the organization?  This command will personify the form and function of the organization.  However, if being out of place the manager will not give the maximum result, he will have to adjust himself to his responsibilities, which will reduce his effectiveness.  It requires the right organizational structure and processes.  Robert Frost wrote: "The neighbor is good when the fence is good."  The structure provides an area for effective application of efforts, since it determines what kind of support from other departments you can count on, and what tasks you need to concentrate on yourself.  It should minimize the areas of intersection of duties and reverse ownerless areas of activity. <br><br>  The correct structure contains 3 important components: <br><ul><li>  responsibility structure </li><li>  authority structure, power and influence </li><li>  remuneration structure </li></ul>  All of them are necessary and in the amount sufficient for the effectiveness of the structure.  With their help, you can determine the contribution of participants to success or failure.  It must be remembered that responsibility is different from duties.  Responsibility is implied when there is an opportunity to achieve results.  To achieve the goal, you need authority and their boundary, and to stimulate their use - reward.  If these three components are observed, a person can and should be held accountable for failing to fulfill his duties. <br><br>  It is interesting regarding the dissemination of information on the structural hierarchy.  If a person has only one source of information for making a decision, then he becomes a hostage of this source, without being able to verify the authenticity of the information and obtain an objective picture.  The scheme works much better with several unrelated sources with its own points of view.  This will provide a more complete and voluminous picture, will enable the combination of this information to obtain new and effective its effective use. <br><br>  With serious revisions of the company's mission, restructuring is indispensable: what was effective in previous activities is unlikely to be the best tool in another context, the old structure will conflict with new goals.  Conscious pain in rebuilding structures is necessary to avoid even worse consequences in the future.  One of the typical mistakes in such a situation is to change processes instead of structure when the company's course changes.  Ideally, the strategy should manage the structure, but in practice often the opposite happens.  The result is that the tail starts wagging the dog.  This is due to the fact that the restructuring process is painful and risky, especially for its organizer, the strategy is much easier to change.  Why again such difficulties?  The fact is that the structure stagnates, turns into a habit and loses its effectiveness, it will begin to define the process (function), although initially it was the process that determined the structure (form).  If it is not revised, it is dead. <br><br>  Unsuccessful examples of the structure: combining the sales and marketing department with a single manager (their functions (P) and (E) will interfere with each other, at least one of them will suffer), combining accounting and finance ((A) against (E)), department of research and production ((E) and (P)).  An effective basic model divides the directions at least into: Production (P), Sales (P), Marketing (E), Research (E), Human Resource Management (A), Personnel Development (E), Accounting (A) and Finance (E ) and the CEO of the company (I).  Its practical implementation is highly dependent on the stage of the company's life cycle.  Thus, a young company may look like: Production (P), Sales (P), Personnel Service (A), Accounting (A) and CEO (EI), replacing marketing, finance and research. <br><br>  After determining the structure you need to pick people.  To find out whether a person is suitable, you need to understand his style.  An approximate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit can be obtained in the order and number of questions (P), (A), (E), (I) -types asked by man.  It should also be understood which styles of current team members need to be supplemented, what are the requirements of the tasks, at what stage of the life cycle is the organization.  At the stage of becoming more are required (PE) -people in youth - (PA), after - (AE), during the heyday - (EI), with aging - (PE), and in case of crisis (P).  The style should bring maximum benefit in the appropriate place, otherwise there is a need for costly retraining of the person.           :        (P/A),    (E/I),      (),   (/),   (),     (),    (),    (),   (),   (I),     (),      (),   (   )    (),       (, ,        ). ,  ,     ()- , (PE) ‚Äî , () ‚Äî   , (I) ‚Äî    (PA) . <br><br><h4>      </h4><br>         ?       .     ‚Äî   ,        .

All feedback on the presentation should be divided into 3 groups: questions, doubts and objections. These groups need to be discussed consistently. First you need to discuss the issues, they are quite neutral and should not lead to discord during the discussion. Each question should be considered in full, all ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù should be answered. After analyzing all the questions, the next group should move from the group of doubts to the group of questions, and after them the objections. If an intractable question is encountered and the study does not help in depth, the decision on it should be postponed until the next meeting. During the time between meetings, people's thoughts will settle down, they can change their opinions and the question is likely to be resolved.It is also important to monitor the protective response of the participants. It can manifest itself from fatigue or discussing unpleasant problems. The person begins to get angry and hurry, at this moment it is important to be able to slow down. A typical sign would be degradation of the participants' behavior to the brightest anti-examples (P ---), (-A--), and so on.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Without general rules, collective conditions risk becoming either anarchy or the dictatorship of one person. </font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Leader and his role </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For effective work of the group, she needs a leader. It creates conditions for collaboration, develops common views and values. This ability is called the ability to integrate, it does not allow any of the participants to become indispensable. It transforms mechanistic communication into organic, turns individual entrepreneurship into a group. Teamwork does not mean full equality of its participants. Each has its own role. Drawing an analogy with the hand, you can call the leader with your thumb - it can work in conjunction with any of the participants, and with all at once. When discussing problems, the team should independently come to a consensus.
