  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota will live contrary to the negative asset value</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, a number of media outlets published the news that in early April, Scartel LLC (the owner of the Yota brand) filed reports with a negative net asset value.  Negative assets of Scartel for 2 years in a row.  If you follow the letter of the law, this means that there is a question about the inevitable liquidation of this operator, who was once the pioneer of a cheap mass unlimited Internet, and now performing the functions of a virtual operator at MegaFon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69b/a6f/b98/69ba6fb989604660aac5ce5ac89490c3.png"><br><br>  Journalists made such a conclusion.  However, representatives of MegaFon have already said that this is nonsense. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.mskagency.ru/materials/2656082">Literally:</a> ‚ÄúThis is complete nonsense.  Yota successfully works, develops business and increases revenue.  There is no question of any liquidation. ‚Äù  In addition, in December 2016, Megafon and Mail.ru Group, when they announced the expansion of the partnership, announced the imminent launch of the VKmobile service, including on the Scartel network.

      Representatives of the company explained the negative assets of investments in infrastructure for new regions and high development costs.  Indeed, Yota has always invested much more in infrastructure development than it earned.  I used to build LTE, now 5G.  Together with "Megaphone".  Less than a year ago, MegaFon‚Äôs CEO stated that the purchase of Scartel was <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3031549">justified</a> because it bought a unique frequency spectrum.  In the future, this spectrum will enable the company to provide high-speed traffic.  And he expects the results in 5-7 years.  That is, in about 2023, not earlier.  The Scartel bands really are more than frequencies of all other operators.  It was assumed that he would build a federal LTE network with funds from the Big Three operators and then he would hand it over to those who wanted it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù has already expressed that Yota will live and everything is fine with it.  Now the management of the operator need only decide on a way to increase net assets and choose the best.  The question is why did they allow them to fall under the formal requirements, which, however, in practice are not implemented by either the tax or the courts in the liquidation procedure for working firms.  Typically, the tax service simply invites the head of the company to the commission in the IFTS, where he is invited to raise net assets to the desired level.  If the company has no wage and tax debts, then Scartel has at least 3 to 6 months to put the indicators in order. <br><br>  The main shareholder can make additional contributions to the authorized capital (issue), increase the additional capital by revaluating fixed assets and intangible assets, or by direct formation of additional capital and finally replenish the reserve capital.  Scartel itself can write off overdue payables if its term exceeds 3 years and it has not been submitted for payment by creditors, for example, shareholders. <br><br>  In recent years, starting in 2014, the company had short-term debt and ranged from 1 to 4 billion rubles.  If a billion is the same since 2014, then writing off such an amount is the fastest way, although it will lead to an increase in income tax.  However, you still have to add another 1 billion rubles from above.  Or revaluation of intangible assets.  MegaFon paid for Yota more than a billion dollars.  And this amount was paid precisely for the frequency. <br><br>  The reasons why "Scartel" made such a situation a lot.  Megafon recently bought Mail.ru and are now busy with reorganization procedures there, and they are not up to Scartel, everyone is used to his permanent losses, and it‚Äôs possible that the shareholders have been waiting for 3 years and will now write off the extra loans. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403103/</a></p>
