  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CeBIT 2013 - iron, girls and continuous disappointments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ca/a5b/32f/2caa5b32f86f388ca141cd2aa85dbedd.jpg"><br>  <b>CeBIT</b> is one of the largest exhibitions in the computer industry in the world.  Every year at the beginning of March in Hannover in Germany, an enormous exhibition takes place.  In 2012, <b>CeBIT</b> was quite popular due to the announcement of motherboards based on the <b>Intel Z77</b> chipset.  This year, <b>Intel has</b> postponed the launch of the <b>Z87</b> chipset for the summer, prompting many major motherboard manufacturers not to go to Hanover.  A similar situation with the transfer of a new generation of <b>AMD</b> video cards has also affected the manufacturers of video cards.  After the first three hours of visiting the exhibition, we looked at the covers for the Iphone, all sorts of USB flash drives, and even upset.  Nevertheless, we found some new glands and beautiful girls on German soil and we hasten to share with you. <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/130/02f/640/13002f640916f6536572d5fddc32371a.jpg"><br>  Already by tradition.  We were first met by <b>ASRock</b> company booth.  This year, the Taiwan motherboard manufacturer will host an overclocking show featuring overclocking masters <b>Nich Shih</b> , <b>SF3D</b> and <b>Perica_barii</b> .  Today there is no overclocking, but you can safely look at the first motherboard on <b>Intel Z87</b> performed by <b>ASRock</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e1/9f8/24c/3e19f824c6df5e713e33b70c8c1e2bf3.jpg"><br>  It is seen that the <b>ASRock Z87 Extreme6</b> is not yet ready to end, as evidenced by the lack of a cooling system for the south bridge and the power supply system.  Although it may be some trick, Taiwanese do not want to show the final design of motherboards before their time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f9/b85/553/2f9b855539cf415bd7f628880dba8645.jpg"><br>  Just five meters away is <b>Biostar</b> , another motherboard manufacturer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fec/4f2/fb3/fec4f2fb31b30448b3e1a4a6da52152e.jpg"><br>  New product based on the <b>Intel Z87</b> <b>Biostar</b> called <b>Hi-Fi Z87X 3D</b> and is positioned as the basis for a home multimedia station.  As seen in the photo, in the lower left corner there is a somewhat unusual ‚Äúsound zone‚Äù for motherboards, led by a microcontroller, hidden under a metal cover. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc4/2ce/bd2/bc42cebd2746ab1d230548251d5ef6ed.jpg"><br>  The stand of <b>Thermaltake</b> greeted us with a presentation of a new gaming headset.  Naturally, there is a large mass of cooling systems, cases, and power supplies, but I have a clear impression that the main focus is on the gaming industry and brand promotion - <b>Tt eSPORTS</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/155/f7c/892/155f7c8925add06e5779a49cd80be86b.jpg"><br>  A new headset for gamers was named <b>Tt eSPORTS Level 10M Headset</b> , and I can‚Äôt call a design familiar to gaming headphones.  I don‚Äôt understand the needs of gamers, but as far as I remember gaming headphones, they were all round, and here is a solution in the form of rectangles.  Naturally, the speakers, as they were, remained round, but nevertheless, the body of the speakers and the design is unusual.  The main question - the price - has not yet been disclosed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7b/091/bfb/e7b091bfbb9410673aa99ff9df043c95.jpg"><br>  For those who do not like the new <b>Level 10M Headset</b> , <b>Tt eSPORTS</b> has a huge selection of all kinds of headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c4/ac3/220/6c4ac32202ffb008aac5d2a9eed087d8.jpg"><br>  For Starcraft II fans, <b>Tt eSPORTS</b> has special gaming mice designed in collaboration with the well-known gamer <b>White-Ra</b> .  Moreover, the mouse for every taste, ranging from red and blue, and ending, white or orange. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c4/74c/26b/9c474c26b0a83e912ea2277a3c15c929.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, girls are not new either.  I saw a blonde on <b>Thermaltake</b> last year. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cce/74a/798/cce74a79806b08aee920ea3ffb8e7fdc.jpg"><br>  And the <b>XFX</b> of the interesting things on the stand, only a machine with a punching bag, which determines the force of impact.  Naturally, visitors of the computer exhibition are not very attracted to it, and girls have to be bored. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/072/1c0/6e4/0721c06e4580b3c50392b151983d30cf.jpg"><br>  But the girls from <b>Enermax</b> immediately see that they approach the work with the soul. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ec/eb8/c47/6eceb8c479ababc5db4add331a3a36ac.jpg"><br>  This is how the first day at <b>CeBIT 2013</b> turned out for me.  To say that I saw a lot of new products, I can not.  To say that something struck me - also not.  The exhibition seemed boring, and the number of visitors decreased markedly.  In this whole situation, only one thing pleases - the upcoming <b>Computex 2013</b> will be rich in novelties more than ever. <br>  Thank! </div>
