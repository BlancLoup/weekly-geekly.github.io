We went-looked, <s>poplev</s> grieved and already wanted to close, but the eye caught on the text of one page ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://rosgkh.com/Page.aspx%3Fid%3D2%26title%3DReshitj_problemu"><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/rosgkh.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The fact is that we published a very, very similar post <a href="http://webuprava.livejournal.com/2225.html">in our LiveJournal</a> about a month before, here's an excerpt: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

    <img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/webuprava.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is clear that the text was simply copied and slightly rewritten.  Something like ‚ÄúDamn, is this a state structure, did they really come to this?! ...‚Äù, and the hands already wrote a letter to <a href="http://blog-chibis.livejournal.com/">Andrei Chibis</a> , such as the person in charge of this project.  The text is not a pity to us and its reprinting says that it is written well and correctly.  But just like it was done in NP ‚ÄúUtilities Development‚Äù, a state-owned company, it simply undermines faith in people.  At our request to remove the text or put a link to the original, there was no intelligible answer (there was an answer in the spirit of ‚ÄúWe are doing one thing, let's cooperate‚Äù - aha, cooperation is in one gate). <br><br>  We are advised to go to court and we are considering this option.  But we, unfortunately, are not strong in copyright law and it‚Äôs impossible to fully understand whether such a phenomenon is provable.  We would be glad to know the opinion of the community - perhaps someone would have similar experience, help or advice would not hurt us. <br><br>  As at least some evidence of the primacy of our text can be cited: <br>  1. data on pages in search engines; <br>  2. the history of creating a document in Google Docs, - because  The article was written right there online, you can restore its appearance in all its details. <br><br>  Already, we see several drawbacks to the court, because of which they have not done anything so far: <br>  1. in any case, it will take time and effort, but you do not want to be distracted from the main (of your project) time, just enough time; <br>  2. there is no certainty that our evidence is sufficient and that rewriting will not be considered a separate copyright work; <br>  3. there is no understanding of the possible compensation and sanctions to the defendant in case of a successful outcome of the case. <br><br>  Thus, we want to know the opinion of the community - is the copyright provable under rewriting?  Does it make sense to get involved in legal proceedings? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thank you to all who expressed themselves, the best advice in our opinion from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/chemali/" class="user_link">ChemAli</a> user: Be stronger: write a note on yourself that, well, you are so cool that even ‚Äústate-owned companies‚Äù quote you, despite the presence of your super-paid and experienced specialists.  And then drive and move on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154473/</a></p>
