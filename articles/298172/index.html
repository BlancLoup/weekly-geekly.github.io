      At the start of the project, the founder decided to analyze the capabilities of another platform called Craftjoy.  It immediately included a number of useful tools for working with a business by subscription.  It was decided to use these opportunities to develop a new idea. <br><br>  The founder decided to sell only natural and rather rare products that could be found only in small private shops.  As the main idea for promoting the concept of his store, he decided to use <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">epicureism</a> - the project had to offer customers all the necessary "ingredients for a happy life." <br><br>  The entrepreneur decided to start work by creating a marketing newsletter, which was supposed to help him test the concept and gather the contacts of the audience that showed interest.  To do this, he chose the Launchrock service, with which you can quickly create a microsite and attach a form to subscribe to an email newsletter. <br><br>  The founder of the project is to choose the most popular social networks as channels to attract the audience.  Here he used standard tactics for working with subscribers and experimented with the design of publications. <br><br>  As more and more subscribers appeared to the project profiles with social networks, it was decided to launch a thematic corporate blog and interview the opinion leaders in the area to which the project could be attributed.  This approach helped attract several thousand people, 22% of whom signed up for the newsletter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/247/842/76e247842fa74e9e82f99f1f0fbd2ca4.jpg"><br>  <i>/ Photo: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gauravonomics/">Gaurav Mishra</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">SS</a></i> <br><br>  In the course of working on the project, the founder identified a number of basic insights: <br><br><ul><li>  It is necessary as soon as possible to find the right CRM for processing customer information.  For a business with a subscription model, this is critical. </li><li>  In addition, you will need software for billing and accounting, or a separate specialist </li><li>  You will be helped by a standard template with basic offers for sellers of goods that you will distribute by subscription. </li></ul><br>  Another important point is the packaging: <br><br><ul><li>  It should reflect your brand, and not just be the one that the supplier prepared. </li><li>  It is worth thinking about the delivery and the various ways of its implementation. </li><li>  You can design the box yourself on the drawings from the Internet </li></ul><br>  And a couple of tips for working with subscribers: <br><br><ul><li>  the project needs to be dealt with constantly - work every day, prepare mailings for the following periods, communicate with suppliers and so on </li><li>  Special promotions with big discounts are good for active promotion for those who share photos or store publications with their friends in social.  networks </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298172/</a></p>
