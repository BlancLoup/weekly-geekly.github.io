Why - we will certainly tell, and now we would like to share what is new and interesting on our way to our desire to create the most convenient and global taxi order service of a completely new generation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, in order for us to be recognized by our long-time fans, we would like to tell you about the process of our rebranding and what it was connected with.

      Initially, we called ourselves ‚ÄúTaksolet‚Äù and made the following logo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d5/3e2/953/9d53e2953c53c1892063d1c5c707b138.png" alt="Old logo"><br><br>  Many habrovtsy then condemned this "masterpiece", finding in it a lot of different images and associations, up to the rod with a reel.  And the name itself, although it was clearly different from the post-Soviet ‚ÄúBullet‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo Desyatochku‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlues‚Äù, etc., but still not everyone was perceived positively. <br><br>  In determining the new name and logo, we relied both on your wishes and comments, and on the fact that we need a foreign name, because the project began to go far beyond the country. <br><br>  As a result, we modified our old name and became like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/3f1/883/cf13f18832fd62db592be855a7ae1da7.png" alt="New Taxofly logo"><br><br>  Together with the brand, our design has completely changed, as well as the website address, which, in sum with our new technical developments, has made us almost completely new company. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://taxofly.com/">Taxofly.com</a> </h4><br><br>  Our disappearance for several months from Habradradar was due to the fact that we realized our development mistakes and began to almost completely redo both the logic of the service and the functionality itself.  We wanted to reach a certain step in this question in order to reassert ourselves.  Perhaps it was a clear sign of growing up of the company and the desire to do everything competently and in a truly high quality this time. <br><br>  During the time when we changed externally and internally, we had connections and business partners in other countries and the project gained international scope.  In the next couple of posts, we will tell you about the changes that have affected all of our applications, web functionality and the project‚Äôs business model itself.  Also, we had to break the head over some technical problems, which we also briefly describe. <br><br>  After we finally finish everything we have planned in the fall, the residents of Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Lithuania will finally be able to use our taxi service, and in the near future also Moldova and Romania. <br><br>  Perhaps, the most important thing in the life of any startup is that we finally fully decided on the course of development and business model, having clearly realized where and how we should move.  It was not easy to do this - we had to rake up our foreheads and waste a lot of time, but we successfully passed this stage of uncertainty, or the so-called ‚ÄúDeath Valley‚Äù, and now we are confidently and successfully moving forward. <br><br><h5>  At last </h5><br>  We would like to sincerely wish every startup that is going through difficult times to confidently overcome them, as we did, and develop into a successful and useful project for society.  Good luck with your endeavors and thank you for following us and helping your feedback to embody our idea. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112714/</a></p>
