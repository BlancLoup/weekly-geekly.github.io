Customers transfer him money to the card, and he lives in clover.  The flow of people who need solutions is large, and there are thoughts to scale - but there may be problems with this. <br><br>  First, there is no site.  It is troublesome, but an acquaintance does not want to invest in it.  Secondly, even now customers may not have the right bank card, and they go to others - because the competition is high.  Again, tax and 54-FZ - no one wants to have problems with them, and my friend is no exception.  As a result, I told him about Yandex.Cash and that you can accept payments without a website, just throwing off the link in personal messages, while the payment process for the client will be like in any decent online store. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the Yandex.Cash private office there is an opportunity to bill customers for goods or services - and send them by letter, via SMS, in instant messengers or social networks.  For those who sell through the group - the very thing.  Billing is securely embedded in our payment protocols, so you can not worry about security - all transactions are protected.

      The section of the personal account is called "Accounts to clients".  It has a list of bills - you can cancel them, post them again, or just see that the bills are paid and everything is in order.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f43/0c9/9f1/f430c99f13a16d5c62d5a29e5e532604.png"><br><br><h3>  No transfers from card to card </h3><br>  Customers can pay the invoice by all means, which the merchant has connected to himself in Yandex.Kassa, and these are cards of any banks, e-wallets, various Pay and invoices. <br><br>  In the usual transfer from card to card there are different risks - for example, the buyer may send money to fraudsters, and the seller‚Äôs account may be blocked for suspicious wording of the payment purpose.  If the store is connected to Yandex.Case, all this does not need to be afraid - it is well checked and the seller has all the necessary documents. <br><br><h3>  The check, please </h3><br>  There is little need for data, and a lot of possibilities appear - from the required fields only where to send the bill, the list of goods and services and the prices for them. <br><br>  If you put up by e-mail - you need to ask mail, if via SMS - find out the phone number.  But this is not necessary - generate a link and send it to the chat, where you communicate with the client.  And if he is not in a hurry, he wants a letter confirming your relationship in the mail, and he agrees to everything - you can send it as well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/918/c34/6fd/918c346fd29a0a771698c1052a9ae0d0.png"><br>  <i>The ancients predicted: see the window of a new account - to the money</i> <br><br><h3>  What do you sell? </h3><br>  Next you need to choose exactly what you want to sell.  In this case, you can manually enter each time, and you can substitute the goods from the database inside the service.  It is easy to fill it with your own goods - immediately collect everything into one Excel file and load it all at once.  And if you then need to add something, download again. <br><br>  Each product has several parameters - mandatory and not. <br><br>  Mandatory - name, quantity, unit price, VAT (if the store operates at 54-FZ).  In the case of selling solutions to problems, of course, it is difficult to predict their cost, but if prices do not change much, you can set several options and indicate them in the invoice - for example, tasks for 100, 300 and 500. <br><br>  <i>In the end, the</i> bill on the mail looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a1/0bf/844/4a10bf844a1fe139bfb3b6bb8c6f720e.png"><br>  <i>And nothing that is the end of May</i> <br><br><h3>  Discounts </h3><br>  A friend says that he sometimes holds promotions - bring three classmates with tasks and get a discount on his decision.  When billing, you can make beauty - right inside indicate a discount so that a person not only sees that he pays less, but also clearly - that he has saved.  It seems and is not difficult, and the client is nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07a/7f7/741/07a7f77414be2fe9b27b5f6e8449644e.png"><br>  <i>Dear buyer is better than inexpensive</i> <br><br><h3>  54- </h3><br>  As I wrote above, for those who have an online cash register, when invoicing, there are additional items that <a href="https://kassa.yandex.ru/54fz/">are legally required</a> , and buyers will not see them.  The first is VAT, you just need to specify the rate. <br><br>  When creating an invoice without customized fiscalization within the framework of 54- in the form of invoicing, there is no field for choosing VAT.  It appears only among merchants who have integrated with the cloud office and are residents. <br><br>  The next sign - the subject of calculation - is the category of goods and services that you sell ("the sign of the subject of calculation" of the law). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">You can select values:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  product, <br></li><li>  excisable goods <br></li><li>  Job, <br></li><li>  service, <br></li><li>  bet in the game <br></li><li>  winning the game <br></li><li>  lottery ticket, <br></li><li>  lottery winnings <br></li><li>  intellectual property <br></li><li>  payment, <br></li><li>  agent's commission, <br></li><li>  property rights, <br></li><li>  non-operating income <br></li><li>  insurance fee <br></li><li>  trading fee <br></li><li>  resort fee <br></li><li>  Several variants, <br></li><li>  another. <br></li></ul><br></div></div><br>  The method of calculation - the way you get money - partial or full prepayment, an advance, full or partial settlement, or on the loan.  You can not specify, but the law requires from January 1, 2019, so you need to specify.  So it goes. <br><br>  You can adjust it so that the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the object and the method of calculation have never changed - then you will not need to choose them each time with your hands. <br><br><h3>  Cute nuances </h3><br>  The resolute acquaintance keeps a list of orders in the google-table ‚Äî records the order number, the name, the conditions of the problem and what else he needs for successful work.  In the Cashier, you can invoice with your own numbers (by default they are generated) and indicate the one that is now in the table. <br><br>  And let's not discuss the maintenance of the list of orders in the Google table - a friend is just too lazy to relearn. <br><br>  If there are people who return to you regularly, you can maintain a list of customers - add contacts and quickly select them from the list when creating new accounts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed4/43e/fdd/ed443efdd1e4fe385ec32f39025be48c.png"><br><br>  If you order the same thing, you can re-issue invoices - for example, if someone orders a solution for the entire course of laboratory work during a semester. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5f/8ac/82d/f5f8ac82d7b11cafbe7f18b0c5ac92e4.png"><br>  <i>Most likely, the picture</i> - <i>laboratory on nuclear fusion.</i> <br><br>  And of course, invoices can be canceled. <br><br><h3>  When invoicing is still useful </h3><br>  I have already told about orders in social networks and the lack of a site - this is the real story of my friend. <br><br>  There are still long discussions of options by mail (for example, if you decide to donate your badge with the logo of an amateur football club where he plays on weekends), or when there are just a few goods left - then you can recount it manually and invoice sent the application. <br><br>  If you are doing something similar and want to make work even more convenient - <a href="https://kassa.yandex.ru/joinups%3Futm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_source%3Dhabr">connect to Yandex.Kassa</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453996/</a></p>
