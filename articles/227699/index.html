The most prestigious competition for programmers headquartered <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/">at Baylor University (Baylor University)</a> , also known as the <a href="http://battleofthebrains.podbean.com/">‚ÄúBattle of the Brains‚Äù</a> , brought together 122 student teams that in just five hours had to cope with several of the most difficult tasks of the real of life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbe/ad9/a35/bbead9a358c81b5425f05ba629a8feba.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year the Championship was hosted by the Ural Federal University.  The tasks of the final concerned the key trends of the modern IT industry, for example, cognitive computing and the IBM Watson supercomputer.  The supercomputer has become one of the most significant innovations in the entire history of IBM.  The study of his abilities - communication in natural language, processing of huge arrays of disparate Big Data and training in the process of interaction - became a unique opportunity for the participants of the competition. <br><br>  The team of St. Petersburg State University solved seven tasks in five hours, demonstrating an exceptional level of professional skills and the ability to quickly solve complex problems.  Programming champions will return home with the ‚ÄúThe Smartest Prize‚Äù award (The World's Smartest Trophy), as well as prizes and offers for internships or work at IBM and other leading companies in the IT industry.

      ‚ÄúAs one of the leading international technology companies, IBM understands how important it is to help students and motivate them to become familiar with the latest technological advances,‚Äù said Alain Azagury, Head of IBM Software Group Technical Strategy, a member of IBM Academy of Technology. and the ACM-ICPC sponsorship program manager.  - Every year, ACM ICPC brings together the best programmers in the world and gives them the opportunity to solve problems from the real world.  We believe that these students are the future leaders of our industry, and we want to make a contribution to their development and preparation for future work.  We hope that the winners will help us build a truly sensible planet. ‚Äù <br><br>  In addition to participating in the championship, students had the opportunity to get acquainted with the latest developments of the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/">IBM Research &amp; Development Labs</a> and communicate with leading international experts in the field of information technology, as well as take part in excursions around Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  ‚ÄúACM-ICPC is a great opportunity for students from all over the world to come together and share valuable experiences,‚Äù says Dr. Bill Poucher, a professor at Baylor University and executive director of the ACM-ICPC championship.  ‚ÄúI am pleased to see how young people use the knowledge gained during the competition to further develop their chosen academic and career paths as members of the Computer Engineering Association (ACM).‚Äù <br><br>  The live broadcast of the championship was held with the assistance of <a href="http://urfu.ru/ru/">SKB Kontur</a> on the site <a href="http://www.icpclive.com/">ICPCLive.com</a> . <br><br>  Teams from Moscow State University, Peking University, National Taiwan University took second, third and fourth places, respectively, and received gold medals.  Regional champions are: New York University (North America);  St. Petersburg State University (Europe);  Alexandria University - Faculty of Engineering (Africa and the Middle East);  Military Technical Institute (Latin America);  Peking University (Asia);  and the University of New South Wales (South Pacific). <br><br>  <b>List of winners of the ACM ICPC 2014 championship:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  St. Petersburg State University (gold medal, world champion) </li><li>  Moscow State University (gold medal, 2nd place) </li><li>  Peking University (gold medal, 3rd place) </li><li>  National Taiwan University (Gold Medal, 4th place) </li><li>  Warsaw University (silver medal, 5th place) </li><li>  Shanghai Transport University (silver medal, 6th place) </li><li>  University of Tokyo (silver medal, 7th place) </li><li>  University of Zagreb (silver medal, 8th place) </li><li>  St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO) (bronze medal, 9th place) </li><li>  National Research University Higher School of Economics (bronze medal, 10th place) </li><li>  Tsinghua University (bronze medal, 11th place) </li><li>  University.
