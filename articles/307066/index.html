How it was</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are an advanced SEO-expert and have withdrawn more than a dozen sites from under the Minusinsk algorithm, then perhaps more than half of this article will cause ‚Äúwater‚Äù emotions.  However, if you have never encountered such a task or just met with scraps of information on its solution, then here you will find a lot of interesting and useful things that will help you quickly solve this problem. <br><br>  Just over a year ago, on 05/14/2015, Yandex launched the Minusinsk algorithm, aimed at identifying and ‚Äúpessimizing‚Äù sites that use SEO links * for search engine promotion.  SEO link is a link that affects the search algorithms and can increase the position of the site. <br><br>  Our company, one of many, received the so-called ‚Äúletter of happiness,‚Äù the content of which was as follows: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f83/024/04a/f8302404acae45a79898d1382963bf14.png">

      We received such a letter, but since this is just a warning, we did not respond to it. <br><br>  One evening, in February, after almost 9 months, on the internal service of our company, we found a drop in the site for most requests for 20 positions.  "Minusinsk" in action.  Began to make a plan how to solve this problem. <br><br><h4>  Sequencing </h4><br>  The main task was to get out of the sanctions with minimal losses.  Many administrators, frightened by the warning, took and deleted all links at once.  We could also do, however, a sharp decline in the link mass and the loss of high-quality links with a large weight could have negative consequences when ranking a site on Google. <br><br><h4>  First stage.  Collection and analysis of reference mass </h4><br>  For a start, it was necessary to collect the full reference mass.  The collection was carried out both with downloads from search engines, and with the help of individual services (majestic, ahrefs). <br><br>  A total of about a million links were collected.  They were sorted and cleared of those that 100% could not get under the "Minusinsk" (links from our sites). <br><br>  About 650 links came out, many of which were very old.  The main part was purchased on exchanges. <br><br>  Then we began to analyze each link.  About link analysis (good / bad) on the Internet you can find a lot of information.  There are services that help determine the quality, however, they do not reveal their algorithms, which is why we decided to analyze all the links manually. <br><br>  Links were evaluated by the following indicators: <br><br><h5>  <b>1) URL indexing in Google</b> </h5><br><h5>  <b>2) Host characteristics</b> </h5><br>  I Major <br><ul><li>  number of donors (unique IP) </li><li>  number of acceptors </li><li>  ratio of donors to acceptors </li></ul><br>  II Related <br><ul><li>  TCI </li><li>  Alexa Rank </li><li>  MCF (Majestic Citation Flow) </li><li>  MTF (Majestic Trust Flow) </li><li>  AUR (Ahrefs URL Rank) </li><li>  ADR (Ahrefs Domain Rank) </li><li>  Monthly traffic </li></ul><br><h5>  <b>3) Textual, human characteristics</b> </h5><br><ul><li>  anchor and okolankor text ((in) readability, speech, grammatical errors, etc.) </li><li>  page quality </li><li>  site quality </li></ul><br>  An interesting point is that about 200 links purchased through the sape.ru exchange were absent in the Google index, which greatly facilitated our task.  There are services that help determine the quality, but they do not reveal their algorithms, which is why we decided to analyze all the links manually. <br><br>  In general, we have the following situation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/00e/4c1/f2500e4c196b46e7b867a71a35e8ebc5.png"><br><br>  In principle, it is expected.  Most of the links were placed more than 5 years ago in automatic mode for "pennies" or free "runs".  Donor rates deteriorated over time. <br><br><h4>  Second phase.  Gradual removal </h4><br>  Since more than half of the links were not indexed in Google, the risks after their removal are noticeably lower, so we took them first. <br><br>  Links were deleted by groups between updates.  When the groups were divided again, it turned out to be somewhat larger than in the screenshot above, so the process of solving the problem was delayed.  In cases where the exchange did not allow the removal of the link directly through the system, it was necessary to contact the administrators. <br><br>  There are a huge number of communication methods, below are the ones we used: <br><br>  <b>1. Feedback on the site</b> .  A very useful thing, but it does not always work, or it does not exist at all, or people respond for a very long time. <br><br>  <b>2. Contact information on the site</b> .  It happened that they turned out to be invalid, but in some cases they helped to get in touch.  We should also highlight the whois services, which define the contact details of the domain owner. <br><br>  <b>3. Domain registrars</b> .  They can be used to contact the owner or representative of the domain.  This is also used. <br><br>  <b>4. Communication through the host</b> <br><br>  <b>5. Comments on the latest news.</b> <br><br>  <b>6. Standard mail</b> .  Many sites have standard mail like admin@site.ru, abuse@site.ru, webmaster@site.ru, info@site.ru are most common, but there are others that are found in individual cases, such as support @ site. ru.  We sent messages to them if there were no other options to contact.  The option is not particularly effective, but also an option.  We had no responses at all. <br>  <b>7. Communication with web developers</b> .  Sometimes in the cellars of many sites you can see the link and the logo of the company that developed this site.  We contacted this company to get in touch with the owner of the site or simply resolved this issue with them.  In principle, if the developers see that the site is about nothing and our link is placed on some left page, then its removal should not be a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24b/b11/3b1/24bb113b13c444d7a736b949fd527f77.png"><br><br>  Imagine that the total number of administrators you need to contact is ~ 250 people.  I had to write more than once, sometimes 3 or more letters in each of the ways listed above. <br><br>  The first time we tried to remove all links for free, and since we received a very small amount of feedback, we decided to try to offer the owners a certain amount. <br><br>  It all started with $ 2.  Feedback has increased and we have removed some of the links for a fee.  However, people began to come across who requested a much larger amount.  The first time we scored on them, however, when almost three months had passed, and we did not get out of Minusinsk, we began to pay for everything. <br><br>  It is difficult to say what amount was spent in general.  There were several links, for the removal of which administrators requested more than 1000 rubles, some were around 500 rubles and the main part was cheap for $ 2. <br><br><h4>  A few interesting things discovered when working on this issue that may be useful for SEO specialists. </h4><br>  1. Shoals with Yandex service.  There were moments that some kind of link is in the interface, but it was not in the upload.  All this was solved by communication with tech support. <br><br>  2. We removed some pages from the search results of Yandex through the url removal service in Yandex.Webmaster.  You can delete a page with a link if it meets one of three conditions: the server returns 404, the page is forbidden to be indexed via robots.txt or using the noindex meta tag.  We basically deleted 404 each. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d7/bfc/35c/7d7bfc35c49d4a32b3ded830d99559ed.png"><br><br>  3. Reindexing.  We tried to use fast-feeds to re-index deleted pages faster.  Probably, 3 services were tested, using all possible modes, but the result was still almost zero.  Even upgraded twitter accounts did not help speed up the re-indexing.  Perhaps the reason is the quality of the pages where we sent the fast-access;  maybe it's in the accounts, maybe in something else.  The main reason could not be identified. <br><br>  However, Yandex has a service called ‚Äúpage traversal‚Äù, with which the site owner can request a quick re-indexing.  In correspondence with the webmaster, you can ask him to use this function, it is usually not difficult for a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f6/01b/10a/9f601b10a8184a85ada08d8e077753a6.png"><br><br>  4. Minusinsk does not affect all keywords. <br>  ‚Ä¢ creation of web studio sites (did not fall under Minusinsk) <br>  ‚Ä¢ site in Vladimir (did not fall under Minusinsk) <br>  ‚Ä¢ promotion of the site of Vladimir (did not fall under Minusinsk) <br>  ‚Ä¢ site promotion in Vladimir (fell under Minusinsk) <br>  Pay attention to the last two keys, which are basically identical, but only for the last site lost position. <br>  Maybe there are many reasons explaining this situation and maybe we will analyze them in a separate article. <br><br>  5. It is not necessary to delete all available links. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c32/029/f69/c32029f69824432f92f6811ac744d702.png"><br><br>  Here on this site we found one of our links. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/994/639/7bb/9946397bb6e74b6aa362943999f0559a.png"><br><br>  After a large number of attempts to get in touch with the administrator - we have not received any response.  In general, the site shows that it was abandoned 5-6 years ago.  We contacted those.  support and explained the situation to them.  In response, we received something like: "We can not help you, remove all links and sanctions will be eliminated."  After countless attempts to contact the owner of this site, we began to gradually give up.  And here we left Minusinsk. <br><br>  The exit from the sanctions took place along with other sites that fell under them at about the same time as our site. <br><br>  At that time, we still had a certain amount of purchased links.  There were not many of them, from which it can be concluded that the algorithm <u>may</u> work according to a certain percentage ratio between the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù link mass and the SEO links, <u>or maybe</u> those.  support went to our meeting, <u>or maybe</u> there is just some sort of low-quality links, and we went down below it.  There may be several reasons, and we will hardly ever know the exact one. <br><br>  It took about 3 months to remove the site from the sanctions of this algorithm. <br><br>  The most important thing in solving this problem is to collect the full reference mass, with the help of all possible functionality. <br><br>  Remember that those.  support is always on your side and in its interest to help you resolve any issue, therefore it is necessary to have a dialogue with it. <br><br>  Team design studio "VladWeb" ( <a href="http://vladwebstudio.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dstatya%26utm_campaign%3DSTM_model">http://vladwebstudio.ru/</a> ): <br><br>  Anton Sinitsyn - SEO Manager <br>  Serov Nikita - SMM / SEO-specialist <br>  Sergey Petukhov - SEO-specialist </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307066/</a></p>
