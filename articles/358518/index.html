  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VimpelCom subscribers will pay 13 rubles per month for the Spring Law</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/iu/rf/nriurftiqql8blyczx8zsewjhn4.png"></div><br><br>  After the adoption of the <a href="https://habr.com/post/358010/">technical requirements for the storage of voice and Internet traffic,</a> operators began to estimate the amount of additional costs according to the law of Spring. <br><br>  According to VimpelCom, this year the additional costs are estimated at 6 billion rubles (approximately 17 rubles per subscriber per month at the rate of <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5a8e652f9a79478b68f3b2a5">58.2 million</a> subscribers, calculated from June).  Over the next five years, expenses will amount to 45 billion rubles, that is, approximately 13 rubles per subscriber per month. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It can be assumed that about an average of this amount should increase tariffs for the population, so that the company can maintain profitability at the same level.  Although you need to make a discount that for certain users, tariffs will rise more significantly than for others.  For example, the cost of storing Internet traffic for each operator is much higher than the cost of storing voice calls.  Therefore, it is logical to assume that, first of all, tariffs for Internet users and package tariffs with megabytes included should increase. 
      <br>

      It is possible that operators will find ways to cut costs so that the increase in tariffs does not become so significant.  For example, it would be logical to set the maximum amount of consumed Internet traffic at unlimited rates - the limit for daily and monthly transmission with megabyte pay for excess traffic. <br><br>  In Russia, cellular communications and the Internet are among the cheapest in the world.  Probably, for this reason, the authorities believe that the operators can install the equipment at their own expense, and the increase in tariffs for users will not cause a serious blow to their welfare. <br><br>  According to Resolution No. 445 ‚ÄúOn Approval of the Rules for Storage by Telecommunications Operators of Text Messages of Users of Communication Services, Voice Information, Images, Sounds, Video and Other Messages of Users of Communication Services‚Äù, operators of telephone communication and data transmission services for the purpose of voice information transmission store voice traffic and text messages in full for 6 months, and Internet providers from July 1, 2018 store traffic in zero, and from October 1, 2018 - in full.  The operator must keep traffic in Russia.  By agreement with the FSB, it is allowed to store traffic on ‚Äútechnical means of accumulating information‚Äù belonging to another telecom operator. <br><br>  The capacity of the storage system must be equal to the volume of traffic transmitted within 30 days preceding the date of commissioning of technical means of accumulating information.  The operator is obliged to annually increase the storage system capacity by 15% within five years from the date of putting the accumulation equipment into operation.  Information is deleted from storage devices automatically in accordance with the algorithms provided by the software and the requirements for the information accumulation means used, based on the maximum storage period for traffic within 6 months.  The document was published on April 19, 2018. <br><br>  After the publication of technical requirements, Rostelecom <a href="http://tass.ru/ekonomika/5142752">announced a shortage of certified equipment on the market</a> ‚Äútaking into account the scale of the infrastructure of Rostelecom‚Äù, which makes it difficult to fulfill the requirements of the Rules. <br><br>  The operator "Megafon" called the requirements "compromise" and kept the forecast for the cost of its implementation at the level of 35-40 billion rubles for five years (7 billion rubles in 2018).  Other large operators will incur comparable costs.  Thus, they get about the same amount of additional expenses per subscriber: about 13 rubles per month. <br><br>  At the same time, manufacturers of certified equipment for SORM are <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/04/19/767277-chto-pridetsya-operatoram-zakonu-yarovoi">counting on a sharp increase in demand from operators</a> .  For example, Megafon is currently testing certified systems to enforce the law - a joint development of Citadel and National Technologies companies.  To test the system, specially generated test traffic is used.  Norsi-Trans, which also specializes in SORM, has also created its own complex for the implementation of the law. <br><br>  The first SORM systems ready for the implementation of the law of Spring <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/03/16/753935-sorm-yarovoi">appeared on the market</a> in March 2018.  For example, in the aforementioned development of the Citadel and National Technologies <a href="https://habr.com/company/yadro/">companies, the</a> Yadro data storage platform is used (the <a href="https://habr.com/company/yadro/">company's blog on Habr√©</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358518/</a></p>
