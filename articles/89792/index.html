The site, in theory, should seriously facilitate the process of communication with officials, but what is really going on?  I decided to ask this question to Leonid Volkov, also known as LJ-user <a href="http://leonwolf.livejournal.com/">leonwolf</a> . <br><br>  The 29-year-old Volkov has no serious political ties and millions of bank accounts, but this did not prevent him from becoming a member of the Yekaterinburg City Council.  He got into politics only through the Internet: he campaigned through social networks, communicated with people on the forums.

      All of the following about gosuslugi.ru is solely the opinion of Leonid Volkov, who is familiar with the system no longer hearsay. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúGosuslugi.ru is a cut in all its glory.  <i>E-</i> Potemkin <i>e-</i> village.  The president said: ‚ÄúAnd to submit an e-government here!‚Äù - and Rostelecom (or who is it, am I already confused?) Performed.  Well, I must say, it is not a big deal to draw a website with links to the websites of all state bodies.  But what's next?  After all, no systemic transformations followed (and could not follow, given the time constraints; in this sense, the President‚Äôs deliberate tightening of deadlines, perhaps, turned out to be a minus, not a plus) - there were no uniform formats and standards, automated interfaces with already existing electronic services too ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/427/789/b35/427789b3503bf5ff243a45a0f9ef9a84.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  No wonder the work on the deployment of e-government were divided into five stages, the first three of which cause nothing but a smile.  Applying them to my professional field of electronic reporting (Volkov is working on the creation and development of new electronic accounting and reporting systems for business - <i>approx. Aut.</i> ), For example, we get some mocking nonsense: ‚Äúwe have to send the declarations through the Portal‚Äù learn by the fall of 2010 ... and receive answers about accepting declarations - only by 2012.  Amazing responsiveness!  And this is despite the fact that now the electronic reporting system works fine, and the answers about accepting declarations from all tax countries resort to the taxpayer within a few minutes after sending the declaration ... It's funny.  But it‚Äôs also sad: because now, in the Federal Tax Service, smart people, informatizers, instead of solving actual problems, are forced to scratch their heads - and how to match the already existing and well-functioning electronic reporting system with the ‚Äúportal of public services‚Äù, on which there is nothing?  And the honest answer - ‚ÄúNo way‚Äù - cannot be given according to the rules of the game, and this is not discussed. <br><br>  So, for the first three stages, Rostelecom will somehow report back, since these monumental ‚Äústages‚Äù do not require any real work, no serious automation.  And what will happen next?  I suspect they did not even think about it.  The principle ‚Äúafter us - at least later‚Äù works.  After all, the money for the first three stages will be completely mastered. <br><br>  In general, everything that is being done under the ‚ÄúElectronic Government‚Äù program, at least so far, has been aimed at enriching a narrow circle of interested respondents, but not at all at creating electronic government as such.  This includes the already mentioned portal Gosuslugi.Ru, from the same series - the creation for tens of millions of rubles of the ‚ÄúConcept of e-government development‚Äù, a multi-page document containing platitudes and nonsense in approximately equal proportions.  If any interesting, real electronic services appear in Russia, it is, nevertheless, more likely, contrary to the efforts of the government in this area, than thanks to them.  Alas, this state of affairs persists to this day, and therefore I do not think that right now in deaf villages it is worth trying to buy computers in order for grace in the form of public services to descend on them ‚Äî you still have to travel to the regional center for services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89792/</a></p>
