    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I consider it the best among all services.  There are enough analogues, but <a href="http://logmein.com/">LogMeIn</a> was recognized as the best option.  With it, service providers and enterprises provide the end user with remote support, that is, organizing quick access and the ability to effectively manage computers, servers, and even smartphones that are connected to the Internet.  Computers or servers can be easily accessed via the web interface.  When you start working, you will immediately realize that the functions of the product are organized as safely as possible, scalable, and easy to test, purchase and use. <br><br>  Currently, the service uses more than 40 million devices running <em>Mac OS</em> and <em>Windows</em> . <br>  The standard package includes the ability to support PCs, smartphones and other user devices on demand.  Also, the ability to manage remote access systems, file sharing, remote control, backup and the virtual part of the network was not forgotten. <br><br>  <strong>What is in the composition?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br><br>  A few words about <strong>LogMeIn Free</strong> .  I think this is the most interesting part for us. <br>  The program allows you to provide fast, easily customizable access to any computer.  Works great with routers and firewalls, allowing users to easily and freely use a desktop or home PC from anywhere in our beloved planet.  It should be noted multi-level protection, which is characterized by 128 and 256 bit encryption of passwords and data.  The interface is incredibly convenient, and you can even use the program from a PDA.  LogMeIn Free is available absolutely free. <br>  It makes no difference whether you are using a Mac or Windows ‚Äî specially designed plug-ins for <em>Safari, IE, FireFox, Opera</em> , etc.  make work quick and convenient. <br><br>  <strong>LogMeIn IT Reach</strong> , which provides us with modern tools for remote access, management, support and reporting using a web-based interface for organizations of any size.  This solution can be easily installed and deployed on several tens, hundreds, or even thousands of computers over many hours, with minimal interaction with the main, end-user.  Product integration is very easy, as all existing networks and infrastructures support it.  There are no problems for other existing applications. <br><br>  <strong>LogMeIn Pro</strong> .  This assembly contains the most powerful features of the entire project that a mobile professional may need.  This service can use an SSL gateway, which is of course absolutely secure.  It provides easy and quick access to the configuration of any personal computer, and additional integrated functions make it possible to maximize productivity.  It is supposed to automatically work with routers and firewalls, which give full access from anywhere on the planet.  One of the main advantages - the transfer of files at a decent speed is finally implemented. <br><br>  <strong>RemotelyAnywhere</strong> .  It has two options: <em>Server Edition</em> and <em>Workstation Edition</em> .  Edition Server allows you to get full access to your services for quick administration and analysis.  The package includes all the tools you need for remote administration of Windows-based servers within a strict security system.  Additional features include support for RSA SecurID (a powerful security system), reboot manager, filtering and blocking by IP, registration of events and alerts, ftp server, port forwarding and detailed performance monitoring. <br>  When working with <em>Workstation Edition,</em> you can pay attention to the system for creating the infrastructure for remote support, administration and secure access to resources.  This solution is called the ideal tool to support workstations that are on or off your network. <br><br>  <strong>Remotely Anywhere Network Console</strong> .  This program will be quite interesting for most serious PC and Internet users. <br>  Here you get centralized control using Network Console (network console).  It is safe to call monitoring host computers one of the best of the existing ones.  Among the other benefits will be allocated high-quality remote control, standardization of configurations and deployment of the program in the network.  The main bias is super-fast remote control. <br>  How about optimizing efforts when working with remote access?  LogMeIn Ignition is what you need.  The program is specifically designed for one-click access to multiple computers from anywhere in the world.  Ignition is completely portable, plus it can be run from any USB device or installed on a local computer for faster access to all computers. <br><br>  If you have problems with the organization of work with VPN, then <strong>LogMeIn Hamach</strong> will help you.  The service is a VPN service that is easily configured in ten minutes and provides secure remote access to the network of any enterprise from anywhere, where you can connect to the global network.  The service bypasses NAT devices and firewalls.  Configuring customer settings is not required. <br><br>  <em>Summing up, it is safe to say that even the free version is leading the market for this type of service.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27253/</a></p>
