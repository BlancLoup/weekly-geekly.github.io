      For professionals in the field of work with data, ER / Studio is an effective, simple and convenient set of tools and tools for collaborating data management specialists that allows you to create and maintain large corporate databases and data warehouses.  The functions provided in the system automate routine modeling tasks and allow you to visualize, therefore, more quickly understand, analyze and optimize the structure of large databases and data warehouses.  Included in the reporting and interaction tools contribute to the application of organizational standards and the achievement of high levels of performance. <br>  ER / Studio Enterprise is a complex product and includes the following tools: <br><ul><li>  ER / Studio Data Architect, </li><li>  ER / Studio Business Architect, </li><li>  ER / Studio Software Architect, </li><li>  ER / Studio Repository, CONNECT. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The server model management system and the Internet portal make this solution an effective tool for sharing, documenting and publishing models and metadata in distributed teams. <br><br>  ER / Studio Data Architect is an essential part of ER / Studio, a visual modeling application designed for independent logical analysis and design of data architecture, as well as for physical design and building database instances for specific DBMS. <br><br>  ER / Studio Data Architect is recommended for use as a practical tool for teaching on topics related to databases and multidimensional information repositories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54a/ea2/196/54aea2196c8815ca6a25b46e0340007c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using the example of working with ER / Studio Data Architect, students will be able to master in practice: <br><ul><li>  Principles and methods of database design, </li><li>  Using ER - diagrams of various notations for designing and visualizing structures of various types of databases, including relational ones </li><li>  Reconstruction (reverse engineering), analysis and optimization of existing databases. </li><li>  DB modeling at the logical level;  Comparing objects of conceptual, logical and physical models and searching for correspondences inside them for viewing. </li><li>  Decomposition and merging models to simplify working with large models </li><li>  Modeling Multidimensional Data Warehouses for OLAP and BI Systems </li><li>  Designing Database Access Strategies </li><li>  Modeling constraints and dependencies both within the database and with elements of external systems </li><li>  Design and analysis of information exchange subsystems and ETL processes </li><li>  Designing a system for protecting information in a database, managing user rights to access a database </li><li>  Analyzing and evaluating the effectiveness of various database models. </li><li>  Use in the design of the database of modern methods of providing scalability </li><li>  Building physical implementations of models based on various DBMS platforms, taking into account database performance requirements </li><li>  Creating XML schemas from logical and physical models to use models in various projects, such as SOA </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/545/088/336/5450883363c9e6b30f0b6e2eaddc8d86.jpg"><br><br>  Practice shows, and leading analytical companies predict a strengthening of this trend in the coming years, that the vast majority of companies use more than two different DBMS platforms in their work.  And no matter what caused it - the presence of long-lived inherited databases or the company's initiatives to find and use corporate data as an organizational resource and asset, the IT world is very interested in having specialists and architects of the database well-prepared for work in multiplatform environments.  It is with ER / Studio that the opportunities for training specialists of this level increase many times. <br><br>  The most ‚Äúfull‚Äù feature of the edition is ER / Studio Enterprise.  This edition is distinguished by the simultaneous support of almost all existing types of DBMS (including not necessarily relational ones), including all versions of the same DBMS.  ER / Studio Enterprise also added tools for export / import and exchange of metadata with other modeling tools from leading manufacturers. <br>  ER / Studio Enterprise is recommended for training specialists in managing large corporate databases and data warehouses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27a/0d3/3b0/27a0d33b0d4ab5d67717306591f9f7bd.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the topics listed in the ER / Studio Data Architect section, this tool allows you to train: <br><ul><li>  More effective diagnostics and analysis of the impact of changes based on universal mappings, data transformation tracing, corporate data dictionary and comparison and merging technologies. </li><li>  Designing real-time data reuse and collaboration through effective model management at the corporate level and the ability to publish metadata. </li><li>  Effectively share information about data models across the enterprise through the use of reporting tools and publishing metadata. </li><li>  Modern and most productive ways to share data and metadata, document and publish it for distributed workgroups, advanced corporate collaboration features such as activities and discussion threads, alerts, and subscription and rating capabilities. </li><li>  Standardize and reuse items based on data dictionaries </li><li>  Methods of working together on interdependent business requirements, projects and data models in a collective modeling environment with strict adherence to the necessary standards. </li><li>  Integration and semantic linking of embedded business definitions using a centrally managed glossary, a single corporate registry of all available data sources. </li></ul><br>  For architects and software developers, ER / Studio Enterprise includes ER / Studio Software Architect, an object-oriented modeling tool for application architects that allows you to visually design and analyze complex software applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92e/e58/de4/92ee58de495d3c18c06abd9b87cfada0.jpg"><br><br>  With the help of this tool, students will practically learn: <br><ul><li>  Software architecture and model-based standards development. </li><li>  Industry standard templates. </li><li>  Indicators and audit models. </li><li>  Use UML 2.0 to visualize, construct, and document artifacts of distributed object systems. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/128/23c/0f5/12823c0f526698fe7722da69edf4e544.jpg"><br><br>  ER / Studio Enterprise also includes ER / Studio Business Architect - this is a conceptual modeling tool designed to simulate business processes and their use of data.
