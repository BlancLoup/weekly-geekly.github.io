To immediately understand what kind of problem we are talking about, here's a video (watch in 1080p). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KlOkbFlnsk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfGlotBfvFSxMLZ3m010omCN_K5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this review of the MacBook Air 11 "2013, the glitch is visible from 1:54 to 2:24 and from 2:42 to 2:54. There is a 1080p version. There are no words about the screen brakes in the review. I don‚Äôt know how to look at the screen, not to see this.

It looks like a very high response time of the matrix.  This is especially noticeable on thin lines (text, frames) and contrasting objects on a white background.  When scrolling in the browser or when dragging the windows behind most of the image elements, you can see clearly visible plumes that are comparable in length / width to the objects themselves, which leave them.  Text fades or changes color. <br><br>  The problem caught my eye right away.  I had enough different laptops, from cheap to expensive ones, to conclude that such a display, especially in one of the most expensive laptops, cannot be considered normal.  The next day I called Apple ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The operator of the first line of support listened carefully to me and asked me to do a few standard manipulations to reset PRAM and statics from the motherboard.  After it became clear that this did not help, I was transferred to a technical specialist.  She also listened to me and asked me to record and send them a video illustrating the problem so that they could give comments.  Within an hour, I recorded a video and sent it to the specified address.  After about 3 hours they called me back.  The girl said that they watched the video and conducted the same tests on their MacBook.  And they see what I see on most of them.  However, they have no special instructions on this problem and cannot recognize it as a defect until there are a sufficient number of references.  I was recommended to resolve this issue with the store individually. <br><br>  I was disappointed with this approach to the problem from the support service side and decided to test other MacBooks for this effect.  The first two MacBooks I came across turned out to be with the same problem.  MacBook Air 11 "2012 and MacBook Pro 13" 2008. First with LG matrix, second with AUO matrix.  Next, I went to the store where it was possible to check the MacBooks in the windows and saw the same problem.  Unfortunately, I could not see the matrix model on laptops from the store, since  I did not remember the command to check the matrix model. <br><br>  Also from my friends and comments on the forums, I received feedback that on some MacBooks there is no such problem.  I asked them to find out the model of the matrix, it turned out to be Samsung's matrixes.  However, so far I can not say that the problem is precisely in the manufacturer of the matrix, because  So far I have received not many reviews. <br><br>  According to the current state of affairs, the picture is that for the same price the buyer can get either a normal screen or terribly slowing down, which is just painful (and possibly dangerous for eye health) to watch.  And guess what will fall before the purchase can not be.  Another lottery from Apple? <br><br>  I consider such an attitude to customers unacceptable.  I urge MacBook owners to check their screens for this defect and unsubscribe in the comments about its presence / absence and the screen matrix model. <br><br>  The matrix model can be found using the following command in the terminal: <br><br><pre><code class="bash">ioreg -lw0 | grep IODisplayEDID | sed "/[^&lt;]*&lt;/s///" | xxd -p -r | strings -6
</code></pre><br>
