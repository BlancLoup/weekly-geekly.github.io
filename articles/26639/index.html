      When I first started listening to podcasts, I naturally began to look for suitable software.  <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder</a> most corresponded to my expectations in how the podcast aggregator should look and behave, and there were no annoying flaws or religious considerations, as in other variants.  More precisely, you will not say so much time has passed. <br><br>  <strong>How popular is your development, if not a secret?</strong> <br><br>  To avoid misunderstanding, let's make a reservation right away - <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder is</a> not my development.  The author of the project is <a href="http://thpinfo.com/">Thomas Perl</a> , a student from Vienna.  I just take part in this project.  Interestingly, our universities have an affiliate program, and Thomas and I met through his project.  The popularity of such a program is difficult to judge.  This is not an office suite and not a desktop environment, to be asked about in numerous preferences polls, a rather specific program, the podcast aggregator.  Many people do not know what a podcast is, who knows - listens from a web page <br>  or what happened, that is, in your favorite player (if the latter allows it).  However, if we take into account the fact that simple people come to the development mailing list and ask questions, suggest improvements, write documentation, draw icons and generally begin to help in every way, the project has popularity. <br><img title="gpodder-0112-more-ipod-remove-columns" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gpodder-0112-more-ipod-remove-columns.png" width="500" height="292"><br>  <strong>What are the reasons for joining the gPodder?</strong> <br><br>  I lacked the support of Russian.  It turned out that I first worked on one of the unsupported scripts, the code was run in and later added to the main <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder</a> code base.  Then fixes to support non-unicode locales ... So I learned more and more Python and learned more about <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder</a> from the inside. <br><br>  <strong>What problems arise when developing such a program?</strong> <br><br>  Development language  A joke, in general, but with a bit of a joke.  Although I study it in order to take part in the development of the project, I still don‚Äôt like Python as I did five years ago.  There are things in it, because of which you just grab your head, causing problems in short and clear code, forcing you to write unnecessarily verbose and ugly code to solve them.  Fixing one of these problems in gPodder was one of my following patches.  Then the problem manifested itself in another place, I found the source in the python itself and cut, like a proud knot, a rather dirty, but effective hack.  But on other machines, this problem will arise again.  So you have to crush crutches caused by language imperfections. <br>  There is a good <a href="http://gpodder.org/files/linuxwochen-2008-05-17.pdf">presentation</a> , however, in German, dedicated to gPodder, which Thomas conducted at the recent Linuxwochen 2008 in Vienna.  In it, among other things, Thomas talks about the difficulties that arise - incorrect feeds, performance, outdated packages in distributions, iPods, and other closed devices, dependencies.  From myself I would add that often there are all sorts of "everyday problems" - hosting, spam on wikis and fools who, without understanding and not using plainly, write reviews like <a href="http://madpenguin.org/cms/%3Fm%3Dshow%26amp%3Bid%3D8129">this</a> .  Sometimes I write about news or project difficulties on my <a href="http://thegeekbird.blogspot.com/">blog</a> . <br><br>  <strong>What development tools do you use?</strong>  <strong>And how is the joint development going?</strong> <br><br>  I always use two development tools - the Vim text editor and the interpreter / compiler of the language used.  The rest - according to circumstances, salt and pepper to taste.  No delights of all kinds of IDE will not cover one of their main drawbacks - the editor in them is not Vim, which means it will be inconvenient for me. <br><br>  Joint development is mainly using the mailing list and bugtracker.  People choose a piece of work that they can do, or realize their idea and send the patch to the list.  Anyone testing.  Thomas is testing, perhaps he picks up an interesting idea (as with my last patch, he added a part to support a new iPod chip, which I don‚Äôt have) and applies it to the current code base. <br><br>  Once a month a week before the next release - stabilization.  Only bug fixes and translation updates.  No new features and new bugs;) <br><img title="gpodder-0112-feed_cache_updates" src="http://www.podcastim.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gpodder-0112-feed_cache_updates.png" width="418" height="197"><br>  <strong>What parts of the project are you working on now?</strong> <br><br>  I usually just finish what I‚Äôm missing.  Well, here are a few releases in a row complement the Russian translation. <br><br>  <strong>What interesting features to expect in new versions?</strong>  <strong>And how long is version 1.0 left to wait?</strong> <br><br>  Why wait?  Download the source (especially suffering, like me, can be installed from svn) and only two words `make install`.  No need to wait for the maintainer of your distribution to lay out the day before yesterday bugs in the form of a package.  For my taste, <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder is</a> developing too fast to be set from <br>  distribution kit.  Planned new features are described in roadmap, which can be found on the wiki. <br>  project. <br><br>  <strong>How do you feel about podcasting, do you run your podcast?</strong>  <strong>What are you listening / watching?</strong> <br><br>  I take it purely positive (and not from the word put).  A pretty good way to turn in time travel time.  I do not keep my own, I have enough <strong><a href="http://thegeekbird.blogspot.com/">blog</a></strong> , although I have already been invited to others.  While I refuse for lack of equipment.  So who knows. <br><br>  I listen to the well-known <a href="http://radio-t.com/">Radio T</a> and <a href="http://radio-u.ru/">U</a> , Gray's podcast " <a href="http://it-thoughts.rpod.ru/">IT Thought,</a> " about <a href="http://ltalks.rpod.ru/">L-talks</a> Linux, which I wish successful sequels, a few Ruby-themed topics.  Also in gPodder there are several tapes of video from different conferences, so it‚Äôs quite comfortable to watch, although it‚Äôs not a podcast at all.  This is done, for example, <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/">here</a> .  I think to unsubscribe from the <a href="http://kadry.rpod.ru/">staff</a> and a few more uninformative.  And in general, when the hands reach, I‚Äôll post OPML with my blog subscriptions - a good way to indicate a circle of interests. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.podcastim.ru/2008/06/intervyu-s-leonidom-ponomarevym/">Original on Podkastim.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26639/</a></p>
