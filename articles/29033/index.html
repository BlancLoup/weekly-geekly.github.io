  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sms feedback for sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another of my ideas for taking part (willing) or criticism (constructive) -sms feedback. <br><br>  The bottom line is as follows: <br><br>  Owners of websites, newspapers, booklets and reasons - those who want to get this type of communication, enter into a partnership agreement with the content provider providing the service and receive a unique code and place it in the form of an icon (with information about the short number and participant code) or links to their resources.  The user will be able to send a text message to the site administrator or other contact person to a short number with the participant's code as a prefix.  From the user's point of view, this will give a GUARANTEE for consideration and response from the recipient.  The obligation to give any response to the request within nn time must be specified in the content provider agreement with the partner.  From the point of view of a partner (website, newspaper, etc.) - this <br>  extra income and spam protection.  Few people will write nonsense even at the rate of $ 1, but those who really need to contact and get a reasonable answer will write. <a name="habracut"></a>  Some sites may even be able to remove links to e-mail and ICQ and use this communication option as an alternative to the feedback form.  In addition, this is the only telephone option (of those that comes to mind) without disclosing your number.  A recognizable icon, such as RSS, will help the service go to the masses.  You can give a service with two rates.  Commercial with a guaranteed response to the recipient of the message - more <br>  expensive.  And private, in which the answer is not required, but it is focused on communication only through this system with the payment of messages by both parties.  It is like an SMS mailbox - analog <br>  e-mail box on free services like mail.ru to hide the number.  Both options can be offered as an additional service for websites and other media for dating, bulletin boards, etc.  (although in my opinion the second option is already used).  In any case, the essence of the proposal is to enable all users to communicate using a mobile phone. <br>  without disclosing the true number - using the virtual number (unique word, numbers and their combination as a prefix). <br>  In principle, it is possible to start and voice mode.

      It is interesting to know your opinion, it will be claimed, no - why? <br><br>  UPD: This is not about technical support of users, but about left-handed calls (for example, to the management with a proposal to buy an elephant). <br>  UPD2: I would pay 1 - 5 cu  for sms in exchange for a guaranteed consideration of my proposal by the MANAGER in a large company. <br><br>  UPD3: In general, it is clear.  In principle, as expected, the reaction is negative.  Probably his time has not yet come, as well as the time of paid e-mail messages - but sometime it seems to me that this (paid) will become the main way of filtering the increasing flow of information. <br><br>  UPD4: Everyone goes to thinking that the director's time is more expensive than sms - I agree, but I do not propose to make money on sms, I suggest using it as a filter. <br><br>  Well, since you insist so much :) - another modification of the idea, the company itself sets how much the company‚Äôs minute / attention is on certain issues and makes sms at that price (unlikely), a paid number with such a cost per minute or paid access to the feedback form .  Naturally, it guarantees that the interaction will be with those who are specified.  Let us take such an extreme and unsuccessful example - many people respect Lebedev for God, if for example he sets a minute of conversation in xx (x) dollars - there will surely be people willing to talk with him and offer their ideas :) <br><br>  <a href="http://ildar.3dn.ru/forum/3-9-1">Cross post</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29033/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29033/</a></p>
