  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Informational space</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear Habrasoobschestvo, I welcome you.  This post is dedicated to information interaction in various areas of our life.  For example, most of us want to stand in smaller queues at the clinic, work remotely, and monitor the progress of a child at school through an online diary.  All this is made possible by IT. <br><img src="http://wa1d.ru/wp-content/uploads/el/1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In fact, with what speed the world is flying now - most people cannot even imagine the pace of this development.  Information flows simply knock down.  This article - an attempt to streamline the confusion in my head, and try to live in a new way. <br>  Anyone who is interested in this topic, welcome under cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Communications </h4><br>  Many would agree that this is a breakthrough in communications - affordable voice calls around the world, channels of communication are expanding, new high-speed data transmission technologies are emerging.  To convey information to the interlocutor at the other end of the world can be done in seconds.  You can enter into transactions, contracts, etc.  But in order to reach this business level, we will consider how this can be achieved.  Therefore, we proceed to the next item.

    <h4>  Electronic money </h4><br>  Online banking - that's why I began to love banking systems - that's just not all, of course, banks are different.  Everything requires a detailed approach. <br>  Opportunities: <br><ul><li>  Loan repayment </li><li>  Payment for services </li><li>  Ability to fill in payment orders, etc. </li><li>  Secure access via https via EDS or TAN-passwords (one-time). </li></ul><br><br>  Virtual plastic card Visa.  I learned about it not so long ago, but I have not had a chance to use it yet.  Share opinion pliz who already carried out with it some financial transactions. <br><br>  Virtual money is still very popular, but it seems that in the future, plastics will force them out of the market.  It becomes much more convenient to pay for purchases with plastic than to enter / withdraw virtual banknotes. <br><br>  Withdraw money.  What can I say, you can even withdraw money from a mobile phone account using the same virtual visa, or attach plastic to a virtual account, and withdraw money from an ATM. <br><br>  The only problem is that the commission is very tangible. <br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  What is the first thing you need to spend electronic money?  No, not on mmorpg, hardware upgrades and entertainment. <br>  Invest them in yourself.  Now you can learn almost any language - there would be a desire.  Higher education in a foreign educational institution is already possible to get online. <br>  Participate in useful webinars, professional conferences, make useful contacts. <br><br><h4>  Remote work </h4><br>  Recently, this is some kind of trend.  ‚ÄúI just want to work while sipping juice in a palm paradise, away from the evil and short-sighted bosses.‚Äù  And how to come to this, no one thinks. <br><br>  After you have trained, you have filled up professional cones, brought in satisfied customers, made a money parachute - only after that you can jump into a free freelance flight. <br><br>  Modern remote access tools allow you to work from anywhere in the world. <br>  However, the most important enemy of a freelancer is self-discipline.  A lot of temptations and distractions.  Coworking centers are one of the exits.  He sat, worked in silence, talked with colleagues.  In cities where there is no such possibility, you just need to find a secluded place, turn off the phone and dive headlong into work. <br><br>  Do not forget about the extra income.  Various partnership programs, development of own projects. <br><br>  Do not forget to register officially, again via the Internet it is possible.  There are advantages to this, and with the right approach, once a year, submit reports on the simplified procedure to spit.  * Source - personal experience. <br><br><h4>  Entrepreneurship </h4><br>  Yes, I agree that there are just mega-profit professions.  But ... at one moment, even the super-super professional will have to understand that it is not the best choice to pull a car behind you, and even uphill. <br>  We move on - we want to become the ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù. <br><br>  To work "ON UNCLE": in general it sounds like "we don‚Äôt want our bosses to raise their voices and terrible eyes to our authorities, because the cleverest and the nicest on the planet of the whole I". <br><br>  However, there is a caveat - you become a cool businessman, and you start to depend even more on others. <br>  A) from customers. <br>  B) from employees razdolbaev. <br>  B) from state structures <br>  Working with people is one of the most difficult.  So think, are you ready for it? <br><br>  But, actually, this is a sonata not of this opera - let's say everything is fine, and now we want a remote system, so that the clients are taken into account, the employees are monitored, and the accounts are kept. <br>  CRM systems for working with clients in the market is full, I will not even stop - pick up your drec and wallet. <br><br><ul><li>  Electronic document management - without comments, the papers should be discarded AT ALL. </li><li>  Accounting - it is advisable to hire a freelance accountant and not to go into this jungle. </li><li>  Tax and pension reporting via the Internet has long been the norm! </li><li>  Remote lawyer, financier, secretary - these are the people who will help you to conduct business, while you simply look through the reports and make management decisions. </li></ul><br><h4>  Purchases </h4><br>  Order food via the Internet, pizza, taxi, medicine.  Bowling, cinema, concert, sporting events.  The list can be continued indefinitely. <br>  What can I say, it is already possible to book a plane ticket via video chat with the air ticket manager. <br><br>  Problems: Delivery and payment.  In the regions the post of Russia and cash on delivery are still popular.  The system of online order taking is not implemented everywhere. <br><br><h4>  E-government </h4><br>  Whatever one may say, and in many respects the state controls us and our actions. <br><img src="http://wa1d.ru/wp-content/uploads/el/10.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A single card of a citizen of Russia - well, a separate topic on state projects.  Perhaps it will be a great tool, but for now this is in the plans, a pilot project - we are waiting, we hope, we believe.  What does it promise - a passport, passport, Inn, pension, bank account, etc. <br><br>  The portal of public services.  Attempt to structure all information about public services, as well as providing them in electronic form.  In fact, in fact, so far not so many services have been translated into electronic form. <br><br>  Who knows, maybe sometime we will relate to state projects with greater loyalty than now. <br><br>  Payment of fines and utilities.  When I woke up, I paid for the communal phone from my smartphone with two keystrokes.  Damn, I thought - how many Russian people still stand in queues at all bank tellers, filling out all kinds of receipts by hand. <br><img src="http://wa1d.ru/wp-content/uploads/el/12.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And polyclinics are monstrous.  Personally, I am for multidisciplinary private medical centers.  Yes, on the one hand it seems expensive, but my opinion changed when four years ago I sat in a queue at one of the soviet clinics - it was 4 hours in a queue + the next day, 3 more !!!, plus the road (2 days killed, what can we say).  We are rich people, because we have time, and we need to appreciate it. <br>  Making an appointment to the clinic via the Internet - it should be, you should strive for this, and it should work!  Private clinics are doing an excellent job with this task (well, not all of course), publicly, unfortunately, alas :( <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  It was a post that I wanted to accelerate everything, not to stand in lines and stuffy cabinets, unsuccessfully struggling with bureaucracy at all levels :).  It is clear that this is all simple and generalized, but this is my vision of the situation of electronic services and information interaction.  I invite everyone to comment for discussion and additions. <br><br>  I'd like to read the comments of Habrayuzer, who make the most of the possibilities of modern information systems and services in electronic form. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144392/</a></p>
