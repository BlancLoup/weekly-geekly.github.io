    <h4>  <b>// Teamwork</b> </h4><br><h6>  Team spirit is much more important than you think.  If people understand each other, if they are willing to make compromises, then everything will be much simpler - this is like a mechanism where everyone knows their business and will never substitute someone who is close, because otherwise the common cause will be useless. <br><br>  Tell us about the situation when you had to work with a person with whom you were very different. <br>  Give an example of a conflict situation in a team.  How did you deal with her? <br>  Describe the moment when you needed to build a relationship with someone very important and you did not immediately succeed.  What helped you cope? <br>  We all make mistakes that we would like to correct.  Tell us about the situation with your colleague in which you would like to do otherwise. <br>  Tell us about the situation in which you needed to get information from a not very responsive person - how did you do it? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Customer focus</b> </h4><br><h6>  If you work in the service sector or are engaged in service, then, of course, you are familiar with the situation when you have to cope with a difficult client, when suddenly everything collapses and everyone is unhappy or vice versa - suddenly you managed to save the day. <br><br>  Describe the situation when it was fundamentally important to make a great impression on the client - what did you do? <br>  Give an example of a situation where you did not meet the expectations of your client.

How would you prioritize? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Ability to adapt</b> </h4><br><h6>  In fact, this is one of the most necessary qualities.  If you are able to find an approach to people, if you feel the needs of clients, if you can create a comfortable atmosphere for yourself - this is half the success.  The ability to adapt and in nature is considered one of the most important for survival. <br><br>  Tell us about the situation when you were under strong pressure from outside.  What's happened?  How did you handle it (or not)? <br>  Describe the time when your company or team experienced some kind of change - how did it affect you and how did you manage to adapt? <br>  Tell us about your first job. <br>  Give an example of a situation where you had to get out of a difficult and unpleasant situation. <br>  Tell us about your failure.  How did you handle this? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Time management (without time machine)</b> </h4><br><h6>  All the time late?  Do not have time to do anything?  Be prepared to ask questions about how time you feel.  And do you understand what ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù is. <br><br>  Tell us about the situation in which you had to quickly build a strategy in order not to miss anything and keep all your priorities. <br>  Describe the project you have been working on for a long time.  How did you manage to plan everything so that the process did not stop? <br>  It is simply impossible to carry out all the items from the list of mandatory cases.  Responsibility falls on you with a huge lump - you become depressed, you cannot cope with anything.  What would you do at such a moment? <br>  Tell us about the goal that you once set for yourself.  How did you move to her? <br>  Give an example of a situation where you simultaneously performed several duties.  How did you handle this? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Communication</b> </h4><br><h6>  It is unlikely that this is somehow related to the ‚Äúsociability‚Äù in your resume - this is the ability to communicate your thoughts clearly and communicate with people.  And stick to the right course in your relationship. <br><br>  Give an example of a situation in which you could convince a person to look at things the way you see them. <br>  Describe the situation when you had to act as an expert - did you manage to make everyone understand you? <br>  Tell us about the situation when you had to rely on letters to convey your idea or thought to the team, team, colleagues. <br>  Give an example of a situation where you had to explain something very specific to a client who did not understand anything in the subject. <br>  Tell us about the successful presentation that you conducted. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Motivation</b> </h4><br><h6>  She will also be very necessary to you.

How to cope with this? <br>  Describe a situation where you were able to display all your creative nature at work.  What did you do?  Was it difficult? <br>  Tell us about the time when you are disappointed in your work.  What can be done to cope with this situation? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Understanding the company's work</b> </h4><br><h6>  This moment reflects the extent of your preparation for the interview. <br><br>  What company values ‚Äã‚Äãare close to you?  How do they relate to your behavior in life, at work?  Give an example. <br>  Why our company? <br>  Than our company stands out among others.  / Name the company's competitors.  Have you ever faced this kind of competition? <br>  Tell us about the moment when you realized that you want to send a resume to us. <br>  Why do you think it is you who approach this position in our company?  How do you imagine yourself working here? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>// Personal questions</b> </h4><br><h6>  Be prepared for them to be given to you.  And there is nothing wrong with answering them sincerely. <br><br>  What would you call your passion?  Give an example of a situation in which you can forget about the passage of time. <br>  What do you do in your free time?  Why this particular hobby?  How can it help you succeed at work?  Give an example of a situation where your hobby helped during working hours. <br>  Describe the situation when you were faced with a serious moral choice. <br>  What are the main values ‚Äã‚Äãfor you? <br>  Have you encountered the problem of life-work balance?
