  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Servers for business: energy efficiency matters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Habr!</b>  In this publication we will talk about new models of Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers that are optimized for maximum energy efficiency. <br><br>  Fujitsu is one of the leading server manufacturers.  According to analysts of Gartner, in terms of the number of server shipments to the EMEA market, according to the results of the fourth quarter of 2014, it ranks fourth after HP, Dell and Lenovo with a share of 5%.  It is worth noting that Fujitsu has a very wide range of server systems and periodically improves them through the introduction of innovative technologies.  This also applies to the most massive systems.  For example, the PRIMERGY line of dual-processor servers was fully updated in September 2014 due to comprehensive improvements made to the wishes of customers. <br><br>  And in September of last year, Fujitsu <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/ru/products/computing/servers/primergy/rack/rx2530m1/">introduced new models of</a> its PRIMERGY server line, which use Xeon processors from the E5-2600 v3 family and DDR4 memory technology.  What is remarkable about these new systems in a situation when the standardization of nodes and components of server platforms makes the products of leading manufacturers so similar in design and characteristics?  In what direction is the engineering thought of Japanese system architects?

     <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/254117/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9f/98f/def/d9f98fdef33f48389954843adb71e161.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <i>The development, testing and production of many models of servers, workstations and storage systems, Fujitsu carries out at its plant in the German city of Augsburg (Germany), in close proximity to European customers.</i> <br><br>  Developers of new dual-processor rack and blade servers PRIMERGY tried to solve a difficult task - to ensure the possibility of developing data centers under the constraints associated with power consumption and footprint.  Indeed, in many data centers, the energy consumption limits are almost exhausted, there is little free space.  At the same time increasing requirements for scalability and system performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a4/da7/acb/1a4da7acb29e4ce7ae2fad835c3099af.jpg"><br>  <i>New dual-processor rack server Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX2530 M1 is designed for virtualization tasks and horizontal scaling.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/397/b9e/740397b9efed420189a8a3b7537b9980.jpg"><br>  <i>The new PRIMERGY BX2580 M1 blade server is optimized for virtualization and other demanding workloads.</i> <br><br>  The extent to which the Fujitsu developers were able to cope with this task is <a href="http://spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/res2015q1/power_ssj2008-20150114-00683.html">indicated by the results of the</a> SPECpower_ssj2008 energy efficiency <a href="http://spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/res2015q1/power_ssj2008-20150114-00683.html">test</a> in the class of rack servers with a height of 1U - 9811 ssj / W operations.  Interestingly, according to the company, since the beginning of the measurements of power parameters and performance in 2007, the energy efficiency of Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers has improved 30 times. <br><br>  Due to what record figures are achieved?  First of all, this technology is Cool-safe Advanced Thermal Design and power supplies with energy efficiency of 96%.  Cool-safe ensures server operation in high temperature environment in the data center.  Heat resistance of Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers is achieved, first of all, thanks to the hardware architecture.  Traditionally, they use an optimized design of the front grille, which allows to increase its breathability.  This solution, coupled with a cable-free design, ensures good circulation of air flow, which prevents the appearance of areas with elevated temperatures. <br><br>  Since the new generation PRIMERGY servers use advanced cooling technologies and power management tools, they can operate in an extended temperature range, and the risk of overheating downtime is reduced. <br><br>  In modular servers with an integrated power supply and cooling infrastructure, the power and cooling systems take up very little space, and the saved space allows you to optimize the heat exchange in the servers themselves. <br><br>  Special software monitors the temperature of the components and in case of reaching the critical values ‚Äã‚Äãincreases the speed of the fans or, when using the specified rules, lowers the clock frequency of the processors to reduce power consumption and, as a result, reduce the temperature.  As a result, PRIMERGY servers can operate for a long time at ambient temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius, and not just withstand its short-term increase. <br><br>  Why is it important?  Experts <a href="http://www.osp.ru/lan/2012/05/13015723/">estimate</a> that increasing the temperature in the data center by one degree reduces energy consumption by 4‚Äì5%.  The cost of cooling the data center is reduced, you can more widely use the mode of free cooling.  It is also worth considering the power consumption of the cooling and power supply systems, and in the data center it is sometimes equivalent to the power consumption of the IT systems themselves. <br><br>  According to some estimates, by increasing the energy efficiency of the server park, it is possible to achieve a total reduction in energy consumption of 5-10%.  If we consider the server with a consumption of 400-500 kW, then it is easy to calculate how much electricity can be saved in a year.  As for the Cool-safe Advanced Thermal Design technology, Fujitsu estimates that it can save up to 27% on cooling. <br><br>  Other efficient energy saving tools are virtualization and deployment of blade systems.  By transferring a significant number of services to a small number of physical machines, it is possible to significantly reduce energy consumption. <br><br>  The Fujitsu Blade Chassis contains 18 blades per 10U, the industry's highest density of equipment.  This is 648 cores.  Each server in the chassis supports RAM up to 1.5 TB.  This is important, for example, for deploying virtualization environments with a large number of virtual machines.  Compared to rack servers, this computing platform requires far fewer cables and patch cords.  This means cost savings, fewer connection errors and easier operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bea/930/3d3/bea9303d331b4784b0cd15543995d997.png"><br>  <i>The PRIMERGY RX2530 M1 server <a href="http://globalsp.ts.fujitsu.com/dmsp/Publications/public/wp-performance-report-primergy-rx2530-m1-ww-en.pdf">outperforms the</a> Dell PowerEdge R620 classmate by 24% in energy efficiency</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/c98/e61/264c98e61283436e9cb7c1133d2b9b16.png"><br>  <i>Thanks to the new PRIMERGY RX2530 M1 processors, it has a significantly higher throughput than the previous model PRIMERGY RX200 S8 and, with higher power consumption, demonstrates 28% better energy efficiency.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7d/6cf/1c2/e7d6cf1c2c6d4b50b65f7f92a8f89204.png"><br>  <i>New generation systems show 52% better maximum results in OLTP tasks compared to previous Fujitsu server models.</i> <br><br>  Onboard servers - Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors, containing up to 18 cores, up to 1536 GB of DDR4 memory (24 DIMM slots), up to 8 hard drives / solid-state drives with a size of 2.5 inches or up to 10 drives with a size of 2.5 inches, of these, up to 4 2.5-inch PCIe solid-state drives, four PCIe Gen3 slots.  That is, as necessary, integrate new solid-state drives and hard drives into the system. <br><br>  Another interesting technology used in the new PRIMERGY models is the ability to dynamically scale the I / O bandwidth to meet the needs of applications through the use of a modular scalable LOM architecture (LAN On Mainboard), the so-called DynamicLoM, and universal converged network adapters (CNA) .  DynamicLoM technology allows you to use a network port as a three-in-one port, that is, with three different types of ports, three different port numbers and two data rates. <br><br>  Fujitsu's blade chassis uses I / O port virtualization tools and its own integrated switches.  A ‚Äúflat‚Äù network on these switches requires fewer rack-level (ToR) switches.  Up to eight switches can form one logical switch, which simplifies management. <br><br>  Support for the most common RAID configurations is built into the motherboard and does not require a special controller.  Therefore, server-based, you can create an entry-level RAID at no additional cost. <br><br>  It should be noted that the cost of the servers themselves is only a small part of the TCO, the tip of the iceberg.  Cumulative costs also include system maintenance, software licenses, cooling costs.  These are significant costs to consider when deploying IT systems. <br><br>  An efficient heat removal system allows the servers to use the most advanced processor models, which results in a performance increase of 30-40%.  At the same time, the cost of the CPU is only 5-10% in the cost of the server.  That is, the customer gets more performance for less money.  The acquisition of such systems means that you need to buy fewer software licenses, and this is also a significant savings.  Reducing the number of servers also improves the manageability of the IT infrastructure. <br><br>  Our previous publications: <br><br>  <font color="#cc0000"><b>¬ª</b></font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/251557/">Fujitsu ETERNUS CD10000: Ceph without worries</a> <br>  <font color="#cc0000"><b>¬ª</b></font> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fujitsu/blog/251921/">New server park Fujitsu</a> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we are ready to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254117/</a></p>
