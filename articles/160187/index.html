  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tariff with access only to MSK-IX, DataIX, W-IX or how to download their European servers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a long time already, many of our clients or potential clients have asked, ‚Äúcan you connect a server only with traffic in MSK-IX?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow much will it cost if I pour traffic only on MSK-IX?  Will it be cheaper? ‚ÄùBut then we didn‚Äôt have such a tariff.  Yes, and there was no technical possibility.  And now, a couple of weeks ago, we finally launched a tariff with access only to MSK-IX, W-IX and DataIX networks.  We would like to tell about the technical details and advantages of the new tariff in this article. <br><br>  Those who are interested only in facts, can read about the benefits, and then decide for themselves whether or not to read the rest of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At once I will make a reservation that M9 is a reinforced concrete building.  And MSK-IX is a distributed traffic exchange network in Moscow.  Many people confuse these concepts. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br><h5>  The cheapest traffic in Russia </h5><br>  Traffic at this rate is even cheaper than traffic on MSK-IX - from 6500 rubles for 1 Gbit / s.  It is worth remembering that we offer only guaranteed bands.  Of course, in the Russian market you can find offers for 5,000 rubles per gigabit port, but these data centers are unlikely to give you to constantly occupy a gigabit port during peak hours every day.

    <h5>  Unloading existing resources </h5><br>  Removing the load from the current servers with access to the entire Internet, for example, where traffic costs 25,000 rubles for 1 Gbit / s, you significantly optimize costs: you can add the load on the servers that have become free without upgrading the bandwidth. <br><br><h5>  Improving connectivity to traffic consumers in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and some other countries </h5><br>  About 50% of users of Russia and a certain percentage of users of operators of neighboring countries are available at this tariff.  Operators, as a rule, try to expand the peering joints (which are also connections to MSK-IX, W-IX and DataIX) on time and keep them unloaded, since these lines are the cheapest and most often cheaper than buying traffic from large operators.  As a result, it is more profitable for end operators to receive traffic through peerings, rather than receive this traffic, for example, from Europe. <br><br><h5>  DDoS protection </h5><br>  The community of operators connected to the "exchangers" is always in touch - their technical contacts are always in the list of participants on the sites of traffic exchange points.  Catch the source of DDoS'a in this case is not a problem.  It is quickly detected and eliminated.  Even now, during DDoS, spurious traffic coming from traffic exchange points in Russia is less than 5% of the total attack volume.  Also, due to the unavailability of IP addresses used on this tariff plan throughout the rest of the Internet, they are not visible from, for example, India, Pakistan and other countries, which usually appear in cyber-news reports about the closure of the next botnet used in distributed attacks. . <br><br><h4>  Now the details </h4><br>  First, it is technically impossible to connect the server directly to the MSK-IX network.  IX allocates non-routable IP addresses to participants, that is, they are not visible on the Internet, and also requires participants to have an autonomous system (AS) and their own block of IP addresses to connect to IX.  So, to connect to MSK-IX, you will need to get your own router with an AS and a network of addresses, and only connect your server to it.  The same applies to other traffic exchange points - DataIX and W-IX. <br><br>  Why do customers so often ask us about the possibility of such a connection?  This is very profitable: at the moment, a guaranteed gigabit port in Moscow‚Äôs data centers can be bought for 20,000‚Äì30,000 rubles.  The MSK-IX gigabit is more expensive, but everything changes when you need several gigabits - the 10 Gbps port will cost the MSK-IX 101,244 rubles.  That is a little more than 10,000 rubles in terms of 1 Gbit / s.  Yes, of course, this is not the entire Internet, but only about 50% of users of RuNet, but it is many times cheaper just to buy gigabits in the data center. <br><br>  In Ukraine, data centers have long had very cheap tariffs with access only to UA-IX.  After upgrading our network, we also had the technical ability to provide only access to the MSK-IX, DataIX and W-IX networks.  This is implemented by a separate routing table on our routers that do not get IP networks from the global Internet.  This immediately rejects the question of users ‚Äúand what will happen if my traffic goes not only to MSK-IX, but also to other networks?  How much will I pay?  This is impossible: IP addresses on this tariff are simply unavailable from the global Internet, so traffic does not go to them. <br><br>  Our tariff turned out to be even cheaper than MSK-IX: 1 Gbit / s port with a guaranteed unlimited 1 Gbit / s band we offer for 7,200 rubles per month, 10 Gbit / s port with a guaranteed band of the same speed - 65,000 rubles per month.  In terms of 1 Gbit / s comes out to 6 500 rubles.  How are prices cheaper than the original (MSK-IX)?  We have a lot of direct peer-to-peer connections into which the traffic ‚Äúmerges‚Äù.  In general, the logical scheme of traffic distribution at this tariff looks like this: traffic is evenly distributed over direct peer-to-peer connections, then traffic is evenly distributed between DataIX and W-IX ‚Äúexchangers‚Äù, and all remaining traffic that has not passed to the above connections goes to MSK- Ix.  The uniformity in this case is determined by the shortest path of traffic.  It is much better to distribute traffic over direct connections than it does in MSK-IX, if only because we can control the loading of operators 'connections and redirect traffic from overloaded connections to the moment when users' complaints come to us.  When sending traffic to MSK-IX, we see the loading of our port, but we cannot see the loading of ports of other operators and, accordingly, cannot do anything if the operator has a port overloaded and there are losses or delays on it.  In such cases, we take action after reasoned user complaints. <br><br>  In fact, the price of our tariff is the cost of depreciation of the port, which includes our client, the cost of transporting user traffic through our network and transport reservation.  A certain percentage of traffic goes to MSK-IX itself - it is also counted in our price. <br><br>  With the MSK-IX route servers, we now get a little more than 15,000 IPv4 routes.  Add routes from DataIX, from W-IX clients and our direct peering here.  As a result, in our table of routes available at this tariff, at the moment there are just over 19,000 IPv4 prefixes.  Why more MSK-IX?  Because not all operators present on DataIX and W-IX are on MSK-IX.  The list of available networks, by the way, we also provide to customers.  If anyone is interested, there is a link to it at the end of the article.  We have excluded from it all networks shorter / 24, since they are usually aggregated into larger networks. <br><br>  But let's imagine with you that there is a technical possibility to connect servers directly to the ‚Äúexchangers‚Äù.  We calculated the difference in the cost of connecting directly to MSK-IX and connecting to Multibyte.  The graphs below show the monthly cost of the port 1 Gbit / s and 10 Gbit / s in terms of 1 port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/579/0ea/b955790eaa65481f1c1e07929c0c0573.jpg"><br>  <i>The cost of one port 1 Gbit / s with the purchase of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ports</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e8/79f/991/2e879f99178dabee007910ce3e8caa4b.jpg"><br>  <i>The cost of one port 10Gbit / s with the purchase of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ports</i> <br><br>  For calculations, we took the cost of the ports from the MSK-IX website, added 18% VAT to them and multiplied the U.E.  for the course established on the website (28.6 rubles for 1 CU), that is, now our prices with MSK-IX are given to a common denominator. <br><br>  The difference in the cost of 1Gbit / s ports, of course, is striking.  But even at 10Gbit / s ports it can be seen that the monthly savings in renting one port will be 36,244 rubles.  If we talk about 5 ports, then the savings are as much as 20,044 rubles for each port (in the amount for all 5 ports more than 100,000 rubles). <br><br>  The only technical important limitation that exists at this tariff: it is available only in our data centers and only at our IP addresses; we also do not raise BGP sessions with clients at this tariff. <br><br>  For those who are not sure that they can somehow remove traffic from their current servers, as well as for those who are afraid to buy a cat in a bag, we have prepared several test servers with SSD and gigabit connections with access only to MSK- IX, W-IX and DataIX.  Contact me personally right at Habr√©, or call the office during business hours and ask me to get a test server for a few days.  Considering possible habraeffekt, I do not exclude formation of turn, but we will try to satisfy all. <br><br>  In order not to be unfounded, we asked one of our first customers who tried the new service, <a href="http://highload.biz/">HighLoad.biz</a> , to comment on this article. <br>  <b>Andrey Vasilishin, representative of HighLoad:</b> <br><blockquote> We have been engaged in outsourcing high-load resources for 5 years, we provide clients with rental and administration of servers for pseudo flv and mp4 streaming. <br><br>  This year, for several reasons, they decided to develop CDN solutions.  The first reason is cheaper traffic, the second is to bring content closer to the user.  In the spring of this year, we began to separate the world traffic and traffic passing through the UA-IX and Dtel-IX exchange points.  This solution has helped our large customers who are oriented towards the CIS to save about 25% of their traffic. <br><br>  The second stage was the proposal from Multibyte for hosting servers connected to MSK-IX, Data-IX and W-IX.  The main target audience of consumers of our customers' content is in Russia, and a significant proportion of traffic passes through these exchange points.  The result of the server for the first week is visible on the chart below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eba/e9a/e4c/ebae9ae4c2b37dd24fd111faaa48e422.png"><br><br>  As expected, this server took about 35% of the traffic.  During the week of using Multibyte services, we improved the quality of communication to content consumers, and unloaded our servers with global traffic.  Savings on the purchase of traffic there! </blockquote><br><br>  We asked for comments about our new tariff and representatives of the "exchangers": <br><br>  <b>Alexander Slivker, DataIX Commercial Director:</b> <br><blockquote>  About 85% of the participants of the distributed Russian DataIX traffic exchange network are broadband operators.  The remaining members of the exchange are content providers.  Getting traffic through traffic exchange points is much cheaper than buying it from large telecom operators.  Broadband providers are well aware of this.  By connecting to DataIX, they both optimize their costs and improve connectivity to the largest Russian content generators. <br><br>  The emergence of such an interesting tariff at the company PolyBite will hopefully contribute to the development of broadband access operators in Russia by localizing traffic within the country.  And we, the DataIX team, will continue to develop our network to deliver this traffic to consumers not only in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, Kiev, Yekaterinburg, Khabarovsk, but also in other regions. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Vasily Maslovsky, General Director of IHOME LLC, CEO of W-ix:</b> <br><blockquote>  We are sincerely glad that now such a tariff is available to the clients of the company Multibyte.  The new tariff will not only save money to customers of Multibyte, but also provide direct access to popular content at maximum speed using the W-ix peering infrastructure in 21 cities of the Russian Federation and 8 cities of the World.  This was made possible through the development of cooperation W-ix and Mbyte. <br><br>  The territorially distributed peering W-ix unites more than 100 telecom operators and content providers in Russia and Ukraine, and also provides access to the 6 largest peering operations in Europe and the USA.  Most of the Internet (about 265,000 IPv4 prefixes) are already available to the peering participants via the shortest route.  W-ix has points of presence in the cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Tula, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don, Kursk, Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Saratov, Cheboksary, Ufa, Perm, Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, Yekaterinburg, Tyumen, Omsk, Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Kemerovo, Krasnoyarsk, Kiev, Frankfurt am Main, Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, Paris, Ashburn and New York.  We provide Multibyte customers with access to our peering members in the above cities with minimal delays. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Useful links for this article:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.dataix.ru/">Official site of the Unified Distributed Russian Internet Exchange DataIX</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.w-ix.ru/">Official website of the International Peering W-ix</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.msk-ix.ru/">Official website of Moscow Internet Exchange MSK-IX</a> <br>  <a href="http://mnogobyte.ru/noc/networks/ixonly.html">List of IPv4 prefixes available at the ‚ÄúOnly with access to MSK-IX, DataIX and W-IX clients‚Äù tariff</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160187/</a></p>
