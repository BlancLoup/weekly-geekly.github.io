Security </h3><br>  On the vulnerability of standard IP cameras, especially budget ones, many articles have been written, including on Habr√©.

      I can recommend <a href="https://xakep.ru/2017/04/27/hack-cams/">this one</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/company/devline/blog/405083/">this one</a> . <br><br>  ".  <i>... To date, more than a million IP cameras and IP DVRs from different manufacturers allow you to remotely access their settings without any authorization.</i>  <i>The Python script that automates the attack on vulnerable devices has already been posted on GitHub.</i>  <i>The problem was discovered in early 2017 when reversing the DVR firmware from Dahua Technology.</i>  <i>A little later, it turned out that it affects more than a thousand models from different manufacturers.</i>  <i>They simply replicated each other's mistakes ...</i> ‚Äù <br><br>  The main problem of IP cameras in terms of security is that the camera is essentially a server that looks to the Internet from a specific address and on a certain port. <br><br>  As a result, simply by scanning the ranges of IP addresses and ports in search of a response from the camera, you can easily find cameras and attack them. <br><br>  It is also worth mentioning the solution - video surveillance on a smartphone that uses Android Webcam Server - a simple application that transmits video stream from the smartphone‚Äôs integrated camera to the Internet. <br><br>  Such applications are also subject to hacking on the principle described above. <br><br>  Most IP cameras have the ability to broadcast an audio channel - there is a speaker in the camera. <br>  This is often used by hackers - they often frighten their victims by reproducing various sounds through the camera. <br><br>  There are even whole channels in youtube, which keep records of such hacked cameras with sound, in which they scoff at unsuspecting users. <br><br>  For example, Cam Prank: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5m1IvnmVOw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Unlike all similar solutions, our application ( <a href="https://www.mob1.biz/product">instant messenger with video surveillance function</a> ) was developed in a completely different way. <br><br>  Firstly, all video surveillance lives in the messenger ecosystem, that is, you can‚Äôt just take and scan IP addresses and ports - it will give nothing. <br><br>  Secondly, the entire video and audio stream is encrypted. <br><br>  Thirdly, access to the video camera is carried out by a unique login, which cannot be faked. <br><br><h3>  2. Non-volatility </h3><br>  As a rule, most budget IP cameras do not have a battery or a battery, respectively, if there are problems with electricity, they will not work. <br><br>  The built-in battery in the smartphone allows you to maintain up to a day in the case of using the application for video surveillance. <br><br><h3>  3. Already installed 3 / 4G module for Internet access </h3><br>  Basically, all IP cameras use a Wi-Fi connection. <br><br>  In some cases, for example, if the owner wants to use video surveillance at a remote site where there is no infrastructure (cottage, remote warehouse, garage, car), you need to additionally install some router to convert the mobile Internet into Wi-Fi. <br>  And routers tend to hang. <br><br>  For such cases, the application on the smartphone already has ¬æ G modules and is able to switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data network and vice versa, while maintaining performance. <br><br><h3>  4. The possibility of obtaining the geo-location of a remote object of video surveillance </h3><br>  The application has a function for remotely receiving coordinates from an object with video surveillance installed - this can be useful if the object can be in motion - for example, a car, a container, a pet, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/7d/nz/rr7dnzujlcd4suaa_fq-rqy5aag.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  5. Standard connection of the solar battery or an additional high-capacity power source </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/s2/pj/dks2pjqxqqt-onpqngdapkqygcw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  6. A variety of devices on which video surveillance systems can be launched. </h3><br>  It is possible to install such a video surveillance system on virtually any device with an android version not lower than 5. <br><br>  For example: <br><br>  - on Android TV consoles (you need to connect a USB camera with a built-in microphone if you need sound) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/ge/yy/bngeyyzvzxlkns7j6md76sjdpqg.jpeg"><br><br>  - on smartwatches with full Android (like LemFo): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3y/p-/ra/3yp-raefz7kmymljhu9xnscqxoe.jpeg"><br><br>  - on smartphones the size of a credit card: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/uv/r3/khuvr3qshnbmt9gqkkxlppmhk3a.jpeg"><br><br>  - on dust / moisture protected smart phones of small size: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hk/0i/em/hk0iemfhhse0vxbnubbqtaqlomc.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  7. Low cost solution </h3><br>  There are two things here - firstly, probably, many have quite workable old smartphones, which no one uses anymore and which can be used for video surveillance. <br><br>  Secondly, now you can buy new budget smartphones for $ 25-30. <br>  The cost is slightly higher than conventional IP cameras, but it should be noted that this amount already includes the ¬æ G module, battery and 2 cameras with a fairly good resolution. <br><br><h2>  Minuses </h2><br><h3>  1. While there is no video recording </h3><br>  But soon there will be a function of photographing from the camera on a schedule. <br><br><h3>  2. No motion detection </h3><br>  There are certain ideas on how to make a good detector, but this is still in development. <br><br><h3>  3. No IR illumination for night shooting </h3><br>  And finally - a small guide on how to set up such a video surveillance system. <br><br>  1. Download and install <a href="https://www.mob1.biz/product">M1 Messenger</a> on 2 devices - for video surveillance and for the observer. <br>  Registration is simple, by login, without a phone number. <br><br>  2. Now you need to "make friends" these 2 devices so that they can communicate with each other. <br><br>  To do this, search from any device in this pair, look for the login of another: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bw/ui/lv/bwuilv7o85hon5k1y5sqhfcjhok.jpeg"><br><br>  We send a request and confirm it from another phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/6d/rv/iu6drvxjluutwcmod68nq4gii3o.jpeg"><br><br>  3. Select the camera with which the video stream will be broadcast. <br><br>  Go to the Live TV settings in the smartphone that will stand on the object of observation. <br>  If you plan to use an old smartphone with a weak processor, we recommend choosing a front camera - it has less resolution and the processor will be easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/tt/na/mdttnafdgcpfdfdfvyhmqlupz78.jpeg"><br><br>  4. Open access to the camera. <br><br>  In the settings there are 2 modes - allow access only to certain users, which we authorized earlier in step 2: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u9/qg/w2/u9qgw2r67ixhsdw3rjglhzsqwhm.jpeg"><br><br>  If you want to provide access to several users, then all of them must first also be authorized by the login that will be included as a video camera. <br><br>  The second mode is an open broadcast, that is, any M1 Messenger user can watch a video. <br><br>  Before turning on this mode, a message is made that the camera will be accessible to everyone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/pw/_j/crpw_jxlijbv_kp0nllxqu7quo4.jpeg"><br><br>  All available cameras are displayed in the Live TV list: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/pc/om/sspcomzvq6_hc1stdcig4og94oq.jpeg"><br><br>  Tapu will open the video stream. <br><br>  You can watch online video on your Live TV Test Stream test account - access is open to everyone. <br><br>  You can also watch a small video that describes the process of installing video surveillance in a car: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvzE_L13sBU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420339/</a></p>
