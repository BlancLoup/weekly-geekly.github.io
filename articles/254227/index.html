Moreover, the nature and content of these decisions are not disclosed in the draft act. </blockquote><br>  It would be desirable, of course, to more clearly understand what may in general be information allowing the release (emission) of money substitutes and (or) transactions with their use, but this is not disclosed anywhere.  With such a formulation it is not clear, is it possible to talk and write about how the mining of cryptocurrencies works?  Does this information allow something or not?  And the description of the implementation of the function SHA256 (SHA256 (Data))?

      Absolutely all the suggestions and comments on the results of the public discussion were not taken into account.  The published <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/get.php%3Fview_id%3D5%26doc_id%3D17698">summary of the proposals</a> is essentially a formal reply.  Many suggestions and comments are left without any comments at all, and where they are, the text of the comment is the same, regardless of the nature of the proposals or comments. <br><br>  Based on the foregoing, it is also logical to assume that there may be problems for game developers of studios that use in-game currencies and for companies that use other entities that are not within the definition-exception from the project under discussion. <br><br>  Another thing worth remembering is Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseyev, who <a href="http://ria.ru/economy/20150320/1053571143.html">stated</a> at the All-Russian Banking Conference that the law, which provides for penalties for using money surrogates, will be adopted this year, as well as <a href="http://bits.media/news/blokirovka-roskomnadzorom-bitcoin-saytov/">blocking websites</a> dedicated to cryptocurrency topics. <br><br>  In the Duma, they are already waiting for this law, some deputies even took the initiative to hold it before all approvals, in particular, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/580558">‚ÄúFair Russia‚Äù</a> , and the Liberal Democratic Party <a href="http://regnum.ru/news/1899867.html">considers</a> that <br><blockquote>  All these cryptocurrencies are created by the American special services just to finance terrorism and "color revolutions" </blockquote><br>  Summarizing all the above, there are no reasons yet to see why this law will not be passed at the autumn session of the Duma this year.  That this decision will well <a href="http://bits.media/budushchee-kriptovalyuty-v-rossii/">throw</a> our country back has been repeatedly written, it makes no sense to repeat.  It is just a bit annoying to observe what is happening here, against the background of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/247894/">processes</a> in more developed countries on this issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254227/</a></p>
