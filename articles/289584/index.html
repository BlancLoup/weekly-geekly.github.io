    <h1>  <font color="#3b5998">Preparing to start</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Dorji, I have a first question for you: we know that you are the founder of the company, we know that you are the CEO of Infostart, tell us about yourself and what happened before that?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">I, like all the main participants in our community, started as a 1C programmer.</font>  <font color="#000">In the last courses of the university I went to work in a franchisee company and automated a small business, I came across a retail network of pharmacies, motor transport enterprises, and construction organizations.</font>  <font color="#000">Gradually I grew as a specialist, and this became my profession.</font>  <font color="#000">Then I took up larger projects.</font>  <font color="#000">The first such major project was the automation of the Alliance Leather Factory, and the last was the Velikoluksky Dairy Plant.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">That is, is it possible to say that already then you had an idea for <a href="http://infostart.ru/">Infostart.ru</a> ?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Infostart.ru was originally launched as a commercial project.</font>  <font color="#000">Moving from one project to another, I have programmed, one might say, a universal set of reporting, as well as a tool for the database.</font>  <font color="#000">And from project to project, the tool was improved, and at some point I realized that I wanted to make a lottery solution that could be sold.</font>  <font color="#000">Then the Internet was just developing, and I realized that this is a new sales channel.</font>  <font color="#000">This was the impetus.</font>  <font color="#000">I have been looking for a name for a long time, looking for a free domain so that the domain name and the company match.</font>  <font color="#000">Although the Internet was small, all pre-letter domains of popular words were already taken.</font>  <font color="#000">Even Artemy Lebedev did not disdain it, was engaged in cybersquatting, took the domains "spoon", "plate.Ru".</font>  <font color="#000">The two-letter domains were not yet taken, so I took information technologies - the words ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù and ‚Äústart‚Äù, because I assumed that this would be the site from which business automation begins.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the appearance of the Internet in Russia</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">We have now touched on the topic of the internet of that time.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Do you remember when you first encountered the Internet?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">This is a unique technology, as you know.</font>  <font color="#000">Even fiction writers could not have imagined that such a thing would arise.</font>  <font color="#000">And this, it turns out, was the end of the 90s.</font>  <font color="#000">And I studied, just entered the university.</font>  <font color="#000">My friends and I, three friends, threw off $ 100 each and bought the first computer for three, that is, he was with me one week, one week with my friend and another week with the third.</font>  <font color="#000">And then the Internet had to go through a modem, dial up to some phone number, buy a card from the subway.</font>  <font color="#000">Then for the first time we discovered the Internet.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Yes, it will be difficult for our children to believe this when they have three or four gadgets.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">And then what was Infostart devoted to, was it rather a thematic site, or a tool?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">So, Infostart as a company was registered in 2004.</font>  <font color="#000">Already 10 years ago.</font>  <font color="#000">I had been in my desk for two years, but my product was being prepared, and I realized that my main costs of making it a lot of production are not in the actual programming, but in promoting the solution.</font>  <font color="#000">Competent marketing - in order to bring the product to the end consumer in high quality - was expensive.</font>  <font color="#000">It is this understanding that gave impetus to the creation of a certain community on the basis of the site Infostart.ru, in order to unite all commercial authors who will place their software products in one site, and to attract potential consumers to this site.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúMAJOR COSTS NOT IN PROGRAMMING, BUT IN PROMOTION‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">Did you have a team, or were you one for all?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">You could say it was almost a hobby because it was the main work: automation of enterprises, only at that moment I was working on food distributors, and at the same time I had a project site where my own solutions were sold, and other solutions also started to be sold third-party developers.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Do you remember any difficulties or difficulties at the initial stage?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Hardship?</font>  <font color="#000">I can say that there were no special difficulties.</font>  <font color="#000">At first it was a bet on the sale of advertising, but it turned out that the audience of programmers to advertisers is not particularly interesting.</font>  <font color="#000">In general, the industry only developed, and as such, sales via the Internet were rare.</font>  <font color="#000">Income is not enough for normal development.</font>  <font color="#000">For several years I was accumulating a certain potential, that is, I created a user base, a development base.</font>  <font color="#000">And only, probably, in 2012 I was able to monetize all this.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the first successes</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Monetization is good, but maybe there were some other successes in six months, a year?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Anything to say "yes, we have achieved some success."</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Perhaps a certain number of visitors or a certain figure registered on the portal.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#222">Well, of course!</font>  <font color="#222">When I started the project, we were happy for the first 100 visitors.</font>  <font color="#222">When the counter grew over 100 visitors a day, we even arranged a holiday and celebrated.</font>  <font color="#222">Then the number of visitors exceeded 1,000 people per day, and we also noted this, and then, when there were several thousand of them ...</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Sorry, but 100 visitors is what?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Is it registered or logged in?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Visitors throughout the day.</font>  <font color="#000">On the day, 100 people visited the site - this was an event for us.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">I am a programmer in the past, and I remember that in addition to Infostart there were a number of other similar sites.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">There was a forum Kuban.ru, which still lives, there was a forum of Stanislav Mitichkin "Mista.ru", there was a forum Proclub.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">How did Infostart differ from all these sites?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">At that time, all our colleagues on the Internet mostly communicated on forums, we also provided some kind of platform on which to post files and communicate, and, moreover, in 2006 several social know-how were used, which are now considered standard facto</font>  <font color="#000">I say that initially in 2006, when we opened, we immediately came up with a system of likes: one user could give another one a point (‚Äú+1‚Äù) for publishing it.</font>  <font color="#000">Surprisingly, it worked.</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e0/452/6be/5e04526be8e548c081b4c603e2894ab4.jpg"><br><br>  <b><font color="#000">As I recall, these were stars.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#222">We displayed them in the form of stars or pluses.</font>  <font color="#222">You could put +1 or ‚Äì1.</font>  <font color="#222">Maybe now this technology does not surprise anyone, but at that time it was quite difficult to get these voices, it was some kind of asset that does not repeat.</font>  <font color="#222">A person registers on the site, places the program, someone likes it, votes for the program.</font>  <font color="#222">How many ‚Äúpluses‚Äù, so many people voted, and it is impossible to fake it.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">In fact, it is a system of a certain rating, and a social one.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">So far on our site there is this rating, there are TOP-100 authors.</font>  <font color="#000">Since 2006, they accumulate these "pluses".</font>  <font color="#000">As experience and time have shown, thanks to this system, quite interesting and unique solutions emerge.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About community cohesion</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">You talked about the community before.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Infostart differs from many similar portals in cohesion.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">As far as I remember, you even conducted club trips, chose to rest somewhere with the guys, held meetings in St. Petersburg.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Can you say a few words about this?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, when we started to unite all members of the community, we held meetings not only on-line, but also off-line.</font>  <font color="#000">We went on picnics, rode a catamaran in the Gulf of Finland, even organized the first bowling championship with the name "Roll the Balls - do not automate."</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">This is very curious: after all, when you launched the portal as a kind of commercial product, you had to imagine an image of a potential audience.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Was that image very different from the people with whom you have already met live?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">My main audience is 1C programmers, like me, so we speak the same language.</font>  <font color="#000">In general, I believe that programming is creativity, in any case, I refer programmers to the creative class, because these are people who, like painters and sculptors, create an object - a program out of nothing.</font>  <font color="#000">No wonder that in the fourth chapter of the Civil Code, programs are equated to literary works, and it would probably be worth mentioning Lev Tolstoy, who said, "If you can not write, do not write."</font>  <font color="#000">So a programmer, he can not write programs.</font>  <font color="#000">He always creates, he is a creator who, like an artist or a sculptor, creates some essence.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúPROGRAMMING IS CREATIVITY‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">Is it possible, on the basis of the above, to compare Infostart with a certain gallery where the results of creativity are placed?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, Infostart is also at the initial stage, and now is a gallery for programmers, where they, as artists, come and exhibit their works.</font>  <font color="#000">After launching, Infostart.ru offered users, after registering, the opportunity to place their program on the court of the community, which was claimed, everyone accepted the rules of the game and began to participate.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About moderation and the "Court of the Public"</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">You just said that you can submit your development to the public at once, that is, there was no moderation?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">There was no pre-moderation, there was some post-moderation.</font>  <font color="#000">I was looking through new material, and if there really was some spam, I deleted it.</font>  <font color="#000">But at the time there were no ‚Äútrolls‚Äù or ‚Äúhaters‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#000">A new platform for communication was perceived with a bang, no one especially did a hooligan, so moderation was minimal.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">From Web 2.0 to the cutting edge</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">By the way, I have now opened the page ‚ÄúAbout the site‚Äù on the portal and here it says that InfoStart is a professional automation community.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">We touched on the community issue.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Can you tell when the site and users have really become a community?</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">After all, community is something more.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#222">Yes, Infoostart was originally just a development catalog and was built on the ideology of Web 2.0: it was a fashionable name for websites that are organized according to the user content generation, that is, users fill it themselves.</font>  <font color="#222">That is, any user could register on Infostart.ru and add their own content, which other participants are discussing.</font>  <font color="#222">We tried to be progressive and I understood that for further communication there were not enough personal messages, groups ... The participants demanded more functionality, so when we switched to 1C-Bitrix, and 1C-Bitrix later released a special module "social network", we were the first to even the Beta version and on this Bete have completed their infostart.</font>  <font color="#222">And when the official release of Bitrix came out, the very next day, the Infoostart functional was rolled out, and even in the first press releases of Beatrix modulo social networks, our company featured as an example.</font>  <font color="#222">In general, Infostart has always been at the forefront of progress, even now we have launched a redesign based on an adapted site.</font>  <font color="#222">Now not all sites have an adaptation.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Can you tell us more about this?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">An adapted site is a site that is built on the principle that it looks correct on any device.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">Well, that is, I will have a tablet, it will look correct, if I have a phone - it will adjust to the phone.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">The same optimized for the iPhone, on a laptop - this is the third type, and on the large monitor you can make the fourth.</font>  <font color="#000">And this is all at the same address.</font>  <font color="#000">That is - there is no mobile version, there is no normal version.</font>  <font color="#000">One version that adapts to any device.</font> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About baggage knowledge</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#000">Returning to the topic of differences in Infostart from other similar sites, the following question arose: there was a moment when you announced that all banned users could return to the site and continue communication there without any repressive actions.</font></b>  <b><font color="#000">Where did these banned users come from?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">At first, communication was, so to speak, intimate.</font>  <font color="#000">We were a little, we placed the program, developed.</font>  <font color="#000">In order to grow further, it was necessary to use other methods, that is, those who wanted to share their programs were already shared, and the situation was that the content accumulated on Infostarte was no longer appreciated, because it was free and accessible without restriction.</font>  <font color="#000">And then I came up with a certain system that called for "sharing my own in order to get someone else's."</font>  <font color="#000">In the end, now all the authors who are present on the site, who have created their publications, fully get access to all the accumulated knowledge.</font>  <font color="#000">This is not the moment everyone fully understood.</font> <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúSHARE YOURSELF TO GET ANYTHING‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b><font color="#000">I understand correctly that this was supposed to be a kind of driver for further growth?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes.</font>  <font color="#000">It became a driver.</font>  <font color="#000">Approximately as the principle of the early torrent: "distribute, to download from others."</font>  <font color="#000">This is about the same thing, only on Infostart there is a virtual currency, and some measure: what you have shared, you can download so much from other users.</font>  <font color="#000">This was the growth driver, but it divided the community into 2 camps: those who suddenly began to hate Infostart, and those who accepted the new rules of the game.</font>  <font color="#000">Naturally, as history has shown, this was the right decision.</font>  <font color="#000">Now in the Infostart catalog there are more than 30,000 reports and treatments accumulated in one way or another during this time.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">I understand this is not counting the various thematic articles and threads on the forum.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">It's all together.</font>  <font color="#000">In one publication there can be several files, and there are just articles, without files.</font>  <font color="#000">In total, about 30,000 files.</font>  <font color="#000">And all -

a concert hall on Nevsky, 100, which seats 600 people.</font>  <font color="#000">We continued to sell, and literally over a week, we gathered another 150 participants, and then another 150. So, the first conference was gathered in a month and a half.</font>  <font color="#000">This is from idea to implementation.</font>  <font color="#000">That is, one and a half months we pondered the idea, got ready, two weeks later we announced the set and after a month we had 500 people.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">If you translate into business terminology, the payback is very high.</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#222">500 people came from all over Russia, Ukraine, from Kazakhstan, from Kyrgyzstan.</font> <br><br>  <b><font color="#000">That is to say, is it even an international conference?</font></b> <br><br>  <font color="#000">Yes, I even said that at the opening remarks.</font>  <font color="#000">By right, it can be called the first international conference.</font> <font color="#000"><br><br><br></font> <h1>  <font color="#000"><font color="#3b5998">About discontent and haters</font></font> </h1> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">This is an example of some very positive innovations that the community took to cheers, but were there any situations when some innovations had to be canceled due to mass discontent?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Because of mass discontent?</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">That's when the monetization was, when they introduced the virtual currency "startmani", then I realized that the unit of exchange is money invented by humanity.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Nothing more universal has yet been invented, so I invented virtual money inside my world - ‚Äústartmoney‚Äù, and it was the currency with which it was used to estimate how much the file was in demand.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Downloading from you means you can download the same amount from others.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">And then, when the internal structure of the entire catalog broke, then, of course, supporters and opponents appeared.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Most accepted, but some did not want to accept.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font> <blockquote><h4>  <font color="#000"><font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúUNIVERSAL UNIT OF EXCHANGE - MONEY‚Äù</i></font></font> </h4></blockquote> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">Until now, there is a certain division, or did opponents have loyalty?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">I was worried about this, but then I read the words of Guy Kawasaki - this is the evangelist and ideologue of Apple.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">He said that the world should be polarized, otherwise there will be no product, it‚Äôs okay that there are those who do not like this product, because on the opposite side there are those who love.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">And those who love your product, they will love even more, because there are haters.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font> <blockquote><h4>  <font color="#000"><font color="#7891a5"><i>"POLARIZATION OF THE WORLD - BUSINESS PROBLEM OF ANY BRAND"</i></font></font> </h4></blockquote> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">In fact, without one, there would be no second.</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Yes, therefore the polarization of the world is, one can say, the business task of any brand.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">I once read one message on the forum: ‚ÄúI used to visit InfoStart every day, talked on the forum, and now just to find something for work.‚Äù</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">So he wrote to me in a reproach.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">And in fact, this is the best praise, because I created such a resource, which is necessary for it to work.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">In order to chat and read jokes, there are lots of other sites.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">But if the site is needed for work, you will use this service.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">That is, I created some value that will be used regardless of my attitude.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br><br></font> <h1>  <font color="#000"><font color="#3b5998">About the "blue oceans"</font></font> </h1> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">I can't disagree here, because one of my colleagues recently asked me, having my nickname and account, just to download some file for him, that is, a trifle, it would seem, but probably nice.</font></b></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">In general, you, as the founder, have already passed the ten-year line of your ‚Äúchild‚Äù ...</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">... I want to note that not 10 years, but 8 more, because the official opening was in 2006.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">In 2004, the company was registered as a legal entity, so I still consider 2006th the date of birth of the site as a community.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">After 2 years there will be 10 years for the community, and we will probably be celebrating big this event.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">But it is too early to say, we must live.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">Well, imagine that you are celebrating a decade and a young start-up startup asks you a question: ‚ÄúIs it difficult to create such a site or a startup like Infostart.ru?‚Äù What would you say to him?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">This is a difficult question, of course, now there are other budgets.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">The only thing I can advise novice startups to look for the blue ocean again.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Absolutely new niches that are not occupied by anyone.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">We are also not lagging behind, for example, we launched this series of video podcasts, take an example from us.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font> <blockquote><h4>  <font color="#000"><font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúLOOK FOR YOUR BLUE OCEAN‚Äù</i></font></font> </h4></blockquote> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">On the question of the blue ocean: I remember that for a long time the Beta logo was hanging on the site, now it is not there.</font></b></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">Can we say that the site has reached its apogee?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Well, the Beta badge is such a trendy thing.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">There was an ideology that we never stand still, develop and never become a complete product, and always have a Beta version.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">It came from America.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">It is, rather, the ideology of the programmer.</font></b></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">I remember, when I was a programmer, I always had the feeling that there is something that can be changed and improved in my product.</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Yes, any software product can be called Beta.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">The site is also a kind of software product, we also created it, it was also in Beta state.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">A fashion has passed - we have removed this badge, but still we continue to constantly evolve, do not stand still.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Almost every week we release a new feature to improve the functionality, the type of site, recently, for example, we made a mobile video section.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">I just recently launched not just a newsletter, but a blog where I‚Äôll share the news.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br><br></font> <h1>  <font color="#000"><font color="#3b5998">About personal blog</font></font> </h1> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">So this is a kind of personal blog?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">I write something all the time: either articles on the site, then posts on social networks, then I talk about innovations in newsletters.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">But all this is rather fragmented, and I thought that I need to create one channel through which I will communicate with my users.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Well, and since I am the first person of the company, I will personally, on my own behalf, tell everyone about what appeared new and on my own behalf to write the details: why it was done, how it was done, why.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br><br></font> <h1>  <font color="#000"><font color="#3b5998">About thanks</font></font> </h1> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">And, perhaps, perhaps, the last question for today - can you remember two or three moments when someone told you words of gratitude - precisely thanks - for creating Infostart?</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">In general, you rarely hear gratitude, but ... No, why?</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Was.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Infostart actually changed quite a few destinies, because at one of the last conferences my colleague approached me and thanked him warmly, saying that thanks to Infostart he developed, found a niche for his commercial product, left the company, engaged in selling his commercial product, He created his own company, hired employees already and now came to our conference to learn how to manage them.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">That is, in fact - he found his blue ocean.</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">In principle, any commercial development that exists on Infostarta is a small niche, many small niches in which the authors of these solutions find their realization.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Again - any software product can be improved, because there is no limit to perfection.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">For example, on the site there is such a product, called the "Alcohol Declaration", taking into account all changes in the legislation with alcohol.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">The author released this product one of the first and very successfully occupied this niche.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">And really: it is almost a large software package that solves all the problems associated with the alcohol declaration: unloading, loading, reporting, automatic updating, etc.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Just need to find this niche.</font></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">Each development on the site is a small startup.</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font> <blockquote><h4>  <font color="#000"><font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúEACH DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE IS A SMALL STARTUP‚Äù</i></font></font> </h4></blockquote> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">Today the guest of the studio was Dorji Tsydenov - the founder of the company ‚ÄúInfostart‚Äù.</font></b></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">With you there was a program "Ready-made solutions" and I, Sergey Gorshenin.</font></b></font>  <font color="#000"><b><font color="#000">The end of the procedure.</font></b></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#e9f3f7">______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</font></font> <font color="#000"><font color="#e9f3f7"><br></font> <br></font>  <font color="#000"><font color="#000">You can watch and listen to us here:</font></font> <font color="#000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjuwXCXPZbTcQe4cLd_4CsA">youtube</a></font> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/peredaca-gotovye-resenia/id961615837%3Fmt%3D2">itunes</a></font> <font color="#000"><br></font>  <font color="#000"><a href="http://gsoft.podfm.ru/ReadySolution/">podfm</a></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289584/</a></p>
