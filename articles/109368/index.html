      <b>"Online"</b> <br>  Just keep all acca online, periodically updating the activity. <br><br>  <b>"Entry"</b> <br>  I didn‚Äôt see a more adequate name for this software, and the word  joyner ‚Äôis already taken by a completely different software, so I‚Äôll call it an auto-inlet.  The essence of the software is to process the list of accounts, each of the akk to join a given group, or for example to follow someone on Twitter. <br>  This is used not only to increase the number of people in a group at the expense of bots, but also because of necessity.  For example, on Odnoklassniki a bot cannot invite to the group in which it is not a member, therefore, the herd of bots before inviting to the group must first be driven into it. <br><br>  <b>Reggaers</b> <br>  The task of the software is simple - registration of accounts on any service. <br>  These can be VK profiles, emails on mail.ru, redirects to sites.google.com, etc. <br>  Often completed with "activator" - if the account requires activation by email. <br>  In the course of work, the regger drops e-mails for which accounts are registered in a separate file, and the activator goes over the list of e-mails, opening the link from the letter and activating it. <br>  Also, proxies are used for the whole process, but they are almost never needed for activation. <br><br>  <b>"Spammers"</b> <br>  This category I think in the comments does not need. <br><br>  <b>"Gulyalki"</b> <br>  Often combined with spammers, because  just to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù around users and stay with their friends, it‚Äôs enough to disable sending them a private message. <br>  We collect people from online lists or by criteria, then we review in a cycle. <br>  Occasionally, delays between views are applied. <br><br>  <b>"Grabbers"</b> <br>  Very blurry type of software, you can grab anything from anywhere. <br>  In my understanding, this is more often the grabbers of users from the site - from online or by criteria, not the essence, the main thing is that the collected id are saved to a file. <br>  The assembled base can then be used for anything, for example, for an inviter, spammer, or walker. <br><br>  <b>Parsers</b> <br>  Collect content.  It is used in black seo, but I have always been far from this. <br><br>  <b>"Inviters"</b> <br>  Inviting users to the group. <br>  Users can be collected from online, by criteria, from friends of acca, from friends of friends of acca, from those who visited his profile, and so on, depending on the functionality of the site. <br><br>  <b>"Appraisers"</b> <br>  Small category, containing a twist rating ratings photos and the like. <br><br>  <b>"Autoresponders"</b> <br>  My favorite type of software. <br>  He sits on the site, periodically walking around the users to attract attention, and then responds to incoming phrases from the file. <br>  Here you can simulate artificial intelligence - to sort incoming regular ones, answer specific keywords with a random phrase from the corresponding file, keep the conversation up to N answers, and then discard the user to ignore. <br><br>  <b>"Fillers / customizers / customizers"</b> <br>  It is a lot of names, an essence one - filling of the questionnaire of the user. <br>  Fill a photo, album, fill in personal data, etc. <br><br>  Last year, the notion of ‚ÄúCombine‚Äù, which is now popular, appeared on the scene - it means just a system of several scripts of different types connected to each other. <br><br>  <b>Here is how the average combine works:</b> <br>  All scripts have a common interface for launching, a configuration editor, a file editor - files for them are also all common. <br><br>  old banner: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5c/59/5c591e98e17c7c821e6e5be00da44478.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First of all, the email registration script is launched - it registers the specified number of emails on any mail service and adds it to _emails.txt.  After it, provided that in _emails.txt there is data in the LOGIN: PASSWORD format, the regger of accounts is launched, which reggaees fresh emails to the e-mails, for example VK.  Used emails are thrown off in _emails_used.txt <br>  After the regger, it is the turn of the activator, which downloads _emails_used.txt, enters every mailbox, searches for a letter with a link to activate the account and, if it is found, activates. <br>  Next, the filler queue - we fill accounts with information and photos, we get a full-fledged bot at the output. <br><br>  And after all this, you can run one of the options: <br>  1 spammer of private messages / on the wall / photo evaluator, etc. <br>  2 online <br>  3 simple walker <br>  4 answering machine <br><br>  This, the last module and brings unique / sms / traffic to where they are needed. <br>  Naturally, the same emails can be purchased on the service, accounts can also be bought and each module is launched separately, working with the data loaded into it. <br><br>  - <a href="">screenshot of the most ancient combine loveplanet.ru</a> <br>  - <a href="">in disrepair</a> <br><br>  **** <br><br>  Actually, these are the basic tools of anyone who makes money on faceless users of social networks. <br>  There is information about more exotic products: <br><br>  <b>- FTP Injecter</b> <br>  works with a list of FTP accounts <br>  comes on acc, scans the directory, looking for subdomains and sites <br>  determines the type of site - if there is Joomla, WordPress and etc. - it will simply inject all the themes <br>  if the site is unidentified, the script looks for signs of the site's footer in files and adds an inject there. <br><br>  Inject - often either a hidden iframe, or just a set of links to increase the TIC. <br><br>  <b>- WAP software</b> <br>  The software is basically the same as for a regular web, but its structure is much simpler and aimed at a wap audience. <br>  Usually consists of a regger and a spammer.  They work with wap much less often than with the web, but this is a pro, and shkolota wap does not spam. <br><br>  <b>- Web email spammers</b> <br>  Spammed through email services through the web interface. <br>  Either by a given list of emails, or by contact list of the account itself. <br><br>  In the next chapter, I think to conduct an educational program on earnings with the help of sms on examples of simple affiliate programs and the corresponding use of the software described above. <br>  Write in the comments about what you would like to know more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109368/</a></p>
