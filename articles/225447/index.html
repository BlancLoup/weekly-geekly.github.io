  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We feel iOS 8 beta</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What does a student do after graduation?  Life suddenly becomes boring, measured and not so interesting.  To add some thrill, I decided to put the beta version of Ayios 8 announced on my iPad a few days ago. <br><br>  Before installing a new version of the operating system, it is recommended to first make a backup of the old one using iTunes.  Then, in which case, it will be possible to deploy this copy on the tablet.  It's just not possible to roll back from the eighth version back to the seventh.  To install Ayos 8, you need to download its image from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">the developer portal</a> , where in the tab ‚ÄúiOS 8 beta‚Äù there is a huge amount of them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/482/359/a90482359f88d1a276330bacc01a33d6.png">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After downloading the image, you need to open it using iTunes (Cmd + Click or Ctrl + Click on Windows by clicking the "Update" button), and the update will start on its own.  The process itself takes about 15-20 minutes - after which your tablet is ready to go. <br><br>  <font color="red">Caution: under the cut a lot of pictures.</font> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After that, your iPad asks you to enter a password (if it has been set), and then happily reports readiness: <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1d/f1d/69c/f1df1d69c855b999718bb05ee548a4db.jpg" width="390"></a> </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/0f1/9f6/9830f19f6cf8c849086b827e10c3eeae.jpg" width="390"></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Then my tablet tried to activate, but it failed to do this (while it was connected to the Wi-Fi and to iTunes on the computer). <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fed/ecd/baf/fedecdbaff78baedf898883da9f305f9.jpg" width="390"></a> </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f12/d32/b31/f12d32b31f18b9983c0caa33dff6670e.jpg" width="390"></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Retrying nothing, and I decided to leave the activation alone.  It seems that everything worked without it: <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/562/3a3/c04/5623a3c04e84fac5487712a8af9f9b7b.jpg" height="370"></a> </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f27/d08/5d8/f27d085d82d2981ad6b61ce1e660016b.jpg" height="370"></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Now you can do an active study of the presented novelties.  The appearance of the main screen with applications has not changed.  But rather strongly modified the notification area and the Today window (by the way, the new OS X received almost the same window): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d5/44a/29e/1d544a29ea3b9fb011be341122c21431.jpg" height="400"></a> <br><br>  When you click on the "Edit" button, a settings window appears where you can specify which parts should include the "Today" screen.  At WWDC on June 2, we were told that now third-party developers will be able to add their widgets to this screen.  Widgets from the screen can be removed (and then, if desired, returned), and also swapped.  Only ‚ÄúReview for today‚Äù and ‚ÄúReview for tomorrow‚Äù are fixed. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f8/ece/0a4/3f8ece0a4179f53457433f1ae6f6c275.jpg" height="400"></a> <br><br>  If you used the seventh version of Ios, you know that there were three screens: ‚ÄúToday‚Äù, ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù and ‚ÄúMissed‚Äù.  I honestly did not fully understand why they divided the last two, and it seems that Apple also realized this now.  From now on there is only one unified ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù screen, in the beta version it additionally contains a button for sending bug reports: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e30/3f4/e77/e303f4e777aebbc13a6b09c7a9df32bb.jpg" height="400"></a> <br><br>  To send a bug report, you need to log in using your Apple ID, agree to the conditions and fill in a few standard fields (to which component the bug belongs, how often it plays and what is wrong): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb3/ef8/494/cb3ef849478ea2a5a5b49681d93a6768.jpg" height="370"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d43/4f0/e0b/d434f0e0b81f509024bb037b563f2133.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  True, I did not manage to send any of the bugs.  The first time I couldn‚Äôt attach a screenshot ‚Äî orientation somehow slyly went, and the second bug wasn‚Äôt able to go over the network, although everything was fine with the connection. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/ed4/cb5/bd9ed4cb5d092dfe5ef9034ac842a162.jpg" height="370"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/5cb/4cf/08f5cb4cfe7ec2a4313f7e6340670698.jpg" height="370"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/47f/84d/52b47f84dc8535dbe87b946c2ad7080d.jpg" height="370"></a> <br></div></div><br><br>  The next update is a new spotlight search.  Now he can search almost the entire contents of the tablet.  To previous searches for applications, notes and mail, a search was added in the AppStore, in Google and Wikipedia, in music and on the map. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/8a7/fd1/68b8a7fd19753054aae42f6afab50267.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  Unfortunately, one of the Ayos' bugs appeared here, and the keyboard didn‚Äôt appear in Spotlight :-(. Even these few pixels of the keyboard are not visible in the vertical orientation. By the way, the orientation problem once again showed up - the pop-up window clearly counted on the vertical one. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d10/6b2/6ca/d106b26caa47d588b2491eeee8abe820.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  The application switching screen has also changed.  On top of it appeared the icons of recently used contacts.  When you click on a button, options appear: write a message to him, call FaceTime by voice or using video. <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ef/59e/794/6ef59e79439bbb563534d007da44a903.jpg" height="300"></a> </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a6/a7d/e7f/6a6a7de7f6281a1e18914aafe2027819.jpg" height="300"></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The settings have changed slightly: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/104/c6d/a77/104c6da7744e4eed2faecf89ea828fdf.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  Now in them, including you can set up family access (Family Sharing) and add up to six devices of your family there.  This will allow you to share purchased music, movies, books and applications, share photos from your photo stream, show all members of the family where you are now, have a shared family calendar, and also find the missing devices of someone from your family.  Children who are under the age of 18 can use their parents' credit card to pay for their purchases in the AppStore only with the permission of the parents, that is, each purchase will need to be approved by someone from the device. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99a/924/909/99a924909498243c34fad087e218e986.png" height="370"></a> <br><br>  <s>Also in the settings you can now see the consumption of mobile traffic by each of the applications, and even prohibit some applications from using mobile Internet.</s> <s><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/791/da0/e58/791da0e58be7bd97286714ae8382fa2b.jpg" height="370"></a></s> <br>  <b>UPD</b> : in the comments suggested that it was in the seventh version. <br><br>  For the Russian keyboard for different characters and signs added a ruble sign: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/263/7fa/23b/2637fa23b2c49571d2a149ce2e4504b6.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  Of the small changes in the keyboard, you can note the color scheme.  For example, they changed the color of the pressed shift (and in the Russian keyboard it remained the same, but in the English it has already changed). <br><br>  The main screen of the blocked iPad is now equipped with a new ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù button.  Although, perhaps, it appeared not in the eighth version, but in 7.1, here I can not be sure. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/000/681/cb6000681d1e427bfabf2735e476556f.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  Strongly (as in the new OS X) Safari has also been updated.  If you often have many tabs open, now you can see tabs ‚Äústacked‚Äù on top of each other around the edges: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a88/775/f58/a88775f58b2dabf867fc31782c60d7b8.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  Find the desired tab will help a special screen, which grouped all of them on the sites: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c07/604/cca/c07604ccae89f33da5a6f703407c7f16.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  The top panel when scrolling down now disappears from the screen, and appears only when scrolling up: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0df/83e/c91/0df83ec91130ec76ce9a6c572681fd9e.png" height="370"></a> <br><br>  From trifles: in the pop-up menu, items are now located next to each other, if possible, and not one above the other: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/503/2a7/07c/5032a707c4e7bb9c408eec03ed24cf83.jpg" height="370"></a> <br><br>  The camera learned how to make a time-lapse video (not to be confused with the Slo mo mode).  In this mode, it takes about one frame in three seconds, and then sticks them all together in a video.  An example of such a video: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNFC7hdK3o4&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhc50xr8FX_IQVt-Lrx483T8T_ymQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <font color="gray">For information about the new mode, thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/heroino/" class="user_link">heroino</a></font> . <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> from heroino <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/heroino/" class="user_link">user</a> : <br>  In the notes added the ability to insert photos from the photo stream.  This is how it works: <br><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/522/41f/8ee/52241f8ee5d8423eaeb157e9036f1744.jpg" height="300"></a> </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64c/678/e91/64c678e91ae7433cac87f6ba35f88d20.jpg" height="300"></a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h5>  Brief summary </h5><br>  It‚Äôs not possible to feel all the changes in the new version of Iios.  Some of them require new OS X (for example, transferring calls and unfinished letters between devices), for a part - the activity of third-party developers (for example, new keyboards, their own widgets on the Today screen, something with HealthKit), for part - several devices with the new Iios (for example, for Family Sharing). <br><br>  So far, only a little updated interface capabilities have been evaluated.  Everywhere it is noticeable that this is a beta version.  Controls are going everywhere, applications are crashing regularly, some animations are gone.  If your tablet or phone is important for you to work, do not upgrade until the eighth version. <br><br>  It is also noticeable that the new version of Iios is developed primarily by looking at the phones, and only then rework solutions on tablets.  Probably, this is generally correct (why immediately sprayed on all types of devices), but from this the appearance of the new version on Aipad looks even more unfinished. <br><br>  If you have any questions - write in the comments, I can still do something with my tablet and post new screenshots. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225447/</a></p>
