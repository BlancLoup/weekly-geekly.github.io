    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For many years we have fought, with varying success, about different ‚Äúprojects‚Äù.  The projects were often brilliant, often practical, something worked out, but something fell out in the form of recorded losses.  And somehow, unexpectedly, it was understood that we are not doing everything right, instead of dabbing through the closed gate with our idea and literally making our way from scratch, maybe you just need to take people and give them an idea? <br><br>  On the Internet there are thousands of sites with traffic that waste their potential and do not use the available opportunities.  What if you do not start from scratch, but to buy an already popular site that can be improved, improved and another word tired of mouth is to monetize?  We have not tried it yet, it means it's time.  The most difficult thing is to find a suitable site, or rather even just find a site that has a lot of traffic, but a financial and ideological aspect is lame.  How long is it short, but absolutely by chance we found a certain whoer.net.  This is the site for checking your IP address, the site was visited daily, at that time about 100 thousand unique people and about 2.7 million per month.  According to the owners, the site brings them 2-3 thousand dollars a month.  Klondike! <br><br>  For a relatively small amount of money, we buy a resource, the topic is not close to us and what to do with it is not clear at all.  It is clear that millions of people want all the same, only better, and they also want to buy something, but still do not know what.  Attentive analysis shows that the simplest and most popular is the VPN connection sale service.  Trite judging by their advertisers.  And we are in it, even on the head of the chesh, for many years of b2b-oriented projects, advertising, and then pure b2c is in an unfamiliar role.  But you can not miss this.  We have a smart situation when there are people, but there is no idea, it means you have to give it to them. <br><br>  In general, what is the problem of many sites, that they provide a certain service or sell something, but spend very little on branding.  In the West, it is much better cut, if possible and ideally, each service and product should cause a bright associative array.  Well, as a hamburger is McDonald's, sneakers are Nike or Adidas, and inexpensive furniture is Ikea.  Well, these are the ideal extremes, but if a couple of hundred people say that the <a href="https://whoer.net/">VPN is whoer.net</a> , then the idea was a success.  But here's a bad luck, the domain is frankly not harmonious for the Russian language, but for English it‚Äôs like trouble, they changed one letter and it‚Äôs already a curse.  Not too funny for the image ... The biggest doubts were about this.  On the other hand, there is no bad PR, but what if you give this flaw a cute look?  Well, it seems easy to remember, and for example, Dr. Huer will make you anonymous?  Sketched with the illustrator layout, tried on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de9/b05/1e7/de9b051e75964445bcd8580ce4d15cf5.jpg" alt="Doctor whoer"><br><br>  A simple survey among the target group showed that the doctor as a whole and in general usually causes a negative associative array, and even more so with that name ... But all that is ingenious is simple, I don‚Äôt remember how this idea was born, but it was born light and bright.  And what to wrap it in some kind of sweet creature, well, that would be sweet to all.  Seals, squirrels?  No, trite and sad, kangaroo!  And what have the kangaroo to do with it ?? .. And then it was accidentally born, a fox!  Everyone likes the fox, the Russian, the redhead, but the eared fox Phoenix, this is generally excellent!  Awesome and cute, infinitely funny and moderately ridiculous animal!  Like the domain itself.  Well, as in that film Pelevin, all the best - on Huer! <br><br>  If you got a controversial domain with a project, then you need to wrap it into something human, close and pleasant to the hearts of the millions who go there, to everyone as one.  And this is what came out of it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c4/c84/ca3/5c4c84ca3b31465181abfc213d8f971e.jpg" alt="Mr. Whoer"><br><br>  The most important thing is when you buy someone else's project and start modifying it, not to kill its original idea and the reason for which people visit it.  This is the most difficult and unpleasant, on the one hand, I want to do everything in my own way, on the other - just put the Buy button on the floor of the screen.  Our task is not just to start earning and repelling the investment, but also to make the project better.  Therefore, it turns out that the most important thing, when buying something alien, is not to make something completely out of it.  Millions of people are not mistaken if they are there, which means that we should give them everything that is, only better and more. <br><br>  Therefore, our first improvement of the old site, even at the time of work on the new site, logo and other things, was the addition of verification on WebRTC.  Verification is carried out through the browser's built-in API (PeerConnection) for working with WebRTC. <br>  A request is made to obtain available addresses, and then their location data is requested for this list of addresses. <br><br>  In fact, even then, the technology itself was at least a couple of years old, but for the most part, such checks were not used for some reason.  And then there was an effect, as from the explosion of a nuclear charge of low power.  The Internet was flooded with topics and questions in 6 languages, but most of all in Russian, the essence of which was as follows: I use a VPN, why they know my real IP!  What should I do?!  It was definitely a small but brilliant success, which instilled in us the confidence that we are doing everything correctly. <br><br>  Be anonymous!  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391283/</a></p>
