Project shot. <br><br>  Below, I want to share a couple of thoughts about how I promoted a resource in RuNet and how I tried (in some places well) to recoup the flow of visitors.  So let's go. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/sillysunnybear/pic/000ae82h"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c00/3f0/a30/c003f0a308aa54e6a664131cd99ca573.png" width="450" height="69" alt="Web Optimizator statistics"></a>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Articles and Publications </h2><br><br>  The very first thing that gave me an exponential growth of the visit and almost collapsed the server, was, of course, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/client_side_optimization/35245.html" rel="nofollow">an article on Habr√©</a> .  For two days, 5000 people went in, about 500 sites were checked.  They joined the active core of users who were able to share their thoughts and transform the project to the current state.  It was here that I found support in almost all forms.  The collective blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/client_side_optimization/" rel="nofollow">Client Optimization</a> , however, takes place in the second hundred in the ranking, but daily results in the order of hundreds of users on <a href="http://webo.in/">webo.in.</a> <br><br>  A good return from other visited target resources was also noticed: <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/" rel="nofollow">forum.searchengines.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/" rel="nofollow">www.free-lance.ru</a> , etc. <br><br>  I tried to make the target community on <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club2471782" rel="nofollow">the contact</a> , however, probably there is much less (in percentage) target audience.  Without much spam and promotion from this resource goes about 50 people per month.  Actually, here is the first thought: <strong>study your target audience</strong> , find out which sites it visits, and advertise on them.  Non-targeted advertising only takes time (s) whether money and effort. <br><br><h2>  Viral spread </h2><br><br>  The glory of viral advertising did not give me rest on many nights (just kidding :).  A total of two forms of verification (in HTML and Flash) and a puzomerka in the form of a small 88x31 button were released for distribution to the people.  In general, the penetration into the masses occurred, however, due to a small audience, a self-sustaining chain reaction is not observed. <br><br> <a href="http://webo.in/urls/webo.in/"><img src="http://i.webo.in/urls/webo.in.png" alt="webo.in optimization"></a> <br><br>  Maybe these conclusions are premature, but I got the feeling that <strong>viral advertising only works for a large audience</strong> . <br><br><h2>  Open API </h2><br><br>  Another step to integrate with arbitrary services was the discovery of output results in XML format, which made it possible to configure a sufficiently large range of applications based on it.  So far the only exhaust has been a preliminary agreement on the inclusion of analysis results in the admin panel of one of our CMS (one of the top three).  I hope I can tell you more in a couple of months. <br><br><h2>  SEO tricks </h2><br><br>  The main steps to increase search engine traffic were (except for placing the checked sites in the URL headers) creating a sitemap (special XML files containing a list of all the URLs that search engines should see on your site) and creating a directory of trusted sites available to search engines. . <br><br>  As a result of these steps, the search traffic increased about one and a half times (now about 7000 visitors per month), however, about a third of it is not entirely ‚Äútargeted‚Äù: users type the URL of the site, and a link to the results of its check appears in the output using Web Optimizator. <br><br>  I do not mention the semantic layout as the basis of the project: it also played its role, allowing indexing more and better, however, it was from the very beginning for <a href="http://webo.in/">webo.in.</a> <br><br><h2>  Context is our all </h2><br><br>  Banner advertising is effective only for highly visited projects; for small blogs, targeted placement of advertising banners or placement of links and context will be rational (pop-up windows are evil, not a single self-respecting resource will place them, although they give the best return).  Until recently, the main stream of visitors to the Web Optimizator came exactly as a blog (articles), therefore contextual advertising was chosen as the main source of income. <br><br>  Now about the numbers.  With a flow of about 1000 visitors per day, it was possible to collect about 1000 rubles per month, which was enough for a dedicated virtual machine.  In this regard, the project is fully self-sufficient.  Placing links at the end of the second month also reached about 700‚Äì1000 rubles a month (not only on the main page, but also on secondary pages), which allowed spending a portion of the income ‚Äúfor beer‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  SaaS - another profanation? </h2><br><br>  The attempt to introduce any paid services was not crowned with special success (now all the features of Web Optimizator are completely open for use).  I didn‚Äôt want to activate the payment via SMS: too many intermediaries leave.  Users operate with electronic currency not so actively, for 4 months about 250 rubles were transferred by different people. <br><br>  I do not want to conclude that SaaS (Software as a Service) does not work in this case.  Just did not have the heart to connect it fully and actively promote it to users ( <a href="http://linguamania.ru/" rel="nofollow">linguamania.ru</a> could!). <br><br><h2>  What's new? </h2><br><br>  Now literally a couple of words about the new features: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://webo.in/my/action/packet/" rel="nofollow">Batch optimization appeared</a> : images are converted to PNG format, jpegtran and pngcrush are applied, CSS / JS files are minimized using YUI Compressor and archived. </li><li>  Launched the English version of the project: <a href="http://webo.name/">webo.name</a> </li><li>  Added button-indicator of site optimization: <a href="http://webo.in/urls/webo.in/"><img src="http://i.webo.in/urls/webo.in.png" alt="webo.in optimization"></a> </li><li>  The <a href="http://webo.in/my/widgets/api/" rel="nofollow">XML format of the</a> site verification results is open. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Happy end </h2><br><br>  Yes, the most important thing: under a partnership agreement, the project is completely transferred to a separate server, and all advertising has been removed from it.  The server architecture has been slightly updated (nginx as a reverse proxy and other buns, I will post the configs soon).  In general, while this story has a happy ending. <br><br>  If someone has a desire to transfer money, then <a href="http://webo.in/my/support/donate/" rel="nofollow">all coordinates are listed here</a> . <br><br>  And, of course, many thanks to all those people who write suggestions, comments and complaints on the project.  Without them, nothing would have happened :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29074/</a></p>
