  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acer S275 Mini Monitor Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The most important thing when choosing a monitor is to have a suit sitting. <br>  No matter how much you buy monitors, he ultimately chose with his eyes.  Therefore, the first thing you should pay attention to is how the monitor looks.  After all, the monitor is always in sight.  The design of monitors is an unfairly missed credo of some manufacturers.  But the hero of the review - he is so stylish. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/307/105/c17/307105c17f3ea1d0c359be81053a543b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Screen Size: 27 " <br>  Screen Resolution: 1920 √ó 1080 <br>  Screen Ratio: 16: 9 <br>  Matrix type: IPS (manufactured by LG) <br>  Dynamic contrast ratio: 100000000: 1 <br>  Screen brightness: 250 cd / m2 <br>  Response time: 6 ms <br>  Viewing angles (for CR&gt; 10): 178 ¬∞ horizontal, 178 ¬∞ vertical <br>  Pixel pitch: 0.311 √ó 0.311 mm <br>  Screen tilt: -1 ¬∞ / + 15 ¬∞ <br>  Ports: 2 HDMI, 1 D-Sub, 1 3.5 mm jack <br>  Built-in speakers: 2 √ó 1.5 W <br>  Power supply type: external <br>  Dimensions with stand (WxHxD): 622 √ó 450 √ó 142 mm <br>  Warranty: 36 months. <br><br>  Yes, first of all - stylish.  And then everything else. <br>  Black glossy plastic, only sharp corners, chopped forms.  The designer took and drew his monitor on the line.  And it turned out very tricky.  The stand is asymmetrical, thanks to which the bulkiness of the 27 inch display is not felt.  It looks like a 20-22 inch. <br>  As it usually happens with designers, they disagree with technologists.  Design business - small.  Drew and all.  And the technologist must shove the components so that it still works, but does not break during operation.  However, here the designer and technologist apparently worked in the neighboring premises and listened to one another.  It turned out that the monitor is stylish, while comfortable. <br>  The delivery package is very simple.  The monitor itself, stand, D-Sub cable, external power supply, audio cable (jack-jack), brochures and manuals - everything. <br>  The power supply is a classic notebook. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa8/fb6/191/aa8fb6191b48552caf61b903d7984739.jpg"><br>  For the gloss, there is not enough rags, well, I would like at least one digital cable. <br>  However, the monitor has digital only HDMI ports.  On the one hand, this is bad, your DVI-D cable will have to be connected via an adapter, and on the other hand, there are two HDMI ports, so your periphery (smartphone, tablet) can be connected with a standard, short wire.  All ports are on the stand (in the leg).  Also located there is a Kensington lock. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d79/ea8/44f/d79ea844f5aac512718dc1f73cf15e13.jpg"><br>  In addition to connectors, on the stand are also control keys.  Fortunately, they are mechanical.  Also, on the stand, there is a work indicator (blue). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4da/1fa/d3e/4da1fad3ec368f353d4649f4a4aec955.jpg"><br>  When connecting all the wires comes out very carefully - everything remains at the level of the table, nothing hangs down from the display. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/857/911/dc5/857911dc56f34986a9b996508e5e08cc.jpg"><br>  The display itself is FullHD IPS matrix, glossy protective plastic.  Again, dual impressions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d2/1d7/40a/8d21d740a1ffa6d29bd74521b8ef4293.jpg"><br>  Gloss is the enemy of office work.  Everything is reflected, eyes get tired.  To somehow help yourself - you need to unscrew the brightness to the full, which means that the eyes will tire even more.  But if you use the monitor at home, or just in a not very lighted place, then all its potential is revealed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b7/dec/b98/6b7decb986dce1d05bd299a7a271a254.jpg"><br>  Very good color rendition, excellent (even outrageous) brightness, well, good response time (6 ms).  Yes, as usual - maximum viewing angles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5c/182/79c/c5c18279cab14dedc5676583a5ab934c.jpg"><br>  Resolution - FullHD 1920 * 1080 pixels.  Yes that's right.  FullHD resolution at 27 inches.  This is the same resolution as on a 42 inch LCD TV, or the same as Sony Xperia Z (and all trend smartphones in 2013). <br>  But this resolution has an indisputable advantage: if your smartphone or laptop has FullHD resolution - you can use the Acer S275 as an external monitor without changing anything.  It is very convenient!  Pixel to pixel. <br>  Thanks to CrystalBrite technology, the color rendition of the monitor is richer and deeper, of course, it‚Äôs a monitor for home and entertainment, but in the office it could adequately perform its main tasks. <br>  Yes, it is still worth talking about sound.  The sound of the monitor speakers is good (for their size).  Here their location played a big role.  Both speakers are separated as much as possible and the conclusions are separated by 180 degrees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/817/902/86c/81790286c1297d175114607a68a1b6dd.jpg"><br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - Low resolution (for a diagonal of 27) <br>  - Lack of DVI connectors <br>  - No VESA mount <br>  - Glossy Matte Coating

      Pros: <br>  + Interesting design <br>  + Excellent color and viewing angles <br>  + Two HDMI inputs <br>  + Good speakers. <br><br>  Summary: I will safely recommend to purchase this monitor to those who need a monitor to connect a laptop, watch movies, games, and in general work.  If you have enough FullHD resolution, you want a beautiful monitor with a good display - then the price of $ 300 for the Acer S275 seems to me very good.  Only one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - in Russia it will be a bit <a href="">more expensive</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166579/</a></p>
