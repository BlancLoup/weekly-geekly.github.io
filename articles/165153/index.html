  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feasibility of using the Raspberry Pi as a NAS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to write this article because  the lack of such an article outweighed my desire to purchase a Raspberry Pi and use it as a NAS.  Below we consider the feasibility of such an application with numbers of copying speeds, and draw conclusions, each with its own. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Preface. </h4><br>  The main purpose of the acquisition of Raspberry Pi was to create a NAS based on it.  At home there is a local network, headed by a TP-LINK <a href="http://www.tp-linkru.com/products/details/%3Fcategoryid%3D241%26model%3DTL-WR741ND">TL-WR741ND router</a> , to which the ACER <a href="http://www.notebook-center.ru/catalog_acer_1312.html">ASPIRE 7520G</a> laptop is permanently connected by cable, the Iconbit <a href="http://www.iconbit.ru/products/players/104404/">XDS73D</a> media player and the SAMSUNG <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/consumer/televisions/televisions/tv-led/UE32C5100QWXRU">UE32C5100QW</a> TV (connected just in case, because the router is under it, but poor network functionality is not used).  Plus, the Sony Ericsson <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/phones/live-with-walkman/">Live with Walkman</a> phone, the SAMSUNG <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/mobile/product/galaxy-tab/GT-P6200ZWAXSP-spec">Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus</a> tablet, the G-Box Dyno <a href="http://dx.com/p/android-4-0-mini-pc-google-tv-player-w-1-5ghz-hdmi-1gb-ram-4gb-rom-white-152641">Android 4.0 Mini PC</a> and the experimental TP-LINK 3G <a href="http://www.tp-linkru.com/products/details/%3Fcategoryid%3D218%26model%3DTL-MR3020">TL-MR3020 router</a> , which has a number of articles devoted to it, are periodically connected via Wi-Fi. <br><br>  All this farm needs network storage to access the necessary files from any device.  At the moment, as a NAS, I have a media player mentioned above, which is also a torrent-rocking chair in combination, but this is a separate topic.  A Western Digital hard disk with a capacity of 500GB, removed from <a href="http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/search/1/a_id/1731">My Passport Essential</a> due to the absence of an e-sata port in it and inserted into the AgeStar <a href="http://age-star.ru/catalog/extbox25/show/68/">SCB2A8</a> container, is connected to the e-sata <a href="http://age-star.ru/catalog/extbox25/show/68/">player</a> .  But I am not satisfied with the speed of this bundle when it is necessary to transfer a large amount of data, it is just anguish.  With the release of the Raspberry Pi, I set about trying to make it a simple network storage with the hope of greater speed than my player allows.  As a result, the soul of the poet could not stand it and the malinka was ordered in one of the domestic online stores at the appropriate price, because I really did not want to wait long.  At the moment I have a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs">Raspberry Pi model ‚ÄúB‚Äù with 512 MB RAM</a> with a SanDisk <a href="http://ru.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/sd/ultra-uhs-1-class10-30mbs/%3Fcapacity%3D8GB">Ultra SDHC UHS-I 8GB card</a> , with a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">Raspbian ‚Äúwheezy‚Äù</a> with a Samba server <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">running</a> on it, which was also configured according to the instructions from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149890/">habr</a> .  As a USB drive, a 160GB hard drive is plugged out of the laptop and inserted into the box from the My Passport Essential.  The disk is connected via USB-HUB which says gembird <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/249307/%3Fhead%3D1">uhb-c345</a> , but not in the manufacturer's catalog.  The USB splitter model was written for a reason, it is not in the <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals">list of working and non-working equipment</a> , it can be useful to someone.  The Malinka was connected to the network mainly via Wi-Fi via the NETGEAR <a href="http://www.netgear.ru/home/products/wireless-adapters/work-and-play/WNA1100.aspx">WNA1100</a> USB adapter, but at the time of the tests it was also connected via LAN.  A visual connection with the raspberry occurs via VNC. <br><br><h4>  The first test is large-scale. </h4><br>  After assembling and setting up this whole farm, I decided to check the speed of work, and at the first copying of the files I was very disappointed, after which I decided to conduct a full-scale test of copying speed in all directions and, after analyzing the result, decide on the expediency of using the raspberry as a network storage device.  A lot of time was killed on the chase data on the main corners of the network, which I determined for myself a laptop, player and, accordingly, Raspberry Pi.  The routes were as follows:

      ‚Ä¢ Laptop-LAN &lt;-&gt; Player <br>  ‚Ä¢ Laptop-Wi-Fi &lt;-&gt; Player <br>  ‚Ä¢ Notebook-LAN &lt;-&gt; Raspberry Pi-LAN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Laptop-Wi-Fi &lt;-&gt; Raspberry Pi-Wi-Fi <br>  ‚Ä¢ Raspberry Pi-LAN &lt;-&gt; Player <br>  ‚Ä¢ Raspberry Pi-Wi-Fi &lt;-&gt; Player <br><br>  Where ‚ÄúLaptop-LAN‚Äù is a laptop connected to a router via LAN, etc.  respectively. <br>  Copying was carried out using Total Commander on a laptop and using Nautilus on a malink. <br><br>  For the test, I used a folder with photos in 276MB with 65 files and a cartoon in mkv format weighing 220MB.  As a result, 56 screenshots were taken, from which the results were later rewritten for the compilation of tablets and graphs.  The result of the work done was the plate, which I was extremely dissatisfied with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ef/216/16e/6ef21616edd3f94de9aa45e9ba0222af.jpg"><br><br>  To understand it is quite difficult, although if you look closely, it becomes clear that the Raspberry Pi in numbers has a very weak result and loses to the media player, but maybe someone can catch useful data from this outrage. <br><br><h4>  The second test is truncated. </h4><br>  Such an incomprehensible picture does not suit me, and I think you, too, so I decided to cut down the test program, leaving only those directions of copying that can actually be used in my network.  They turned out to be much smaller: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Laptop-LAN &lt;-&gt; Player <br>  ‚Ä¢ Notebook-LAN &lt;-&gt; Raspberry Pi-LAN <br>  ‚Ä¢ Laptop-LAN &lt;-&gt; Raspberry Pi-Wi-Fi <br><br>  For the test, the same files were used as in the first test.  As a result, a total of 12 measurements of copying speed were made, and the results were driven into the plate and a more visual diagram was drawn up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2b/aec/935/a2baec935431ee580351e72d5605c8b3.jpg"><br><br>  The result obtained roughly coincides with the first test, but this table more clearly describes the state of affairs with copying over the network from / to Raspberry Pi.  By not tricky mathematical calculations, I found out that when connecting Malinka via LAN, the data copy speed differs from the speed of the solution I had on average from 1.5 to 2.5 times.  And when I connected it via Wi-Fi, as I had originally planned, the difference increased from 3.6 to 4.0 <br><br><h4>  Instead of a conclusion. </h4><br>  For myself, I conclude that for the time being as a NAS I leave my media player and will be thinking about buying a full-fledged home network storage device.  For the price that this idea cost me, the Raspberry Pi + USB-HUB + memory card (not counting the available hardware) is comparable to the Western Digita <a href="http://www.wdc.com/ru/products/products.aspx%3Fid%3D280">My Book Live 1TB</a> , and this is with the hard drive.  At the moment, Malinka is engaged in measuring its own temperature and room temperature, set up according to an article from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163575/">habr</a> , but this is from a cannon on sparrows.  I can still experiment with it, but I don‚Äôt know yet in which direction.  I don‚Äôt see the point of using Raspberry Pi as a NAS at all, especially if I buy it specifically for this purpose.  He himself bought it with good intentions as a lover of all gadgets, but as I usually do, it was played with a new toy and on the table.  I hope this article will be at least something useful to someone and everyone will draw his own conclusions for himself, and I have already drawn my own conclusions and voiced them above. <br><br><h4>  Request to readers. </h4><br>  This is my entrance fee for Habr, so please do not kick much, but constructive criticism is welcomed and appreciated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165153/</a></p>
