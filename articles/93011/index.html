This is our third attempt at writing on Habr√©, if anyone is interested, here is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/69012/">second</a> . <br><br><img src="http://www.ventumnet.ru/static/images/eggs.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In May of this year, our company once again decided to distinguish himself and arrange a crazy action ‚ÄúStrizha Eggs‚Äù, at the end of which one of our subscribers will receive an Apple iPad, Sony PS3 + Sony Bravia 40 '', licensed Windows 7 and a number of incentive prizes for all participants.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Under the cut - goals, implementation, subtotals and various pictures, videos. <br><br><h4>  Goals </h4><br><br>  - increase the number of new connections <br>  - increase the size and number of payments from subscribers in our favor <br>  - provoke the growth of traffic to the Internet <br>  - have fun, preferably paying back the share. <br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br><br>  In the beginning, in about two weeks, there was a loud announcement using all the communication channels with subscribers: news on the site, message on the forum, a blog post on behalf of the administration, tweet on corporate twitter, greeting on the PBX and SMS sending. <br><br>  The announcement has grown into more or less final <a href="http://www.ventumnet.ru/eggs">conditions of the action</a> .  Here are some of the conditions for "making eggs": <br><br>  - You can buy eggs for N rubles from statistics (from your account) = N points at the rate of 1k1 (cheaper at night!) <br>  - For each new subscriber brought - 1000 eggs <br>  - When paying for 500 rubles - automatically get 300 eggs. <br>  - And when you pay 1000 rubles - automatically as many as 700 eggs. <br>  - If you had a traffic write-off + 10 eggs <br>  - If you didn‚Äôt have a traffic drop of -10 eggs <br>  - Do you have a negative balance today?  -20 eggs <br>  - Positive balance today +20 eggs <br>  - Who has downloaded more than 30 eggs today? <br>  - Who paid the most for today +50 eggs <br>  - Fully filled out profile (subscriber card) with telephones and email + 100 eggs (write to adm@ventumnet.ru) <br>  - You can donate eggs, enter the login in the statistics, payment by cash (from the account) or by your eggs. <br>  - On leaflets there is a unique number that can be activated by connecting + 1000 eggs (valid only for new subscribers connected in May) <br>  - Blog post = 100 eggs <br>  - Call at 4 am (+ -10 minutes) to our number (495) 679-86-49, from the determined phone number that matches the records in our database = 1 egg. <br>  - Order pizza employees in the office (with payment at your expense) +400 eggs! <br>  - Win in tekken 6 from the office staff = 500 eggs. <br><br>  As you can see, all conditions meet our goals: <br><br>  1) new subscribers are attracted by the conditions ‚Äúwhen connecting from other operators, we transfer your balance to us‚Äù, as well as the opportunity to immediately earn 1,000 eggs. <br>  2) those who lead them are also pleased with the opportunity to earn 1000 eggs. <br>  3) there is always the opportunity to buy eggs for cash, or to persuade friends to transfer them to you, promising to share the prize, thus catching up with the rest. <br>  4) you can do nothing, pay as you pay, swing as you rock and still win. <br>  5) a lot of funny moments, from the series win in tekken 6 or call us on the phone at night. <br><br>  All conditions were implemented in our billing, in the personal statistics of the subscriber, and for the most part automated.  Website was launched <img src="http://www.ventumnet.ru/static/images/egg_icon.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://top.ventumnet.ru/">top.ventumnet.ru</a> where subscribers could watch all the eggs they earned and the transparent history of their receipt. <br><br>  All this was accompanied by abundant posts on our <a href="http://twitter.com/ventumnet">Twitter</a> , and photos of prizes as they were purchased also became <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/ventumnet">available</a> , thereby increasing the credibility of our campaign. <br><br>  We also tried for the first time ‚Äúheavy‚Äù offline advertising in the form of placing videos on LED panels - one of them, at the entrance to Krasnogorsk, at the BP filling station, in a place with fierce traffic jams, now shows this video (ventum password)! <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/11455649&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-gR4IZCaqW-BJd8DHcXkZi6obGg" width="394" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Ventum Halo Girl Adv" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We had to redo it 3 times to allow censorship.  We also managed to stay in the ski complex Snowball.  There is another advertisement, but here I suggest that you go and see for yourself :) Direct traffic to the site has already doubled, applications for connection have come down. <br><br><h4>  Subtotals </h4><br><br>  In general, of course, it is still too early to judge the results, but about 10% of subscribers joined the game from the very first week, many build birdhouses, someone came to play in the office, someone tries to build a coalition by teaming up with friends, in general , fun and positive yet. <br><br>  Let's see what will be on the prize draw <a href="http://event007.ru/02441/">on May 30 in the office</a> , and be sure to post videos and photos.  Anticipating the questions ‚Äúwhy in Krasnogorsk‚Äù I can answer that I would be happy to organize such actions on a much larger scale, but so far, alas. <br><br>  I am pleased to answer any of your questions, as long as they are in principle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93011/</a></p>
