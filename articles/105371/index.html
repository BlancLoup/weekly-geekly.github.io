On the technical side of the literary <br>  programming (i call it literary, not literate; i <br>  It seems to be closer in meaning to the original title) I saw a couple <br>  wonderful articles in runet, but I want to talk about emotional <br>  to his side, hopefully it will give you the motivation to dig <br>  deeper.  Emotional words would have sounded from my lips. <br>  a few ... in fanboy, so leave them for later, and now <br>  I'll suggest you read a few quotes from the creator of the methodology, Donald <br>  Whip. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I did the translation with Google Translate, and this is my <br>  The first published translation - I will ask you to kick only the case. <br><br>  Fragments from the article "Literate Programming", 1983:

    <blockquote>  I believe the time has come for much better documentation. <br>  programs, and that we can achieve this by making programs <br>  literary works. <br></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Let's change our traditional attitude to building programs: <br>  instead of the notion that our main task is to explain <br>  computer what to do, let's focus on explaining to the person <br>  what we want the computer to do. <br></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Literary programming practitioners can be thought of as <br>  an essayist whose main concern is exposure and perfection <br>  style.  Such an author, with a dictionary in hand, carefully chooses the names <br>  variables and explains why we need each of them. <br></blockquote><br><br>  In the above quote should ponder more seriously and not skip <br>  as something obvious.  The word <i>exposition is</i> packed a lot of sense, and <br>  his understanding is essential for uncovering the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãliterary <br>  programming.  I give the definition of Wikipedia. <br><br>  <i>Exposure</i> in literature - part of the work preceding <br>  the beginning of the deployment of units of the structure of the product, in particular, part <br>  works that precede the beginning of the plot.  The exposure should <br>  placement of actors, the circumstances, are shown <br>  reasons that "trigger" plot conflict.  Exposure can <br>  follow both before and after the tie. <br><br>  Exposure in the LP is one of the main ideas;  the point is that <br>  the author should explain to the reader the literary program where it came from <br>  any piece of code and why it is there where it is. <br><br><blockquote>  He or she seeks a program that is understandable because her ideas <br>  were presented in order that is best for human <br>  understanding using a mixture of formal and informal methods <br>  mutually reinforcing each other. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  We understand the complex system by understanding how its simple parts are arranged, and <br>  understanding the simple relationships between these parts and their immediate <br>  neighbors.  If we express a program as a network of ideas, we can <br>  emphasize its structural properties natural and satisfactory <br>  in a way. <br></blockquote><br><br>  This is a word about why many of the tools for LP have in their <br>  The name of the word is <i>web</i> [web]. <br><br><blockquote>  I dare to suggest that such achievements in the documentation are possible because <br>  the experience that I received during the last few years during <br>  intensive software development (here Knut talks about <br>  the development of TeX and METAFONT).  Taking advantage of a few ideas that <br>  have existed for a long time, and systematically applied them slightly <br>  in a new way, I came across a method of creating programs that is extremely <br>  I was excited. <br><br>  In fact, my enthusiasm is so great that I must warn <br>  reader to perceive a lot of what I say, like a raving fanatic, <br>  who thinks he just found <br>  enlightenment.  Programming is a very personal activity. <br>  therefore I cannot be sure that what worked with me will be <br>  work with everyone.  However, this new approach has fundamentally influenced <br>  my own style, and my excitement does not subside to this day - more than <br>  two years.  I like this new methodology so much that it is difficult <br>  keep from not going back to every one ever written <br>  I program and not to alter it in the "literary." <br><br>  I cannot resist the urge to work on tasks for <br>  programming, which I usually instruct student assistants <br>  research;  and why?  Because it seems to me that I can finally <br>  write programs as they should be written.  My programs are not <br>  only explained better than ever before;  they are better than programs, <br>  because the new methodology makes me do my job better. <br></blockquote><br><br>  A short excerpt from an interview with Donald Knut, 20 years later: <br><br><blockquote>  - One of your few projects that did not cover a wide <br>  a community of programmers, this is literary programming.  What are <br>  your thoughts on why literary programming didn't stick?  AND <br>  is there anything that you would do differently in retrospect <br>  regarding literary programming? <br><br>  - Literary programming is a very personal thing.  I think it is <br>  awesome but maybe this is because i'm very strange <br>  person.  He has tens of thousands of fans, but not millions. <br><br>  Judging by my experience, programs created using literary <br>  programming turned out to be significantly better than the program <br>  developed in a more traditional way.  But the usual programs still <br>  were good enough so the traditional methods stay with us - <br>  they are understood by a vast community of programmers, and most people <br>  there is no particular need to change something;  just as I am not motivated to teach <br>  Esperanto, even knowing that he may be preferable to English, <br>  German or Russian. <br><br>  John Bentley probably dotted i when asked ‚Äúwhy <br>  literary programming didn't conquer the world? "He said that only <br>  a small percentage of all people are good at programming, and a small <br>  the percentage is good at writing;  and you ask me to all people <br>  were in two of these categories at once. <br><br>  As for me, literary programming is the most important thing <br>  which came out of the TeX project.  It not only allowed me faster and <br>  safer than ever to write and maintain programs, it was <br>  one of the biggest sources of joy since the 1980s, and at times without <br>  it was impossible to do.  Some of my main programs <br>  such as the MMIX meta-simulator, could not be written using <br>  any other methodology I've ever heard of.  They were <br>  just too complicated for my limited brain;  without <br>  literary programming like enterprise just failed <br>  would. <br><br>  If people discover good ways to use the newfangled <br>  multithreaded machines, I expect the discovery will come from people who <br>  daily use of literary programming.  Literary <br>  programming is what you need to rise above the next <br>  level of achievement.  But I do not believe in the violent acceptance of ideas.  If a <br>  literary programming is not your style, please forget about it and <br>  do what you like.  If it is not like anyone except me - <br>  let him die. <br><br>  From the positive: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the rules of CWEB <br>  ( <i>literary programming systems for C</i> ) are already <br>  standard in preinstalled programs such as the Makefile in <br>  modern Linux. <br></blockquote><br><br>  As for me - I think that literary programming is very, very <br>  badly lacking in open-source projects and especially in training <br>  programming (it is not used formally with the corresponding <br>  tools). <br><br>  Last year I watched the life of the community very closely. <br>  lisperov-klozouristov and absorbed all available information on the network <br>  this topic: the planet of blogs, twitter, 3 books published today.  After <br>  I had a rather dense "immersion" in this topic. <br>  vague suspicion about the approach to learning Clojure and <br>  related infrastructure.  Then I learned about LP and vague <br>  the suspicion cleared up.  Judge for yourself.  Now in the world there are three books about <br>  Clojure and their contents intersect very strongly, <br>  approximately it can be described as 100500 weakly connected with each other <br>  recipes for placing rakes provided by this language <br>  specific version.  Reading all three books will not make you <br>  professional  You can read a thousand books like this - by master <br>  you will not become.  All 3 books run into an impenetrable wall;  you know <br>  that there is a treasure behind the wall, simple and concrete;  but you can't <br>  get to him through the thorns of scattered and obscure <br>  outlines.  Similar technical literature is the essence of the clip <br>  thinking: as if I was fed well brewed porridge from <br>  nutritious and damn healthy pieces but I can never by her <br>  to be full, because they feed me with the secondary, leaving the essence <br>  unavailable. <br><br>  Clojure, like all lisps, is inherently extremely simple. <br>  constructions.  Someone said ‚Äúsource is the best documentation‚Äù;  for <br>  The family of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãis the absolute truth.  In fact, that part of the language <br>  which is directly used by the user, is described on the <br>  Clojure in one core.clj file about 5 thousand lines in size.  it <br>  transparent as a tear of the baby code with comments from which <br>  generated quite simple but high-quality documentation.  Reading <br>  This file for a cup of tea will be the beginning of that journey for <br>  wall clips to the very essence of the technology used.  But further <br>  promotion is much more difficult - the next ones on the way will be <br>  Java sources that describe the compiler, transactional memory, <br>  references, agents, and persistent data structures.  And not one <br>  comment - there the devil himself will break his leg.  And the thing is not at all <br>  difficult, but those who are really thorough, or at least approximately <br>  knows the structure of this whole technology up to its very foundation - by orders of magnitude <br>  less than those who studied it to this difficult wall. <br><br>  Another thing is TeX - the glorious creation of the great master.  If you want to become <br>  With this technician, you read the standard guide from cover to cover. <br>  described in TeXbook.  I decided to become a seasoned specialist - again you study <br>  from cover to cover the book "TeX The Program", in which all 20,000 lines <br>  TeX programs (TeX is written in Pascal, fuck me!) are described <br>  simple understandable human language is a literary work <br>  a detailed description of the program from a bird's flight right up to <br>  the smallest details.  Everything.  Two books.  Alpha and Omega.  The technology is described <br>  from the bottom to the top and from all sides - no one will say more.  To in <br>  to fully experience the methodology, I highly recommend taking a look at Knut's three major literary programs, ‚ÄúTeX The Program‚Äù [http://db.tt/X8debml], <br>  "METAFONT The Program" and "MMIXware". <br><br>  Literary programming is not just another approach to <br>  documentation.  It is much deeper - this is the path connecting hearts <br>  program and programmer.  And this path will remain unclimbed, until <br>  until literary programming is applied on <br>  practice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105371/</a></p>
