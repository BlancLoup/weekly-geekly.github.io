The situation when the same "regik" sell 5-10 brands is not uncommon.  But, despite the seemingly ‚Äúchalice‚Äù, prices between twin models may vary.  Therefore, it is considered that it is best to buy the cheapest device, other things being equal. <br><br>  In my hands - "twins" teXet DVR-603FHD and AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS.  Why appearances are deceptive, what is hidden in the registrars' cases, why I wanted to weigh a head on my head for the parrot - this and many other things are further in the article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ece/91e/101/ece91e101333d92a3ec31b8a33850568.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Dossier</b> <br><br>  In terms of product confidence, my sympathies are with AdvoCam.  If only because it is not just another umbrella brand, but a team specializing specifically in registrars.  This is not surprising, since in the column ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù the brand indicates 16 years of experience in the field of video surveillance systems.  If I understand correctly, the brand belongs to the company "Videomax".  Which in turn is subordinate to the organization ‚ÄúByteErg‚Äù.  The latter owns its own factory in Alexandrov.  It is not difficult to guess that AdvoCam is not engaged in the "import" of devices.  Best of all, the registrar training scheme is described on the AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2f/942/811/c2f94281191944609ed53e0f214db059.jpg"><br><br>  In contrast, teXet is a typical Russian B-brand with a ‚Äúwith the world‚Äù assortment showcase.  Here and navigators, and recorders, and smartphones - just exactly a dozen product groups.  I do not belong to second-tier brands biased, as now, when preparing many products, companies really form an order for developing models and actively participate in / watch all stages of device preparation.  However, the ‚Äúspraying‚Äù on the example of teXet can accordingly affect the competence in certain categories of devices.  Whether this is true in the case of teXet DVR-603FHD, we have yet to learn. <br><br>  <b>Packing and packaging</b> <br><br>  Model teXet comes in a modest package - they say, do not expect miracles from me, I will not surprise you with "chips" and "buns".  However, we will not judge by clothes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/844/3c0/7a5/8443c07a50fbfab16d1a0cca045af378.jpg"><br><br>  On the contrary, AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS is more like a billboard - your eyes run from the abundance of information.  In general, this is not bad at all.  Because the information on the ends of the box is enough to not look into the instructions at all.  And about the bracket explained, and about the appointment of buttons.  And the brand is so sure of the quality of the shooting that it takes pictures of day and night recordings right on the package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fad/317/0ad/fad3170ade417ed8f1a8ae8b4f9425f8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aef/b1c/82f/aefb1c82fdfb712684a798cca03e3312.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef2/42a/063/ef242a063f1e2bc8950b91d3e7d5b16d.jpg"><br><br>  By picking, I would say more about parity.  Of course, in both cases there is a charger for the cigarette lighter, a miniUSB cable and instructions.  Next - teXet DVR-603FHD is distinguished by the presence of an HDMI cable, and AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS attracts with a complete 4 GB card (72 minutes of Full HD video).  It seems to me that if you buy a recorder and immediately want to use it, the ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù microSD card will still be more useful than an HDMI cable.  By the way, the question is for motorists - do you often resort to using the HDMI connector in your recorder? <br><br>  <b>Mount</b> <br><br>  In my humble opinion, both registrars use the most convenient and practical brackets among those in principle possible for ‚Äúvideo witnesses‚Äù.  The first and most important is the hinge, which eliminates the need for a holder with two or even three adjustment nodes.  The position with the hinge is configured as flexible as possible, a long leg-holder is not formed, and the recorder can be turned to the side at any time.  This is in contrast to ‚Äúzdorovskih‚Äù mounts, where the recorder is screwed (!) On the mount.  As a result, turning the camera to the left is a complete rotation along the axis. <br><br>  Praise the connection on the latch of the recorder and fasteners.  Dressed in one second, removed a little longer.  Then I put a ‚Äúplus‚Äù for the mechanism of operation of the vacuum sucker.  There is no plastic lever for you, to change the position of which (for the ‚Äúactuation‚Äù of the sucker), sometimes you need to put considerable effort.  In teXet DVR-603FHD and AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS, nothing of the kind - just a neat ‚Äúhandle‚Äù that easily turns clockwise and fixes the bracket on the glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f6b/dcd/f92/f6bdcdf9258bdfc712d1c251da7cfbfd.jpg"><br><br>  The last ‚Äúwow‚Äù is nutrition.  Do we have it as it is?  DC connector (or miniUSB) is located on the side.  And the power cord, respectively, also hangs gracefully on the side.  And at especially lazy drivers elegantly hangs down from a windshield "directly" to the cigarette lighter.  The recorders I reviewed solved the issue simply and with taste - the connector is located directly on the bracket, from which the power is supplied to the recorder.  That is, the holder initially motivates the laying of the wire under the skin.  Plus as much as possible reduces visibility of "lace".  In the sense that otherwise even the wire brought under the casing is still visible at least at a distance of height from the recorder body to the ‚Äútop‚Äù of the holder. <br><br>  As you understand, in this case the laudatory odes are dedicated to both teXet DVR-603FHD and AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS.  Despite the fact that the external attachment is slightly different, all the principles described in them coincide.  Without a doubt, the developers (whoever they are) - ‚ÄúRespect and respect‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Appearance and management</b> <br><br>  Who has the modified version, and who has the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù - let everyone decide for himself.  I only know that teXet DVR-603FHD has the most common plastic case with a ‚Äúshiny‚Äù surface.  And at AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS, the entire ‚Äúexterior‚Äù is completely matte soft plastic.  Looks solid.  Plus offhand, the AdvoCam model is heavier.  This would be appreciated by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26v%3DtgMiDkerZVE">well-known Boris Razor</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b5/bdf/56a/3b5bdf56a910c7107702c1bc965bad17.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d4/e2d/8dc/8d4e2d8dc7510307e0a9dbb8a34749cd.jpg"><br><br>  The buttons and connectors of the model do not differ from each other.  The so-called ‚Äúvan tach‚Äù system is implemented in the recorders.  This means that access to popular features is possible with one touch of a button.  For example, on the left side of the screen, the bottom key instantly turns on / off the screen.  On the right side - the top button starts / stops shooting, and the bottom one allows you to set protection on the file.  Then the video is excluded from the cyclic recording and cannot be ‚Äúoverwritten‚Äù by the user's carelessness.  At the upper end, a pair of keys is responsible for turning on / off the LED backlight and getting an instant photo.  In practice, everything is organized really great - the functions are remembered in an instant, it is really convenient to work with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/914/177/986/914177986e551c58d0212f790b4e67c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/9c3/841/1f29c3841f56af5e2314c6efcf0da9c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e7/a21/1e9/2e7a211e99991df57c3ca3c78fa76505.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e8/ff7/f22/8e8ff7f22ed11b6b83bdf0bef4be238d.jpg"><br><br>  There are no fundamental differences in the settings: we set the resolution of the shooting, the duration of the commercials, the sensitivity of the G-sensor, the exposure, the white balance and other items familiar to the recorders. <br><br>  We change the settings, as well as view the video on a 2.7-inch screen.  I can not say that the presence of a relatively large display had a negative impact on the dimensions of the recorders.  The devices are still small and the visibility of the driver does not interfere. <br><br>  <b>Videography</b> <br><br>  So we got to the main criterion for evaluating registrars.  Go through the characteristics.  The teXet DVR-603FHD has a 1 / 2.5 ‚Äù5-megapixel matrix, a 3.4 mm / f / 2.0 4-lens lens (not indicated, glass or plastic - second), a viewing angle of 120 degrees.  In the column "processor" it becomes immediately clear why the model is cheaper than the AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS - and what can be expected from the "colleague".  Ambarella A2S60 - budget "stone", serving devices for unpretentious users.  In a good place for such a processor in the registrars for a maximum of 3-4 thousand rubles.  Anyway, whether shooting HD or Full HD, sensible pictures will not work.  Let me give you a comment left on one forum back in 2011: "This is a very ancient processor, the first processor for processing HD and Full HD video, was used in video cameras that were released 4-6 years ago."  However, one should not ‚Äúgrumble‚Äù ahead of time. <br><br>  AdvoCam camera parameters of the recorder are not at all shy.  First of all, we see a 3.1 megapixel matrix, originally intended not for recorders at all, but for quite professional video surveillance systems.  Plus four glass lenses with a focal point of 3.4 mm and f / 2.0.  By the way, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade by Aptina, one of the world's main suppliers of this type of product for ... Almost everything, from mirrorless to industrial vision systems.  Processor to match the listed accessories - Ambarella A5S.  It is easy to calculate how far a generation Ambarella A2S60 mentioned above is lagging behind. <br><br>  How long is it short, get acquainted with the results of the video. <br><br>  Daytime shooting, AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5Fda82EmfU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhipXY5Vd6tJQzyNjQucFKdhWzU8jQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Daytime shooting, teXet DVR-603FHD <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uS_0o1X7-A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-zXsxWoRppJWZY2Q2L4mjc8Dgqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Night shot, AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZyPXaLXyPg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhisK-WHDBsTx4bGLmhOH5AdaeBGPw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Night shooting, teXet DVR-603FHD <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JCGF3R7Nog%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjwN5-6qL2ztyicnkGvORxvGfFFFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I chose the most typical shooting examples in order not to waste your time by viewing lengthy records of the same type.  The conclusions are obvious, we are not talking about some comparable quality levels of shooting.  In principle, the ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù picture of the teXet DVR-603FHD daytime video can be useful for an unpretentious driver.  But - in my opinion, with such a terrible quality, the recorder doesn‚Äôt need much price-increasing moments like an accelerometer or the same HDMI cable.  In fact, will many people want to display the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù teXet DVR-603FHD on the TV screen?  Regarding night shooting, I will probably refrain from flattering epithets. <br><br>  The amount of "iron" AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS gives, to put it mildly, a decent image - even if you do not take the teXet model as a background.  Acceptable for the registrar 15 meters distance for viewing numbers are maintained.  The picture is clear, including at night.  Although at night the "stars" of the light sources are striking.  But the same numbers are viewed within about 8-10 meters. <br><br>  In fairness, I will say that for me, the quality of the video AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS is not a reference.  On a clear sunny day, situations were noticed when the number could not be viewed at all within a couple of meters - a completely white "board" was visible.  Also often lubricated numbers of oncoming cars. <br><br>  <b>The most interesting</b> <br><br>  In fact, we have seen that recorders have different case materials, equipment, the optical system and video quality are completely different.  It remains only to see what is hidden inside the recorders.  I admit, I would not dare to this experiment, be it my personal devices.  However, the conditions allowed me to "ponder" the devices. <br><br>  Problems with the disengagement of the covers did not arise.  The paper knife created a crevice in the case and made it easy to divide each recorder into two halves.  Immediately see the first difference.  Inside teXet DVR-603FHD the surface of the plastic is not processed by anything.  In AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS - some rough coating of bronze color.  I suspect that it is needed for a reason.  If among the reader who is aware of the appointment of this moment - please explain in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/150/8be/58d/1508be58d7142ceaaa8f95447fcd48af.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02d/337/e6c/02d337e6c37c6695e8b6a37a7d4153be.jpg"><br><br>  It was striking that the board and battery AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS used something like foam lining, not seen in teXet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e0/ab2/384/3e0ab2384ecb058c716637bc68758770.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/619/134/d9b/619134d9bb77d79d2d19bcf196c036b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b0/490/003/8b04900039799f7ca1c43f57ca5e60d8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb1/1fe/f01/bb11fef0178911313ff5d812d5dfde78.jpg"><br><br>  The photo shows that the recorders are not just different optics, but different boards - even if they have the same location of connectors.  It is noticeable how much more serious matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãset in the center in AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS.  The speaker platform is also of a purely practical nature - with it the fluctuations of the lens are excluded.  At teXet DVR-603FHD, an almost flat platform is obtained, the lens is fixed only with screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5a/b6b/a67/e5ab6ba6701f8fb78ac63d668e95a1cd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d5/5d5/cc3/4d55d5cc3dab57a4d3d35d4e6234120f.jpg"><br><br>  About cogs.  Fortunately, in the absence of a small screwdriver, the same paper knife replaced me with success.  Only in teXet DVR-603FHD one of the cogs ‚Äúworn out‚Äù one hook.  The usual screwdriver came to the rescue, unscrewing the naughty "plug". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/910/dfd/542/910dfd5429da825e7871912d90778da8.jpg"><br><br>  I also note that the option of carefully grouping the screws did not bring me the desired result in terms of their safety.  When I tried to assemble the recorders, it turned out that about half of the required number of screws was missing.  Sadly, it was only at this moment that I remembered the parrot.  More precisely, that even his private flight across the room lets out a weak wave of wind.  In general, I am still looking for cogs within the room :) Well, at least I have linoleum on the floor, not a carpet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03d/7e3/eba/03d7e3eba9d8f224afcac3516880958e.jpg"><br><br>  We return to the lens.  The manufacturer of the "peephole¬ª teXet DVR-603FHD was not found out.  ‚ÄúNumbers and letters‚Äù were written from the back side, but they didn‚Äôt say anything to Google.  Amused what made the "shell" of lenses.  See the top rims of the cameras?  So, the teXet DVR-603FHD ‚Äúcircle‚Äù is made of plastic, while the AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS is made of metal.  I can not imagine why this is necessary, but still nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/283/813/bb1/283813bb1a34a97d0dc7f502f1a70146.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/554/e31/acb/554e31acbc92eb8c6fd23016393ed9b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd9/f26/233/fd9f262332a798ac0102e8534a32e400.jpg"><br><br>  Directly behind the display is a metal patch sheet, its withdrawal "exposed" the processor.  No wonder - the "stones" of the models correspond to those indicated in the characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a10/9f1/e9f/a109f1e9f6096d4b73fa441dc373a1ef.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the attempt of the most accurate treatment, teXet DVR-603FHD "bullying" could not resist.  On the one hand broke the wire leading to the speaker.  Fully "moved" battery cable.  Not as an example, AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS survived better, only the speaker cable came off.  The recorder refused to turn on, but when connected to the network it winked at the charging indicator.  In general, on the weekend you will need to call on a soldering iron to your uncle :) <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In fact, everything did not turn out exactly as I had planned.  In a preliminary study of recorders, I thought that the difference between models would be limited to optics and a processor.  According to the results, it turned out that between the registrars examined there is practically a gulf of differences.  The internal execution of models varies radically - however, you yourself could see everything.  Initially, I wanted to show that AdvoCam-FD5 Profi for 5,990 rubles justifies an "overpayment" of about one and a half thousand rubles.  In the end, I'm not sure that teXet DVR-603FHD creates a real-world price difference with the AdvoCam product. <br><br>  PS In the end, I deliberately led the AdvoCam-FD5 Profi model.  The AdvoCam-FD5 Profi-GPS that I had was different only in the presence of an external GPS module.  This receiver is inserted into the ‚Äúgap‚Äù between the mount and the power cable.  The registrar version with GPS costs 7,490 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184198/</a></p>
