But it is not for those who smoke and do not see any need to quit.  As they say, smoke to health. <br><br>  <strong>Common myths about smoking:</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  - <strong>Smoking helps to lose weight</strong> .  Complete nonsense.  I saw crowds of fat women who smoked for years but didn‚Äôt become thinner.  Men are concerned, too. <br>  - <strong>Smoking helps to change the voice</strong> (in particular, to make it more masculine, coarse).  I have often heard this from young people with a high timbre of voice uncharacteristic of men.  Smoking does have such an effect, but too slowly.  Will have to wait until old age.  It is not worth it.  Personally, my voice has not changed in 4 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - <strong>Smoking stimulates mental activity</strong> .  It really is.  The action lasts from 5 to 20 minutes.  But for example, Glycine tablets have much safer help for the brain and a longer lasting effect, they are very cheap, pleasant to the taste. <br>  - <strong>Smoking increases the intoxicating effect of alcohol</strong> , but you have to pay for it with a more powerful hangover syndrome. <br>  - It is widely believed among young people that <strong>smoking can improve their status</strong> in the eyes of more influential persons, which are found in all schools.  So, in order to quit smoking, you will need no less courage than to prove to other people in other ways that you are no worse than them. <br>  <strong>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to smoke, I‚Äôll only try</strong> . <strong>‚Äù</strong>  That was how I told myself before my four-year battle with smoking began. <br>  - <strong>"You do not smoke and do not drink and die healthy</strong> . <strong>"</strong>  Have you heard?  My grandfather smoked all his life and recently died of lung cancer.  I saw this.  I'm actually not going to die, but in this context I want to die healthy. </blockquote>

      <strong>Recommendations experienced</strong> <br><br>  The most difficult thing is not to quit.  "It is easy to quit smoking," Mark Twain would say, "I know, I myself threw it many times."  The first three months are the hardest, but after this period the obsessive desire to smoke passes.  Smokers know that their first wish in the morning is to smoke. <br>  Throwing is accompanied by an increase in appetite, the body begins to demand a lot of water, a person becomes very irritable, unrestrained, may be accompanied by reddening of the eyes, and darkening of saliva and urine (the body is cleared).  Insomnia and growing self-esteem.  During the period of throwing, it is recommended to refrain from drinking alcohol, as at such moments the desire to smoke increases. <br>  Very helpful special pills "Corrida", there are in all pharmacies, there are pennies, they should be taken when there is a desire to smoke.  It tastes nasty.  After them, it's not that smoking, I don't want anything at all.  The main thing - do not forget to take with you, it is better to stock up on a few packs, put it in your pockets in everything you walk. <br>  As an option - to avoid smokers, so that once again did not remind and not tempt.  By the way, the water required by the body also helps to take a glass on the chest as soon as there is a desire to smoke, in the sense of smoking. <br><br>  <strong>Caution!</strong> <br><br>  The victory over smoking is, of course, a success, but you should not relax.  Be alert.  The more experience a smoker has, the longer this habit will remind of itself even after years.  Only one cigarette you smoke will restore the "memory" of your body, and you have to start all over again. <br>  The desire to smoke will be as strong as before.  But unlike last time, self-confidence will live in you. <br><br>  <strong>Effects</strong> <br><br>  When I quit smoking, the sensations were awesome, complete freedom, clean breathing, healthy and clean teeth (for five years I was at the dentist once, not a single hole, of course, I brush my teeth every day, morning and evening, when I smoked, I went to the dentist every half a year and every time he drilled something to me), I really felt improved health and health, shortness of breath disappeared, I rarely get sick (for comparison, I was very often sick and felt weak, depressed), the complexion became natural, acne disappeared, my memory improved and the speed of thinking  I already wrote a motivation, you feel like a man. <br>  I‚Äôm not talking about such trifles as clothes and hands that do not stink tobacco, that it‚Äôs not lost from life 3 hours a day (the usual rate for a smoker is a pack of cigarettes a day, it takes a little less than 10 minutes for each to smoke; smokes faster, flag in hand, I personally liked the process itself, and not just the effect or the satisfaction of desire) and that your spouse is much more pleasant to kiss you, and I am silent about the fact that your future children become more likely to be born healthy (if you do not have children yet, by the way, as for parents: if in  You smoke and teach children that it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs useless, it‚Äôs like a bald one to advertise hair growth, you need a personal example. This does not guarantee, of course, that the children will follow your footsteps, but the probability will decrease significantly). <br>  Personally, I was stimulated by the last point by 100%, especially after visiting the kuntz camera, where I saw a collection of jars with alcohol-treated children, freaks of smoking parents. <br><br>  It would be nice to know your personal experience.  Here, by and large, only mine is stated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27197/</a></p>
