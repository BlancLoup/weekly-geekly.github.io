I looked at Habr√© - it turned out that since 2012 no one has made reviews of this type of device.  But Major is also a headset for your smartphone.  She just has high-quality sound and excellent design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35f/364/167/35f36416754312c95f0480eec423cccf.jpg" alt="image">

It was founded in 1962, and its musical equipment can be seen on many live recordings from that year.  For many people, this brand is associated with hard rock.  For example, Iron Maiden has been using Marshall since the band‚Äôs founding, and they played more than 2,000 concerts and sold over 80 million copies of their albums. <br><br>  <i>Adrian Smith, Iron Maiden</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/672/743/d06/672743d063864d3667f675e577ab3eff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Carrie King, Slayer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd5/d09/b6b/dd5d09b6b4392b07f21e99acc4a65c36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the design of the headphone hand put the Swedish company Zound Industries, known precisely as a manufacturer of headphones.  Among their works are Urbanears, Molami and Coloud.  Zound Industries also developed the Marshall Minor design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d97/f80/092/d97f8009256149742cb7541de8311023.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Packaging </h4><br>  Headphones are delivered in an almost gift cardboard box, on which are printed characteristics and a color picture on the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc8/c7f/20d/dc8c7f20d97eb1ded4fe2e7b9e049234.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/4c8/944/b654c8944ff303bf68e56d7b8c63be50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside, the headphones and the adapter from 3.5 to 6.3 are pictured on a black cardboard pedestal.  I don‚Äôt even want to pull them out.  They are firmly fixed with flagella. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/03c/99f/a7d03c99fe616976cf053eb693782259.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The set, except for the headphones itself, includes an adapter from 3.5 to 6.3 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce0/b71/724/ce0b71724457bb6aa5c2c709150959e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  The Marshall Major headphones bring us back to the heyday of rock'n'roll and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.  You look at them - and in your head starts to play something like Run To the Hills or Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.  But it is optional and depends on your particular musical preferences. <br><br>  The outer walls of the ear cushions are made of vinyl and decorated with the brand-new white Marshall logo, which is recognizable from afar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/f51/0e5/a3bf510e565d19eb63957ba42ecdd1d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/040/055/b87/040055b875efeab24cb2ee5ce36566d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Conveniently, the headphones can be folded.  So they will save space in the bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3da/11a/7f5/3da11a7f581399490fcc76e57a2ba64b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Part of the wire is twisted by a spring, which prevents the possibility of spinning anywhere else.  If necessary, you can stretch the wire to two meters, in a quiet state, it conveniently reaches the jacket pocket, where the mobile phone lies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/a82/1e0/282a821e05cdd8fc81eab74389e16ccc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The steel spring prevents the wire from wrinkling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29b/669/c8f/29b669c8f78fc468881c8436ca1dad84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main colors of Marshall are black and gold, as well as the white logo.  This is reflected in the design of the headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/f89/fbb/167f89fbbd1908918597e6fe26dfee1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside, the fasteners are decorated with embossed Marshall logos on a gold background, the jack and the spring are also gold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b8/35b/bfa/5b835bbfa7c54e9486c084026bf8dc52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The painting of Jim Marshall, the company's founder, is printed on the inside of the rim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff5/c2c/59c/ff5c2c59ce90819660b3789981840147.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The microphone remote is equipped with one button.  On Android, one click starts or stops the music, double-click - and you call the last number you dialed. <br><br><h4>  Materials </h4><br>  The first thing you notice when you hold the headphones in your hands is high-quality materials and a perfect assembly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35f/364/167/35f36416754312c95f0480eec423cccf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main materials of the headphones are soft-touch plastic, vinyl, leather, eco-leather and steel.  The arc is covered with natural leather, while the cushions are made of soft eco-leather, which is difficult to distinguish from the real one.  Even by smell.  There is a minus in this - in summer it can be hot.  The outer walls of the ear cushions are made of vinyl.  Ear pads attached to the arc with steel wire.  Headphone cups are made of vinyl - the same material used in Marshall amplifiers.  It's nice to know that I pulled the speakers of such a manufacturer over my ears.  The wire is thick rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dd/f07/a28/1ddf07a282a9960ee3d0613a194ed8cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  <i>Attention!</i>  <i>Subjective opinion!</i>  <i>Listened on Mac and HTC One X.</i> <br><br>  Let me remind you the main characteristics: <br>  <b>Resistance:</b> 32 Ohm <br>  <b>Speaker diameter:</b> 40 mm <br>  <b>Frequency range:</b> 20 - 20000 Hz <br>  <b>Sensitivity:</b> 121 dB <br><br>  Marshall Major is very loud.  Be sure to remember this in order not to accidentally turn on the music at full volume.  Just brains flow out.  At the average power of my HTC One X, they sound great.  It was as if I was listening to music again after a SONY MDR-ZX300 / W, which I, however, am very pleased with.  And this is despite the fact that this Sony model has a wider range - 10-24000 Hz.  The point is the difference in price and materials. <br><br>  Sound insulation is far from perfect.  Of course, in the office or at home it is a pleasure to use them, and in the subway you will even hear the announcement of the next stop.  This does not affect the sound quality, as if you are sitting between two powerful speakers and listening to music in the car.  Turn it on louder - and others will drag along with you. <br><br><h4>  Verdict </h4><br>  First, about the shortcomings: in the summer in Marshall Major will most likely be hot. <br><br>  And the advantages of these headphones include high-quality materials, excellent assembly and high-quality sound.  Headphones are comfortable, tight to the head, the wire is not confused.  I would call the design outstanding, as you rarely find headphones that are nice to look at.  I am pleased with them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221645/</a></p>
