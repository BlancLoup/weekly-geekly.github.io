How to attract new customers?  How to keep existing?  How to charm the boss or the interlocutor at the upcoming meeting?  This is a very difficult problem, especially considering that very few people really understand the fundamental principles of how attention works. <br><br>  When I was writing my new book, I shoveled over a thousand scientific studies and conducted interviews with dozens of scientists, doctors of science, business leaders, and various luminaries to understand why we turn our attention to certain people and ideas, while others go unnoticed.

      For my friend Guy Kawasaki, I selected ten of the most delicious ways to attract attention from my research.  Their use is unlikely to make you a superstar, but they are sure to help draw some attention to your ideas. <br><br><h4>  Treat a person with hot coffee </h4><br>  Research shows that we associate a physical sensation of warmth with interpersonal relationships.  In other words, if you give a person a cup of hot coffee or tea, he will most likely transfer the warmth to your relationship.  ( <i>Note.- And I thought where did this tradition come from</i> ) <br><br><h4>  Make a red frame around your profile picture. </h4><br>  Do you want the same success as the <a href="http://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a> online dating app?  One study found that simply putting a red frame on a photo of a person attracts more people.  Red is your friend in the world of dating. <br><br><h4>  Use contrasting colors for Buy buttons. </h4><br>  Most of Amazon.com‚Äôs space is filled with orange and yellow buy buttons that stand out on white and gray backgrounds.  The contrast of the element is proportional to the number of clicks. <br><br><h4>  Make your offer scarce </h4><br>  Our ideas about something change when we consider it a rarity.  Gmail and <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> attracted enormous attention, limiting participants to invitations (invites).  Slow distribution and limited access often become effective ways to attract attention. <br><br><h4>  Make an unexpected gift </h4><br>  The human brain is configured in such a way that makes us pay attention to surprises that are deceiving our expectations.  The next time you make a gift, make it different.  For example, wrap it with special paper.  Do this when people least expect it.  In general, be creative.  Show that you are doing something extremely unique and creative! <br><br><h4>  Visualize the proposed rewards. </h4><br>  Numerous studies show unprecedented growth of enthusiasm in the presence of achievable remuneration or tangible fruits of our work.  So it's not enough just to tell the audience about the award, show it! <br><br><h4>  Curb the experts </h4><br>  Most people with respect for the opinions of experts, so it would be foolish not to use this phenomenon.  Try to use reliable experts to get recommendations that speak in your favor. <br><br><h4>  Curb the crowd </h4><br>  We trust the wisdom of the crowd - without this trust, sites like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp_Inc">Yelp</a> would have no users at all.  The crowd is also a place to take part and have a direct impact ( <i>Note - crowdfunding, as it is Indiegogo, Kickstarter or Boomstarter</i> ). <br><br><h4>  Use intriguing endings </h4><br>  We suffer an irresistible burden of completeness ‚Äî an innate, insatiable need for the bottom line, explained by the uncomfortableness of vagueness.  Do not be afraid to finish your lyrics with exciting finals, then your audience will want to return to see the sequel!  Remember how Steve Jobs always finished his speeches - ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Äù? <br><br><h4>  Prove your audience is special </h4><br>  We have an innate need to be different and feel special.  The best projects, startups and brands are always trying to build strong communities around themselves.  The most important thing is to make your audience aware of its importance to you.  And when there is attention, there is room for maneuver. <br><br>  If you accept these ten recommendations for service, be sure that attention is provided to you. <br><br>  Ben Parr co-founder <a href="http://www.dominatefund.com/">DominateFund</a> , former co-publisher of <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> , and author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Captivology-Science-Capturing-Peoples-Attention/dp/0062324195">Captivology</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286366/</a></p>
