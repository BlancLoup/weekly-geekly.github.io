Therefore, it is extremely important for businesses to be able to train their security professionals to the extent that their IT management strategy requires. <br><br>  This means that there is only one question: how best, on the one hand, for specialists to get adequate training (which will make them more in demand in the labor market), and on the other hand, enterprises to improve their protocols and security procedures (and demonstrate to their customers a sense of security)? <br>  The right decisions are security certificates that allow a combination of minimum requirements, a standardized language and a professional code of ethics.

      If we, as specialists and business leaders decided to take a course in IT security management, then it is recommended to choose certificates of leading international and independent organizations.  With this in mind, in this article we present some of the most serious certification programs available: <br><br>  <b>CISA / CISM</b> <br>  CISA and CISM are the two main accreditations issued by the association. <a name="habracut"></a>  ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association) is an international association that has been engaged in certification and methodology since 1967 and has over 95,000 members in its ranks. <br>  CISM (Certified Information Systems Manager) appeared later than CISA, and offers accreditation in the knowledge and experience of managing IT security. <br>  CISM offers the core standards of competence and professional development that an IT security director must possess in order to develop and manage an IT security program. <br><br>  <b>CISSP</b> <br>  The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certificate issued by ISC is one of the most valuable certifications in the industry.  Organizations like the NSA or the US Department of Defense use it as a reference. <br>  The certificate is also known as ‚Äúa mile wide and an inch deep‚Äù, i.e.  indicates the breadth of knowledge (in a mile), which are checked during the exam, and also the fact that many questions do not touch on the sophisticated details of the concepts (only an inch deep). <br><br>  <b>COBIT</b> <br>  COBIT 5 (the latest tested version) is defined as the starting point used by government agencies and enterprises for IT management.  Managed by the ISACA Association in conjunction with the IT Governance Institute. <br>  COBIT is designed to adapt for businesses of any size with different business models and corporate culture.  Its standards are applied in areas such as information security, risk management, or decision making regarding cloud computing. <br><br>  <b>ITIL</b> <br>  ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) can be described as an example of good practice and recommendations for administering IT services with a focus on administering processes.  Manages this OGC (Office of Government Commerce) certificate in the UK. <br>  While COBITS works on enterprise management and standardization, ITIL focuses on processes, i.e.  COBIT defines "WHAT", and ITIL - "AS". <br><br>  <b>ISO / IEC 27000</b> <br>  The standard, published by the International Organization for Certification ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC, serves as a starting point for a group of standards that provide the basics of IT security management that can be used by any type of organization (non-profit, public, private, large or small). <br><br>  Unlike other certificates that are intended for individuals, this certificate is primarily designed for businesses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268453/</a></p>
