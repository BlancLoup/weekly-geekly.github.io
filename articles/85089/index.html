  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Looking for work: practical experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are a lot of theoretical rules for success (we will be considered a success that you were hired) during the interview.  But I would like to share my observations without referring to them.  About myself I can say that I change my job about once every 1-2 years.  The reasons are completely different, but the consequence is one - this is the search for a new job [usually I go through 2-3 interviews], which allows me to choose the place that most satisfies my needs.  So let's get started: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Carefully prepare your resume.  It is very important at the very first stage.  Do not exclude from your achievements absolutely nothing.  Any plus is a small step to success.  Celebrate your achievements not only by specialization [although this is the most important thing], but also in sports and hobbies.  If you have certificates, write about it. [Even if they are issued by not very well-known companies.] And yet, do not forget to issue it: use pseudo-characters for formatting, it helps the potential employer in your text very well. <br><br><h4>  Letter of recommendation </h4><br>  When you leave your previous job, ask your supervisor to write you a letter of recommendation.  It will help you a lot in the future. <br><br><h4>  Registration on job search sites </h4><br>  Register at least on 2 or 3 job search sites.  I usually use hh.ru and rabota.ru.  Post your resume and MUST write a cover letter.  Example: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
     <code>, .   ...   ....     3- :  ..., ..., ....      .        (  Windows  Linux ,  ),   ,        IT-. <br> <br>  , .... <br></code> <br><h4>  Choosing an employer </h4><br>  One of the important points when looking for a job is the choice of a potential employer.  Determine for yourself what minimum wage you expect.  I usually sort jobs by the wage column.  And I start sending cover letters.  It is clear that the majority will not answer you for one reason or another.  But this is not the most important thing.  The main thing is that among those potential employers who have answered you, it may be your future.  Remember that your task is to pass the maximum possible number of interviews.  This will increase your chance of success of the ‚Äúevent‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Interview </h4><br>  Each employer can have a different interview process.  But the essence is the same everywhere: they want to know as much information as possible about you.  Moreover, both positive qualities and negative ones.  An interview is a very difficult and most important part of your job search path.  Your task is to convince the potential employer that it is you who are most suited to the proposed position. <br><br>  <b>Preparation:</b> be sure to read what the company does.  You will most likely be asked at the interview: ‚ÄúDo you know what our company is doing?‚Äù.  And you can fuck up. <br><br>  <b>Clothing:</b> clothing should be as strict and clean as possible.  You must be neat.  This is very often forgotten.  But after all, this is the first thing that employers pay attention to.  And the first impression can either spoil everything and you will be interviewed "for show", or they will draw attention to you as a potential employee. <br><br>  <b>The manner of communication:</b> must match the image.  Answer questions calmly and confidently.  It is very important to be confident (do not go too far, it will scare the employer) in yourself.  You must make it clear that you do not need the employer, but you need him. <br><br>  <b>Agility:</b> also a key point.  When interviewing, job seekers often make a big mistake: if a question starts in a related field (well, I say, a C ++ programmer, and they ask me how familiar I am with Ruby programming), they get scared (worried) and carry nonsense.  In this situation, the simplest thing is to lie.  Yes, you heard right, it is to lie and say that there is a programming experience on Ruby, it was just a couple of years ago and you just need to remember the constructions, syntax, etc.  (this is in case you suddenly want to ask you a little task).  And all this should be done being absolutely calm and confident. <br><br>  <b>Questions to the employer:</b> usually at the end of the interview the employer asks if you have any questions for him.  Feel free to ask them: ask about salary, work schedule, team size, sick-lists, etc.  I also highly recommend asking the question: ‚ÄúWhy was this vacancy vacated?‚Äù.  Truth, perhaps you will not be told, but, usually, it is clear whether the employer is lying or not. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  So, after a week or a couple of weeks, and maybe the next day, they will call you and say that they took you.  Come to the company and start working.  Do not be afraid that they will call you from a company that is more interesting for you.  If they call, just explain the situation and leave. <br><br>  Here is a small note on your court.  If you have something to add and share your experiences and observations - please in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85089/</a></p>
