Not with kickstarters or bitcoins.  Not with 3D printers or Tesla towers, but with us.  Those who say "impossible" should not interfere with those who do. <br>  So the essence - I propose to discuss (and implement) the opportunity for the hearing impaired to see the sound so well as to understand the speech and learn to talk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The individual man is weak, as abandoned Robinson: <br>  only in community with others can he do much. <br>  (c) Arthur Schopenhauer. <br><br>  For the past few years, I have regularly returned to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmagic glasses, which will allow deaf people to fully communicate with the main part of humanity.  However, all the time rested on the fact that I did not have the necessary knowledge.  And postponed.  But today I remembered a quote from an epigraph and decided to simply voice the idea ... In fact, we all like to say that Skolkovo is the best sawmill, but we ourselves are no better - we do not destroy money, we destroy something more - opportunities ... But There are enough specialists on this resource for many things that can change the world.  I propose to start small ... <br><br>  <b>Please express your criticism in a positive way, for example, ‚Äúin order to realize this, it will be necessary to solve the problem of interstellar flights‚Äù and not ‚ÄúThis is insanity and absurdity!</b>  <b>This is impossible because no one can get to the neighboring galaxy. ‚Äù</b>  <b>Thank you for understanding.</b>

    <h4>  A little more blah blah ... </h4><br>  Most of the deaf are not completely deprived of hearing, but only so that this is not enough for normal communication.  Many can easily understand the speech on the lips and a small part of the information they hear.  Yes, they have languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not tied to ours at all, but a form of communication in which the speaker articulates a little more clearly and adds only a few gestures for a better understanding of what was said.  Yes, this is not enough to learn to speak for yourself, because they do not hear sounds and cannot compare - they say it correctly or not, so the sounds made by the deaf sound scary, but in general the strategy of speech perception by indirect signs works. <br><br><h4>  So what do we have? </h4><br>  1 - a person is able to recognize speech not only on the basis of the sound channel. <br>  2 - for learning coherent speech, it is necessary to receive a reference image from a teacher (usually a child learns from parents), and to receive information about his sounds to compare what we do. <br>  3 - any sense organs in one way or another turn all information into electrical signals that undergo a certain processing.  The width of the visual channel is much higher than the sound one.  The rational hypothesis is that one can also ‚Äúembed‚Äù lost audio information into it. <br>  4 - human speech is not synthesized from the digital stream, but it is based on all the same electrical signals to certain muscles that in a certain way change the path of air from the mouth. <br><br><h4>  Desired result </h4><br>  Miracles that do not interfere with seeing, but at the same time allow you to see the necessary information about the sound as well (as Google-Google or in another way, for example with translucent icons).  This image in the most convenient form encodes the current sound background (for a start in the speech range).  Ideally, the displayed image should be similar in format to the signals that are used to pronounce these sounds. <br>  Next, points are added to the method of teaching speech understanding with the help of glasses and teaching conversation. <br><br><h4>  What do you need? </h4><br>  1 - processing of a speech signal in a form convenient for an output.  Accordingly, it is necessary to work out this very format of sound representation.  Question to the signalmen, zvukikam, maybe doctors. <br>  2 - convenient form of withdrawal.  Can be developed in parallel.  Question to interface designers and so on. <br>  3 - consultation of the hearing impaired. <br>  4 - software development. <br>  5 - tests and testers training. <br>  6 - release in tablet form, field tests. <br>  7 - release in the form of points, taking into account errors and improvements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226623/</a></p>
