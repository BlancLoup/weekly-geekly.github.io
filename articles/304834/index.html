      But in this film, life and delicacy are not just compared.  The hero of Tom Hanks, who is not bright-witted, but well-educated and kindhearted Forrest Gump, teaches us <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dostigayte-bolshego-sokrashchaya-chislo-obyazatelstv/">to achieve our goals</a> without listening to other people's opinions.  Forrest risks his life, but keeps his promises and achieves his plans. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOnce it started to rain and did not stop for four months.  I learned all kinds of rain ‚Äî light and stinging rain, old and heavy rain, horizontal rain.  Sometimes it even seemed that it was raining from the bottom up.  Hell, he walked even at night! ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Despite the fact that the quotation in the film refers to the rain of bullets during the hero's participation in the Vietnam War, it also symbolizes the obstacles that a person encounters <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-pereyti-ot-mechty-k-delu-4-shaga-k-motivatsii/">on the way to a dream</a> and the fact that all bad things ever end. <br><br>  The obvious evidence of his deep and unconditional faith in God is the constant instructions of the hero‚Äôs mother: <br><blockquote>  "You must wisely dispose of what God has given you." </blockquote><br>  In addition, at one of the moments, Forrest and her best friend Jenny prayed to God to turn her into a bird and she could fly away from her terrible father. <br><br>  In short, Forrest Gump was the embodiment of perseverance.  His kindness and wisdom (despite his low IQ) help the hero in an easy manner to reveal to the viewer banal truths and real life values ‚Äã‚Äã(which are not noticed by the people around him). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">In the movie "Outcast"</font> </h2><br>  <i><b>"And I know what I have to do next ... I have to keep breathing, because tomorrow the sun will rise again, and who knows what the tide will bring ..."</b></i> <br><br>  The film "Outcast" won first place in the ranking of the best films about survival.  In it, Tom Hanks played Chuck Noland, a former Federal Express delivery worker who was stuck on an uninhabited island after a plane crash in the South Pacific.  The film shows how the main character for four years alone survived on the island, using as resources only what was originally there (and things from the wrecked plane). <br><br>  When you think you have lost everything, look again.  Helplessness will not help you.  Be resourceful and benefit from all that you have.  Even if it is something insignificant, it will be useful, even if all you have left is yourself.  You have to defend yourself, because life is not always fair. <br><br>  Not always will rescue a group of rescuers;  be a sailor who fights the waves and knows where to change direction in order to be safe. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">In the film "Terminal"</font> </h2><br>  Here he plays the role of Victor Naworski, a resourceful man who comes to the United States from Cracoja.  The problem of the hero is that he cannot return home because of the start of the civil war in his native country, but cannot be in the States, so he has to live for 9 months at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.  Fuel to the fire adds language barrier. <br><br>  We usually represent the airport half way to the destination.  But for Victor, the airport temporarily became a stop.  Thanks to his mercy, the hero was able to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/3-dorogi-skvoz-ad/">tolerate injustice</a> towards himself.  Despite all the difficulties, the airport becomes home to the hero. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSometimes you catch a small fish.  You get her very neat.  And let go back into the water.  She is now free, and someone else can now catch her. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In this case, Victor is a ‚Äúlittle fish.‚Äù  This passage shows how obediently Victor kept the law of a foreign country, even in those moments when he was provoked to violate order. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">In the movie "Terribly loud and unbearably close"</font> </h2><br>  <i><b>"If any thing can be easily found, it is not worth it."</b></i> <br><br>  The events of the film take place on September 11, 2001, during an attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  Tom Hanks plays Thomas Shell.  Despite the fact that Shell‚Äôs image is far from central to the film, and he dies at the very beginning, his death teaches his son, Oscar, to accept sadness as an integral part of life in order to be happy without feeling guilty. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOne who does not want to believe, nothing will convince.  But who wants to have something to cling to " </blockquote><br>  Oscar is tormented by constant thoughts about the death of his father and the memories of his mother.  Losing a dad gives Oscar the opportunity to realize that loved ones help cope with loneliness. <br><br>  No one can do everything on their own.  Be ready to receive knowledge from those sources from where you would not even think to draw it.  Appreciate those who care about you, be it parents, friends, teachers or caregivers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Thanks, Tom Hanks</font> </h2><br>  What unites all these films? <br><br>  They are the best show optimism and ability to survive.  They remind us that being lonely and being alone is two different things, and even though we need the support of others, being alone is sometimes useful too.  Sometimes this is the best way to know yourself. <br><br>  Never give up!  Forrest continued to run.  Chuck lived to tell a story about his loneliness on the island.  Victor found a home even when he seemed to have lost it forever.  Thomas Schell left interesting puzzles to his child so that he would not focus on his death and continue to explore the world. <br><br>  Learn to be happy, being alone or with a friend, enjoying the memories or the present time.  Without rain, there is no rainbow, and the truth will always be found. <br><br>  This article is a translation <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/4-times-tom-hanks-totally-made-us-re-evaluate-our-attitude-towards-life/">from here</a> . <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the subject of work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-potryasayushhix-biznes-urokov-ot-izvestnogo-predprinimatelya/">10 amazing business lessons from a well-known entrepreneur</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304834/</a></p>
