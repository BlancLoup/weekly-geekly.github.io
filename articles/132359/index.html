      The authors investigated and identified the common features of three dozen companies, which, thanks to their originality and creativity, divided the entire industry into two halves: themselves and all the rest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main points are as follows: <br><br>  1. The heart of all these companies is a <b>great idea</b> and its <b>values</b> , which are not just spelled out and forgotten, but reinforced by inflexible faith.  These companies have the courage to give up short-term opportunities for the sake of preserving their values.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãform the internal culture of the company.  And culture is something that is very difficult for competitors to adopt.  Thus, competition evolves to a qualitatively new level.  From competition of goods and services, and then competition of business models, to competition of ideologies and values. <br><br>  2. During the globalization and mass development of social networks, these companies understand how important it is to be <b>open</b> .  In a group of people, the potential for creativity is always much higher than that of a single person.  Therefore, it is very important to realize the architecture of complicity, which makes it possible to use the knowledge of as many people as possible inside and outside the company.  ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù to a common distributed mind as an endless source of new ideas.  Wikipedia;  open source software;  Sites where professionals from all over the world compete, learn from each other and solve the most difficult tasks for the sake of recognition and reward - these are examples of such an architecture. <br><br>  3. The openness of the company requires a more <b>open management style</b> .  The leader has to impose restrictions on his ego.  Otherwise, he will not be able to consider, understand and use ideas outside of his world view.  It is very important in the search for new ideas to interact with people least like you. <br><br>  4. In pursuit of cost reductions, a reduction in the cost of products, an expansion of the sales market, and the fight against competitors, managers often forget about the most important thing - the <b>customer</b> .  Make the feelings and emotions of the client unforgettable, exceeding all expectations and not like anything else from the first to the last second of contact with you.  Create a psychological contact with the consumer, and he will remain your loyal supporter for a long time, despite the higher price or the complete lack of advertising.  At the same time, we should not forget an important point: an organization cannot have happy and satisfied customers if its employees are unhappy and not happy.  Therefore, you need to start with the sensations and emotions of people within the company. <br><br>  5. The company itself has no ideas, <b>people</b> have ideas.  Experience shows that the top five in their field will achieve more than a hundred middle peasants.  All smaller groups of people can create more and more amazing things.  Therefore, the level of people working in the company is of paramount importance.  It should not be forgotten that not only professional skills, but also human qualities are important.  After all, "Who are you" beats "What do you know." <br><br>  The most important thought for me after reading was the following. <br><br>  It is not necessary to open your company to be a Maverick.  Whatever you do and whatever position you currently occupy, jump over your head, put all your energy and creativity into the performance of today's tasks, make any contact with you unforgettable.  And if it enters into the daily habit - the result will not take long! <br><br>  <b>Quotes:</b> <br><blockquote>  Great minds discuss ideas.  Average minds discuss events.  Small minds discuss people. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  It‚Äôs hard for you to learn how to get it. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Passion and peace things. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Be ambitious.  Be a leader.  But do not belittle others in your pursuit of your ambitions. </blockquote><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132359/</a></p>
