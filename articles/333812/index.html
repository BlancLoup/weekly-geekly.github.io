  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About design in mobile applications (with the eyes, mind and heart of the developer)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the vastness of the network you can find a huge amount of very different information about the design of mobile applications: about the basic principles, trends, fresh ideas, role models, etc.  So this publication is not about that. <br><br>  I often hear that the design for a mobile application is in fact not so important.  The functionality, quality of the code and the overall architecture in the project and other technical nuances are important, and the design is not so important in the end it's just the look of the application and I disagree.  In my opinion the design is no less important. <br><br>  In this publication, I want to share with you my opinion on this matter and how, in my opinion, the interaction between the development and design teams should be built. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my opinion, design affects, if not all, then many other aspects of the application, which ultimately affects the quality of the product being developed.  And then, may the reader forgive me, I can not fail to cite this quote: <br><blockquote>  Design is not how the product looks and perceived.  Design is how it works.  Steve jobs </blockquote><br>  I propose to go together on some aspects of the applications and think about how the design affects one or another aspect.

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><br>  So, why do we use software products in general and mobile applications in particular?  The answer is simple - because we need some functions of this or that application. <br>  How would a design define functionality?  No way!  All functions of the application must be described in the requirements, TOR or specifications. <br><br>  But let's not hurry and look at it from the other side.  Suppose there is some excellent functionality in the application (for example, let it be sending feedback about the service received in some application aggregator), but you cannot find that section of the application where this can be done.  But after all, those features of the application that the user never found in the application are, in fact, capabilities that are not in this application for this user.  And what if such users are not one but 5 people or 10%? <br><br>  Consider another point.  There are two applications with similar functionality (let it be some kind of map or navigator) and in one application the zoom and return buttons to the user's location are located so that you can easily use them with your thumb, which you hold the smartphone with and the second application These buttons are less convenient.  Which application will the user choose?  Is it important for you that people use your application? <br><br><h2>  Architecture </h2><br>  Most people who participate in the development process in one way or another will agree that it is very important to properly design the application architecture.  This architecture will become a kind of framework or foundation that will help to predict and prevent some problems during development.  Of course, not everyone, but from this good architecture does not become less important.  And I also agree that a well-thought-out architecture is extremely important. <br><br>  What does the design have to do with it?  So after all these things are directly related.  What will be the basis of the application itself: tabs at the bottom or sidebar with sections?  What data will the server transfer to us?  And in what form will it transmit certain data? <br><br>  I am sure that the person responsible for designing the architecture will be useful to know what we will show the user in which sections.  And of course it would be better for him to immediately see the whole design and can even appreciate the clickable layout, otherwise some trifle can provoke an explosion of emotions and the need for major revisions in an almost finished architecture. <br>  How does all this scale further? <br><br><h2>  And much more... </h2><br>  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how to express or convey this to those who still doubt the importance of quality design.  The success of the project depends not only on how clean the code is in this project and how few bugs it has.  Yes, of course, if you have developed an application on demand, then this is important.  But in this case, the customer must understand that future users of the application you are developing for him do not care how clean the code is in this project.  Yes, critical errors will upset the user, but if it is convenient and functional, the user may wait until you correct the most unpleasant of errors.  And if your application is written perfectly and there is not a single error in the code, but the user simply cannot figure out how to use it, he will soon delete it. <br><br>  For these reasons, I think design is half the application. <br><br><h2>  How to deal with this? </h2><br>  In my opinion, the errors described above can be avoided due to the maximum interaction between developers and designers. <br><br><h3>  What should be the first step in creating a design? </h3><br>  What should a designer do when he starts work on a new project?  In my opinion this is not wireframes.  First of all, the designer must be a user of the platform / device under which he was assigned to draw the layout.  For example, if this application is for iPhone, then it is desirable that the designer uses this device in everyday life. <br><br><h3>  Great, designer user of this platform.  What's next? </h3><br>  Can the designer now finally start creating wireframes?  No, he can not.  First, the designer needs to take this gadget, find and install several modern applications and study their design.  First you need to find some ideas and, however banal it may sound, inspiration. <br><br><h3>  Now we are starting to create wireless frames. </h3><br>  In my opinion, designers and developers should be in constant contact and interaction from this stage of work on the application until the very completion of the project.  If the designer constantly asks some questions about his ideas and sketches, he will receive feedback at an early stage, which will help the developer start to think through the structure of the project earlier, which is important for the quality of the code. <br><br><h3>  We have approved wireframes. </h3><br>  Great, we can proceed to the design itself.  Here, the designer must accurately interact and consult with the developers.  Mutual assistance will never be superfluous in the team, right?  Developers, by their own experience, can predict potential design flaws or too nontrivial places and design difficulties.  In addition, developers are aware of some interesting tools (of course, I mean tools for creating UI), which help to make great applications and should share this knowledge with designers. <br><br>  Developers and designers together should think about each section of the application.  Suppose the designer has prepared sketches for a list.  What will it look like if there is no data to display?  Or too much data?  How will it look on screen more / less? <br><br><h3>  Design is ready </h3><br>  What next?  In my opinion, now the developer who will be involved in this project should conduct a review of the models.  Some of the errors can be avoided by carefully examining and thinking through everything that was created by the designer.  Now that the designer and the developer have helped each other not to do something stupid, ready-made layouts can be submitted for approval. <br><br><h3>  Design approved </h3><br>  Fine.  In my opinion now and only now you can begin to develop the project.  Sometimes, the design needs to be slightly edited, because some nuances only appeared during the development process.  Again, developers must constantly interact with designers.  Yes, of course, developers can themselves use some typical solutions to make these changes on their own.  But let's respect each other's work.  Surely the designer had some kind of global idea or concept for the overall look of the application.  Every small edit inappropriate within the framework of this idea can spoil the appearance of the application.  And surely the developer of this may simply not notice, his head is occupied by others.  Such changes must be approved by the design team so that all minor edits will be within the framework of the initially chosen idea or concept.  This is very important for the user‚Äôs first impression of the application. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  These are the thoughts about the importance of design in mobile development, I have formed as experience has appeared in the creation of various applications.  In no case will I argue that it is this approach to design and development that can be the right one.  Nevertheless, all the conclusions appeared as a result of one or another experience in the development, so perhaps my conclusions will help someone to avoid some mistakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333812/</a></p>
