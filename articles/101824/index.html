Until 2009, the use of Twitter was an important factor in the promotion of websites or companies in social media.  Twittered almost everything. <br><br>  If '08 and '09 is the era of Twitter taking off, then '10 and '11 may become known as the years of the same success for Tumblr, as it shows the same signs of becoming very popular.

      Tumblr seems to be approaching a critical point, after which it will start to have wide popularity and become mainstream ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  This is what the main Tumblr interface now looks like: </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4a/c33/544/e4ac33544eee923d3bebfc701ac4d2b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>The peak of July, 1.5 billion page views,</strong> is likely to be broken in August, and then in September, and for the foreseeable future, Tumblr should keep up the pace. <br><br>  But will he keep the same active growth? <br><br><h5>  The road is 1.5 billion views ... </h5><br>  Launched in March 2007 by David Karp and lead developer Marco Arment, Tumblr has come a long way.  Less than a year ago, the Tumblr project was accused of ‚Äúsquandering‚Äù $ 10 million in capital investments, and gave little hope for positive results. <br><br>  But something happened in early 2010 ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7a/e65/d97/d7ae65d9740b0d25b12dd64e3a00c1fb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Over the past 6 months, Tumblr has doubled the number of page views.</strong> <br><br>  Tumblr is a social media news site: more content than is possible on Twitter, but less so than a regular blog.  No matter how difficult and thorny the Tumblr path was, people begin to notice it.  Quote from the New York Times: "Tumblr is a new competitor to Twitter and Facebook." <br><br><h5>  What makes Tumblr different? </h5><br>  AOL blog about Tumblr: <br><br>  - ‚ÄúFor those who are looking for new ways to express their thoughts and interests, as well as the distribution of social materials, Tumblr is an ideal choice among blogging platforms.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2010/08/08/is-tumblr-the-new-twitter/">Sitepoint asks</a> : <br><br>  - ‚ÄúIs tumblr a new Twitter?‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/reviews/2010/081310-.html">NetworkWorld comments on</a> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt times, I was starting to feel that Tumblr is what Facebook should be: simple to use, easily customizable, and with a rich set of functions, without restrictions on the number of words in a post, and with much less strict restrictions on the size of a photo.‚Äù . <br><br>  That‚Äôs the key to Tumblr‚Äôs success.  AOL called it a blogging platform, Sitepoint compared it with Twitter, and NetworkWorld in turn with Facebook. <br><br>  Many use Tumblr as a simple alternative to Wordpress, Blogger, Typepad as well as other blog services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b19/73f/6ee/b1973f6ee85bb4e131f3f04e4f3ae7d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tumblr is convenient and has many integration options that allow you to not spend too much time on blogging. <br><br>  For some, Tumblr has become an alternative to Twitter, but without an absolute limit of 140 characters.  Unlike Twitter, videos and images can be placed directly on the pages of the service, rather than a link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e12/8b7/915/e128b7915c1125e69f104dd4c448cf1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Others use it as a community: the site is similar to Vox and Ning (social blog hosting).  Although the aspect of certain communities on Tumblr is not so developed, participants are still extremely active and loyal to each other. <br><br>  Perhaps the biggest difference between Tumblr and other social sites is the ‚Äúreblogging‚Äù tool (approx. ‚ÄúRepost‚Äù).  As with Facebook, you can take the content of the post that you find on Tumblr, and instantly send it to your own blog - just a couple of mouse clicks. <br><br><h6>  Is this a blog?  Microblogging?  Social network? </h6><br>  This is the lack of identities that make Tumblr unique. <br><br><h5>  Who uses tumblr? </h5><br><h6>  Major Tumblr Media </h6><ul><li>  Newsweek </li><li>  The atlantic </li><li>  Life </li><li>  Huffington post </li><li>  The new yorker </li><li>  Elle </li><li>  Village voice </li><li>  NYTimes (coming soon) </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Companies that start using Tumblr (mostly small and medium enterprises are now represented, but corporations will soon be living on Tumblr, as was the case with Twitter) </h6><ul><li>  The auto insiders </li><li>  Sencha </li><li>  HR Violations </li><li>  TK Carsites </li><li>  Smarter cities </li><li>  Chemical Free Skinny </li><li>  Your Nutritionista </li><li>  From Dimes to Dollars </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Summing up </h5><br>  Over the years, Wordpress has been a favorite social blogging platform for many users.  His blogging features, abundance of themes and plugins have made him a natural choice for those who have the desire to spread messages, express thoughts and ideas, and just share their personal photos or videos on the pages of their blog.  But Tumblr is not a bad alternative, because he can also offer all of this.  And even more. <br><br><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img193/565/themesx.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Over the past few months, many of those who have had the common sense to use such traffic generators as Digg, Reddit, and StumbleUpon have now turned to Tumblr as their preferred content platform.  In the past 30 days, various materials from Tumblr blogs <strong>have gone to Digg's main page 53 times, adding 1.4 million unique visitors to Tumblr</strong> . <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  The initial question, ‚ÄúWill Tumblr maintain the same rapid growth?‚Äù Still in the air. <br><br>  Integrating components with other sites makes distributing content easier and more accessible on sites outside of Tumblr.  When registering, you are offered a subdomain tumblr.com, or free hosting - this gives an advantage that not all social sites can offer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/435/59b/3e0/43559b3e09b5a31e53ccfb1f2fb7b8ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, it seems that Tumblr will be profitable.  Like many of its competitors, it does not seem to be a clear methodology for obtaining profits from it. <br><br>  Many have already called Tumblr "the next big thing."  If this does not happen, he may sink into the abyss, as quickly as his popularity has increased recently. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Free translation of <a href="http://www.focus.com/briefs/other/mainstream-social-media-pushing-tumblr-tipping-point/">material on focus.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101824/</a></p>
