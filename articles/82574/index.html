Experience One: Office Hours</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>There was a photo found in a Google search for <b>Office Hours</b> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It was placed here solely for the purpose of drawing attention to the topic.</i>  <i>Not recommended for children and impressionable girls.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But there were too many of them on Habr√© and I deleted the <a href="">picture</a> .</i>  <i>:)</i> <br><br>  Google Wave is often blamed for the unusual interface, the complexity of development and the difficulty of use.  Evil tongues even say that Google has attracted many developers to test the early developer version of the Wave (the so-called "sandboxes"), so that they quickly figure out how to use it in business.  :) <br><br>  Well, even if this witty thought is correct, the Googler idea was again successful.  There are attempts and the first real-world experience of using a new hi-tech tool for solving a variety of real-world problems: The wave is used as an analog of mail, forums, IM, chat, mail groups and electronic mailings, as a commenting system, as an independent CMS and for embedding waves into existing CMS, for organizing user support and organizing feedback on websites, for lectures, seminars, etc.  educational purposes, for business planning and programming, for blogging and subject journals, for collaborating on documents and for translation, for joint planning of trips, for searching for escaped criminals, for casual games, for creating a system of netting and bills of exchange, for accommodating joint orders from online stores and auctions, for online support of conferences and other events in "real reality", for ... <br>  In general, I can continue to list the real-world applications of Google Wave for so long, given the excellent extensibility of the Wave and the presence of several APIs (for robots, gadgets, for implementation and integration with browsers).

      <i>Excuse (disclaimer).</i>  <i>No, I am not a blind Google fan and I see perfectly the limitations inherent in the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Wave, and the imperfection of its current implementation.</i>  <i>I also see that not only we are white and fluffy, we are thinking about using the waves for our own purposes.</i>  <i>Spammers, vandals, ‚Äúshkolota‚Äù, hackers and privacy violators, Big Brother and other ‚Äúevil Pinocchio‚Äù are already there.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But I am sure that we need to solve our problems with the available tools, instead of talking about their imperfections, removing the blame for inaction.</i>  <i>It is better to regret the mistakes made, than about the unrealized opportunities.</i> <br><br>  It looks like it's time to compile a use case directory, i.e.  how waves are used.  Today we will talk about one of the very first ‚Äúyuzkeys‚Äù - the so-called <b>Google Wave API Office Hours</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúBusiness hours‚Äù (Google Wave API Office Hours) are discussions that are held for wave developers by the Google Wave team.  Every two weeks in the sandbox (wavesandbox.com) a wave opens, in which competent specialists from the Google Wave Team are present for an hour.  You can ask them questions and promptly receive answers to them.  Usually the topic of discussion is announced in advance.  The schedule is also known in advance and you can subscribe to receive notifications of the beginning. <br><br>  Key features of this yuzkeys: <br>  a) simultaneous presence in the online leading (or leading) and participants of the wave.  This OH is like a chat, but in a chat there is usually no hierarchy of participants, separation into leading and non-leading (unknowing :). <br>  b) a clear time limit for the stock.  And time is allocated a little - up to an hour and a half.  This OH differs from "wave marathons", which we will talk about next time. <br>  c) the question-response nature of the work.  This is not some kind of joint activity planning, progress report, or decision meeting.  It is rather a consultation. <br><br>  In theory, exactly an hour later, the discussion closes.  In reality, of course, no one bothers you to continue writing blips in this wave even after the official hour is over.  Sometimes Googlers even read them and write answers.  Often, by the end of the OH, the breathless participants appear (he himself was more than once) and begin to write their own urgent questions, but as a rule, none of the Googlers respond to this wave. <br><br>  Usually in each Office Hours several members of the Sydney team participate.  Participation is a blurry concept.  At the very least, their avatars are added to the wave, and whether they really read the discussion at the moment is unknown :).  The current implementation of the wave protocol and the Google wave client do not allow us to understand whether this user is currently in a given wavelength or simply logged in to the wave account. <br><br>  I assume that this way of using Wave has grown out of internal discussions between members of the Google Wave team.  At some point, it became clear that this way it is possible to discuss problems not only within a narrow project team, but also with an amorphous mass of external developers admitted to the alpha version of GW. <br><br>  <i>Pros:</i> this is a good opportunity to directly contact the ‚Äúoriginal sources‚Äù, to get fresh and unofficial information about the current state of affairs, prompt response to a specific question or advice that solves your difficulties. <br><br>  <i>Cons: a</i> non-permanent composition of the leading and even more unpredictable composition of participants.  Some OH are numerous and pass very rapidly, while others turn into a light chatter of two or three people about this and that. <br><br>  With the obvious usefulness and importance of these events, participation in them may present some difficulties for users of exUSSR: the conversation is conducted in English, the meeting time is early morning or late evening Moscow time, topics are limited mainly to the development of gadgets and robots for the Wave, discussion takes place in the sandbox, where not everyone has access. <br><br><hr><br>  Those who want to test this use case for themselves are invited to participate in a kind of experiment - trying to transfer the experience of conducting Office Hours to our ‚Äúnative soil‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>February 1, 2010 in Wave will host the first thematic online meeting of the community of Russian-language developers and users of Google Wave.</b>  Starting our series of meetings, we will try to create a supplement to the official Office Hours, devoid of the local shortcomings described above.  We hope that this will allow newcomers to actively work with Google Wave, to gain experience in using Wave in the mode of group meetings (conferences, workshops, distance learning, working with consumers, etc.) and more closely introduce the participants of the ‚ÄúRussian waves‚Äù to each other. with a friend. <br><br>  So, on Monday, February 1, 2010 at 10:00 Moscow time, we are opening the first wave on googlewave.com.  It will work in active mode for 1 hour, then it will be transferred to the read-only status.  Wave address - <a href="http://goo.gl/KbTl">goo.gl/KbTl</a> <br><br>  The task of the first meeting is an introductory one, therefore the topic of this wave is not rigidly defined.  We suggest you prepare any questions that you have matured while exploring Google Wave.  Your thoughts and suggestions on the very idea and format of the Russian-speaking Office Hours are also welcome. <br><br>  Leading the first wave will be (alphabetically): <br>  - Vadim Barsukov (vadbars, Ekaterinburg), <br>  - Alexander Belozor (ABel, St. Petersburg), <br>  - Maxim Vasiliev (qMax, Novosibirsk), <br>  - Vadim Gerasimov (gerculanum, head of the API development team for Google Wave Gadgets, Sydney), <br>  - Vladimir Ivanov (elGephest, Kiev), <br>  - Evgeny Smolanka (eugene, Uzhgorod). <br><br>  Alexey Shelestenko (Google Russia), Dmitro Sholomko (Google Ukraine), GTUG offices of Russia and Ukraine, Alexey Ivankin, Sergey Kayuk, Anton Shaleev, Pavel Prudnikov and others were also invited to participate in the project. <br><br>  It is assumed that such meetings will be periodic and will be held once every two weeks.  The composition of the lead, as well as the subject matter will vary.  If you feel that you are ready to become a presenter and tell about your experience in a certain issue - suggest a topic and a date.  Discussion of the project can be carried out in the Wave - <a href="http://goo.gl/ande">goo.gl/ande</a> , or in the Google GWR <a href="http://goo.gl/mBv9">group</a> - <a href="http://goo.gl/mBv9">goo.gl/mBv9</a> <br><br>  See you in Wave! <br><br>  So, put in the calendar: <b>February 1, 2010 at 10:00 Moscow time</b> , <a href="http://goo.gl/KbTl">goo.gl/KbTl</a> <br>  <a href="http://goo.gl/4uDR">Office Hours Online Meeting</a> <br><hr><br>  <b>Upd .:</b> The meeting took place.  If you do not have access to Wave, you can read the record of the discussion in plain text here - <a href="http://goo.gl/vx9v">goo.gl/vx9v</a> <br>  The most interesting (in my opinion) news: <br>  - Perhaps the imminent appearance of the russified version of Google Wave (the menu and messages will be in Russian). <br>  - After about 2 weeks, support for new Python and Java APIs for robots will be added to the API.  Wave should work much faster on Chrome. <br>  - With the following restart in the "preview", a new feature will be added (now it is only in the sandbox): Extensions folder with a list of the most useful gadgets and robots. <br>  - Vadim Gerasimov will be a guest of the wave marathon on February 23 of this year. <br><br>  And the next meeting of the Russian Office Hours will be held <b>on February 15 at 10:00 Moscow time</b> .  The event is likely to get its own name (what? - discussed in the wave <a href="http://goo.gl/ande">goo.gl/ande</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82574/</a></p>
