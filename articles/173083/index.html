      Applications like WeChat, LINE, Kakao, Zoosk, Badoo, Find My Friends and Facebook are leading a new wave of growth in social networking applications.  And some of them have already begun to benefit from this growth, very successfully monetizing their applications. <br><br>  Over the past year, applications in the Social Networks category have significantly increased in the Apple App Store: the category took the third place in terms of revenue in January 2013, falling behind only Games and Productivity.  For comparison, a year ago, she was already in 12th place.  Thus, the category showed 87% growth compared with January 2012, and moreover it is 3% of the total revenue in the iOS App Store. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbe/e7b/2e3/cbee7b2e3977fe49a617bb4f2d62d78f.jpg"><br><br>  While worldwide revenue grew gradually, in Japan there was a tenfold increase in revenue during the year.  Not the last role in this growth was played by the success of LINE.  Voice / text messenger LINE climbed to the top iOS in Japan at the beginning of 2012, in April he was in Top Grossing and never went down from there. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a76/7a9/c57/a767a9c57b29e7ee14a6e99bafc12d0a.png"><br><br>  At the same time, a huge growth potential is also observed in China: monthly downloads of social applications in this country have doubled over the past year. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bcb/800/665/bcb800665f5071365268702791732e14.png"><br>  A huge space for further development is the fact that publishers are finally beginning to turn out to convert downloads into bank notes.  Over the past year, the growth in revenue from such applications surpassed the growth of the audience of these applications (just a haven for business), as well as the growth in revenue of most other categories.  What definitely makes this category of applications the next after games a tasty morsel for publishers. <br><br>  Monthly downloads of applications in social networking are growing by 30% annually, and at the moment they represent 5% of the total downloads on the iOS App Store.  Such growth may not look as impressive as the other categories, but it says that the category has reached a certain level of maturity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/695/ab0/187/695ab018745b05daa3c5c1a40549fd87.jpg"><br>  In fact, half of all downloads in the social networking category fall on just two countries: the United States and China.  Revenues in this category in China are so far minimal, most likely the growth in revenues there will be exactly this year.  It is also worth noting that the social networking market in China is represented mainly by local publishers. <br><br>  Last year, the Facebook application ranked first in downloads, and a year later Facebook Messenger took this place.  Building a user base around a whole group of applications (Facebook, Instgram, Facebook Messenger, Facebook Poke) was the key to successful monetization through advertising. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/770/2ae/82d/7702ae82dab32400dcb17cebd2eb4943.jpg"><br>  Apple's application, Find My Friends, demonstrates excellent growth. Over the year, it has risen from 15th to 2nd.  This success is largely due to the very aggressive marketing of Apple native apps with the release of iOS 6. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00e/e21/a84/00ee21a8458c3d0c60a77051b9a13772.png"><br>  Another application that tested the love of users was the Chinese equivalent of WhatsApp - WeChat.  It ranked first in the category of social networking in China and became widespread in many countries of Central Asia and South-East Asia.  By the way, the developers of WeChat - Tencent are planning to expand to the west, namely in the US. <br><br>  The first 10 applications in terms of income in the Social Networks category consists of a variety of instant messengers and data services.  LINE unexpectedly overthrew the leading WhatsApp line due to a wide selection of IAPs.  While WhatsApp chose a rather interesting way to monetize: it cost 99 cents on iOS, and on Android it was offered for free, after a year of use, the user was asked to renew the subscription for 99 cents. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the monetization of social applications is on the agenda of many analysts, who are dominated by a load of attracted investments.  One thing is clear, now there is a wide field for innovations in the field of receiving revenue from this segment. <br><br>  Interspersed with instant messengers, top share their offers.  All the giants of the sphere such as Badoo, eHarmony and Match.com perfectly coexist with appy for gays like Grindr Xtra and Scruff.  The rating has already established itself as a very profitable business on the web, and it is not surprising that it also feels quite comfortable on mobile platforms. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2d/e72/2ce/f2de722ce529ed9d049070a11f3a2b56.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173083/</a></p>
