It was solved only in rare cases.  But that all changed after scientists learned how to decipher the human DNA and compare the results obtained with the data of other transcripts. <br><br>  Quickly realizing the commercial viability of the DNA decryption technology, services began to appear, offering the search for relatives or the identification of the likelihood of the occurrence <a href="https%253A%252F%252Farstechnica.com%252F%26xtz%3D-120%26abp%3D1">of a disease</a> .  In the courts solving family problems, they began to file documents on DNA coincidence in large quantities, which helped to resolve the issue of problem paternity and motherhood.  No cost and no funny situations.  For example, two friends who met nearly 60 years ago learned that they were brothers to their mother.  A woman who was looking for relatives <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/woman-takes-ancestry-com-dna-test-learns-her-real-dad-is-her-moms-doctor/">found out</a> that her father was a doctor who treated her own mother for infertility. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A woman named Kelly Roulett decided to use the services of the site Ancestry.com in July 2017.  Actually, she wanted to find distant relatives about whom she knew nothing.  The Roulett family was complete, and it was raised by both the father and the mother.  After the service analyzed the data entered by the woman, he showed that there is a coincidence of the category ‚Äúchild-parents‚Äù.  This surprised Kelly, she even told her family that the service was not working properly.

      In fact, Ancestry worked just perfectly - the fact is that Kelly Roulett herself was not aware of the problems of the parents before her birth.  And the problems were - three decades ago, the father and mother could not conceive a child.  After a large number of attempts and disappointments, the young family decided to begin treatment for infertility.  In 1980, future parents turned to a doctor in Idaho.  The doctor's name was Herald Mortimer. <br><br>  He found that both the young man and his wife had problems, so it‚Äôs not surprising that they couldn‚Äôt conceive a child.  The couple agreed to undergo the procedure of artificial insemination of the egg.  Moreover, they decided to take the seed donor, since the young man had almost unsolvable problems with the number and activity of sperm.  The couple wanted the donor to be high, with a higher education.  There was a request regarding the eye color of the future biological father - they were supposed to be blue. <br><br>  After some time, the doctor said that the donor was found, and the expectant mother underwent several artificial insemination procedures.  The procedure was successful and the girl became pregnant, giving birth to Rowlett in May 1981. <br><br>  Over the next few years, the doctor watched the patient.  Some time after the birth of the daughter, the couple managed to have a second child.  The family moved to Washington state.  The patient, cured by the doctor, informed him of the move, and Mortimer suddenly started crying, which was very strange.  Only now, after the situation had cleared up, it became clear why the doctor was crying - he, of course, knew that he had a daughter and regretted moving the family to a place where he could not see his daughter. <br><br>  In 2017, when Roulett told her parents about the strange results provided by the DNA service, they told her about all their misadventures.  The parents of the woman, like herself, were simply dumbfounded - no one thought that the father of the child was the mother‚Äôs former doctor in attendance.  By the way, he has brown eyes and medium height.  Thus, the criteria for donor selection do not coincide with the wishes of the client - only the criterion of higher education converges. <br><br>  Now the family is suing the doctor and his company, demanding financial compensation for moral injury of $ 75,000. The court also accused Mortimer of violating medical ethics and deceiving his clients.  Almost immediately after the start of the case, the doctor was dismissed from the company.  It is clear that the organization could not know about this case and the role of its employee in it. <br><br>  Leave a comment on the topic and the Ancestry service: ‚ÄúWe provide accurate results, however, people may be surprised and confused after receiving their data.  Ancestry is not the owner of the downloaded information, the rights to it belong to the customer.  Any client can be sure that the data will be available only to him and to no one else. ‚Äù <br><br>  The company is the largest genealogical organization in the world.  It acts as a network of genealogical and historical records of websites operating in the United States and nine other countries.  She works since 1997.  At the moment, the company provides access to billions of records. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371405/</a></p>
