A few hours later, a certain Mrs. Susan Williams responded to my ad and assured me in broken Russian that she seriously intends to buy my lens for a very seductive amount of $ 360 (a little higher than the one I indicated on Avito), and also pay the shipping cost abroad in the amount of 100 dollars. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will cite here our correspondence: <br><blockquote>  Susan Williams susanw87@gmail.com <br>  Is the product still for sale? <br><br>  Dmitriy <br>  The lens is sold, as a gift, a hood and a light filter.  box and all documents in stock <br><br>  Susan Williams susanw87@gmail.com <br>  how much do you have for sale and what is the cost in US dollars <br>  how much do you need for sale

I will send a PayPal payment to send me my PayPal email, so I can send a payment now.  I'm waiting for a PayPal email, so I can send the payment, and you can send the goods <br><br>  I will pay you $ 360.00 for the item and I will send you your paypal email so I can send you the payment now. the item and you can ship the item <br><br>  Dmitriy <br>  to which country will i need to send the parcel? <br><br>  Susan Williams susanw87@gmail.com <br>  Here are the details of the package. <br>  Name Daniel Olusegun Peter <br>  Address No. 22 Adams Street Dugbe <br>  City Ibadan <br>  Oyo State <br>  Zipode 23402 <br>  Country of Nigeria. <br>  I am waiting for a PayPal email, so I can send a payment and you can send the goods <br>  This is the shipment details <br>  Name Daniel Olusegun Peter <br>  Address No 22 Adams Street Dugbe <br>  City ibadan <br>  State oyo <br>  Zipode 23402 <br>  Country Nigeria. <br>  I‚Äôm waiting for the paypal email so I can send you the item <br></blockquote><br><br>  After what I saw, I had great doubts about the good faith of her intentions, especially because of the address of the country to which I was supposed to send a package with a lens, moreover, a completely different name was indicated there, which allowed Suzanna to be brought to clean water.  It was necessary only to break through this name and address in Google and voila, here they are, fraudsters from Nigeria.  My last message to Susanna was a laconic wish of good luck in all of her (or his) endeavors. <br><br>  <i>And here is the information that I found by searching for these Nigerian scammers:</i> <br><br>  In some cases, allegedly a man wants to give his beloved son a gift that lives in Nigeria.  In another case, this is an English pilot, whose daughter lives in Nigeria, and he also wants to give her a gift.  In the third, most interesting situation, our Nigerian says that he himself lives in Scotland, but wants to send the purchased camera to the house for orphans in West Africa as an act of charity (they say, donate something useful for the development of children).  Well, the scenario, I see, in all cases is almost the same, only the heroes change. <br><br>  He also always asks you to send your goods using the services of Russian Post or EMC (he refuses from FedEx and DHL) and asks for your bank details or PayPal email address, for which he must transfer the agreed money. <br>  Those ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù who manage to send their belongings later receive a letter from the user RoyalBankOfScotland.com, which states that the agreed amount was deducted from the account of the Royal Bank of Scotland and that the bank will transfer the amount to the account immediately after receiving confirmation from you goods.  In this case, the bank assures that the buyer (Nigerian) will not be able to cancel or cancel the payment. <br><br>  Naturally, neither the day nor the week after the money comes to the account, and the bank says that they need to check the delivery first, and that the delay of the transfer is due to this. <br>  After the fraudsters make sure that the fish is on the hook and the parcel is sent, they again resume the correspondence on behalf of the bank, apologize for the delay and say that for some reason they have written off the invoice for the unspecified amount and a few hundred dollars more and offer to send this surplus to the bank.  At this place, even the most naive people, in my opinion, should think and not rush to continue to give them their blood savings. <br><br>  Lastly, I will say that the <b>first reports of fraudulent activities relate to February 2011 and continue to appear on the Internet to this day</b> , since then quite a few Russians and residents of the CIS have been killed by the actions of these cunning Nigerians.  Faced with a similar situation, I did not remain indifferent and decided to make life easier for people who decide to sell items that are expensive for them using free advertising boards or online auctions (especially it‚Äôs worth being vigilant to the owners of photographic equipment), therefore I collected the names and addresses known at the moment, under which crooks seem to be: <br><br>  <b>Name Daniel Olusegun Peter</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address No 22 Adams Street Dugbe</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zipode 23402</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country Nigeria.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>NAME: Jide Lanre Bosede</b> <b><br></b>  <b>ADDRESS: Under G Area</b> <b><br></b>  <b>CITY: Ogbomoso</b> <b><br></b>  <b>STATE: OYO STATE</b> <b><br></b>  <b>COUNTRY: NIGERIA</b> <b><br></b>  <b>ZIPCODE: 234038</b> <b><br></b>  <b>PHONE NUMBER: +2348060983416</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>lucazsandra@gmail.com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Name: Desmond Oladele</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Adresse: 32 bamigbase road</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Cit: Ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zip Code: 23402</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>danielluis505@gmail.com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Name: Adefisoye Titus</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address: No 56 Odi-Olowop Street</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: Osogbo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Osun State</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zip code: 23435</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Name: Mr Julious Mathew.O</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address: No 21 Faith Lord Highway Ministry</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: Ogbomoso</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigerian</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Postal code: 210001</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>leejosh2003@gmail.com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Name: Odewale Olas</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address: No.</b>  <b>2, Dugbe Road</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Postal Code: 23402</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: Ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State.</b>  <b>Oyo state</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>williams robert &lt;wllmsrobii02@gmail.com&gt;</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Name: Ola Williams</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address: No 8 Iremo Road Enuwa</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: ile-ife</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Osun State</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zip code: 234036</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Name: Mr.misson onuwa</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Address: 21 Samanda road</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: Ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br></b>  <b>zip - 23491</b> <b><br></b>  <b>tel - 2348131608000</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Name: Sani Danjuma</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Adresse: No.</b>  <b>21 Samonda Road</b> <b><br></b>  <b>City: Ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>State: Oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Country: Nigeria</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zipcode 23402</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Telefon-Nummer: 2348131608000</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>nick vincent nickvin11@gmail.com</b> <b><br></b>  <b>NAME: Kate Francis Oha</b> <b><br></b>  <b>ADDRESS: Idi Oro</b> <b><br></b>  <b>CITY: Ibadan</b> <b><br></b>  <b>STATE: Oyo</b> <b><br></b>  <b>COUNTRY: Nigeria</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Zip Code: 23402</b> <br><br>  There is also one simple piece of advice on how to avoid such a situation - Stay alert.  Firstly - as a rule, people who want to buy photo equipment from you on the websites of online auctions do not have a rating and only registered yesterday-today!  Secondly - as a rule, amounts of 1.5 are offered, or 2 times more than the real value.  The money is sent in some magical way :) Demand that money be transferred via Western Union (it will start moving out - a fraudster).  Thirdly, they either ask that they buy EMC from you or by selling it (as a rule, a package sent via EMC can be easily traced both to fraudsters and victims).  And thirdly, if you like to communicate, communicate with fraudsters, it is possible to get a deposit of 10 dollars from them, for example, and also to be lost. <br>  But in general, that's all that I can advise. <br><br>  <i><b>PS: The Prosecutor's Office, the Police and other organizations in 99% simply clog the bolt, and in 1% of the type makes a request, but refuse to initiate a criminal case.</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147677/</a></p>
