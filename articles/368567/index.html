Last time, when my wife and I washed the windows, I almost divorced :) Therefore, when it was time for the spring bathing, I tried to charge the robot with this whole wet procedure.  It was just in time, for the test they offered a wonderful automatic window washer - Hobot -188.  This is the youngest model in the line of trunks, although there was another predecessor before it, but now a more advanced one has appeared - a square shape.  He was already asking for a square for a long time, but in principle, Hobot-188 washes remarkably, I will tell you about it later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/486/185/909/4861859098654d13bcaa021667636ea6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hobot, what a funny name is for sale in a box (thanks to Cap).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79e/b6b/69b/79eb6b69b17548bbb0fff613703dc96e.jpg"><br><br>  It looks nothing unusual.  Well box and box.  In the picture it‚Äôs not even immediately clear its purpose.  And in general, until you try it in and do not make sure as a result, the attitude towards such a window washer is biased.  The mother-in-law immediately said - there will be divorces :) So, that I‚Äôm all running ahead, let's look into the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f56/84e/161/f5684e1618f94a9aaedc3e881610cdab.jpg"><br><br>  Here we have the trunk itself, without an elephant true, but already with a tail.  This tail consists of a paracord resemblance, only it seems to be without a core, well, we don‚Äôt jump on a parachute.  Power supply with extension and standard power cord and remote control.  And why the remote?  This is not a TV.  But more about that again later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/637/4b3/a20/6374b3a20c5349a5bdbd8bc51f0207d9.jpg"><br><br>  Oh, and a pair of interchangeable rings on which microfiber cloths are put on and a set of these napkins of 12 pieces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/944/1b7/e13/9441b7e133134bbb8c6b857c7cbe2bfa.jpg"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have a set of napkins for the test, but I did a great two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b1/910/eb5/3b1910eb51064150900249466f11f874.jpg"><br><br>  Additional rings in the photo did not hit, but there is nothing interesting, here you can see what it is and where to dress. <br><br>  There is also an instruction about which even on the trunk itself it is written that you must read it before turning it on!  But in fact there are only a couple of important points, or even three. <br><br>  1. That before using the device you need to charge. <br>  2. That you can not use it on glasses without frames (otherwise it will be drained from the edge and the skull). <br>  3. Where to click on the remote so that he began to wash the window. <br><br>  Well, the rope needs to be fixed somewhere for insurance, and so it is understandable.  And here's another thing, even though there is a battery there, it seems to be the same for securing, you need to wash the windows with the power supply connected, for this there is an extension cord of the power supply cord. <br><br>  You need to charge the battery only once, after opening the box, the very first time.  Battery charge time is 3 hours.  After charging, the green LED lights up.  With further use, pre-charging of the battery is not required, since  The device is powered through a network adapter.  The battery serves as a backup power source in case of loss of voltage in the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9be/356/d95/9be356d955bb4488abc94026595c0e12.jpg"><br><br>  In general, we figured out, it's time to suck this HeadCrab to the glass.  And he really sucks hard.  We turn on the power, the trunk squeals happily and after a couple of seconds roars with its motors, which drive the air through the napkins to the outside of the central exit nozzles.  Sucks to the glass, as I said tightly.  Then you have to press the topmost button on the remote and the trunk will crawl upwards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cc/961/80a/0cc96180a8a840ab834f27cf8398ebc4.jpg"><br><br>  He moves in small steps, alternately sticking to the glass with one or the other around the same time taking a step.  Climbing up is very funny.  Reaching the top, and resting on the side of the frame, he turns on his side and goes to the right side rail, rests against it and begins to reverse movement to the left side.  And so on all window, trying better to clean the places of transition from level to level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/373/752/931/37375293131d485e9f12438742760cab.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the advantage of the square shape.  The upper and lower corners of the frame remain unwashed.  But compared to the overall purity of the glass is nonsense.  Corners can be wiped with the cloth itself, if it is possible to reach it.  I, for example, have loggias on the loggias with a reverse angle, where it is very inconvenient to reach out with a mop and not to crawl at all.  I there, last time, dropped a mop on the street.  Well there was no one, and the 13th floor, by the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/5d5/707/4e45d5707dfc4b4e97ac415b85183c5a.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of washing quality.  I did not immediately let him out.  For starters, I tried on the mirror in the closet.  Last time, after washing with some domestic remedy, there remained a barely noticeable whitish bloom.  Trunk with his two cloths just soaked with water without any means to clean it off and did not leave any divorce.  I suspect the whole thing in a miracle microfibers + strong pressure due to powerful engines and good traction. <br><br>  The quality of washing the windows can be estimated from the photo.  Here are photos to: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/150/d3b/1da150d3beb24f02af96f40218b6187e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/ddd/edc/bf0dddedc38941d6b52b28a2d1df24e5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdb/709/78a/fdb70978accc444da7840a92239a57e4.jpg"><br><br>  And after: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19f/aea/e36/19faeae366074fe09e1c92e07a5e31bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/698/675/70f/69867570f9374076aaacc8207b23d93d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/721/fce/356/721fce3560ef45d4b8130a2c792d587d.jpg"><br><br>  Generally clean glass is difficult to photograph.  It turns out only manual focus and with careful selection of the background.  Some photos show dirt in the corners. This is how I said the lack of a round shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/b58/568/adab5856870a43a5943714a6c26e9504.jpg"><br><br>  Themselves better to wash cloth after each outer glass.  They collect dirt very well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/497/93e/484/49793e484fac4ed1a90d84984cdd9b8b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afb/55d/dcf/afb55ddcf9034af0a16df862acb3eaf8.jpg"><br><br>  The instructions generally speak about washing in a washing machine apparently, but remembering the student years and washing socks with soap and hands, they are easy to wash in a couple of minutes, and again to battle. <br>  On the inner parts of the windows so often they do not need to wash up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/b43/902/a31b43902ca942b99d71c4df7d0034d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efb/a58/cc8/efba58cc891c48f2a697705717b5b7d2.jpg"><br><br>  And here, by the way, you can see how the dirt disappears under the miracle of the trunk of a window robot.  But it is better to see the video once, than a hundred times to see the photo.  I made a couple of videos that demonstrate the work of an automatic window cleaner. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qCVlIv1PmGU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhkc7tWmdcF4l7NuOddLkMTKMnCSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Let's describe the process of washing windows with the help of a trunk again. <br><br><ul><li>  insert the power cord into the robot and the outlet </li><li>  charge until the green light comes on </li><li>  we attach a safety cable, for example, to the battery </li><li>  Turn on the robot and attach it to the glass </li><li>  press the up button on the remote </li><li>  waiting for the robot to wash the window and stop, squeaking merrily a couple of times </li><li>  hold it off and off, removing from the glass </li></ul><br>  It's simple.  At the end of the process, wipe or not wipe the frame and corners, and go wash further. <br><br>  It may be asked what to do if the robot stops far from the edge of the glass and it cannot be reached by hand?  To do this, there are buttons on the console: ‚Äúmove left‚Äù and ‚Äúmove right‚Äù, just press on them and the trunk crawls to the edge you need. <br><br>  The manual also says that with the help of Hobot-188 you can wash the floor, but I did not abuse it, my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwas already in shock, and it would not be quick to wipe a large surface, it‚Äôs better to use a robot floor polisher, maybe somehow appear on my review;) <br><br>  Finally, another video showing the complete process of washing one glass in time and the picture ‚ÄúWhat's inside?‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wc6kXAKRHQY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjP6KEOurbssUl9OQAySeB3q5lV9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you can see, washing one approximately standard glass window takes about 3 minutes. <br><br>  Now let's see what's inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/afc/43e/a7cafc43e4e04e7fb548abe1f8991cae.jpg"><br><br>  To begin, unscrew the 2 bolts securing the rotating base for microfiber and 6 self-tapping screws.  Remove the circles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/294/e1f/ccb/294e1fccbae047d39798f24f5ae3e9d9.jpg"><br><br>  Here you can see that the force is transmitted to the rotating circles by a plastic part, which looks and feels like a nylon material or similar to the touch.  The material is good, does not crack under load as ABS, then offset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce7/814/592/ce7814592acd4cc39dca1bea2d0f579f.jpg"><br><br>  Raise the top, white, part of the body, for this unhooked the terminal buttons and power plug.  This already pleases, there is no cheap Chinese technology - hot melt and direct soldering of wires, when you have to either disassemble wires or unsolder or bite off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fba/2bc/417/fba2bc4170744cf09952473d4dfa5d9b.jpg"><br><br>  The connector itself is standard, with the guides and the latch, not to confuse the polarity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d02/c36/22c/d02c3622c69c4a6bb81cfacb3e6dc587.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, it seemed to me that the motor is more powerful here, this seemingly quite small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/36e/bc0/89736ebc0ae346f8bcf9882279d89539.jpg"><br><br>  But immediately cleared up a lot of questions about what works.  I thought there was a system of cunning valves, but it turns out not.  "Prisos" is constant on both krutilki, and the movement occurs only due to the rotation of the supports.  Turns are performed using different speeds of rotation of the round timber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ac/49f/4b1/2ac49f4b168148aabfc17063786ada5c.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the battery: 14.8 volts, 650 mA / h is such a reserve, if the power is lost.  I think it will be enough for a while, if anything, you need to be more attentive to the robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/8e0/580/1618e058047b48a58a43d92001d72e53.jpg"><br><br>  Brain.  There is a standard scheme of protection against reverse engineering and self-repair.  Important microcircuits are milled and not recognizable.  Although in general it is already clear how it works, and I think you can put any microcontroller here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/377/f58/83e/377f5883e4d148edb551ef96a4e7feac.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, an interesting solution with the rotational motors of the platforms.  They are absolutely standard and widespread.  But the detection of obstacles is done, apparently in the control of motor currents, although it may somehow relate to the sensors on the underside ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/ffa/655/09effa6550864119963ab7cb14cfcdc1.jpg"><br><br>  I did not begin to disassemble further, I still need to assemble it back and so that everything works again. <br><br>  Well, for those interested in the robot here is a link to the <a href="https://dadget.ru/hobot-188/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dhobot-188%26utm_content%3Dhobot-188%26utm_campaign%3Dhobot-188_188">Hobot-188</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368567/</a></p>
