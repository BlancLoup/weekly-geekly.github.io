    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A few words about the school I left.  This is the MOU SOSH from the distant hinterland (you can not imagine how far), affected by state programs and progress in general only barely.  Yes, we were presented with computers with licensed Windows and 15 "monitors with CRTs, even as it were, they gave the Internet. However, the last had a chance to use only a few lucky ones, and then last year; at the moment access to the worldwide network is not carried out for unexplained reasons. <br><br>  However, this did not hit the informatics school plan at all.  There is no place in it either for the subject ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù or, respectively, ... ‚ÄúHypertext Markup Language‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, yes, our school does not learn HTML.  And do not even mention it.  Why, there - the teacher himself first heard about this concept only from me.  For several years (since the 9th grade), the desire I was having to show off in a lesson with my skills in web layout, when we begin to study it, has not got a way out :) <br><br>  But there was an opportunity to go by road. <br><br>  Our ultra-modern school is going to donate such a miracle as a ‚Äúmultimedia board‚Äù next year.  No one in the village has such a thing, we will be the coolest of all, like, and so ... And we, eleventh-graders, - those who will not see it, - were given a party task: to prepare a presentation-lesson for this board on the chosen topic on any subject (synopsis of ‚ÄúMS PowerPoint skills‚Äù to help).  ‚ÄúHere it is - my chance!‚Äù - I thought, and said that my topic would be ‚ÄúXHTML and CSS‚Äù.  A mixed feeling of misunderstanding and indifference in the eyes of the teacher - ‚Äúplease, do‚Äù.  While classmates downloaded presentations on thermodynamics and major events from the Internet, I was learning InDesign CS2, compiled the text of the lesson and examples, prepared comments / for / teacher. <br><br>  As a result, I didn‚Äôt even make a presentation, but something between a brief manual and an information brochure.  However, it was so conceived by me from the very beginning - I was always irritated by the ‚Äúclasses‚Äù in computer science with viewing presentations on a computer monitor.  Presentations for the projector are not suitable, in my opinion, for viewing on a computer, and vice versa.  And since the ‚Äúinteractive whiteboard‚Äù will not be brought to us by the fact that soon, I optimized my work for convenient viewing on the monitors of our office. <br><br>  The work is completed and handed over;  I hope that it was not in vain.  I am sure that fashion will soon be reaching us to create school websites, and I would very much like my school‚Äôs website to look at least as hard as it‚Äôs.  For example, <a href="http://yungpeopleslv.do.am/">so</a> . <br><br>  Was it worth doing?  If it was worth it, did it work out?  I tried to create a lesson-excursion in HTML and CSS, the fundamental principles of website development.  In my opinion, this is more than useful - a contribution to the elimination of computer illiteracy among the population of our country. <br><br><h4>  Actually, the subject of conversation </h4><br> <a href="http://olhado.pp.ru/file_download/1/lesson.pdf"><img src="http://olhado.pp.ru/frames.png" alt="  " title="Download, PDF (1.28 Mb)"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://olhado.pp.ru/file_download/1/lesson.pdf">Download the presentation.</a>  <a href="http://olhado.pp.ru/file_download/1/lesson.pdf">PDF, 1.28 MB</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://olhado.pp.ru/file_download/2/comments.pdf">Download comments to the presentation for the teacher.</a>  <a href="http://olhado.pp.ru/file_download/2/comments.pdf">PDF, 132 Kb</a> (you already know about it). <br><br>  I ask you to forgive for, perhaps, not always successful design and inferior illustrations :) I tried, but was limited in time and effort.  Besides, I was not sure that it was worth doing it brilliantly, because there would still be no one to appreciate ... <br><br>  I will be glad to any comments from the community on how to work specifically, and on the idea in general. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60209/</a></p>
