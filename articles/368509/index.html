Is it permissible now to speak about the formation of a new ‚Äútechnological‚Äù trend?  And how successful is another creative attempt to unite the capabilities of 3D SLS-printing and Audi innovations within the framework of a single design concept of Intel technology, Autodesk Maya and Rhino, having become acquainted with Anuk Wipprecht's strange but incredibly bright collections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65a/749/d47/65a749d475857e4fca49270a7200bceb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Computerized dresses from <a href="http://www.anoukwipprecht.nl/">Anouk Wipprecht</a> (Anouk Wipprecht), most of the ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù which are printed on a 3D printer, are an unprecedentedly bold attempt to combine the facets of science, technology and art in a single solution.  Let the critics have the right to formulate their counter arguments and move on to the collection itself and its creator, who looked at the clothing of the person of the near future, as an element of Hardware Couture. <br><br><h2>  Mistress of lightning </h2><br>  What we see in the photo and video would never have come into being if it were not for the phenomenon of Anouk - an extraordinary, talented, persistent and enterprising person who is perfectly prepared for solving the problems facing her in the fields of engineering design, artistic skill, fashion , design and social psychology.  "... Fashion for me is more than style and character; it is a way of self-expression and communication.  ... I drew attention to the fact that people are looking for a way to express their mood through things, and I think that I can translate this ‚Äúself-expression‚Äù into a digital language. ‚Äù

Wipprecht smart dresses are actively responding to the environment - moving, spewing smoke, glowing and blinking, changing shape, being filled with new, completely unexpected content.  Hardware models from Wipprecht are technologies that create aesthetics, a thing in itself that has little in common with existing utilitarian wearable technologies with a pronounced emphasis on practicality, ergonomics and functionality. <br><br><h2>  Project Faraday dress </h2><br>  The Faraday Dress project (Faraday cage) was demonstrated at the largest DIY festival of innovators in a variety of different areas of the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/">Maker Faire Bay Area</a> .  The <a href="http://www.arcattack.com/">Tesla ArcAttack</a> team prepared the musical, light accompaniment and effects with working high-voltage Tesla coils.  A demonstration of the ‚ÄúFaraday dress‚Äù was conducted by the author to the music of William Jerome ‚ÄúIn the Cave of the Mountain King‚Äù and a controlled dance of shimmering plasma. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH2GgYSwN1A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjTrf0pv1bcxCeKfxMmaq__SxR6UA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Synapse project </h2><br>  Is it possible to transform your appearance depending on your mood?  The answer to this question is the ‚ÄúSynapse‚Äù project from Anuk Wipprecht.  And here, Anuk and Intel's miniature universal chip microcontroller Intel Edison came to the aid of Anuk in implementing the concept.  Intel technologies and Anuk‚Äôs own creative ideas allowed creating a smart dress on biosensors that is responsive to the mood and state of its owner. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnboard‚Äù Synapse provides a ‚Äúproximity‚Äù sensor built into 3D plastic.  Overcoming the offender "red zone" is accompanied by a dazzling flash of 120W, resulting in an unsuspecting victim in a state close to a shock.  A camera on the front panel of a plastic ‚Äúcorset‚Äù programmatically associated with a ‚Äústress sensor‚Äù can capture an image that triggered a state of increased nervous tension.  Viewing and analyzing the captured information will improve self-control, and possibly get rid of perennial complexes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2c/c36/a5f/a2cc36a5fa7ad732b56ea079fb637829.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The use of the Intel Edison controller allowed creating unique lighting effects in accordance with the basic algorithm, but if you want the owner of the dress, you can always change and complicate the light show by downloading the alternative algorithm you like from wired or wireless access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ac/f22/ea4/8acf22ea450ba991b7be8250ff4e3545.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/106431614&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjnLwHbe7IZqDcV3muMmeeEfhm0cw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Interactive Intel-Edison-based fashion dress designer Dutch fashion-tech designer reveals wearers metal states" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Project Particledress </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/beb/d8f/b0a/bebd8fb0af9231300815c02499adb640.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Element Dress is the world's first 3D-printed dress project proposed by Anouk to a creative audience as an open source project.  Thus, to co-creation in creating the design of individual elements of the dress, Anouk Wipprecht invited everyone with no age or geographical restrictions.  About 150 independent authors who use the TINKERCAD template took part in the creation of personalized elements with a size of 62 mm. <br><br>  According to the author, the Open-Source scheme allows realizing the creative potential of hundreds of talented people - this is a unique opportunity created thanks to 3D modeling and <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/xyz_printing_da_vinci_1_0s_aio_printer_dlya_3d_pechati_grey/">3D printing</a> technologies.  The backlight uses a blue LED from NeoPixel. <br><br>  Examples of elements created by independent authors in the framework of the project Particledress <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTl828A6Dd0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8t5yqVXe9vC-zi64ro9Sm3eLKfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Project Spider Dress </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/113/218/0fb/1132180fbff8bf1ee7fd416bcf72140f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This project is probably one of the brightest and most successful of all realized by Anuk Wipprecht and deserves special attention. <br><br>  The Intel Edison microchip-based Spider Dress is crowned by robotic spider legs - the keepers of their owner's personal space.  Paws are driven by <a href="https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html">Intel Edison's</a> computational and communication technologies and sensors ‚Äî biosensors that track the natural rhythm of the wearer's owner‚Äôs breathing.  It is necessary for someone to quickly or sharply approach the hostess at a distance of ‚Äùelongated spider legs‚Äù, the latter immediately go into attack mode.  But a leisurely ‚Äúrapprochement‚Äù with the ‚Äúfuturistic object‚Äù will open them for a friendly greeting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47b/ff5/9ec/47bff59ec7510f3c83933366ee02abc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here, as in Sinapse, using Intel Edison, the author used the capabilities of technology to create a feedback between the emotional state of the owner of the dress and the response of biosensors, giving the command to activate certain functional modes. <br><br>  Relief elements of the dress with aggressive expressive geometry created using the Materialize software and printing method of a 3D printer using the SLS technology of selective laser sintering.  This gives the Spider Dress a solid stock of mechanical "strength." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/224/186/431/224186431609f53cbc255bfa9689c6df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bae/2ff/c00/bae2ffc006cb4ea1b2de569faf0449bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As Anouk says, problems at the level of hardware solutions should not arise.  Thus, the heat energy generated in the process of working with the microcircuits (as in the Faraday dress project) is accumulated and dissipated in the rear part of the 3D structure.  The system wires pass through the gateways in the case, switch easily, safely and securely, the sensors are integrated into the design, coarse massive protruding elements are absent here by definition. <br><br>  Spider dress was demonstrated at CES, held in Las Vegas from January 6 to 9, 2015, as part of the presentation of Intel products. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/114828162&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgEGDPRn1Io_TEbB-ipzCsxG58skA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Robotic Spider Dress [Intel Edison based] // 2015 teaser" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is quite difficult to give an instant assessment of how feminine this clearly allegorical and ambiguous image looks, and how to answer the question: where exactly can you appear in such a dress aside from the catwalk?  But the fact that the Anuk collection is a bright phenomenon deserving the most careful attention and study is difficult to argue. <br><br><h2>  Project AUDI A4 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c5/28b/3a5/2c528b3a589b219f0838c9148aba1d0e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The development of a collection of four dresses for the Audi concern, including the steps of printing elements on a 3D printer using the SLS technology of laser sintering and creating software was carried out in the homeland of Wipprecht in Amsterdam.  Finishing the futuristic wardrobe was carried out in the Audi garage, in full compliance with the Audi A4 paint technology - using Audi matte and metallic paint and then applying a layer of glossy varnish. <br><br>  Four incredible dresses, created using the capabilities of the Autodesk platform and the design elements of Audi 4. Each dress embodies one of the technologies of Audi A4.  To create special effects, without which any Anuk project is complete, real Audi sensors and LEDs, hidden in light elegant designs made using 3D-SLS printing, were used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdb/0cf/aaa/bdb0cfaaab65f01fcf8c12a0e46ff1de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Audi parking sensors are sensitive to the approaching object - at a certain distance the dress starts to flash and illuminate, as if emphasizing the significance of what is happening here and now. <br><br>  Another model of the Wipprecht collection is equipped with 60-watt LEDs from A4 headlights, literally tearing apart the darkened hall space when triggered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49f/4b9/10d/49f4b910dc69b20580ca2cb000d7eebd.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f39/a91/201/f39a912011718b73a995982b3709df8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Options 3 and 4 are created with an emphasis on the Audi A4 lines.  The white dress is used as a background of the synchronously displayed projection, and, due to the changing light effects, creates the illusion of rapid, incessant motion. <br><br>  Interestingly, the concepts implemented in the collection gave rise to the birth of a joint project Wipprecht and Autodesk, the purpose of which is to expand the software capabilities horizon with new features of technological design.  Each of the collection's dresses reflects the concept of the Audi A4 shape, with amazing precision embodied in plastic using 3D printing technology.  In developing the conceptual details, the designer was helped by the 3D camera RealSense from Intel. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/133654595&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhil6Q7_qRppoMUZs5aUgX3sjGZ9_Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="AUDI A4 x Anouk Wipprecht process" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The availability of digital tools and advanced production technologies, including 3D printing and microprocessors, will allow designers, according to Anuk Wipprecht, not only to work faster, but also to discover fundamentally new opportunities for creative experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a90/d84/9a4/a90d849a4a022f4c232b9a3c4287165c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !
