In this post, we will talk about the most interesting, in our opinion, reports that were heard that day, as well as updates from Dell and partners exhibited in the demonstration zones.  The traditional venue for the Forum was the hotel and the Radisson SAS Slavyanskaya business center. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f38/a83/c54/f38a83c54b0446dfaba749d1a5be1df7.jpg" width="700"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The third Forum came in the anniversary year: Dell turned 30 years old.  More than 750 participants included representatives from Dell, as well as customers and partners.  An exhibition of Dell and partner companies was organized in the spacious lobby.  The Forum program was extremely intense: in a large conference room for 550 people, in the morning, a plenary session was held with key presentations from Dell executives and global partners (Intel and Microsoft), as well as representatives from Dell customers.  The second half of the day was devoted to thematic discussions that took place in parallel in four conference halls.  Depending on interests and needs, visitors could take part in any discussion. <br><br>  The forum was held in Russia as part of the worldwide series of Dell Solutions Tour events.  It presented the whole range of solutions developed by Dell and its partners. <br><br>  The Forum was launched by Boris Scherbakov, CEO of Dell in Russia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia, who welcomed all of those present:

The study surveyed 1,400 IT managers from the United States, Britain, India, Japan, China, Brazil, France, Russia, the UAE / Saudi Arabia and South Africa. <br><br>  The study showed how tablets are used in a corporate environment: what approaches are used by IT managers regarding employees' use of tablets in their work, do companies plan their purchases and how do tablets affect work efficiency, which have advantages and difficulties.  A comparison was made of tablets with devices of other types, it was found out how much the tablets meet the expectations of IT managers.  Dell customers, company executives and CIOs around the world can use research results in their work when planning their IT strategies now and in the future.

But on November 14, journalists and guests of the Forum had the opportunity for the first time in Russia to see the model with their own eyes.  Venue 11 Pro 7140 is the successor to the previous generation of 7130 tablets, but is ahead of it in all respects: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/fc9/baf/7fafc9baff834531ad7103085b542f17.png"><br>  The novelty combines improvements, like the appearance of LTE, with reasonable conservatism, like the screen of the previous resolution (1920x1080 with the same 10.8 ‚Äùdiagonal, which remains the optimal resolution for Windows devices with screens of this diagonal), as well as the continuity of the docking connector. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the Venue 11 Pro 7140 has become thinner and lighter than its predecessor, one cannot say that it is chasing dimensions for the sake of dimensions: the thickness of the tablet case allowed to place a full USB 3.0 port. <br><br>  Powerful stuffing - Intel Core i5 processor, up to 8 GB of RAM, up to 256 GB SSD and a slot for SD-cards - make it an excellent tool for solving work tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d6/6dd/4ee/5d66dd4ee1994ecfb1da4e713dfcc16b.png" width="700"><br><br>  Not surprisingly, the new Dell Venue 11 Pro, equipped with built-in smart card reader and fingerprint scanner, was taken as the basis for a joint solution of Dell and <a href="http://www.aladdin-rd.ru/">Aladdin R.D., a</a> Russian developer of IT security solutions <a href="http://www.aladdin-rd.ru/">.</a>  ":" Dell Venue 11 Pro Security Tablet. "  Another co-development by Dell and Aladdin RD was also presented at the Forum: ‚ÄúDell Wyse Protected Thin Client‚Äù. <br><br>  The solution provides for strong authentication in the corporate network when a USB token, smart card or JaCarta Secure MicroSD token is connected to the tablet via specialized slots and ports.  Security policies are administered on a tablet using the JMS (JaCarta Management System).  And for the usual work with Windows-based applications and corporate documents provides tools for data protection Secret Disk and secure access JaCarta SecurLogon. <br><br>  In turn, the Dell Wyse Protected Thin Client solution allows you to work with JaCarta PKI tokens and smart cards in the Dell Wyse T10 and Dell Wyse D10D thin clients on the ThinOS operating system with built-in software clients from Citrix and VMware without additional settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/2e0/803/cf72e08034b4401f8ac12c502333f431.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  Together with the Venue 11 Pro 7140, a docking keyboard station is supplied: this is a full-fledged, easy-to-use keyboard, which also has an additional battery for greater autonomy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/fc7/2a4/971fc72a4dd540e899b4b20d67f3f128.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  Start of sales is expected in January, the order of prices is comparable with other "professional" tablets on Windows - from $ 800. <br><br>  Continuing to protect corporate devices, in addition to the Dell Latitude Rugged, protective covers for Dell Venue Pro series tablets were announced - Targus Rugged Max Pro Case, as well as a medical case for Dell Venue 8 Pro, enabling tablet sanitization - Dell Tablet Healthcare Case . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be7/e25/5ec/be7e255ece0646fd81d238fed9f54b69.jpg" width="700"><br>  <i>Protective case Targus Rugged Max Pro Case.</i> <br><br><h4>  Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme and Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme </h4><br>  The line of ultra-secure laptops Dell Latitude Rugged Extreme is designed to automate the work in harsh environmental conditions.  The model Latitude 12 Rugged Extreme is presented in the form of "two-in-one" and combines the functionality of a laptop and the mobility of the tablet.  The robust attachment mechanism for the new device is borrowed from the premium Dell XPS laptops. <br><br>  All Dell Latitude Rugged Extreme laptops are made of durable materials, internal drives are placed in sealed containers with rubber seals to protect against vibration, dust and moisture, and the fourth-generation cooling system QuadCool ensures uninterrupted operation of devices at extremely low and high temperatures. <br><br>  Dell Latitude Rugged Extreme laptops have passed the tests for compliance with military standards MIL-STD-810G (protection against liquid contamination, work at low pressure, resistance to mechanical shock and a fall from a height of human growth, etc.), IEC 60529 (IP-65) ( dustproof shell and water jet protection without pressure), MIL-STD-461F and ANSI / ISA.12.12.01 (compatible with other types of equipment).  They are equipped with fourth-generation Intel Core processors and high-speed solid-state drives with a maximum capacity of 512 GB, as well as the latest technology for remote control (Intel vPro) and support mobile Internet access and GPS. <br><br>  Resistive multi-touch display with anti-reflective coating provides excellent visibility in direct sunlight and allows you to work even in thick gloves and with moisture on the screen.  A distinctive feature of the new laptops is a sealed keyboard with customizable RGB backlight for convenient operation in any lighting conditions. <br><br>  To demonstrate the real protection capabilities of the Dell Latitude Rugged Extreme laptops, an exemplary ‚Äúexecution‚Äù of one of them was arranged at the Forum: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/927/e5e/424927e5e8fb48b2be4617fe150a94cc.JPG" width="700"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">As we threw on the floor and doused our laptop</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb0/e6c/32b/fb0e6c32bdb34acf8c652f9f73521607.JPG" width="700"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/320/bbb/0be/320bbb0be5e34af38f6a632926513b87.JPG" width="700"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec7/5f2/f39/ec75f2f39836400fbf63cdccd81b905e.JPG" width="700"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ce/675/c9d/3ce675c9ddc840078bf2888e14a2cc2e.JPG" width="700"></div></div><br><br>  The laptop survived the crash test without sacrificing its performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e9/292/b52/7e9292b522444bf8a41b37053aa166f6.JPG" width="700"><br><br><h6>  Dell Latitude 14 Rugged Extreme Specifications </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/407/c09/288407c091fb445ba6a8ff03fe1f0d19.png" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Dell Venue 8 7000 series with 3D camera </h4><br>  The Dell Venue 8 7000 series tablet with a 3D camera is equipped with three cameras on the rear panel: in addition to the main one (below), there are two more that are located in the center of the back cover: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9db/8c3/b61/9db8c3b61d914617bb696aa7ad2981b7.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  The Intel RealSense 3D camera allows you to use the gesture control system, record 3D video and shoot frames with multiple focus, which can then be configured on the finished image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd1/4b2/6ad/fd14b26ade864afd96723fef97207aa7.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  27-inch Dell UltraSharp UP2715K monitor </h4><br>  Guests of the Forum could get acquainted with one of the most advanced monitors in the world: the world's first touchscreen display with a resolution of 5K (5120 √ó 2880) and support for multi-touch input.  The resolution of 5K is four times higher than the number of QHD points and seven times the resolution of Full HD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/e46/149/8a6e46149f8f443698bc34e3be85c2bd.jpg" width="700"><br>  We present this development as a new approach to the organization of the workplace: an ultra-high-resolution touch screen and an ergonomic horizontal touch-screen panel that allows you to work with both touch and stylus and other tools forms a ‚Äúsmart desktop‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Dell technology </h4><br>  One of the most popular objects of the Forum was the Dell booth, which demonstrated the company's own development of a computer management company using gestures.  Similar technologies are already being used by other manufacturers, but we managed to achieve greater accuracy of gesture recognition, which anyone could test on himself with the help of a special game in which it was possible to throw the balls with a wave of the hand (who never dreamed of doing this on the old Windows screensaver with soap bubbles) ?) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39f/2db/43c/39f2db43c14940b3a53e7ce73ac53b48.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Dell Accessories </h4><br>  <b>Dell cast</b> <br>  Dell Cast's ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù was not officially presented at the Forum, but even an extramural acquaintance makes it a very interesting gadget for a mass audience: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c9/6ae/b43/5c96aeb436a445c6860057509717756f.png" width="700"><br><br>  In fact, it allows you to turn any display with an HDMI output into an external display for a Dell tablet or laptop.  Information on interiors, data transfer protocol, OS availability on board and other details will appear later when the official Dell Cast premiere takes place. <br><br>  <b>Backpack display</b> <br>  Intel company showed everyone backpacks with a built-in display.  According to company representatives, this is an idea for group sports activities - for example, with group jogs, you can follow the partner‚Äôs pulse and speed.  However, absolutely any data can be displayed on this display: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/975/b55/dd6/975b55dd69ba445a98d9f02dd80b1d2b.jpg" width="700"><br><br><h4>  Results of the day </h4><br>  The Dell Solutions Forum in Moscow lasted only 6 hours, but due to the richness and density of the information, most of the participants felt like after a particularly difficult working day.  The final chord was the celebration of the 30th anniversary of Dell and a birthday cake. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/b7c/bd6/74bb7cbd63e04af7bb1597108c1fd941.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  So, in short, our Dell Solutions Forum 2014 took place. We hope that our guests were just as interested to visit it as we organize it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245647/</a></p>
