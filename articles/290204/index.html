  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New startup: OneMarkt - hypermarket online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In January 2015, a new platform was opened for the sale of goods from small and medium-sized online stores called OneMarkt.  This is a kind of hypermarket of stores, where the main role is played by the participants themselves - the sellers, and not the goods they sell.  Moreover, the difference from the competitors is that the participants - sellers are free from commissions and subscription fees. <br><br>  OneMarkt's idea is not based on the trivial exchange of goods for money, or sales, but the creation of proper communication between the seller and the buyer.  For some, this is a great opportunity to talk about their store, to win the first loyal customers who will bring friends, as well as to constantly be in touch with their subscribers.  For others, this is a chance to buy a particular product at a great price, get a recommendation on the choice or find out the latest news from the world of goods sold. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All the design and functionality of OneMarkt was as user-friendly as possible.  No clutter of buttons, banners or pop-ups.  Creating a page of your store takes only a few minutes - it takes just 10 minutes from registering to downloading first products  OneMarkt moderators review information about the new store and decide whether to allow it to the project or not, therefore all participants - sellers on the site - are real stores that have been operating for some time.

      The goods are loaded literally in two clicks: the user calls up the product adding page, fills in the information and publishes it on the store page.  Up to 5 products can be added at a time, and up to 300 in total. When downloading, the required minimum information about the product is indicated in order to save the seller‚Äôs time.  Other information about the product can be edited in the profile of the seller. <br><br>  In the store settings, the user can specify some SEO parameters that will help search engines find and display the store in the future.  This will undoubtedly help our customers get new customers to their stores. <br><br>  Also, unlike the main competitors, OneMarkt openly asks its users to provide links to popular social networks.  pages: VKontakte, Instagram and Twitter.  We believe that it will be easier for the potential buyer to make a decision on the purchase of goods, if he sees that this store is actively developing in social networks, that he already has customers and good reviews.  Together with the soc.  pages, the user can give a link to your personal website - shop, and make sales through it. <br><br>  It is also necessary to tell about the news section of the project.  Each store, downloading the product to its page, will be displayed in the general news of OneMarkt.  Buyers will always see the latest arrivals in stores and will be able to make an order first.  Users who subscribe to any store will also receive email notifications about new products from this store.  Also, any seller can talk about upcoming promotions and discounts to attract new or remind old buyers about themselves. <br><br>  What is for buyers is a great way to find out first about new products in stores, follow trends, and receive individual discounts from stores. <br><br>  Until the end of May - mid-June, the team plans to refine some functions and introduce new ones.  This will improve the display and presentation of goods, increase customer confidence.  Moreover, the latter will visit OneMarkt not only for shopping, but also to get relevant, interesting and useful news.  In spite of everything, our customers will be confident in the stores, they will not be afraid that the goods will not be delivered or there will be problems with payments.  They will be pleased to use the updated OneMarkt service. <br><br>  We invite everyone to express their opinion about the project;  We will be glad to hear criticism or to receive suggestions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290204/</a></p>
