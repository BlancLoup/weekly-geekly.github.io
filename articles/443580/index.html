The project, worth several hundred million rubles, consists of the planned test clearance of UAVs on roads in Moscow and Tatarstan. <br><br>  The government was going to implement the experiment before March 1, 2022.  Since December 1 last year, six companies submitted applications for testing unmanned highly automated vehicles: Yandex, Innopolis University, Aurora Robotics, KamAZ, Moscow Automobile Institute, JSC Scientific-Design Bureau of Computing Systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But things did not go quite as planned.  Despite the fact that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev had already signed the documents, and the experiment was supposed to start on March 1, 2019, it turned out that there was not enough money.  The project, in fact, is experiencing serious financial difficulties that prevent its implementation, <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3908765">as reported</a> by Kommersant.

      Funds needed to check the status of robots.  The deputy head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Alexander Morozov, recently said that every automated vehicle would be checked before testing.  The check will concern the operation of the steering system, ABC, automatic transmission system, etc.  NAMI representatives said that they want to prevent accidents during the experiment and to protect themselves from criminal liability in case of problems. <br><br>  Alexander Morozov said that checking one test car would cost 214 thousand rubles, so it would take about 40 million rubles (to assess the condition of more than 100 drones from companies that agreed to participate in the experiment).  The deputy head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade believes that until 2022, other companies may also apply for participation.  So the initial amount can grow significantly. <br><br>  The participants in the experiment were asked to check the drones at their own expense, but no one wanted to do it yet.  There was no response to a request for financial assistance from the office of Vice President Maxim Akimov. <br><br>  In preparation for the start of the experiment, additional problems arose.  In May last year, Rosavtodor and the state-owned company Avtodor received a decree on the identification of road sections for testing and the start of road tests, during which it is planned to test the V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) technology.  It was planned that the highway M11 Moscow-Petersburg will become a test site, but for this it must be equipped with specialized sensors for ro-mobiles.  As it turned out, the relevant work will cost more than 200 million rubles.  For today the source of financing of the project is not defined. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443580/</a></p>
