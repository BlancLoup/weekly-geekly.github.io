If you honestly tell your team where you are in relation to the goal, you may find that the commitment of its members to doing the work (and subsequently to you personally) increases noticeably.

      Delegation is equally necessary both to exploit the strengths of your team members and to accomplish all tasks.  Not everyone is a great organizer, but there are such people.  Not everyone can be called a great writer, but some cope with this role.  Benefit from the strengths, and your team will be happier and more satisfied. <br><br>  However, first and foremost, leaders demonstrate dedication.  The appearance of the desire to quit when faced with a difficult situation does not mean that you are not a potential boss.  Difficult conditions can discourage, and acknowledging problems brings us back to the importance of sincere interaction. <br><br>  But if you show that you intend to follow the previously chosen course even in the face of failure, your team will rally around you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You are able to influence</font> </h2><br>  You probably think, ‚ÄúYes, thank you.  Right now, I‚Äôll do this - the influence on everyone. ‚Äù  But, really, how can you achieve respect? <br><br>  In fact, it is not difficult.  Influence is a mixture of confidence, inspiration and positivity.  The key is to change your point of view. <br><br>  Facing a problem, believe that you can come up with a solution for it.  Grasp this task by opening your mind to both proven methods and new ways.  Sometimes you do not need to reinvent the wheel, and in other cases you can't do without it.  And most often the solution is a complex combination of these two approaches.  Maintain a positive attitude, despite adversity, but be sure to be sincere. <br><br>  It‚Äôs quite normal to say: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a solution yet, simply by adding, but I see several ways, and one of them seems to me promising.‚Äù  Over time, your influence will grow. <br><br>  Contrary to stereotypes, <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">influence is not connected with wealth or power</a> .  In fact, it only implies that you have solid experience in dealing with problems and the ability to invent creative and effective solutions, and people who have previously worked with you realize that you can succeed in extremely diverse and confusing conditions.  If you strive to build your own reputation with your work, then you are on the path to gaining influence. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">And not familiar with the phrase "This is not my business"</font> </h2><br>  Most likely, you have a description of your job duties (even if it is foggy), and it probably defines the limits of "your" responsibility.  When discovering tasks to be completed that are not assigned to anyone or transferred to someone who is already overloaded with work, take them to a pencil.  In those moments when you have an adequate amount of free time, offer to release someone from a couple of cases. <br><br>  Carefully formulate your words so that everyone knows: the source is your desire to help and the availability of free time, and not doubts about the ability of others to cope with work.  Such behavior will put you in a position of strength, because you are eager to help your colleagues, work for the common good, do your own duties perfectly and demonstrate an interest that goes beyond your personal responsibility. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You try hard to keep your composure.</font> </h2><br>  Want to be a great boss?  Then your ego has no place here.  To understand where the ego ends, and the active energy begins, it can be difficult, but still possible.  Do not panic when everything goes bad.  Concentrate on solutions. <br><br>  If someone's words <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-sposobov-spravitsya-s-toksichnymi-chlenami-semi/">hurt your feelings</a> , take the time to create a constructive answer and discuss this question informally with this person. <br><br>  If something breaks down, be the one who admits his potential guilt in the situation, and then focus on finding a solution.  Do not waste time bullying anyone, including yourself. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You are the one who has the answers.</font> </h2><br>  This is what it means: know everything about your products.  Understand how your business works, what your responsibilities and other people‚Äôs duties are.  Remember where you can find useful information.  If someone asks a question, do not be afraid to give an answer if you know it.  If you see a possible solution, tell us about it.  You do not need to be knowledgeable to play an important role in your team as a whole. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">You keep your word</font> </h2><br>  If you have taken on any obligations, fulfill them.  Do not make promises that go beyond your capabilities, time, or performance.  It makes a strong impression. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Usually you are (confidently) patient</font> </h2><br>  You can understand that you are a potential boss before your employers or colleagues.  It is quite normal to hide this fact for some time, allowing others to realize it on their own. <br><br>  At this time, you will have plenty of opportunities to learn to value time better or to avoid stressful or imperfect circumstances.  And when your team comes to understand the situation, you can become a real leader, surpassing all expectations. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the subject of work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/10-potryasayushhix-biznes-urokov-ot-izvestnogo-predprinimatelya/">10 amazing business lessons from a well-known entrepreneur</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301656/</a></p>
