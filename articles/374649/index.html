Choose the best drive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the modern world, mobility and free access to information is highly valued.  Therefore, the question of storing user data and simultaneous access to it, for example, for all family members, is very urgent.  Of course, the best solution for this is networked storage that is installed indoors.  If earlier this required a separate computer, now it is not difficult to organize it on the basis of a wireless router.  In addition, modern models are based on ARM processors and have support for USB 3.0 port, which greatly enhances their capabilities.  And what could be better for the household than to use the shared network resource at home, and then grab it with you on vacation and entertain yourself by watching movies from an external drive?  Here we will deal with the choice of an external disk for these tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/368/57f/c8336857f03f4d5eb0673ecb383a823e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For testing, I managed to get nine models of external hard drives with a capacity of 1 TB or 2 TB: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ADATA HD710, 2 TB <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/306217">HGST Touro Mobile MX3, 1 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/745112">Seagate Expansion Portable, 2 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/337148">Seagate Expansion, 2 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/256782">Silicon Power Armor A80, 1 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/399871">TOSHIBA Stor.E Basics, 1 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/236975">Transcend StoreJet 25H3, 1 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/585381">Western Digital My Passport Ultra, 2 TB</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/931959">Western Digital Elements, 2 TB</a>

      All hard drives have a USB 3.0 interface connector.  Two of them (Seagate Expansion and Western Digital Elements) are of a large 3.5 ‚Äùform factor.  Along the way, during the review, we will find out whether it makes sense to acquire these disks, which are large and require external power, for this type of task. <br><br>  The hard drives were tested connected to the USB 3.0 port of the Intel NUC using the Crystal Disk Mark.  Testing as a network storage was carried out on the basis of the ASUS RT-AC68U wireless router.  The external drive was connected to the USB 3.0 port and then, using the NAS Perfomance Tester program, the speeds for read and write operations for files of 100, 200 and 1000 MB were measured. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">ADATA HD710</font> </h2><br>  External hard drives in this series are available in 500 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB in blue, yellow or black color.

The undisputed leader was an external hard drive Seagate Expansion.  It is followed by Western Digital Elements, with a backlog of about 30 MB / s, for read / write operations. <br><br>  The leader among small form factor drives is the ADATA HD710 hard drive.  Literally on the heels of its results comes the drive Seagate Expansion Portable, behind the leader by less than 10 MB / s.  The difference between the results of drives with a small form factor and a large one is about 45-50 MB / s compared to the Seagate Expansion and about 20 MB / s compared to Western Digital Elements. <br><br>  The rest of the drives failed to break through the 120 MB / s mark and they formed a rather dense group.  According to the test results, the weakest disk was Western Digital My Passport Ultra.  HGST Touro Mobile MX3 and TOSHIBA Stor.E Basics showed slightly better results.  Even better results showed Silicon Power Armor A80 and Transcend StoreJet 25H3.  But to speak about their clear advantage, over the same Western Digital My Passport Ultra, is not necessary. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Testing disks in NAS perfomance tester</font> </h2><br>  The next step was testing drives as a network drive based on the ASUS RT-AC68U wireless router.  Before testing, all disks were formatted in NTFS.  Then they connected to the USB 3.0 port of the router and, using the NAS Perfomance Tester program, measured speeds for read and write operations for files of 100, 200 and 1000 MB in size. <br><br>  Based on the data obtained, the following diagram was constructed: <br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa1/324/ca2/aa1324ca2a9045bfa597d5f3135758fd.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As the external disks were tested as a network disk, the picture became clearer and duller with each new drive.  Regardless of the used disk, their results practically did not differ from each other.  That was until the turn of the Transcend StoreJet 25H3 drive arrived.  Its results are out of the total number of all drives tested.  If on read operations for files of 100 MB in size, the measured speeds coincide with competitors, then for files of 200 MB the read speed is 1.5 times higher, and for files 1000 MB is 2 times higher.  On write operations, the results differ for files of 100 MB.  The Transcend StoreJet 25H3 drive is about 1.4 times higher for files of any size. <br><br>  According to the results of this test, we can conclude that even when using one of the most powerful routers with a dual-core ARM processor, 256 MB of RAM and a USB 3.0 port, its performance is not enough to fully unlock the potential of external hard drives as a network drive.  Therefore, if you want to organize network storage on the basis of the router, it does not play a special role which disk for this you will use.  The only exception may be the Transcend StoreJet 25H3, the results of which turned out to be the best in this type of testing. <br><br>  Buying external drives of a large form factor for this task becomes simply ill-considered.  They demonstrate absolutely identical results for small form factor disks, and have large dimensions and require additional power. <br><br>  If you select from the total mass of any drives, then they can be: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Seagate Expansion</b> - a large form factor drive that demonstrated the highest speeds for read / write operations among all the contestants.  This drive is perfect for those users who need to expand the amount of stored information and have access to it at the highest possible speeds. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>ADATA HD710</b> is a small form factor drive that demonstrated the highest speeds for read / write operations among small form factor drives.  This drive is suitable for those who use portable devices (laptops, ultrabooks, etc.) and needs to expand the volume to store data at the highest possible speeds. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Transcend StoreJet 25H3</b> - a small form factor drive that demonstrated the highest speeds for read / write operations when used as a network drive based on the ASUS RT-AC68U wireless router.  This drive will perfectly cope with the task of using it as a network drive. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Western Digital My Passport Ultra</b> is a small form factor drive, although it has shown the worst results, but, in my opinion, it has the most attractive design, the widest color gamut in the model range and the presence of a velvet bag in the kit.  This drive is perfect as a gift, especially if the user is important appearance, but not performance. <br><br>  Previous articles in the PC Buyer's guide 2015 series: <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245952/">PC buyer's guide 2015: Motherboards, chipsets and sockets</a> <br>  <b>¬ª</b> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245404/">Twist-twirl, I want to confuse.</a>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/245404/">Understanding the HDD lines</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374649/</a></p>
