Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/category/digest/">April 2010-September 2011</a> .  Due to the heightened conference activity this fall, there was a pause with publications, but there will not be such an influx of events. <br><br><img title="Review of fresh materials, October-November 2011" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/8c4/dcb/10d8c4dcb11e250fc8d69cc95e24c7f3.png" width="550" height="150"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Methods and practices </h2><br>  <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-1-an-introduction/"><strong>Storyboarding &amp; ux</strong></a> <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/10/storyboarding-ux-part-1-an-introduction/"><br></a>  Ben Crothers most excellent series of articles on the use of storyboards in design.

He well describes the methods, approaches and examples of research results. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.experiencelab.info/2011/11/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-usability-testing-in-a-foreign-culture-wud2011.html"><strong>Lost in Translation - Tips for usability testing in a foreign country</strong></a> <a href="http://www.experiencelab.info/2011/11/pitfalls-to-avoid-when-usability-testing-in-a-foreign-culture-wud2011.html"><br></a>  Participant of the international UXAlliance, the company ExperienceLab, has published a report on the traditional research, timed to coincide with World Usability Day.  This year the document is devoted to cultural peculiarities during usability testing in foreign countries. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxblog/rapid-prototyping-for-mobile-products/"><strong>Rapid prototyping for mobile products</strong></a> <a href="http://www.cxpartners.co.uk/cxblog/rapid-prototyping-for-mobile-products/"><br></a>  Amy McGuinness from CXPartners compares the different ways of prototyping mobile interfaces for usability tests.  It lists the pros and cons of paper prototypes, clickable PDFs and specialized programs. <br><br>  <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/11/goal-driven-design-decisions/"><strong>Goal Driven Design Decisions</strong></a> <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/11/goal-driven-design-decisions/"><br></a>  A simple but interesting example and method of parsing user goals when working with the interface.  The ‚ÄúMotivatorFacilitator‚Äù diagram allows you to disassemble any target into its components for a better understanding. <br><br>  <a href="http://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/questionstorming-framing-the-problem/"><strong>QuestionStorming - Framing The Problem</strong></a> <a href="http://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/questionstorming-framing-the-problem/"><br></a>  James Kalbach describes the QuestionStorming technique, a type of brainstorm aimed at finding the real problem that the designer is trying to solve.  It consists of 5 steps and helps to find the right direction of work. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2011/11/reflecting_on_halloween_person.html"><strong>The Spirit of Halloween Personas</strong></a> <a href="http://www.cooper.com/journal/2011/11/reflecting_on_halloween_person.html"><br></a>  For the recent Halloween, the Cooper Consulting team prepared a description of a series of comic characters.  Despite the frivolity of the topic, this is a great example of the format and how important it is not to slip into caricature - character cards focus on needs and goals. <br><br><h3>  Tools and Templates </h3><br>  <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/20/comprehensive-review-usability-user-experience-testing-tools/"><strong>Comprehensive Review Of Usability And User Experience Testing Tools</strong></a> <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/20/comprehensive-review-usability-user-experience-testing-tools/"><br></a>  Cameron Chapman has put together a complete selection of tools for remote testing, card sorting, web analytics, eye-tracking and other user research methods for Smashing Magazine. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/eye-tracking/blog/the_truth_about_webcam_eye_tra/"><strong>The Truth About Webcam Eye Tracking</strong></a> <a href="http://www.rosenfeldmedia.com/books/eye-tracking/blog/the_truth_about_webcam_eye_tra/"><br></a>  Excellent article Aga Boyko, in which she tells the principles of the work of cheap ways of eye-tracking-research using a webcam.  The accuracy of the data obtained is extremely extremely low, which, in general, is not surprising for such limited equipment. <br><br>  <a href="http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2011/11/axure-fu-master-cheat-sheet/"><strong>Axure fu master cheat sheet</strong></a> <a href="http://wireframes.linowski.ca/2011/11/axure-fu-master-cheat-sheet/"><br></a>  WitFlow experts have prepared an excellent memo with a list of hot keys in Axure.

It allows you to categorize and rank problems in the interface, to look for links between them. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/12/freebie-twitter-ui-gui-psd/"><strong>Freebie: Twitter GUI PSD</strong></a> <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/12/freebie-twitter-ui-gui-psd/"><br></a>  Shelby White has assembled a PSD template for a typical Twitter page.  Direct <a href="">download link</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://doodlekit.imagiag.com/"><strong>Vector Doodlekit</strong></a> <a href="http://doodlekit.imagiag.com/"><br></a>  More than 700 black and white vector icons, which are perfect for wireframes in the form similar to the sketches.  The kit is also available as free PNG versions.  Another <a href="http://steedicons.com/">collection of icons in the form of sketches</a> . <br><br><h3>  Patterns and guides </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com/"><strong>Meaningful transitions</strong></a> <a href="http://www.ui-transitions.com/"><br></a>  A chic collection of patterns that collects and categorizes animation examples in interfaces.

The author published on the specially created website the entire collection of patterns, and the UX Booth edition is <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/mobile-design-patters/">one of the chapters of the book</a> devoted to reference and training screens. <br><br>  <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/08/extensive-guide-web-form-usability/"><strong>An Extensive Web Form Usability Guide</strong></a> <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/08/extensive-guide-web-form-usability/"><br></a>  A good overview of form design from Justin Misfud.

A good example is the ‚Äúpull to refresh‚Äù gesture that has spread to the iPhone to update the lists, which is usually taught by a tip from friends and acquaintances. <br><br>  <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Jensen-Harris-Walks-Us-Through-the-Windows-8-UI"><strong>Jensen Harris Walks Us Through the Windows 8 UI</strong></a> <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Jensen-Harris-Walks-Us-Through-the-Windows-8-UI"><br></a>  From September 13 to September 16, Anaheim Californian hosted a Build conference dedicated to Windows 8. As part of it, the interface team leader Jensen Harris and other experts talked a lot about Win8 and the Metro paradigm in particular.  In the video - a brief overview of the interface from Jensen himself.
