  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you need employee exchange service?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In whatever company a person does not work, over time such a problem appears as a loss of interest in work. <br>  One can argue with that, but I think the main reason for finding a new job is based on the need to change the situation, colleagues, the job itself, the location (territorial).  Maybe the company is like it, but if it is small and even more so, the rotation of personnel is ensured - in five years (someone earlier, someone later), even a very good employee will start thinking about this issue.  He will not necessarily leave or tell his colleagues about it, but labor productivity will not be the same. <br>  I think this situation does not suit both parties: <br>  if the employee does not leave - he will work halfway (for example, spending time on the Internet :)), if he leaves - the employer will have to look for a decent change (depending on the employee, this can be long and expensive). <br><br>  To solve this problem, I propose to discuss the need (and the possibility) of creating a service for the exchange of (possibly temporary) employees for companies (transfer). <br><br>  The bottom line is this: Company I :) for example (not the employee himself) puts some "tired" on her <br>  a programmer who would like to work elsewhere, and indicates how long the change (or forever) and the necessary information about the employee.  In companies G, R, M, ... :) there can also be (and probably will be) such <br>  specialists. <br>  Exchange employees, together with the employer, select the most appropriate vacancy from the submitted in terms of level and interest and are exchanged with the consent of the parties. <br>  This will give the parties the following benefits: 1) the employee will be able to change the situation for a while (six months or a year or two) and gain new experience, try himself in another company.  As a result he <br>  or may lose heart in other companies and continue to work with joy until the end of his life :) at his previous job (not regretting that he never tried to go to ...), or if it was better somewhere, returning to the company to make suggestions for improvement of life.  2) the employer will not lose forever a valuable employee who just wanted to try something new, there will be no need to spend money on finding an equivalent employee, when returning to the company a new experience and knowledge will be brought in, will receive a new employee with a new look and feel ideas and approach to work.

      This should not lead to the loss of internal information - after all, a person still needs to return.  In addition, this probability will be much greater if a person leaves the company forever (especially offended) and these issues can be directly provided for in the contract (by the way, it should be between the companies). <br>  In case the employee ‚Äúthere‚Äù likes it very much and he does not want to return (if it was provided for) - in the contract, you can add a clause on large penalties to the receiving party. <br><br>  In general, it is interesting to know your opinion on this issue, it is necessary - it is not necessary, why? <br><br>  UPD: By the way, the exchange is not necessarily limited to similar specialties / positions - you can change what is good and a lot from one, for what is necessary.  For example, if there are many programmers, you can change one of them to a system administrator, manager, marketing specialist, designer from another profile company.  You can even purposefully train highly qualified specialists in the field in which the company is strong, and change them to specialists of another profession prepared by other companies.  It will be a normal market. <br><br>  UPD2: Such an approach will allow using the ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù employee in the most effective way when selecting his successor (with direct interest): 1) they leave for good and it makes no sense to take crap, 2) they don‚Äôt know their work better than anyone, respectively, and select a pretender will be more correct, 3) if they also come back - when they pick a bad receiver, they will then rake the consequences 4) each of them will probably be in touch with the old company helping it if necessary, 5) the exchange will not be so dramatic - corresponding  There is, naturally, no time limit on the selection of a suitable candidate and there will be fewer newcomers' mistakes in a new place, 6) considering that colleagues even from different companies often communicate with each other (and even are friends) - there is a chance to make a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù exchange by their agreement :) - that there is quite good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26783/</a></p>
