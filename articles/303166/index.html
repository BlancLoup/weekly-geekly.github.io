We all know that unnecessary things, thoughts, files only slow down our lives and often prevent us from moving on.  And most of us so rarely reach out to finally bring order to the desktop, throw trash out of the closet, delete unnecessary icons on the desktop, disassemble folders with the logical name ‚ÄúDisassemble‚Äù and the not-so-logical ‚ÄúNew Folder (115) "And wash all the same cup, which will be white, honestly, honestly.  So sometimes you want to wipe everything off the table and throw away or enter rm -rf and enjoy the virginal purity around you. <br><br>  But it also needs a complete audit and business, especially in difficult times, such as now.  We hire literate people, each of whom we give at the mercy of their part of the activity, we look through their reports not in the most careful way, we give a blank check for not the most profitable deals, but all because we have a lot of things and we don‚Äôt have time familiarize yourself with the current affairs of the company under the jurisdiction of the people we hired.  Inevitably, there comes a time when we no longer understand where so many people are in the departments, why the quality and quantity of sales drops, reports cease to be given, and in general things develop somehow by themselves without our participation, and they do not develop for the best . <br><br>  This is the surest sign that something needs to be changed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/112/788/2d0/1127882d08837993d7f4a4539dd5e2d3.jpg" alt="image">

      How to get business back on track <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, we have got our hands, we are full of energy and enthusiasm and we want to conduct a full debriefing.  We need to understand who is right, who is to blame, which people we need, and with whom it is better to say goodbye.  Because it is in difficult times of crisis that you need to surround yourself with faithful and hardworking people who will be of business benefit, and not feed on it like mold.  So where do you start? <br><br>  First of all, it is best to view reports and statistics on the work of employees subordinate to you personally (if the company is small and without a complicated management structure) or their departments (if each of your immediate subordinates has their wards). <br><br>  Most often, after viewing the statistics, I want to fire everyone and rehire other people.  This strategy has both pros and cons. <br>  The advantages are that the new state, of course, will try, will work in full force, because  these people do not know you yet, they did not have time to get tired of work and always deserve the loyalty of the management and the award. <br>  Unfortunately, there are a lot more minuses: <br>  - Sooner or later, everything will return to normal and after a few such complete layoffs, you will not earn the best reputation, and in the end, you will get only losers who are not taken anywhere else. <br>  - You can dismiss under the general comb that part of the people who kept the whole business afloat on their shoulders, and then everything will collapse more steadily. <br>  - New staff need to be trained.  And you have to do it from scratch and for you.  Why you?  Why, did you forget how you dismissed anyone who at least knew something?  In this case, you will discover many new things, for example, that you don‚Äôt know any passwords, you don‚Äôt even know in what folder on the server are vital files and that you have absolutely no idea what your marketer did, and therefore you can‚Äôt introduce in the course of things new. <br>  - Finally, a full update of the staff does not guarantee fully competent staff, but it guarantees a headache for a long time. <br><br>  What then to do? <br>  I suggest the following scheme.  to use it or not, it is up to you and only you, but I hope everyone will take something into service and it will be useful.  So: <br>  1. Allocate time only for state updates.  A week or two, maybe more: depending on the number of employees.  Do not plan on this time of meetings, decide the routine by this time and try to devote all your attention only to the issue of personnel management. <br>  2. If you have a complex company structure and it is divided into several departments with a considerable number of employees, warn the heads of these departments for some time, so that they also free themselves working time.  They also have extensive work to conduct conversations with their subordinates, just like you, and if your desire to urgently put off all business and staff take care of them, it‚Äôs going to have negative consequences: first, naturally, this will lead to dissatisfaction (I don‚Äôt have anything else to do, nothing that I‚Äôm having meetings all week long ???), secondly, it will lead to an emergency job, someone will really have to give up a lot of events, someone will postpone the routine to the far shelf, and after that it will all have to be at a very fast pace  to rake and not the fact that they, them, can, in your company will not be any more. <br>  3. As already described above, request reporting on the work done, complete statistics.  For each of the departments / employees, for the increase in the number of people in the state, how the income of the company changed as a whole and in the context of the departments depending on the number of employees.  Make allowance for all extraneous factors: seasonality, crisis, changes in demand, increased competition, etc. They should not influence your decision about employees, how can you not motivate the staff, but if there is no demand, even the most virtuosic of sellers will not be able to sell sunblock retired Londoners, who never goes to rest. <br>  4. Conduct conversations with each of the employees subordinate to you personally.  Here again, everything depends on the structure of the organization. <br>  Tell as is.  The company's revenues are falling (standing still), the number of employees is growing.  This means that someone does not work in full force, as a result, you need to either activate everyone or weed out those whose work does not bring any results for the company.  In order to understand who exactly needs to be sifted out, and who is worthy to remain in the company, a number of measures must be taken.  To begin with, the employee with whom you are talking should provide a report on the work done during the last time period (month / week), an approximate work day plan, as well as a plan for the nearest time period (month / week), i.e.  what results this employee (his department) is planning to bring in this very period of time.  For example, if an employee or his department is engaged in sales, he must provide a sales plan, if it is bookkeeping, the schedule of the month, when what reports, at which section the department employees have a lot of free time, can this section be combined with another.  If the development department, again an approximate work plan, what work will be performed in the current month.  Give him free time on basic duties, if an employee has a plan, cut it.  His salary should not suffer because of the extra worries. <br>  5. If the structure of the organization is complex and clause 4 was to communicate with the heads of the department, its task is to conduct such conversations with each of his subordinates, collect all this data from them and consolidate them for you into a single view of the department as a whole .  If there are subdivisions, such work should move up to the lowest link.  Those.  managers should not communicate with each of the employees, but should collect information from each of the downline managers.  Thus, you will involve the whole staircase in the state renewal procedure and no staff member will go unnoticed. <br>  6. Further, each manager must analyze the weak points in the reports provided to them, since  each employee will lay out for themselves a different amount of work.  If in some of the cases the employee lays out a plan that does not suit you, with this employee you must personally review the plan, and also warn that with such a low plan this employee falls under the category of people who are unprofitable for the company.  All plans received from employees must be taken under control. <br>  7. Each employee needs to clarify that, on the basis of the plans they have provided, in the next period of time employees will be identified with whom they will have to part, as well as employees in whom the company sees its future.  Accordingly, those who do not want to fight for their place in the company can immediately approach the head and warn about possible care, also all people will have the opportunity to start looking for something else.  So it will be more honest: you do not dismiss people without warning, they have time to search for a new job or to revise priorities, many with new forces will regularly work further. <br>  8. Change the motivation system for the next reporting period, let's call it a trial period.  Since workers will provide different plans for the same responsibilities, all need to put in equal conditions.  Alternatively, you can leave the minimum salary for a transaction in kpi, depending on the percentage of completion of the work plan. <br>  9. The next stage is observation.  Here we kill several birds with one stone: We see those who know how to count their forces and proceeding from this plans can not only make but also fulfill, we see those for whom the promises are empty and they quickly sketched the numbers, not counting that someone this will pay attention, we see that, all other things being equal, one department works worse than the other and, in high probability, the problem is not in one department employee, but in its manager. <br>  10. Next begins screening.  All were warned for which all events were started.  Those who did not fulfill their own promises at least 90% already realize that it is time to look for happiness in another area.  With a complex structure, you need to start sifting from the bottom steps.  Those.  if the department‚Äôs plan was executed by 90%, and within the department all 80% of the total plan pulled out one or two employees out of ten, and they should be left.  In this case, the trial period is supposed to continue until the purity of the experiment is reached, since  if there is the same picture with other employees of the same department, there is something wrong with him and the head of the department, it is also advisable to say goodbye.  But this does not mean that if the department immediately fulfilled the plan by 50%, you need to give the manager his second chance.  The plan of the department is precisely the main indicator of the work of a manager, and it is better to immediately refuse such managers. <br>  11. It is necessary to talk with each remaining subordinate again, find out what is missing to optimize work, provide the necessary assistance, instruct on the hiring of new employees in the department. <br>  12. Now you have a very reduced state.  You got rid of the weak, giving them a second chance while not losing the people you can rely on.  Now you need to come to a common conclusion.  First, planning is better left, it should become a habit and keep the whole team in good shape, not let them forget why they are here.  Secondly, agree on a system of motivation.  It is best not to keep people on salary, so they will not have any desire to earn more.  Thirdly, the system of motivation and demotivation should not be limited to salary: select a rest room, take trainings, do not restrict them from being able to take a break or talk on the phone.  After all, the main thing is that they do their work and do it well, and under total control, where a step to the left is punishable by execution, and will be worked mechanically, without a soul.  At the same time, introduce a system of penalties for being late for work, absenteeism and other offenses, so you will teach staff organization and punctuality.  Teach your new employees immediately, who, under the supervision of old ones, will only expand the circle of people who will generate income. <br><br>  Appreciate and take care of your employees, always give them a second chance, and they will appreciate your business and help it grow! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303166/</a></p>
