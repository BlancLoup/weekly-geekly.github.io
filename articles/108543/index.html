But in the case of WikiLeaks, things are a little different.  The fact is that earlier the site of this organization was hosted on servers physically located in the suburbs of Stockholm.  WikiLeaks knowingly chose this place - the northern center is located in the former bomb shelter, so such a place can be called quite protected.  But, as it turned out, a month ago, the WikiLeaks organization ceased cooperation with a Swedish provider, as reported by the head of this hosting provider. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Apparently, after the Swedish court began to accuse Essenge, the head of WikiLeaks, in all mortal sins, including rape, he decided to remove the site itself from Sweden.  You never know, suddenly the authorities will want to check the server for the presence of compromising, or there child pornography, or something else.  It is worth noting that in recent times such searches have become very popular among law enforcement officers in many countries.

      Realizing the danger of the situation, Essendzh and his company left the country.  Essendge himself is now seeking political asylum from the Swiss government, and it is still unclear where WikiLeaks works.  The fact is that traffic from this resource is divided between several countries, including France and Holland.  Perhaps such a distribution really makes sense - especially since it is not yet clear with what / which providers WikiLeaks is currently working with. <br><br>  The head of the Swedish hosting provider says that WikiLeaks did not warn him about the move, and such an event came as a surprise to him.  The last invoice that the hosting company sent to WikiLeaks remains unpaid.  By the way, another hosting provider claims that WikiLeaks partially works in Switzerland, although again, it is not clear with which company in this country the resource cooperates. <br><br>  It seems that WikiLeaks is trying to protect itself against possible manifestations of a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù war on the part of various countries, including the United States, who are dissatisfied with the work of this organization.  Earlier, US politicians have repeatedly stated that Assange is for this country "enemy number 1", which must be destroyed by any suitable method, if not himself, then the site itself is certain. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/30340/20101121/">thelocal</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108543/</a></p>
