Now the <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.ru/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html">details</a> regarding Android One and its launch in India have become known. <br><br>  So, what does Google offer for a potential audience?  Phones of three leading electronics manufacturers in India were announced - Micromax, Karbonn, Spice, phones cost around 105 USD.  Users will receive a device on the MediaTek chip (which one hasn‚Äôt been said so far), support for two SIM cards, expandable memory, built-in FM radio and a replaceable battery.  In addition, all devices among the very first will receive an updated system - Android L, as well as users of the mobile operator Airtel will be able to update the firmware of their phone for free for six months and receive 200 MB of free traffic for downloading applications on Google Play.  As Google itself says, this is only the beginning of the Android One journey, soon phone manufacturers such as Acer, Alcatel Onetouch, ASUS, HTC, Intex, Lava, Lenovo, Panasonic, Xolo, and Qualcomm chipmaker, as well as in the near future, will join the program. expects to expand the program to Indonesia, the Philippines and the countries of South Asia.

      It seems that Google has very seriously approached the business of strengthening its position in the market of cheap smartphones, it remains to wait a bit and see the result of these efforts, perhaps we should expect from Chinese brands even stronger competition in the pricing policy of AOSP devices, we will see. <br>  In the meantime, you can watch the video announcement of the Android One, where Google very accurately conveys to whom the program is primarily aimed: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7UPR9z3OV8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgnmvXOegix5oB1qBSxZ3oqm_T5YQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Packages of games and applications on the App Store </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a38/8ff/bb2/a388ffbb2fe947129cd5f66b462f6548.png"><br><br>  With the release of iOS 8, developers have a new opportunity to sell products in the store via packages.  Now you can see offers from ZeptoLab, Rovio and many other large companies.  All packages are divided into three categories: application packages, game packages and application packages of the day.  The main feature of the packages, which is obligatory, is a discount.  By the way, there are not so many requirements for packages yet: <br><br><ul><li>  the package should be cheaper than all the applications included in it; </li><li>  one publisher can post up to 10 packages at the same time; </li><li>  one application can be simultaneously in no more than three packages; </li><li>  if at least one of the applications included in the package is withdrawn from sale, then the package will also be withdrawn. </li></ul><br>  It is not yet clear whether it will be possible to distribute packages of free-to-play-applications, but this is a great opportunity to show customers the entire series of games at once and offer to purchase it at a discount.  Packages of games will also be displayed in the tops of paid and cash applications. <br><br><br><h4>  Should I go for Windows Phone? </h4><br>  Satya Nadella gave a recent interview in which he tried to explain why Microsoft bought Minecraft.  But King, the creator of the very popular and profitable games of the Saga series, made an unexpected <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.fr/news/10929-king-les-projets-windows-phone-en-pause.html">move</a> - officially postponed the development of products for Windows Phone.  Not canceled, no, but ... sometimes a frozen project from a dead one differs only in flashing lights on the anabiosis camera. <br><br>  By the way, Supercell also does not plan to officially adapt Clash of Clans for Windows Phone.  Such decisions cast doubt on the attractiveness of the platform for other developers. <br><br><br><h4>  More than 300 types of products will appear under the brand Cut the Rope. </h4><br>  How to make the game more than just a game?  Spread it to all walks of life?  We saw how backpacks, pens and even soda pops of Angry Birds appeared.  The first call at McDonalds with Am Nyamovskiy "Happy Mil" was already ... And now we can observe the attempt to repeat the large deployment of the product on the example of the creators of Cut the Rope from ZeptoLab. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238143/</a></p>
