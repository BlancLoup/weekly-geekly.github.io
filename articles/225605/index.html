      Now let's talk with examples, including feedback from Habr. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Process errors </h4><br>  The client bought the game from us on the "island" in the aisle of the supermarket.  Two days later, I realized that the game did not stop, I decided to return.  I called, he was told that the return on the card is done at the point where the purchase was made.  After 10 days, he arrived at the scene, but he was informed that he needed to go to another point.  Because a refund is possible only day-to-day. <br><br>  Customer situation: Friday, evening, on foot, in the hands - the game box.  She eventually left it in the store without any paperwork.  At the same time, he read Habr, and was sure that they would decide something on the spot - service, everything. <br><br>  From our side so.  On the island there are really returns only on the day of purchase, on other days - on other points.  Operators know about the features of returns, but do not always understand that he will not go today.  Previously, the situation did not happen, because an experienced operator who knew all the rakes, asked where the purchase was, and explained everything in detail.  Here in the end we are wrong on all points. <br><br>  Therefore, we need to add this model to the process, change the training and solve the current situation: <br><ul><li>  Operators now describe different timing options.  The elder on the island has a new instruction in case a person comes in with a return. </li><li>  Returning funds in the ordinary case without a buyer at the outlet is not personally possible.  Specifically, this person made a return of funds remotely by special request to the bank. </li><li>  Wildly apologized <abbr title="and not only">.</abbr> </li><li>  They promised to deliver any next order for free. </li></ul><br>  The buyer stayed with us.  The next order was not slow to wait. <br><br>  Such bugs, in general, are easy to understand.  Another thing - external delivery and marriage.  Around October of last year, before the New Year's peak, two people inside the company decided to sort out these processes.  Igor Poleshchuk (co-founder) and Sergey Pyzhikov, the head of the call center, did the same guy who personally calls any jamb.  Again, look at the situation. <br><br><h4>  Marriage </h4><br>  Marriage in nastolki - the phenomenon is not uncommon.  The reason is the manual assembly of most games.  Perhaps only the Germans collect a robot, and even then, by no means always. <br><br>  <b>Example 1. The</b> buyer bought two identical games, one opened.  Maps were labeled due to typography.  He threw out the check, he himself became unwell - that is, he could not return in the two-week period, which is required by the standard (the client made a return for no reason with the return on marriage).  They explained that it is possible at any convenient time, and a check is not needed, but if there is confirmation of the operation, it will be much easier.  He arrived, showed an SMS from the bank and changed it according to a complicated statement.  Everything.  A check would have been preserved - there would have been a standard situation. <br><br>  <b>Example 2.</b> Habr, a person bought a Startup, for some reason it has maps for drawing with a felt-tip pen from the previous version, where they were under pencils.  Here it should be noted that this is our own production, and each component has its own debugging code, by which you can immediately find the cause of the problem.  This greatly reduces the level of marriage - and if someone else does not do that, it is only out of laziness, apparently. <br><br>  So, the buyer sent the debug code from the box.  With this code, we check the entire batch, selectively opening the boxes in different stores - there is no marriage anywhere else.  Fortunately, the buyer works near one of the stores, so they simply opened another box and gave them the cards they needed. <br>  There are two lessons in this situation: <br><ul><li>  The solution to the client's problem should be as fast as possible - if there is a normal box next to it, you can open it and deal with the design of the marriage only later without a client. </li><li>  Any marriage is a signal to check the entire batch.  We have already withdrawn the game a couple of times because of the 0-day in the new installment (once the domestic manufacturer forgot the figures, the second time the Europeans shoved Chinese cards into the Russian edition, and every tenth box).  Another example with Habr - a person writes that he bought checkers from us in a store in a package, and the hinges are rusty.  Issued a refund, opened up even 10 pieces of boxes with these checkers.  Yes, part of the loop - rusty.  Removed the goods from sale, the goods were returned to the supplier. </li></ul><br>  The other day we had an achivka, which sooner or later was supposed to happen according to the law of large numbers - when replacing a marriage, a person got a game with another marriage. <br><br>  Sometimes we are told the reasons for the return.  Two examples: "Both my guys gave me the same game, I want to return one" and "We were going to play with friends on the weekend, but I, it turns out, go to the army." <br><br><h4>  Couriers </h4><br>  In Moscow, we have our own couriers for urgent deliveries, plus we use external courier services to process the bulk of orders in the city.  Stories happen different - the most curious was that the courier, after a record number of deliveries for the New Year, just sat down at the buyer‚Äôs chair and fell asleep (they called to find out how to get rid of the body). <br><br>  It is clear that we can not control the work of the courier service in the city for 1500 kilometers from Moscow.  Therefore, the only objective line of control is the feedback from buyers. <br><br>  <b>Here is an example.</b>  The buyer (delivery to Irkutsk) left an SMS about the designated courier and arrival time.  The courier did not arrive at the appointed time, nor did he arrive in two hours.  The buyer wrote to the address of the courier service from the SMS with the status.  To the claim did not respond.  The problem is that it is March 8, and the gift was needed by the deadline.  A day later, he could not resist and wrote to us in the office box.  So we found out about the problem, because the courier hid it carefully.  The order is not the first, so the client stayed from what is happening in cognitive dissonance.  As a result, the order ‚Äúfinished off‚Äù, the buyer made a gift with delivery.  They talked to the courier service, they changed their counterpart in Irkutsk.  The situation there is generally magical - according to unverified data, they paid under the contract for 5 days of storage with them, and after 5 days additional fees began.  There is a feeling that the couriers of Irkutsk have come up with an awesome way to make money, setting the status of "under-calling" for the first 5 days.  A similar problem arose with another city, so in the end we refused to work with this delivery service as a whole. <br><br>  Couriers often experience overloads on holidays.  We have learned to accurately predict these moments, taking into account the load on the directions, but the lining still happens.  Example: during an anonymous Santa Claus in Habr√©, the buyer sends a Startup from Moscow to St. Petersburg.  This is December 25th.  Payment by card has passed.  The operator checks the delivery lines and reports that the nearest delivery in St. Petersburg is January 9, because everything, the city has risen.  This happened an hour before the corresponding notification in the basket and news appeared, therefore the client is fully right in his expectations.  The senior of one of the stores took the game, and either he himself traveled as a courier to the customer, or sent someone.  As a result, the gift arrived on time.  This is an example of what can, as a last resort, go past the process.  But only if very necessary. <br><br><h4>  post office </h4><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnd these bad people took the hat and mittens from the post office‚Äù</i> - there‚Äôs something like a stereotype about internal shipments.  It must be said that working with the post of Russia through any of the intermediaries greatly simplifies the matter.  The beauty is that in large warehouses such as the Ozonovsky warehouse there are terminals of the Post of the Russian Federation, ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù solely for receiving packages with goods.  And if they are properly packaged (in boxes with no backlash), then everything will be normal. <br><br>  We have been working without incident with the mail for half a year already - in terms of reliability it is, paradoxically, one of the best.  The difference between what was in 2011, and now quite tangible. <br><br>  The last emergency case was this: on January 13, the buyer orders the delivery of an EMS-accelerated EMS from Moscow to Tyumen.  This is 3 days maximum.  The package arrives after 11 days and with a crumpled corner.  Clearly, it does not really contribute to raising the mood.  Specifically, on this occasion, returned to the buyer money for express delivery.  He refused to exchange the Kotz box, because it would be a long time.  EMS got its pack of claims. <br><br><h4>  Difficult cases </h4><br>  As a rule, a good fit canopy is different in that it comes in a combo.  Here is another example.  The girl reserves 4 sets for growing plants in a shop on Ligovsky in St. Petersburg.  Comes to the point - only one is reserved, another one is available.  She buys two, then gets upset and orders two more by courier.  To heaps, the courier prodalbivaet delivery time (stuck somewhere in the industrial zone in the other end of the city) and does not tell anyone about it.  The girl finds the nearest living person on Vkontakte - the head of the event department in St. Petersburg, Olya, who you probably know from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/221509/">Chaypey</a> .  Olya transfers the situation to the call center. <br><br>  As a result, we significantly penalize the courier counterpart for breaching the terms of the contract.  According to the operator, we carry out re-certification and assign a second trial period (then he did not pass it).  I got in touch with the customer, apologized wildly, made a bonus. <br><br>  <b>And here is an example of a serial jamb</b> : they sent 5 orders long ago without payment (they were found during reconciliation).  It was like this: the customers were billed (a receipt for payment at the bank), they did not pay, and the operator saw the status, roughly speaking, ‚Äúthe order was collected‚Äù and gave the sending for sending.  The problem was in IT - the software showed the status of payment somewhere far in the corner of the form and small, and did not block the holding of the document for the warehouse with no payment.  Made changes to the procedure.  The operator, who gave the go-ahead, suffered only morally - a little lost faith in humanity, because none of these buyers said anything after receiving the goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b60/854/1fd/b608541fd10ab27ff038733efa7b6105.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Buyers are sometimes very surprised by the norm.</i> <br><br><h4>  Franchise </h4><br>  Habr, there is information that Volgograd does not allow unauthorized advertising on the walls of houses.  We do two check points, we find that the standards of the franchise do not comply.  We explain what needs to be corrected.  After some time, refuse to renew the contract. <br><br>  Twitter, post in "nowhere" that we are not good people and send spam.  Fortunately, the name of the company is mentioned, that is, it falls into the tracking tape, which we monitor on social networks.  We find out that the head of the franchise in Chelyabinsk made the decision to send them on the cold lists of SMS for the New Year - this is one of the services of the city's advertising agencies.  We strictly warn about the inadmissibility of such things, add a case to a French book with the analysis of the situation, we carry out a check of the point.  The head of the franchise is offended that he is undermined by earnings, and does not understand exactly where he is wrong.  After some time, he leaves the franchise, we open two of our own stores in the city. <br><br><h4>  Products </h4><br>  The buyer acquires the game Angry Birds (floor version), then writes that the game came in incomplete - there is no bag as in the photos of the goods on the site.  We check - there really is a bag in the photo, there is no picking in the game.  And the child saw the bag and wants it.  Slightly ofigevaem, ask the manufacturer.  It turns out that the equipment in the new lot has changed, but they forgot to warn us about it.  Urgently update the information and photos.  Please send us a box with a bag - again, the buyer took from us, and not from the manufacturer, that is, all the negotiations are conducted by our buyers.  The manufacturer in Europe says that there are no more such versions, and cannot help with anything.  We ask for official paper stamped about it - but instead of paper, we are suddenly sent a bag.  It takes about two weeks, we keep the client informed.  In the week we received a warehouse in Moscow, sent it to the buyer.  The bag itself fits in a large envelope.  Of course, we spent significantly more working time than the goods cost, but the principle is important here. <br><br>  <b>And the last case.</b>  We have a series of soft toys, which is made in three sizes.  For example, an owl may be 18 centimeters, 45 centimeters or 30 centimeters high.  There are two species in the series of lemurs, they are distinguished by the fact that one has a small tail, the other has a large, fluffy, fair one, twisted into a ring.  A buyer comes, fighting such a grandfather.  Puts a lemur, a steel ruler, a check on a rack near the cash register.  In the check, the product is marked as "Lemur Long Tail 18 cm."  Grandfather decorously and quietly spins the tail of the animal to the ruler: <br><blockquote>  - Lemur - is.  Long - there is.  The tail is 18 centimeters - see here.  You are four centimeters underweight to me.  Carry the right lemur! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225605/</a></p>
