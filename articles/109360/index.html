Apparently, the company's management decided that 10 free minutes a week is a bust.  As a result, the action miraculously disappeared.  And the tariff with current conditions is now far from being so profitable.  But what do you think, Beeline honestly warned its subscribers about changes in the conditions of the tariff for SMS?  Where there, users should find out about it themselves.  The most interesting thing is that with all the desire to find out, this is not so easy to do.

      But I honestly spent half an hour of my time and as a result found the unfortunate news.  Do you think it was called "Changes in the tariff plan 2010"?  Haha  How do you underestimate Beeline.  The news is called <a href="">Bonuses for communication</a> , as if the company decided to please users with new bonuses. <br><br>  And all right, it all ended with this news.  But no, it surprised us with new details.  After removing 10 bonus minutes, we were offered the ‚ÄúPayment Plus‚Äù promotion.  Less profitable, but giving the opportunity to receive 10% of the payment.  That is, if earlier it was possible to talk for a month, for example, 80 minutes and get 40, that is 50%, then now you will get only 8 rubles (10%) from these 80, for which, according to the terms of the tariff, you can also spend 8 minutes.  In general, compensated somehow. <br><br>  In my opinion, it is quite logical if they automatically connected this service (there is no fee for it by the subscriber, you do not need to pay for the connection).  After all, they were not too lazy to turn off the previous one without my consent?  But you have to connect yourself.  You can do this by calling the short number 0555. <br><br>  Summarizing, I ask all happy subscribers of Beeline operator to be vigilant.  A happy owners of the tariff plan 2010 to connect the service "Payment Plus" or change the tariff, so as not to break off completely.  But most of all, the fact that a reputable company can easily enter a fee for 1 minute of an outgoing call to 100 rubles, having previously written about it somewhere in the bins of the site with the headline "Special offer for all outgoing." <br><br>  <b>And what price are you willing to pay, living on the bright side?</b> <br><br>  PS I apologize in advance for the lack of vivid details about calls to Beeline with threats and about fights in the offices with their managers.  This was not because these people are not responsible for their amazing leadership. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109360/</a></p>
