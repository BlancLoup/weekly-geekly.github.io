      The official from SpaceIL at the moment is the last photo from the Bereshit apparatus (15 km to the surface of the Moon): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/wf/md/rxwfmdcziqiy5if2cji6ykgbdo0.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the location link for this photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/zq/es/lkzqesonslbs55xosdrna3tb5t4.jpeg"><br><br>  Preliminary results of the accident investigation: <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamSpaceIL/status/1118423609951834112">during the landing process, the on-board computer activated the team, the execution of which led to a fatal result for the mission</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/h7/ck/lzh7ckicc84ytwjc6d6zfqeei6y.png"><br><br>  <i>It was the time when the reaction was carried out.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt seems that <b>during the landing process a team was entered</b> that led to a chain reaction that caused the main engine to shut down and did not allow it to resume its operation further.‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  Updated on 04/18/2019: <br>  Yet the accident due to the command received from the operator during the landing is nerves, there is no time to analyze the situation, the main IMU1 unit (inertial measurement unit) is abnormal, the operator sends a command to activate the spare IMU2 unit, which caused further critical consequences in the work onboard computer (hang, reboot) and engine failure. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not a problem. </blockquote><br><br>  Thus, it is possible that this was a software / human error (commands were entered by the operator or engineers at the MCC) in the procedure for landing the Bereshit device. <br><br>  The list of commands and modes of operation with the Bereshit device were approved and transmitted only from the SpaceIL MCC.  SpaceIL engineers created patches for the on-board computer of the device, checked their performance and functionality, and also prepared the teams for the landing procedure. <br><br>  It is interesting to intercept the control of the device and introduce an additional code / command into its on-board computer. Theoretically, was it possible to do it or was there some kind of protection from external unauthorized access? <br><br>  After all, when landing, the time went on for seconds and operators could miss the situation with the device receiving other teams.  Although, at this moment, the operators also conjured in manual mode, trying to work with the device.  Maybe there was also a discrepancy on the commands entered at the same time. <br><br>  But, most likely, there was an error in "his" code (maybe it was in one of the many patches that were transmitted to the on-board computer after each restart of it), which contained a fatal command. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f76/0df/a6c/f760dfa6c0ebd9d89bed7fde7f2514c9.png"><br><br>  This team was introduced intentionally or accidentally, which led to the accident - this fact will remain closed, most likely, although we are waiting for the final results in the near future from SpaceIL, which they have promised to publish. <br><br>  <b>What is known about the hardware and software components of the Bereshit Apparatus:</b> <br><br>  - the on-board computer is one (1), not duplicated (there were several reboots of the computer during the flight to the Moon); <br><br>  - program control code, commands and work with the on-board computer - in C; <br><br>  - due to the fact that the computer is only one, when you restart, all updates (patches) are erased and they need to be additionally downloaded again into the system; <br><br>  - data transfer rate is low: one high resolution photo (from 8 Mpx camera) loads 40 minutes; <br><br>  - DLR (German Aerospace Center) conducted testing of the landing mechanism of the Bereshit apparatus; <br><br>  - a team at SpaceIL: the majority are engineers in the space industry and physics scientists, several young scientists and engineers who are just studying satellite management systems. <br><br>  When could the code be implemented with this fatal command?  Most likely, when preparing for the landing procedure. <br><br>  But the team in the on-board computer worked after the vehicle passed the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù when the automatic landing-controlled computer-controlled process began. <br><br>  Although in the SpaceIL MCC there was an attempt in the manual control mode to influence the situation with the device during landing. <br><br>  At a distance of 800 km from the landing, the landing procedures begin: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/27/-u/yx27-ugbb5ujryfpznnp6us5yye.png"><br><br>  The Bereshit unit will receive a series of commands from the MCC: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kk/7l/al/kk7laljrwgjbcbctxhamz242wj4.png"><br><br>  The landing sensors (main and backup) will be activated: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/yw/bv/tnywbvpcevowlohnnqotbsaeauc.png"><br><br>  A procedure will be initiated to change the position (orientation) of the Bereshit vehicle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v4/nv/cx/v4nvcxlt7wckz-xtqiqlpffvs7s.png"><br><br>  After the preparatory procedures are completed before landing, the on-board computer of the Bereshit device and the MCC will be able to assess the condition of the systems and readiness for landing, if something does not work correctly, the landing procedure will be canceled, if everything is normal, then after the start of the next stage No more cancellations will be done: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/ye/cd/meyecdrvop9k3aaary_k2c5tecw.png"><br><br>  If everything goes smoothly, the Bereshit unit will begin to reduce its orbital speed and reduce the distance to the surface of the moon using the main and auxiliary engines, this procedure will take 15 minutes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3j/lr/rd/3jlrrdewpxh4krldtpdzb0rqxba.png"><br><br>  Landing video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HMdUcchBYRA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What happened, according to the landing video, with the device (the times are shown from the video): <br><br>  23:03 The telemetry indicator turned green.
