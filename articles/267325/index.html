Such technologies are needed for responsible training in an immersion environment (how to maintain a nuclear reactor, for example), evacuation testing (each of us can escape from any oil platform with our eyes closed) and other things, <s>including rule 34</s> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e19/4b3/6ed/e194b36edd6141d19b98d21c29369fb9.jpg"><br>  <i>The design solutions of the Luzhniki Stadium are demonstrated on such a scheme developed by our graduate.</i>  <i>Engineers are very fond of such visual things with 40-50 indirectly interacting subsystems.</i>

All the same is a cool specialty, graduates are snapped up after graduation, many learn right away ‚Äúfor the job‚Äù from large companies.  Departure of the last course - only 15 out of 25 reached the exam.  Training is partly in English. <br><br>  Education costs $ 12,000, but you can enroll in the "budget" - <b>there are 25 free places</b> in the competition (details below).  Last year, the competition was 5 people with the existing 3D skills in place. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What do employers want from graduates in 2016? </h4><br>  In our area, among the designers-designers, the most demanded are specialists in modeling, who have comprehensive knowledge on creating 3D-content for engines, who are able to make animation, ‚Äúbaking textures‚Äù and low-poly models. <br><br>  Of the programmers are very popular specialists who know the entire cycle of content production.  Developers in JavaScript, C ++ and C # are now popular on the market.  People who create special effects (VFX-specialists) are also popular. <br><br>  Of the engineers, the most popular are those who can work with complex virtual reality systems (roughly speaking, with iron). <br><br>  Recently, there has been a demand for technologies related to virtual helmets, but in a lightweight form (cardboard), a bunch of applications for augmented reality are invented on the phone, so you need to be able to create content that weighs a little and can be displayed even on low-performance devices. <br><br><h4>  What do students usually do while studying? </h4><br>  Here are examples (some of the projects are not only a school, but also a 3D laboratory; sometimes students lead a project completely, sometimes they help with a commercial solution): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/da3/0b7/7c4da30b7bd448cbbabe0a976f6bd865.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6e/006/bdd/a6e006bdd0874a278868f57eb74b99e2.png"><br>  <i>This is an interactive demonstration of objects of Moscow for tourist purposes - it is used now on an information stand with a 84-inch 4K screen.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3c/983/98d/e3c98398da9f4eea94564c9657129b88.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33e/172/588/33e1725887e84a1d889cb3d6c2e6413f.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/469/7b0/29f/4697b029f150465d9ee42448d6a830cf.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/33e/a91/3fa33ea9168344d298b764f1b45e7844.jpeg"><br>  <i>Interactive presentation of the gas turbine installation.</i>  <i>Engineers during training needed to get more visual information about the modes.</i>  <i>The content is an interactive demonstration of the modes of operation of the unit, where the basic principles and technological innovations are visualized.</i>  <i>Content is demonstrated using a collective display system.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc3/ff9/56e/bc3ff956eb2d4291b07a5267925f9d73.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d4/c96/17b/1d4c9617bf004988af8f7e9fdfa9910c.png"><br>  <i>Development of a shell for describing technical processes.</i>  <i>Based on the training on the assembly, disassembly of the ball valve and the study of its design.</i>  <i>Interactive instruction works in conjunction with a personal desktop system for creating virtual reality, where 3D-objects turn into virtual layouts of real equipment and are supplemented with necessary information and documents.</i>  <i>The system allows you to disassemble and assemble an object, study its structure, as well as test your skills, passing the test for knowledge of the structure and sequence of operations.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe9/0c7/804/fe90c78049ab42dc945f0805e6b1f689.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65f/042/479/65f0424798714b36b43838ac0514bb7b.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44c/d3f/d29/44cd3fd29c954e79925c11a4858d6762.jpeg"><br>  <i>Application for the international exhibition "Sport".</i>  <i>Interactive instructions for the exercise on the simulator with the effect of augmented reality.</i>  <i>I put the phone on the simulator - showed instructions on how to work correctly.</i>  <i>The content was demonstrated to the leadership of the Ministry of Sports of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>Also a lab project.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/77e/585/ab277e585c0e45ac8fccde2cc1464f1a.png"><br>  <i>Virtual dispatching to monitor real objects using a 3D model.</i>  <i>That is, when conducting a virtual tour of a building or structure, we can see the readings of counters, indicators and remotes in real time.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/551/be8/581/551be858124640fb993a1617115d5447.jpeg"><br>  <i>Development of photo-realistic interactive visualization of the apartment interior for demonstration to the client in the immersion environment.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9b/c4c/479/c9bc4c4795364a78a20471ce8eba7360.jpeg"><br>  <i>Design in the construction industry</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbb/5b8/f5f/fbb5b8f5f42c464793fe5cfb32566708.jpeg"><br>  <i>Virtual Locomotive Repair: Mechanic Simulator</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbf/d46/4b2/fbfd464b287442dbbdbf01108c579a2e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faf/893/596/faf893596d3e46b1ba96bc34c221a6d1.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pilot project to create a national 3D-mapping of the eastern city.</i>  <i>Work out the process of converting 3D data obtained by conducting aerial photography and creating an interactive application for a 3D cube and table.</i>  <i>3D models were optimized and landscape details were added.</i>  <i>In the end, this city was shown to the crowned prince.</i> <br><br>  And a bunch of projects. <br><br><h4>  Wait, where are the promised automaton and the arctic greenhouse? </h4><br>  Here is the Mac Polar greenhouse: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e88/39e/ce0/e8839ece0c964507a6ece9c610061148.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77a/8fb/a3f/77a8fba3f20c4f5a88761581577da412.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/328/9a8/bcb3289a806b4ffb9cdb89ac238ab41f.png"><br><br>  As part of the training project, it was necessary to take an engineering object and conduct the most accurate demonstration of its subsystems and nodes.  The demonstration of the object in this case was conducted using a holographic stereo table, a room for immersion in virtual reality and a collective panoramic 3D-system.  These decisions allowed to make a walk on the object.  It is very important that there is not only engineering solutions, but also a serious architectural concept, so the task needed to impress various audiences - both techies and ‚Äúbig guys‚Äù.  Another part of the work is to show the object in different weather (snow, strong wind, etc.). <br><br>  But the machine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e81/917/401/e81917401009440bb20c4e10189b8ce8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb8/0d2/7a1/cb80d27a1b364fe4a5f6b14cdf625bf4.png"><br><br>  This is an educational project in the study of complex scripting.  The application allows you to study the design of weapons, test the knowledge skills of individual parts, as well as independently disassemble and assemble the AK-47 using a personalized system for creating virtual reality.  Excellent solution for quick response cushion troops. <br><br><h4>  Okay, what a program this year? </h4><br>  Theory plus practice: first boring and on paper, then hardcore and practice as above. <br><br>  The program is here: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><br>  12.10 - 10.13.15 <br><br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ General idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvirtual reality <br>  ¬∑ Work in a virtual reality environment <br>  ¬∑ Review of 3D solutions of EON Reality <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  October 14 - October 16, 2015 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ project management <br>  ¬∑ Basics of storyboarding <br>  ¬∑ Experience in project work at EON Reality and CROC <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  19.10 - 10.23.15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Basic course of 3D modeling <br>  ¬∑ 3ds Max - introductory course <br>  ¬∑ The basis of the work on creating a 3D model <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  October 26 - October 30, 2015 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ 3ds Max 3D modeling basic course <br>  ¬∑ Low poly - model creation, texturing, optimization <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  November 2 - November 6, 2015 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Advanced 3D modeling course <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  09.11 - 13.11.15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Advanced 3D modeling course <br>  ¬∑ Rigging and animation in 3ds Max <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  11/16 - 11/15/15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Introduction to working with EON Studio <br>  ¬∑ Interface <br>  ¬∑ Analogues <br>  ¬∑ Base modules <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  11.11 - 11.27.15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work in EON Studio <br>  ¬∑ Workshop <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  30.11 - 04.12.15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Programming in EON Studio <br>  ¬∑ Workshop <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  December 7 - December 11, 15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with EON Mobile <br>  ¬∑ Mobile application development <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  14.12 - 12.12.15 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with KOMPAS-3D <br>  ¬∑ CAD Formats <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  January 11 - January 15, 16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with visualization systems <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  Jan. 18 - Jan. 22, 16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with Kinect and LeapMotion <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  01/25 - 01/29/16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Advanced programming course <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  01.02 - 02.02.16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Creative Workshop from EON Reality <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  08.02 - 12.02.16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with virtual reality helmets <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  February 15 - February 19, 16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Work with EON Raptor <br>  ¬∑ CAD / DCC <br>  ¬∑ Creating complex materials <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  February 22 - February 26, 16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Training on Nettle virtual reality systems <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  February 29 - March 4, 16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Review of existing 3D engines <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  04.03 - 06.25.16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Practice in real projects <br>  ¬∑ Certification project <br></td></tr><tr><td><br>  27.06 - 01.07.16 <br></td><td><br>  ¬∑ Certification Autodesk, ASCON, PMI <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <b>The teachers</b> are EON Reality experts from the USA, the UK and Singapore, who are directly involved in the implementation and implementation of the product.
