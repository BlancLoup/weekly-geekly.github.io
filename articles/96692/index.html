  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social Radio Station (Public Radio or Radio 2.0)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.m-i-e.ru/user_files/Image/family8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I love the radio.  You can listen to him, doing any business.  It is a pity that the radio in the form in which it exists now is becoming less and less popular.  I think that radio stations lack interactive, feedback from listeners.  Not just SMS voting and calls, but a serious interactive, affecting the radio station broadcast.  Let's imagine together what the future radio might look like.  Let's call it Radio 2.0. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, such a station has a website.  The aggregator of all interesting things on a given topic.  The editors are engaged in the collection and analysis of materials on the Internet or in the "real", if events occur in the region of the station (everything depends on the subject and format of the radio station).  Editors form news feeds and publish news on the site.  Naturally, access to sections of interest for the site visitor is as convenient as possible. <br><br>  People read and vote for the materials, the editor of the section puts the evaluation materials, takes into account the number of publications on the Internet on each topic.  From these parameters, a rating is formed, according to which the materials fall into an hourly issue on this topic.  This parameter may vary.  For example, in those topics where news is updated more often - issues will be more often. <br>  The release is recorded and it goes on the air according to the schedule. <br><br>  The site is voiced on the air, and the fact that you can go to rate, like, comment, comment, etc.  ("You form the ether yourself"). <br>  Public response is analyzed, the rating is corrected.  Based on this, new issues are being formed.  Such a cycle occurs throughout the day.

      Evening graduation (for example, a duration of 1 hour) is formed from the most interesting and resonant events.  Bit by bit from all sources.  It is mixed, recorded and broadcast on air, for example, by 6:00 pm, when people go home and can listen to the most interesting events of the day. <br><br>  From this moment a new day and a new starting point begin. <br>  For yesterday's news a small factor is added to lower the rating, so that the news is relevant.  Yesterday's more, etc.  Updating or continuing the news adds a boost factor to the "starting" news. <br><br>  If you work in shifts, you can make news around the clock.  At night, you can even make releases from the least popular events - for a complete picture of the day.  Since there are fewer events at night and the rating will be formed more slowly, it is possible to broadcast repeats of daily issues, and in the morning - the final evening release, for those who have not heard in the evening. <br><br>  In free between the news blocks, you can broadcast educational programs of the same type, daily, weekly, etc., live broadcasts, retransmit podcasts created by enthusiasts on the most interesting topics of the day.  In the evening and at night sets of DJs from clubs to retransmit or invite musicians and DJs to play directly in the studio. <br><br>  On weekends, revision is required.  Schedule for the week - interchangeable. <br><br>  Also, the air can be diluted with music from the one that interests the listeners most.  To do this, the music editor on the site compiles lists of songs that match the station format.  People listen and vote, forming a rating of songs.  The higher the rating, the more often the track sounds on the radio.  (There are also statute of limitations).  The editor daily (weekly) adds songs that are similar in format, sound, and style to the top-rated tracks that are already on the air. <br><br>  The staff is formed in this way.  Pre-pick news topics.  Each direction has its own publishing editor and one or two journalist - information collector. <br>  General editor in chief.  One sound engineer for mixing recording and cleaning for each direction, or one for several directions (depending on the load). <br>  For each direction, another journalist, making the transfer of this subject.  He has been released from the news, but is also obliged to form a rating of materials and search for podcasts on his subject.  All week working on the creation of programs. <br>  The advertiser is looking for advertising on the air and on the site.  PR-specialist communicates with students, forms public opinion, looking for partners for the station promotion. <br><br>  For those who visit only the site and can not listen to the radio - additional services: <br>  1. Formation of a digest from a popular site at any time, and the ability to print yourself in a convenient form on a printer.  Percentage of materials of different subjects is desirable to form based on the preferences of the visitor. <br><br>  2. Web digest of events for the day.  Audio release of the day‚Äôs events in text form after the broadcast, in the form of a newspaper / magazine (avtoverstka, in a pre-designed format, or layout manually). <br><br>  3. Tape of news releases, broadcasts, with the ability to listen online or download. <br><br>  4. The most interesting nightly broadcasts in the morning on the site for commenting, and studying the opinions of people. <br><br>  This is, in general, I imagine a new generation radio station.  Some ideas may be used on different radio stations now.  But the radio, the content of which would be formed by the users themselves - so far only the future.  I would like to believe that the near. <br><br>  I propose to discuss the idea and its viability in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96692/</a></p>
