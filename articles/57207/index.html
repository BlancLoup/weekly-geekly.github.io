  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Management's influence on projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of us, and perhaps you yourself, faced the problem of project management. <br><br><h4>  <b>What do I mean by that?</b> </h4><br><br>  I would like to start with a story about personal experience, from which you will understand the essence of the topic and its problems. <br>  A year ago I came to work at company ‚ÄúX‚Äù (conditionally I would name it so as to avoid incidents) and headed its main project.  The project was devoted to media topics, something like a magazine or a yellow press, but this is not the point. <br>  My tasks included direct project management, writing thematic materials, updating and development.  I had 5 people on staff - content managers, a programmer, and an administrator.  They all I had to manage.  Everything seemed to be going smoothly and well until the authorities decided to magnetise the project, increase services and turn it from a good media resource into a portal (trash) ... <br>  From the very beginning, I tried to explain to the management that this would not bring good, because now the resource is used by people who are particularly interested in materials, everything is convenient, good and correct, and that the new services do not bring anything to the resource, since they simply do not belong its subject matter, and even commonplace is not needed by anyone.  My statement was taken in hostility and in the form of an order I was forced to do what they wanted ... <br>  As a result, we created a portal (dump), a lot of everything, news and even the weather in the city ... So half a year passed, the result was an almost complete outflow of the target audience, reduced attendance and unprofitableness of the entire system.  As a result, the authorities agreed to return the old type of resource.  Then another half year passed before the old audience returned to the site in part.  But it was a great lesson for the management of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <b>Well, why am I leading all this ?!</b>  <b>Again...</b> </h4><br><br>  Dear managers, listen to the opinion of project managers, and if you really want to, as much as reluctance, add something new and fresh to your project, at the beginning, analyze whether you need it ... it is very easy to do it.  <b>First</b> , ask the visitors what they would like to see on the site, what they are missing, then put everything in a table and cross out what does not correspond to the resource at all.  <b>Secondly</b> , conduct marketing research (in the cases, if the implemented function / service will be manietized).  <b>Thirdly</b> , pay attention to such successful Russian and foreign projects, maybe you are adjacent to emphasize good ideas from them, just do not engage in plagiarism. <br><br>  That seems to be all!  Share your thought.  America has not opened, but for someone it may be interesting. <br><br>  Information from my blog: <a href="http://www.dvoryan.com/">dvoryan.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57207/</a></p>
