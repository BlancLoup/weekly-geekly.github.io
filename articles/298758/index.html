It was all the more surprising to hear the indignant cries of the victims of Minusinsk when their websites from the first page of Yandex fell down on the fifth page.

      But services showing for each visitor of the site his profile on social networks did not arouse concern.  The mechanism for obtaining information was not disclosed, but at the same time, each manufacturer of such a service on its website provided legal information, where it was written that everything was legal. <br><br>  And then it turned out that a completely fraudulent mechanism was used to determine the profile, the term ‚Äúsocial phishing‚Äù was born, and all sorts of penalties fell on legal users of the service, both from the social networks themselves and from the search engines. <br><br>  But this story told for the seed is far from the worst thing that can happen to a bona fide customer.  Blocking a company profile in a social network or a fall in the search engine results can be experienced. <br><br>  <b>The visit of law enforcement representatives is much more serious.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/1b4/062/a721b406256249d59ddb10ef77249bb0.jpg"><br><blockquote>  Following the rule - write about what you know well, I‚Äôll tell you what kind of ‚Äúsetup‚Äù a well-known market for employee activity control systems can give. </blockquote><br>  <b>And here is the story here.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modern personnel monitoring systems have a fairly large functionality that allows you to determine whether an employee is busy with business or games / social networks.  Here and control over running programs, visited sites, received and sent messages and much more.  And also a video of the screens of employees' computers, keylogger and time tracking. <br><blockquote>  All of this control is probably not very pleasant for many lower-level managers, but it greatly increases the company's survival in times of crisis.  And most importantly, all these control methods are absolutely legal.  The worker‚Äôs PC belongs to the employer, the employee‚Äôs time is also sold to the employer in exchange for wages. </blockquote><br>  <b>But then the incomprehensible happened ...</b> <br><br>  Some manufacturers of personnel monitoring systems for some reason included sound recording in their products. <br>  The head has the opportunity to listen to what they say employees at their workplaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/145/bfb/8b2145bfbd5743b6bc0009e6fef00553.jpg" height="300"><br><br>  That is, in fact, computers have become devices for covert sound fixation. <br><br>  <b>And here it is likely that such a program can be recognized as a special tool.</b> <br>  That is, a technical tool designed for the secret receiving of audio information. <br><br>  If lawyers speak mostly positively about the <b>quality control of an</b> employee‚Äôs <b>work</b> with the help of technical means (it‚Äôs enough to recall the recent decision of the ECtHR), then there‚Äôs an interception - it is an interception. <br><br>  In order to avoid problems, the employer must give all employees a signature to the contract to add an employment contract, which states that a wiretap works in the office. <br>  As my personal experience shows, the majority of workers are rather calm about the fact that they begin to control computer activities.  But intervention in personal freedoms is perceived very negatively. <br><br>  But the problem is that special technical equipment is forbidden to be resold without a license. <br><blockquote>  <b>Article 138.1.</b>  <b>Illegal circulation of special technical equipment intended for secretly obtaining information</b> <br><br>  Illegal production, purchase and (or) sale of special technical equipment intended for secretly obtaining information is <i>punished with a fine of up to two hundred thousand rubles or in the amount of wages or other income of the convicted person for a period of up to eighteen months, or restriction of liberty for up to four years, either forced labor for up to four years with the deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years or without it, or imprisonment</i>  <i>for a period of up to four years with the deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to three years or without one.</i> </blockquote>  That is, theoretically, people in uniform may come to the office of any <b>partner</b> or <b>distributor</b> and begin a rather unpleasant story. <br><br>  The moral of this story is as follows. <br><ol><li>  Before you buy a software product or distribute it, carefully study the legislative practice. </li><li>  If you are developing your own software with fundamentally new functionality, check it for compliance with the law, otherwise you can substitute your clients and partners. </li><li>  Proper employee control systems are a great tool that can help your company survive a crisis, but systems with voice recording functionality can be a problem. </li></ol><br>  Good luck in business! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298758/</a></p>
