Many people think that determination is an innate quality, and that successful people are just lucky people who are lucky enough to be born with him in abundance.  But if you ask any successful person, he will tell you that it is not;  he just always found a way to maximize what he had.

      Here are 5 ways to use determination and maintain concentration: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Plan your day the night before.</font> </h2><br>  Before you go to sleep, decide what you will do tomorrow, what you wear, what to eat for breakfast, how expensive you will go to work.  It's easier to pack a healthy lunch the night before than to think about what you want to eat standing in front of a hot dog stand in front of your office. <br><br>  The same applies to spending money.  Determine your budget and follow it. <br><br>  Decide the night before that you will not check emails or browse websites before you complete more important tasks.  Stick to the schedule, and at the end of the day, close your eyes for a few minutes and feel how much you like to feel responsible for your day. <br><br>  When planning the day becomes a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-prevratit-samosovershenstvovanie-v-privychku/">habit</a> , it will be easier to avoid unnecessary and wasting time and energy on minor, unimportant matters. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. First do the most difficult things.</font> </h2><br>  Difficult tasks will not get any easier if we worry about them or postpone them.  We will only spend energy, although it would be wiser to simply show patience and complete these complex tasks.  Take on hard work right away while you are still awake and you have energy. <br><br>  The study showed that our mind works best in the morning, and it is at this time that we must take on hard work.  After it no longer stands in the way, we can relax and take care of the chore that does not require so much mental exertion, ability and energy.  (We recommend reading a useful article on <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/sekret-o-tom-kak-vsye-delat-vovremya/">how to do everything on time</a> .) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Eliminate distractions</font> </h2><br>  We need to be prepared for the present urgent matters when they appear.  Most of the situations that distract us are not urgent and do not require an immediate response.  Many of these situations will resolve themselves after some time. <br><br>  Reacting to them immediately, you only get more such situations.  By not answering them, you show that you are a strong-willed, focused person who is very busy;  and soon you will be less bothered by trivial questions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Recover and save your energy</font> </h2><br>  Take a short break while working on something, if you feel that your energy is decreasing.  Brisk walking, jogging, stretching or anything that helps you take a break from work and rejuvenate.  You will return to work with new forces and with concentration. <br><br>  Instead of eating a lot at lunch, eat a healthy meal, such as fresh fruit or vegetables during the day.  Drink plenty of water and exercise regularly.  Arrange it all so that you don‚Äôt have to think about it and become part of your daily routine. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Constantly remind yourself of your main goals.</font> </h2><br>  Make a visualization board, a short motivational video, or something else that will constantly remind you of what you are working for.  The word ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the goal is key and will serve as a motivator. <br><br>  Suppose the reason you want to earn $ 10 million is to open a school in a third world country.  Create a clear vision of how the school will look, so you can present this image regularly.  Determine the time to visualize this goal and give it 5 minutes daily.  The more details, the better.  It is good to create emotional involvement in visualization with the help of music, video or something that makes you emotion.  Emotional attachment is very important, it will motivate you to move towards the goal. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pyat-zabluzhdeniy-o-produktivnosti-kotorye-my-sebe-vnushaem/">Five misconceptions about productivity, which we inspire.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290698/</a></p>
