  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network for programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is not just another Habr or something else ... Just a thought came to mind after reading some articles. <br><br>  This startup is aimed at both beginners and advanced programmers.  I don‚Äôt even know how to describe the idea right away ... I‚Äôll just write an approximate course of action if you wanted to use the service. <br><br>  You are a novice programmer or decided to retrain, learn a new programming language.  You register and get ranked, for example, ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù.  Choose the appropriate section: for example ‚ÄúPHP‚Äù and subscribe to it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By subscribing to it, you can start by reading the blog.  Publications will be appropriate from the choice of tools, installation and configuration of the server and TP to solving specific tasks for this language / framework and TP, in short, the theory. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then you go to the practice: in the "ads" or "job search".  These tasks are created by more advanced programmers for beginners or more advanced levels.  I think that it is appropriate to give real tasks even from real projects, of different complexity, which any other user can choose.  You can focus on the complexity of the task that the creator installs or on your own skills.  You choose a task, unsubscribe about it, about your level and so on. <br><br>  Further, the choice is already for those who published the task.  He chooses the user and attaches him.  He can attach a few newbies behind him who will work on this assignment or on different ones.  He, too, can be subordinate to someone, working on a more complex task, corresponding to his skills.  As a result, the tree of users from skilled, professionals, to beginners turns out. <br><br>  What is the essence and purpose of the project: <br><ul><li>  to give beginners the opportunity to gain experience in working on real projects, giving tasks from the simplest things to the more complex ones. </li><li>  more advanced users can get real help in simple, routine tasks even in projects they are working on. </li></ul><br>  Most likely, the tasks will be free to some level, i.e.  training.  But the possibility of paid work, too, must be provided.  Also, a task not necessarily completed will be used in a real project, but a beginner will learn, grow, move higher in a tree, take on newcomers too, etc.  Maybe even start earning a little more difficult tasks. <br><br>  Completed tasks <em>can be</em> published, analyze errors, propose other solutions, attach similar and so on.  This is something like a knowledge base, which other users can then rely on when solving a similar task. <br><br>  The ‚Äúvacancies‚Äù section, blogs, even SVN hosting and project hosting (opensource) are all appropriate here! <br><br>  In short, this is something like ‚Äúopen‚Äù freelancing. <br><br>  I, frankly, would be glad to such a resource, because right now I am trying to learn Qt and would gladly perform simple tasks in real projects, thus gaining skills.  And secondly, it is communication.  Community of people united by common interests. <br><br>  I hope, I understood myself clearly, because all thoughts were mixed up in my head and it‚Äôs not so easy to build them.  I will be glad to hear comments and suggestions.  And the idea I really want to realize ... <br><br>  Now imagine that on this site programmers will work together on open source ... <br><br>  UPD: First of all, this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, where first of all - training newcomers.  This is an attempt to combine work with learning, improving skills.  And I want, of course, it was convenient to work, maybe even at a higher level than freelancing.  These are my ideas spinning%) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26430/</a></p>
