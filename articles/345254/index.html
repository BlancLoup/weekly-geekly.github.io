  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What salaries for IT specialists are offered by My Circle employers, data for May-October 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already traditionally, at the end of each year, we look at My Circle, which salaries are offered by employers who place their vacancies with us for IT specialists.  Of course, this is not an objective analysis of wages in the entire IT industry - for this we, nevertheless, do not have enough data.  But, at a minimum, this can be useful information for users of our service: both employers and applicants. <br><br>  In the current report, we will show the salaries indicated in the vacancies, both in Russia as a whole, and in Moscow and the regions in particular, as we did this last time.  But this time we will compare these salaries with the median salaries from our new <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">salary calculator</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/eg/s9/coegs93yulmhfoeyfgt0nom8xlc.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/k4/hh/vbk4hhc7jtvw5if7boaiqtdjj5i.png" alt="image">

We use data for all vacancies in which salaries are indicated only for the last six months, and more precisely from May to October inclusive.  Usually in vacancies indicate the salary in the form of a range of "from and to".  When calculating, we took all the salaries ‚Äúfrom‚Äù, counted the median value and called it ‚Äúthe lower limit of salaries‚Äù, and all salaries ‚Äúto‚Äù, also counted the median value and called it the ‚Äúupper limit of salaries‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>The first thing we want to pay attention to</b> is that the median wages from the wage calculator for almost all specializations correspond to the lower boundaries of wages in vacancies.  That is, at least for half of our applicants (whose current salaries are below the median), the vacancies of our employers look quite attractive in terms of salaries.  These vacancies are also attractive for the part of the second half of applicants (whose current salaries are higher than the median). <br><br>  Only in marketing and management, the median wages from the calculator turned out to be higher than the upper limits of salaries in vacancies.  In our opinion, this means that employers should pay attention to the fact that ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù has many specialists from these fields of activity for which there are suitable vacancies that require more qualifications and experience than in those vacancies that are placed now. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Further, if we compare Moscow and regional salaries</b> , we see approximately the same picture as last year.  On the main technical specializations - backend, frontend, mobile, desktop (software), administration - we see a gap of 30-50%.  A smaller gap for testers - 15-20%.  Surprisingly, there is almost no gap in the top salaries in vacancies for managers, marketers and designers.  However, there is still a gap in the bottom wages, about 15-20%. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>As for the comparison of current wages with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/315992/">last year‚Äôs</a> wages</b> for the same period, we see that in Russia as a whole, wages in almost all specializations increased by 10‚Äì25% both at the lower and at the upper limits.  But in terms of management, testing and design, the upper boundaries remained at the same level, although the lower boundaries also tightened. <br><br><hr><br>  At the beginning of next year we will make the first detailed report on salaries according to our salary calculator.  We will be able to consider each of the areas of activity for narrower specializations, as well as look at the salaries of developers for individual programming languages.  We invite everyone to participate in the upcoming analytics by entering your current salary into our <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">salary calculator</a> (if you have not done it yet) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345254/</a></p>
