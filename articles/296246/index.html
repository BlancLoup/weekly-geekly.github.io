    <h3>  Types of dissatisfied customers </h3><br>  Some customers expect a thorough apology, others react calmly, but shake a mustache, while others insist on an immediate solution to problems.  Each requires a special approach, and it is good if you immediately determine which one.  Understanding what the client is expecting from you, you will correctly construct the conversation and reduce dissatisfaction to a minimum. <br><br>  <strong>A ferocious</strong> client sends a stream of continuous accusations at you - common and possibly personal.  It takes some time for him to go directly to the problem. <br><br>  Sometimes this kind of behavior is specially ‚Äúembellished‚Äù to cause a feeling of guilt, because of which employees are trying in every way to somehow please. <br><br>  <em>Show firmness, patience and politeness.</em>  <em>Excuses won't help.</em>  <em>It‚Äôs better to go straight to the point: explain how, who and for how long will solve the problem</em> . <br><br>  <strong>A balanced</strong> client replaces the accusations with the phrases ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù ‚Äúhow can that be so‚Äù, ‚ÄúI would have done otherwise.‚Äù  He is indignant culturally, expressing concern and disagreement. <br><br>  <em>Answer calmly, but confidently.</em>  <em>Solve the problem and be sure to support the conversation on other topics, as this type of customer especially appreciates attention</em> . <br><br>  <strong>A quiet</strong> client rarely complains, but forgets nothing and draws conclusions.  At one point, you simply discover that he went to his competitors and in the process told his colleagues how bad your service is. <br><br>  <em>Organize an easy way for complaints and complaints: periodical letters with a short questionnaire, a personal manager's call or another method will help, depending on the standards adopted by the company.</em>  <em>You do not overdo it: according to statistics, only one of 25 silent clients complains</em> . <br><br>  <strong>A key</strong> client is aware of its importance, it is sure that it deserves the best, and is ready to pay for it.  Like the ferocious type, he does not tolerate excuses and requires quick troubleshooting. <br><br>  <em>Solve the problem, then be sure to contact the client, specify whether everything is in order, and ask how to compensate for the inconvenience</em> . <br><br>  <strong>An omniscient</strong> customer is upset that you do not agree with all his proposals.  He sincerely believes that he understands many things, although this is not always the case. <br><br>  <em>Explain your position in detail and give examples from personal experience.</em>  <em>This type of customer is great for improving communication skills.</em>  . <br><br>  <strong>The requesting</strong> customer is aiming for compensation.  He does not need answers and explanations.  If he thinks that you are guilty, nothing will suit him, except for the bonus for inconvenience. <br><br>  <em>Self-control, confidence in the product, exact figures and proven facts will help to reflect the unreasonable onslaught</em> . <br><br>  <strong>The sniveling</strong> client asks a lot of questions, does not bother to try to figure out incomprehensible moments, writes in support and complains even in situations where the problem does not apply to your product. <br><br>  <em>Be patient and keep cool.</em>  <em>It is difficult to satisfy such a client: he is waiting for the most detailed answers and lengthy apologies, after which he immediately finds a reason for a new complaint.</em>  <em>Plus the fact that he will appreciate your efforts.</em>  <em>If he likes everything, he will sing the praises of each friend about you</em> . <br><br><h3>  Conflict resolution </h3><br>  With honor to get out of a difficult situation and improve the company's reputation in the eyes of the client will help seven proven steps.  Reserve in advance with endurance, patience and diplomacy. <br><br><h4>  1) Listen </h4><br>  Let the client speak out.  Perhaps he is angry and talking on high tones.  Do not take it to heart - aggression is not directed at you, but at the situation.  Keeping cool is extremely difficult, but don't give in to emotions. <br><br>  Your task is to understand what the problem is and help the other person to let off steam.  Do not interrupt the client, but make it clear that a quick solution depends on his peace of mind. <br><br>  <em>Your enemies: emotionality, heightened tone, a mirror image of client behavior, inattention</em> . <br><br><h4>  2) Show sympathy </h4><br>  We all enjoy compassion, especially in stressful situations.  After client aggression subsides, gather strength and express sympathy.  Show that you understand how upset he is. <br><br>  <em>Your friends: ‚ÄúI understand your disappointment,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow unpleasant you must be,‚Äù ‚ÄúI myself have been in such a situation and I know how terrible it is.‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  3) Apologize </h4><br>  Even if you personally are not guilty in this situation, be sure to apologize.  Attempts to point to the guilty, blame the problem on a third-party service, magnetic storms or a full moon are inappropriate, they only add fuel to the fire. <br><br>  Imagine yourself in the place of a client, think about the inconvenience that has been delivered to him, and ask for forgiveness. <br><br>  <em>Your enemies: dodging, falsehood, formal politeness</em> . <br><br><h4>  4) Decide on the actions </h4><br>  If you are not completely sure what the client expects, just ask him.  Repeat the key points of the problem and, if necessary, ask additional questions.  So the client will understand that you listened to him carefully, and you confirm your assumptions as to which direction to go.  You must clearly understand what result will leave the client happy. <br><br>  <em>Your friends: the desire to get to the bottom of the essence, peace of mind, friendliness</em> . <br><br><h4>  5) Solve the problem </h4><br>  If the solution to the problem is within your competence, do it.  If not, immediately connect a specialist who is better than others to cope with the task.  Explain your actions to the client and warn him how long it will take to eliminate the shortcomings. <br><br>  Offer compensation: a discount, bonus or free use of your product for a certain time.  If you find it difficult, ask the client: ‚ÄúWhat can we do for you in the form of compensation?‚Äù <br><br>  <em>Your enemies: random actions, slow response, refusal of compensation</em> . <br><br><h4>  6) Rejuvenate </h4><br>  After reaching the desired result, take a break, and also take a few minutes to think about what happened.  Even if the client was finally satisfied, such situations do not pass without a trace.  Therefore, a short "cleansing" of the mind will benefit you.  Documenting events (time, date, problem, and solution) simplifies this process. <br><br>  <em>Your friends: a short break, analysis of the situation, conclusions for the future</em> . <br><br><h4>  7) Conduct a diagnosis </h4><br>  Appreciate a disgruntled customer - he showed the weak point of the product or service.  After settling the conflict, sort out the reasons.  Do not look for perpetrators, do not kindle a war between employees - just make sure that this will not happen again in the future. <br><br>  <em>Your enemies: disregard for the incoming signals and the lack of "work on the bugs</em> . <em>"</em> <br><br>  ‚Äî‚Äî <br><br>  <strong>Do not turn the desire to provide excellent service in a banal sycophancy</strong> .  Clients are not always right, and some of them will remain unhappy.  Respect yourself and your employees.  Act as the famous principle in the Ritz-Carlton hotels says: "Ladies and gentlemen serve the ladies and gentlemen." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296246/</a></p>
