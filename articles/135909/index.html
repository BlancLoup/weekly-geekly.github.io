  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comprehensive course on site development: prerequisites, dreams and plans</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all know how many firms there are consisting of ‚Äúa couple of students‚Äù who make websites ‚Äúover 5 thousand‚Äù.  Perhaps it would not be worth even paying attention to them, however, in our region at the moment the situation is quite critical: the Internet is still not very developed, there are practically no more or less serious urban / regional resources that could be leveled at.  And 90% of the sites related to our region are made by such students on their knees. <br><br>  In this case, customers often do not even understand the difference and make the site "for a tick," "to be." <br><br>  The problem, in my opinion, lies in education.  In our city (Nizhnevartovsk) there are educational institutions that graduate from IT.  And I, having finished one of these, I know for sure that IT people are not taught to really make websites.  And websites want to do everything - ‚Äúit's so simple‚Äù! <br>  The university is given only a fragmented set of technologies, which, roughly speaking, everyone uses as he wants.  And there is no data on how to start developing a site at all and on the fact that more than one person should do this :)

      <br>
      In this regard, I consider it imperative to introduce such a course on all IT specialties.  The way I imagine it - under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Another prerequisite </h5><br>  I have been working in the field of web development for about 5 years.  First, as a student, then as a department head.  Finding a competent content manager (not to mention a web designer or web programmer) to support existing projects in our city is simply unrealistic.  And then, it is easier to train a person from scratch than to take him, stuffed with the wrong knowledge and personal convictions. <br>  Often worked with interns, but to take an intern - also a finger to the sky.  During practice, you can only manage to teach something, but he will not have time to work properly. <br><br>  Therefore, I came to the conclusion that it is necessary to look for personnel through the university, not only turning to teachers to be advised, but carefully selecting and learning for myself the most susceptible to this activity of students. <br><br>  But for this, you still need to think of how the site development process is going on! <br><br>  In order to get a couple of students thinking like us by the winter of next year, you need to start preparing now for the beginning of the 2012-2013 school year. <br><br><h4>  Training program </h4><br>  Born about such a curriculum.  I know that many fellow students teach at universities, perhaps any similar discipline.  Therefore, I really want to hear a competent opinion. <br>  <b>Not a university is considered as a base, but a college, and the graduates' qualifications are generally a ‚Äútechnician‚Äù, not a programmer, but they are trying to give them as much knowledge as possible so that they are determined with the further direction for development / specialization.</b> <br><br>  For successful completion of the course, students need to own: Photoshop (to understand the layers, basic skills), HTML, CSS, optional PHP, to have an idea about the databases.  Most likely, 3 or 4 courses (of 4 college courses). <br>  The desired course volume is 64 hours, including practical exercises. <br><br>  1. General information on integrated website development <br><ul><li>  that different specialists should be involved in the process, </li><li>  examples of cool studios and how they work (how much time should be devoted to design), </li><li>  about possible roles and participation of the programmer in the process. </li></ul><br>  To affect the development of web applications as a private (the trend towards the development of cloud services).  Little mention should be made of the role of the server and the client (what side is and how is the display of sites, the HTTP protocol in the most general terms). <br><br>  2. The process of developing a site in stages, starting with the development of a layout in Photoshop, <br>  to mention that the site should have an idea that the site is a marketing tool.  In outline. <br><br>  3. Software tools for website development (Notepad ++, denwer, zen-coding).  Why it is not necessary to write sites in visual editors. <br><br>  4. Further cutting layouts and assembling them in html.  Together we start to impose a site template from a ready-made psd layout.  Tabular and marvelous layout.  Different browsers, processing sites on the client side (why there is a problem of cross-browser compatibility).  Standards, doctype.  W3C Validator.  Site htmlbook.  Why do we need CSS, the principle of separation of content from presentation <br>  <i>Show site <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">www.csszengarden.com</a></i> <br>  The concept of usability, Jacob Nielsen and webmascons. <br><br>  5. Revitalizing the layered layout using dynamic languages ‚Äã‚Äã(php), template engines.  Using JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery (overview). <br><br>  6. Using CMS on the example of bitrix.  Prepare reports on various CMS, if someone wants (Joomla, WordPress, etc.).  If people own PHP, delve into the development of templates and customization of components on Bitrix. <br>  <i>(In particular, we work on bitrix, and the original goal of the course is to prepare personnel)</i> <br><br>  7. Typography on the site, why it is important (with examples from the Managers and other sources). <br><br>  8. Image processing for the site (perhaps some tricks in Photoshop). <br><br>  9. Preparation of the site for publication, the choice of hosting, perhaps, SEO or contextual advertising.  Ways to promote a site depending on its goals (image or contextual advertising).  Modern <br>  types of targeting (behavioral, plus affect social networks). <br><br>  In practice or in the next semester as a continuation of the course - coursework - site development from the first stage, each has its own layout (issue training psd). <br><br>  So far it's rather messy - but in general these are the topics that I want to touch on. <br>  I will add that I do not pretend to the truth, so I will be glad to constructive criticism in the comments, especially from those who teach. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135909/</a></p>
