Books that you feel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I admit honestly, I publish this article in order to be able to write comments on Habr√©.  And of course, he will share some, in my opinion, interesting considerations with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3c/abe/6d0/d3cabe6d0c9f483b836b3562c9015aef.png"><br><br>  I'll start from the end.  Imagine you are reading the book electronically on your tablet or phone.  You are in headphones. <br>  In the story comes an interesting, exciting, or tense moment, which is accompanied by rain and lightning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In headphones, the melody that begins to sound is not loud, but corresponding to the moment.  You hear the sound of rain.  And flashes of lightning are displayed on the screen and are accompanied by trembling in the hands (vibro).  You are literally under this rain with the hero.  In the description, the main character gets an umbrella - an interactive part appears at the bottom of the screen, a hero with an unopened umbrella.  You run your finger in a straight line as if unlocked in an iPhone and the hero straightens and raises an umbrella above his head.  The sound changes a little, the sound of rain drops on an umbrella is added.  Interactive smoothly goes along with the soundtrack.  Read on ...

      In certain places of the book there are video inserts, such as water, fire, wind, sunset, dawn, space.  Different sounds.  Light flashes.  At the end of the book plays the final song. <br><br>  Do you think the immersion in the book will be deeper under these conditions?  How will children who previously did not want to read books react to such a book? <br><br>  I enjoy the fact that I live during the rapid development of technology.  We watch the video in 3d.  Imax cinemas are switching to a new 4d format.  Virtual reality is no longer fiction.  Soon the eye rift will come to every home.  You can play games not only by pressing buttons, but by transmitting body gestures using sensors ‚Äî Kinect technology.  3d printers.  Internet of things. <br><br>  But what about the books?  We still read books in the usual format on high-tech devices, without using their enormous possibilities.  Text, pictures.  Everything. <br><br>  Yes, with an interesting book we dive into the world quite deeply and quickly, but what if it plunges even deeper and in some sense feels what is happening? <br><br>  This is my vision of reading books - books 2.0 (let's call it that).  Above, I have already described the general idea, let us dwell on the details. <br><br>  <b>1. Software</b> <br><br>  Reading takes place using a program that is installed on the device (tablet, phone).  It reproduces all the content of the book - text, audio, video, vibro, interactive.  The program, upon the occurrence of a specific event, plays the corresponding additional content.  An event can be considered a hit of a prepared mark in the center of the screen or the display of a page with a mark, with a countdown of time, which can be determined by a user reading a test of several pages. <br><br>  <b>2. Book</b> <br><br>  The book consists of a main text file with tags for additional content.  Well, he add.  content. <br><br>  <b>3. Additional content</b> <br><br>  <i>Sound</i> - various melodies, songs, sound effects. <br>  <i>Video</i> - video fragments can be reproduced in the bottom of the screen or under text as background, but with a certain transparency for the readability of the main text. <br>  <i>Pictures</i> <br>  <i>Vibro</i> - various rhythms, frequency, duration. <br>  <i>Various special effects</i> in the form of flashes, flashes, etc. <br>  <i>Interactive</i> - scenes where the reader can participate: shot, sword blow, on / off something.  Separately, I note, the interactive can be interesting and useful for children's books. <br><br>  Probably the biggest, but still solvable complexity will be to create a quality add.  content that will best fit what is happening in the book. <br><br>  I believe that books 2.0 technology is only a matter of time and can become not only interesting, but also useful. <br>  If you find this information worthy of attention or vice versa not worth it, please write your opinion. <br>  Would you like to see the alpha version of the book created in javascript, to participate? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375461/</a></p>
