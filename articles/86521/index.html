  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everything has its time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Disclaimer: <br>  1) for a serious study does not claim; <br>  2) I have something to do); <br>  3) maybe not in the topic, but I do not know where, tell me. <br><br>  Spent some time researching Vkontakte.  Now watched the status and age of people. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, I calculated the dependence of the number of people on age.  It turned out the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c4/290/bd5/0c4290bd51ca7e4b84542d1609522da4.jpg"><br>  Everything is clear, the bell, everything.  The maximum is somewhere in 20 years.  A very interesting detail was found: peaks in the field of a whole number of decades.  20, 30, 40, 50 years + another 15 years.  This is something interesting.  There is just one suspicion: we have 2010, which means this is the 90th, 80th, 70th, 60th year of birth.  The numbers are round, all sorts of jokers could easily choose them.  Later there will be more about it. <br>  We go further.  The most interesting and intriguing status: <strong>‚Äúin active search‚Äù</strong> .  The graph represents the proportion of people at a given age who have such a status. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eec/7b8/27b/eec7b827b28471f1dd3db1f82bd1dd2b.jpg"><br>  The maximum for this status is 14 years.  At age 14, 37% of people are ‚Äúactively searching.‚Äù  This is a lot! <br>  But even here an interesting feature is the abnormally high percentage of people in active search at 30 years old.  What?  I do not understand‚Ä¶ <br><br>  We go further: <strong>"there is a girlfriend</strong> . <strong>"</strong>  Here is a picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/470/5c6/664/4705c666407683a2556d7821e5743770.jpg"><br>  Hooray, the bell again.  The maximum now falls on 20 years.  At this age, 19% have a girlfriend or friend.  At 12 and 13 years old, there are some deviations from the bell, well, this is understandable: how is it that there is a Vkontakte page, but there is no friend?  Well, and again, easy problems in 30 years. <br>  <strong>"Engaged".</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51d/8e9/177/51d8e917771b7ae6efc33a93021e648c.jpg"><br>  Very beautiful and smooth bell, a maximum of 21 years.  The status, however, is not very widespread: even at 21, no more than 5% have one.

      <strong>"Married or Married"</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aea/231/a80/aea231a80fa7a90626f2960d0a5d090c.jpg"><br>  If the previous statuses are still temporary, then this is often once for life.  Therefore, there is a logical saturation.  The maximum derivative, that is, the age at which most people marry, falls on 25 years.  Interesting features: pre-peak in 17 years.  I do not even know what to explain.  Maybe by waiting and marrying? <br>  As usual, the anomaly is 30 years old.  And with ages greater than 30, significant noise begins - this is due to the fact that few people on Vkontakte are over the age of 30, which means a high proportion of all accidents. <br>  It became interesting whether the decline in the share at a certain point.  Therefore, I came to the collection of data up to 64 years, and really saw some decline.  Guess after what age - 49-50 years.  Yes, yes, "gray in a beard - a devil in the rib" ... <br>  And finally: <strong>"everything is difficult</strong> . <strong>"</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7b/b65/a2d/a7bb65a2df229b0f3b0b83ea423d9114.jpg"><br>  The share is too small, so the noise is large, but the overall dynamics is visible.  ‚ÄúEverything is difficult‚Äù mainly in people from 12 to 18, then everything is simple, and then again ‚Äúeverything is difficult‚Äù.  After 40 it becomes a little easier).  And again - giant emissions in 25, 30, 40, 50 years.  I'm pretty sure these are some kind of false accounts.  Note that they have "everything is difficult." <br>  And finally, a beautiful comparison: a sort of circle of life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bb/717/50c/5bb71750c83cf951b3d792b1fde3cec2.jpg"><br>  I invite you to discuss the results! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86521/</a></p>
