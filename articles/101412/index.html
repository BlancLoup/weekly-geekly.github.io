    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the initial data: <br>  Modem zte 626 from Pchelain, stitched to "Universalka" for use in Linux. <br>  Laptop with Bubunt 10.04. <br>  D-Link DIR320 access point with ‚ÄúOlegovsky‚Äù firmware. <br><br>  All this iron is very good and kindly worked together for a year, and who is more - no complaints.  Crawled into No from the modem, connected the modem to the access point - everything is fine ... <br><br>  ... Until he took up the "Bezlimit" from Pchelain! <br><br>  For starters, a certificate of their ‚Äúno-limit‚Äù: no-limit ends on the second gigabyte, and then the traffic is blatantly cut!  (Here I don‚Äôt ideologically give a damn about this fact, because the dacha is next to Vnukov, and there in all the Beeline tests are deep ...! So, cut-and-ditch, but 64 kilobits, to which they cut, we are there and the best of times did not meet!) <br>  Well, all this fun is worth 550 rubles ... <br>  Yes, I know, 495 is written, but another 50 rubles for the connection, and for more than a month I don‚Äôt need it myself ... <br><br>  To get started - you need to activate the tariff. <br>  There are two ways: <br>  1. * 110 * 700 # (but the code must also be LEARNED !!! It is shown as pictures, and if you don‚Äôt load pictures to save - alas and ah! Generally - arrogance! All providers have their sites for free ... Except for mobile operators!) <br>  2. Through the site. <br><br>  Having decided that through the site it will be more convenient for me in the future - I requested a password and entered ... <br>  ... Almost: ‚ÄúWe offer you (completely voluntarily) to change the password for every fireman!  But then we will not let go without changing the password!  But it is ABSOLUTELY VOLUNTARY! ‚Äù <br><br>  Then an epic in the style ‚ÄúChange tariff -&gt; To Unlimited -&gt; Yes, yes, yes!  I agree!" <br>  ... And the page does not load ... <br>  I repeat the process (the balance has not decreased, the tariff is still old!), "... YES!"  and the page is not loaded! <br>  I fight with my head on the table on the veranda (the connection is really better from the second floor!), The parents ask from below what happened ... <br>  Spit, ship pictures, figure out the fucking code, and enter it! <br>  "Your application is accepted!" <br>  And silence - the balance request gives all the same amount of 700 rubles in the tail, and an attempt to go to No - breaks off! <br><br>  Forces are no longer - midnight, came on Monday. <br><br>  - In the morning I continued to bang: ‚ÄúI knocked on the wheels, closed and opened all the windows‚Äù - the result is zero! <br>  But the money was withdrawn !!! <br>  But it does not connect! <br><br>  I call in support for a free 8-800- ... (calls from a modem SIM card are IMPOSSIBLE, and the rest I have are Mega and MTS ...), I choose in the voice menu that I need YUSB modems, yes, I am the owner, yes I have problems! <br>  As a result, the secretary picks up the phone, explaining the situation: <br>  - So you need it in YUSB modems! <br>  - So I called there! <br>  - Well, you got hooked up in the wrong place ... <br><br>  Transferred the call.  I explain the next situation, call the number: <br>  - And this is not what you need here!  You in YUSB modems! <br>  - Pancake!  Where am I?  I got yours the same here and kicked off! <br><br>  Translates the call, explain, call the number: <br>  - And this is not for you here! <br>  - PGRR!  Is that not modems again ?! <br>  - Modems!  But you have the Moscow region, and this is the Tmutarakan office! <br>  - PPPPP! <br>  - I switch to Moscow! <br>  - "... Everyone is busy, wait for everything - nothing 50 minutes!" <br>  - YYYYY! <br><br>  Rezvanivayu.  I wait for the answer of the secretary, clearly spelling out what you need YUSB-MODES MOSCOW REGION! <br>  ‚ÄúGood, good, I understand you!‚Äù <br>  This time from the second (TOTAL !!!) redirect came to support. <br>  The support was scratched in the back of my head and I couldn‚Äôt advise anything: ‚ÄúThe parameters on the tariff are the same!‚Äù <br><br>  Assessing the quality of work for the bot as "1-1-1-1" I call back to the manager (only two redirects were needed!), I explain the situation, saying that since  everything was OK before the tariff change - turn back and return the grandmother! <br>  - Your application is accepted, sometime and you will have 3G! <br><br>  In the evening, he took from his father SUCH a SAME modem and laptop with Windows and began to test: <br>  1. Winda + fathers modem + father Simka = works.  So the base station is alive. <br>  2. Winda + fathers modem + my simka = except for jokes, but ALSO WORKS !!!  Rave!  My modem burned out ?! <br>  3. Linux + my modem + my simka = fig with butter. <br>  4. Linux + my modem + father Simka - everything is OK !!! <br><br>  Marrazm! <br>  I call in support, with the third call forwarding I get to the right place, I explain the clarified data. <br>  The support with a perceptible odor boils away the remains of the brain: why it cannot be explained so !!! <br><br>  - <br><br>  Day passed‚Ä¶ <br>  Today they received a call from the support team and talked to them in the end. In five minutes they found a problem that they could not solve! <br>  TADAM !!! <br>  In all settings and instructions both on mobiles and modems from Pchelain APN is listed as internet.beeline.ru - everything was as it was and worked ... <br>  But ... For unlimited tariffs - you need to write <b>home</b> .beeline.ru !!! <br>  The modem prog is all up to date, apparently, and substitutes, but in Linux - you need to beat in ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe settings are no different!‚Äù - ha, ha, ha‚Ä¶ <br><br>  PS ‚ÄúSome Biline sent me a message here!‚Äù (A phrase spoken by the mother in response to an informational message) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101412/</a></p>
