    <h4>  New design </h4><br>  The previous design was not bad, but not in all parts and places is logical, many important functions were removed in the secondary menus, and the additional ones, on the contrary, were striking. <br><br> <a href="http://inmile.com/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4710/4900531.49/0_85fa9_cebe4b28_orig" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In the new version, everything became more logical, as it seems to me, all the main sections are moved to the top menu, site management has become easier, despite the increase in functionality. <br><br>  Added service offers that people created near you, and many other features. <br><br>  Now the whole site is an HTML5 + JS application that works as a single page (except for redirects during authorization). <br><br>  This at the same time makes use of the project faster and more convenient, but also limits the number of browsers that can adequately work with the project. <br><br>  In the current version, IE support is not complete (for objective reasons). <br><br><h4>  Mobile version and application </h4><br>  Simultaneously with the new version of the site, we launched a mobile version of the project, optimized for work on iOS and Android devices. <br><br>  The mobile version is also a single page that loads content from the API as needed. <br><br> <a href="http://inmile.com/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5815/4900531.49/0_85fa7_1cbbb09e_orig" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The mobile version recognizes devices automatically, although there are a number of problems with this due to the ‚Äúperversions‚Äù of device manufacturers.  For example, HTC Sensation specifies the following information in USER_AGENT: <br><br> <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_3; HTC_Sensation_Z710e; ru-bg) AppleWebKit/533.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0 Safari/533.16</code> <br> <br>  By conventional methods, such a phone is defined as something on MAC OS X 10.6.3.  I would be grateful to those who write in the comments, what other android-devices like to introduce themselves, and what they write in USER_AGENT. <br><br>  <b>For all Android devices (and for those on MAC OS X) the application is available in the <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.inmile">market</a> :</b> <br><br> <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.inmile"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4416/4900531.49/0_86510_ac7d867b_orig" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The iOS version is being moderated in the AppStore. <br><br><h4>  More people around </h4><br> <a href="http://inmile.com/"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4417/4900531.49/0_8650f_9f90ea9_orig" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Now there are really a lot of them, we publish not only our own information about people around, but also collect data from popular geolocation and neochen networks. <br><br>  Going to <a href="http://inmile.com/">inmile.com</a> you will almost always see people around, no matter where you are, in the center of Moscow or in Singapore. <br><br>  You can see them on the map, in the list of people on the left, their messages and marks in the stream of events. <br><br>  By the way, almost all users in the system have a floor, even if we removed information about them from services that themselves do not know the gender of their visitors.  This makes sorting by floor quite interesting, you can easily see the girls around. <br><br><h4>  API </h4><br> <a href="http://inmile.com/api_info"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5411/4900531.49/0_85fab_47aa0832_orig" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Finally, we launched the API for third-party developers, it is available at <a href="http://inmile.com/api_info">http://inmile.com/api_info</a> . <br><br>  At the moment, through the API you can receive - people, places and offers around, messages and stream marks, information about users and places, send messages to the stream. <br><br>  <b>To work with the API, you will need to receive api_id and api_key, to receive them, send me an email at info@inmile.com, in the letter you need to specify:</b> <br>  1. The name of the application (or test name); <br>  2. Your contact e-mail (to inform about important changes in the API); <br>  3. Link to the redirect, where you need to send the user after confirming the rights to the application.  This is not a requirement, because  For mobile applications, reverse redirect is not relevant. <br><br>  In the future, this procedure will become automatic when the developer‚Äôs office is completed. <br><br>  <b>Just yesterday, API documentation appeared in English</b> , we did it for our partners, but it is available to everyone. <br><br>  There is also an API for mass actions in the system, but it is closed and issued only to partners with an existing user base and is designed to integrate user databases (for example, so that users of our system can send personal messages to an external system and receive responses).  If you are interested in it - write to the mail. <br><br>  Inmail soon will be integrated with several very popular projects, and our partners will launch advertising campaigns in several countries of the world (if you want to develop the project in a country, we are ready to discuss conditions with you, write to info@inmile.com) . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130242/</a></p>
