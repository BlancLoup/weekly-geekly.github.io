      In 1973, Motorola developed the first mobile device.  Twenty years later, the first pocket-sized computer, the Psion 3, was born. Formally, they existed earlier (in particular, the first IBM Simon smartphone appeared in the same year), but they were limited to a notebook, calculator, and clock. <br><br>  But Psion 3 had a truly unlimited functionality: on the basis of the EPOC operating system, the OPL (Open Programming Language) programming language was created, allowing anyone to create their own application.  Later, it is he who will form the basis of the well-known Symbian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4c/013/0d2/a4c0130d288c4c7d9f5f55630b45c0b4.jpg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>Psion 3. The first is not officially, but in fact</i></font> <br><br>  In those days, the Psion was, in fact, only one competitor - the Palm Pilot.  This device did not allow the Psion 4 to enter the market.  And the real touchscreen is to blame for everything, and, most importantly, the ability to create C / C ++ applications.  It is not difficult to guess how many advantages this gave the Palm OS platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/214/be2/910/214be2910a4642048a6156e894d49266.jpg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>Palm Pilot.</i></font>  <font color="#808080"><i>A small step towards a big sensory future</i></font> <br><br>  Here are the tools for working with mobile gadgets of the time: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>WML (Wireless Markup Language)</b> is a markup language designed for devices with limitations caused by slow internet, low RAM, and screen size and quality.  In essence, this is the same HTML, but with more stringent tag pairing requirements and heavily curtailed functionality.  It was first used just in the Palm Pilot. </li><li>  J <b>2ME / JME</b> , by analogy with WML, is a shortened version of Java.  Practically any person who had a ‚Äúserious‚Äù mobile phone in the early 2000s faced the search for applications written in J2ME. </li><li>  <b>J2ME</b> mainly consists of two configurations: CDC (Connected Device Configuration) and CLDC (Connected Limited Device Configuration).  The first is designed for relatively powerful and productive devices, for example, communicators or handheld computers.  The second is for inexpensive gadgets with significant restrictions, but with an eye on a wide audience.  Specifically, for mobile phones, the MIDP (Mobile Information Device Profile) mode was used, ensuring the coordinated operation of the interface, applications, network and saving all settings.  It is thanks to him that we have learned the wonders of mobile 2D games and the first colorful applications. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">Development</font> </h2><br><br>  A key period in the development of mobile applications, anticipating modern, is almost entirely related to the existence of the Symbian system.  Symbian originated from the EPOC platform, as a result of the collaboration of Psion, Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia.  The collaboration was so successful that by the end of the era in 2009, more than 250 million devices worked on <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Symbian-Foundation-Adds-New-Member-Nuance-117209.shtml">Symbian</a> . <br><br>  Of course, the main contribution to the development of the system has made Nokia.  Symbian S60 under their leadership has grown into a platform that is comparable in power and fullness to modern ones.  Despite the fact that Samsung and LG smartphones also worked on the S60, the dominance did not grow into uniformity. <br><br>  So, Sony Ericsson and Motorola were committed to Symbian UIQ, a platform with nominally more features, in particular, optimization for working with touch devices.  In addition, there were variations of Symbian S40, S80, S90, and all of them were almost incompatible, which exacerbated the struggle between mobile companies, and users often became supporters of only one brand of phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/968/0be/2b5/9680be2b5f50461da48f03df728e9737.jpg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>This is how your phone should look like in the 2000s.</i></font>  <font color="#808080"><i>Stylish and strict</i></font> <br><br>  At the same time, the Finnish manufacturer based on the S60 periodically created additional platforms for developing games and applications, for example, N-Gage.  The first attempt in 2003 failed, but the second in 2008 marked the release of a whole line of multimedia devices, which became the last presensory classics. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">Modern world</font> </h2><br><br>  The appearance of the Apple iPhone, as well as Nokia‚Äôs reluctance to part with Symbian‚Äôs legacy, has predetermined a new rival group of platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS. <br><br>  Officially, the iOS system was born (until 2010 and the launch of the iPad was called the iPhone OS) appeared only in March 2008, but it actually existed since the beginning of 2007. The fact is that Apple protected the platform from third-party developers for the first year and a half, claiming That smartphones work on a stripped down desktop operating system. <br><br>  In 2008, a beta version of the application development environment (SDK) (Software Development Kit) was released.  Today, the package, along with standard tools for using the physical and software capabilities of the device, includes Xcode and iPhone Simulator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16c/3e4/d6b/16c3e4d6bc9847b492eb1142505bfde0.png"><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>So today is conventionally denoted "any" smartphone</i></font> <br><br>  The development of Android began in 2005: it was then that Google bought a young and ambitious company, Android Inc.  It is not known for certain exactly which platform the work was carried out for 2 years, but 10 months after the start of iPhone sales at Google, they announced the launch of the Android mobile system, the creation of the Open Handset Alliance (OHL) - an alliance engaged in its support and development, as well as a package for Android developers "Early Look" SDK. <br><br>  Android is based on the Linux kernel and the Java virtual machine.  Google has managed to quickly develop and immediately give to all interested developers virtually unlimited possibilities for creating applications - from the Android Native Development Kit (porting libraries and components from many languages) to OpenGL ES (working with three-dimensional graphics).  In addition, from the first day of launch in November 2007, Google holds contests for the best applications with multi-million prizes. <br><br>  Windows Mobile has lived and flourished in the market of communicators and handheld computers since 2000, until at the end of the decade the popularity of touchscreen smartphones with related operating systems did not put Microsoft to create a decent answer. <br><br>  The idea was to take the best from the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, tie it to the still-trusting Nokia phones, and thereby attract developers to the development of the new platform.  This goal was served by Visual Studio Express, which allows you to create both highly focused applications and cross-platform ones.  WP also offered the developer tools for Windows Bridge (porting third-party applications), Expression Blend (web design), XNA (games), Silverlight (Internet applications).  However, the last two frameworks are no longer relevant due to the lack of support and the cross-platform Windows 10 system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/c38/007/859c3800781b4ac6a83ebcc29d5260a4.jpg"><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>Good hardware and software capabilities of Windows Phone did not win the hearts</i></font> <br><br>  The BlackBerry OS is perhaps the least developed and closest to eternal oblivion mobile operating system.  The first version was released in 2009, but only five years later it became truly stable and functional.  Particular emphasis is placed on user friendliness (many interesting finds, like miniatures, BB Hub, gestures management were ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù later in Android and iOS) and corporate security. <br><br>  But with the applications turned out to be very tight.  If today you go to <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/">the development page</a> , half of the options proposed will be the creation of an Android application with the ability to run on BB devices.  In fact, starting with version 10, you get the pre-installed Amazon App Store and the ability to choose any other Android store. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#416078">Future</font> </h2><br><br>  It remains only to guess what will become relevant tomorrow, both as the main platform and gadget ‚Ññ1.  On the one hand, it is obvious that solutions that are relevant today on "large" devices will be relevant on mobile too - be it <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/geekbrains/blog/277957/">web design</a> or creating Java applications. <br><br>  At the same time, a deeper introduction of pocket devices (which are now both on the hand and on the face) means that the touch control of tomorrow may be replaced, for example, by fully visual (sign language) or voice control. <br><br>  Do not discount the possible return to simpler mobile phone platforms.  In particular, just recently it became known that Microsoft has developed a new operating system for budget devices, which will replace the outdated and still functioning Symbian. <br><br>  And what development do you expect? <br><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>Article author: Ilya Bubnov</i></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278605/</a></p>
