  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hunting Space Inspectors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the first satellite was in orbit, instructions on how to observe it were published in newspapers.  But almost immediately to the peaceful scientific and national economic satellites were added the military, about the design, purpose and parameters of the orbits of which the states already had no desire to tell.  At the same time, an information imbalance has turned out - developed countries have advanced means of controlling space, the special services of Russia and the United States, using laser, optical and radar stations, know about each other‚Äôs military satellites.  But the general public, these data are not reported.  But fortunately there are enthusiasts who observe satellites and are able to find even secret devices.  In recent years, inspector satellites regularly appear in the news - military vehicles designed to track other satellites.  And thanks to the enthusiasts, we know much more about them than officially informed by the creator countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_u/hw/fh/_uhwfhr4l6e2vgt5s_ksthzu1ys.jpeg"><br>  <i>The Tango and Mango satellites are flying close by, to the right is the Tango photo taken by Mango</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How to find Prowler </h2><br>  November 15, 1990 a military mission of the Space Shuttle STS-38 went into orbit.  Officially, she launched one satellite, which Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology magazine announced as an optical reconnaissance vehicle for ‚Äúmonitoring mainly the Persian Gulf region and providing information for the operation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25C2%25AB%25D0%25A9%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25C2%25BB">Desert Shield</a> ‚Äù.  There was also a version that it was a geostationary Magnum satellite for electronic intelligence.  Amateur astronomers watched the shuttle and noticed a flickering (i.e. rotating) object around it, which soon disappeared.  This is exactly what the launch of the upper stage with the satellite from the shuttle looks like from the ground.  However, photographs published after landing caused serious suspicions that the load was different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/uj/wk/goujwka7mkdxtorn7qqigj7lxb0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photos from missions STS-6, STS-38, photo by NASA</i>

      The photo on the left shows a swivel mount of satellites using the IUS (Inertial Upper Stage) upper stage.  It was he who had to withdraw the estimated payload.  However, the published photograph of the STS-38 mission (right) does not contain any traces of bulky equipment.  Consequently, the payload was different. <br><br>  Enthusiasts observing the low orbit did not find a new satellite, so the Aviation Week version was untenable.  The launch vehicle, officially declared as USA-67, was located in geostationary orbit.  But the intrigue is not over.  In the officially published catalog of space objects, two entries were assigned to STS-38 - USA-67 and the ‚Äúupper stage‚Äù.  The problem - on satellites SDS-2, which, presumably, was the USA-67, was built into the design and not reset apogee engine.  Did the shuttle brought not one satellite, but two? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2o/tn/7j/2otn7j4u19lnhrb7clioka8_juq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Secret Prowler's Track</i> <br><br>  In 2004, NBC news <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6687654/ns/us_news-security/t/what-americas-top-secret-spy-program/">published</a> information about a secret American device for tracking satellites in geostationary orbit.  Amateur astronomer Ted Molczan, who has been observing satellites since the age of 15, brought the pieces of the puzzle together and in 2011 <a href="http://satobs.org/seesat_ref/STS_38/Unknown_GEO_Object_2000-653A_-_90007_Identified_as_Prowler.pdf">put forward a</a> well-founded hypothesis that it was this object discovered in 1998 that was the secret satellite-inspector.  The fact is that the reconstruction of its orbit in the past showed that the device was passing near the Soviet satellites. <br><br><h2>  Raised heads </h2><br>  October 4, 1957 really opened up a new era of humanity.  For the first time, a man could lift his head and see a spark in the sky.  Unlike fast-flashing and dying out meteors or motionless flickering stars, the satellite moved evenly across the sky.  Fifteen-year-old Ted Molczan in 1968 one evening saw a bright satellite moving from north to south and wanted to look at it again.  Rough calculations of the orbital parameters, taking into account the rotation of the Earth, showed that the satellite will appear the next evening 15 minutes after sunset.  At the calculated time, Ted went out into the yard, looked up and saw a familiar star.  This is how an amateur astronomer was born, observing satellites.  And this is just one of many stories. <br><br>  At the dawn of the space age, the Soviet space program was of great interest.  It was generally more closed, and irrational secrecy was in effect, when the satellites that did not go into orbit remained unknown, and if, for example, the interplanetary station could not leave the earth orbit, it was called a ‚Äúsuccessful satellite‚Äù.  Jonathan McDowell recalls how in the early 80s, analyzing open data, including station experiments, was able to distinguish the military OPS "Almaz" from civilian DOS "Salyut" despite the fact that both types of stations officially called ‚ÄúSalutes‚Äù, and define ‚ÄúCosmos-557‚Äù as an orbital station of the DOS ‚ÄúSalyut‚Äù type. <br><br>  Since the appearance of the first satellites of the country, they launched, indicated the orbital parameters and frequencies of their on-board radio stations.  Until now, the overwhelming majority of satellites fall into the TLE catalog (format for representing orbit parameters) available to the general public.  But not all.  Since 1984, the United States has ceased to publish the orbital parameters of some military satellites and to report information about the purpose of the device when registering it with the UN (the practice adopted since 1976).  And it is from this year that the heyday of amateur satellite surveillance can be counted.  Because an ordinary person, without access to super-expensive equipment and secret information, could find what the superpower had hidden from the public.  Of course, enthusiasts are not omnipotent and in the worst case can search for a satellite for years, but, in conditions where secrecy is removed in decades, it is better than not knowing at all.  In recent years, inspector satellites regularly appear in the news - military vehicles designed to track other satellites.  And thanks to the enthusiasts, we know much more about them than officially informed by the creator countries. <br><br><h2>  Inspector on ... </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0p/ei/vn/0peivnypq2s63dn64uywwzzv-3w.jpeg"><br>  <i>Satellites in orbit, image by Michael Najjar</i> <br><br>  At the dawn of the space age, docking was considered a very difficult task.  But the development of mathematics and equipment showed that it is quite realizable.  The main thing is to initially launch the device into an orbit close to the target.  Because flights in the style of "Gravity" in reality are impossible.  In addition to the highest (apocenter) and lower (pericenter) points of the orbit, a very important parameter is the inclination - the position of the orbit plane.  And if the change in the height of the orbit leaves the permissible amount of fuel, then the change of inclination by 45 degrees will require a change in speed greater than the satellite put into orbit.  And if we recall that the payload does not exceed 5% of the initial mass of the rocket, it becomes clear why maneuvers in orbit are very limited. <br><br>  For example, ships traveling to the ISS should start at a time calculated to a second when the station‚Äôs orbit plane passes over the cosmodrome and the inclination will be the same.  However, there is one exception - the geostationary orbit.  There, the satellites almost coincide with the orbits and a small change in speed allows you to move between their points of standing, but this happens slowly over a period of months. <br><br>  When it turned out that the rendezvous and docking in orbit are fully realizable operations, the military on both sides of the ocean came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinspecting ships that would fly to the satellites of a potential enemy, examine them and, if necessary, destroy them.  In the USSR, they studied the projects of military modifications of the Soyuz - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7_7%25D0%259A-%25D0%2592%25D0%2598">VI</a> - ‚Äúmilitary researcher‚Äù, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7-%25D0%25A0">‚ÄúR‚Äù</a> - ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù, ‚ÄúP‚Äù and ‚ÄúPPK‚Äù - interceptors.  As options for weapons considered <a href="https://warspot.ru/14539-kosmicheskiy-inspektor-voennye-varianty-korablya-soyuz">aircraft gun</a> or <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/s/soyuzppk.html">guided missiles</a> .  In the US - Apollo <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/a/apollolmcsd.html">Covert Space Denial</a> , the ‚Äúweapon‚Äù of which was a remote-controlled manipulator.  But manned combat ships did not go beyond the projects.  One of the main problems was that such ships could launch to one specific goal, and they did not have months to work in geostationary orbit. <br><br>  When the Space Shuttle was designed, the military demanded for him the possibility of a large horizontal maneuver.  This was necessary in order to launch a stealth satellite on the first orbit and land immediately.  In this case, the Soviet space monitoring systems would not have time to fix the parameters of the orbit of the shuttle, and the search area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe launched military satellite would become too large for its rapid detection.  Unfortunately, for the shuttle project this idea was not implemented in any flight, but the selected layout made the design of the orbiter more complicated and more expensive. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãunmanned satellites inspectors was proposed as early as the 1960s as part of the SAINT USA program.  The satellite was supposed to carry optical and infrared cameras to photograph the Soviet apparatus (headlights were provided for the night side of the orbit), radiation detectors (what if a Soviet satellite had a nuclear bomb?), Gravimetric detectors for determining mass, and even a set of false targets in case of shelling from an inspected satellite  The first launch was planned for 1962, but Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara closed the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/e4/cd/fae4cdvetlmbdtjolsnbbnw4mcm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Orbital (top) and Lockheed Martin MITEX satellites (center).</i>  <i>Below the upper stage of the US Naval Research Laboratory</i> <br><br>  Subsequent missions of inspectors have not tried so secret.  In 2006, two American MiTEX satellites were launched with a 30-cm telescope and a 2.4 megapixel camera, which first observed each other and the upper stage, but then came close to the broken American DSP-23 missile attack warning satellite. <br><br>  In 2009, USA-207, also known as PAN, began operating in geostationary orbit.  Supposedly, this is a satellite of electronic intelligence - it has already repeatedly changed its location in orbit, turned out to be close to other devices and could eavesdrop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s8/yc/kd/s8yckd9__6fisf3req5e8iiyrjs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Geostar-1 satellite, possibly the <a href="http://spaceflight101.com/spacecraft/gssap/">same type GSSAP</a></i> <br><br>  In 2010, a technology demonstrator of the satellite inspector was launched under the SBSS program.  On this base, four GSSAP satellites (2 in 2014 and 2 in 2016), which have since been operating in geostationary orbit, have already been launched and launched.  Since photographing foreign satellites does not violate any laws, the Pentagon no longer hides, <a href="https://www.stripes.com/air-force-launching-satellites-to-spy-on-other-satellites-1.294735">telling them</a> that the devices will be used to monitor possible threats to US satellites in geostationary orbit. <br><br>  Regular flights into orbit are made by the X-37 spaceplane with a secret payload, which may include equipment to monitor other satellites. <br><br><h2>  In his own country </h2><br>  Russian inspector satellites appeared later than American ones, but they still made quite a bit of noise.  It was easier to observe them, because they immediately got into the publicly available catalog from the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), and from the published orbit elements it was easy to determine what the apparatus was doing. <br><br>  Anyone can go to the site <a href="http://www.space-track.org/">http://www.space-track.org/</a> and download orbital parameters there in TLE format. <br><br><blockquote>  1 39765U 14028E 14143.85155363 .00000010 00000-0 00000 + 0 0 18 <br>  2 39765 082.4519 349.4209 0018110 317.1560 042.8029 12.42900902 33 <br></blockquote><br>  At first, a set of numbers may seem frightening, but in reality <a href="https://lozga.livejournal.com/85769.html">everything is simple</a> , a little familiarity with tabular processors (MS Excel, LibreOffice Calc) is enough to calculate the orbital parameters of the satellites using TLE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c60/4e9/6c8/c604e96c81fe4403b1bd22b9acb9cfc5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Change of the orbital height of the satellite ‚ÄúCosmos-2499‚Äù in 2014, own work.</i>  <i>Blue - pericenter height, red - apocenter, single distant points - data errors</i> <br><br>  First, in 2013, an object classified as space debris began to change its orbit.  Then in the Russian note about the launched satellites for the UN appeared the designation ‚ÄúCosmos-2491‚Äù. <br><br>  Russian radio amateur Dmitry Pashkov discovered a signal that is interfering with him, coming from an incomprehensible source.  The investigation showed that this is most likely the same type ‚ÄúCosmos-2499‚Äù.  Over the past years, the satellite actively maneuvered and several times approached the Briz-KM accelerating unit, which brought it and three more satellites into orbit.  In 2015, another one, supposedly the same satellite, under the Kosmos-2504 number, went to the flight.  Articles appeared in the media about the launches of ‚Äúsatellite killers‚Äù, but the then head of Roscosmos, Oleg Ostapenko, denied the deployment of weapons in space.  Yes, and the devices behaved like ordinary experimental satellites-inspectors.  They were moving closer to their upper stages, and in 2017 Cosmos-2504 passed near a wreck of a Chinese satellite destroyed in 2007 during tests of a Chinese anti-satellite weapon. <br><br>  In 2017, the Cosmos-2519, presumably different in design (it was output by another carrier rocket with other satellites), went into orbit, from which the Cosmos-2521 inspector soon separated.  And from -2521 ‚ÄúKosmos-2523‚Äù soon separated, as <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/5624853">officially announced</a> , observing its technical condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/ft/mh/jcftmhbbfqtrlugwwl-girrxego.jpeg"><br>  <i>Possible tracks of the satellite ‚ÄúBeam‚Äù by another ATHENA-FIDUS device in geostationary orbit, <a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1038150093722058752">source</a></i> <br><br>  In the same year, the media interest was aroused by the ‚ÄúLuch‚Äù military satellite, which, moving in orbit, passed close to the French military communications unit ATHENA-FIDUS.  ‚ÄúClose‚Äù, <a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1038147610073341953">according to calculations of</a> amateur astronomer Jonathan McDowell, was ~ 85 km.  This is enough to eavesdrop on the radio, but too far away for a collision, so it can be assumed that ‚ÄúRay‚Äù does the same thing as the American PAN or GSSAP.  The Russian satellite has replaced more than a dozen places in orbit. <br><br>  In 2019, the presentation of PJSC ‚ÄúSaturn‚Äù, producing batteries, was published, from which the alleged names of inspectors - ‚ÄúNivelir‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurevestnik‚Äù became known.  Also in open sources you can find information about the project ‚ÄúNumismatist‚Äù, in which, possibly, a satellite with a radar is being developed, masking its radiation as noise. <br><br>  The next Russian inspector may go into orbit at the end of 2019. <br><br><h2>  New players </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/-t/8a/oz-t8ahirthukm6mpjrlie5rrg0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Shijian-17, Image by ChinaSpaceflight.com</i> <br><br>  The Chinese satellites Chuang Xin 3 (CX-3), Shiyan 7 (SY-7) and Shijian 15 (SJ-15), officially launched to study issues of dealing with space debris, converged with each other, which may mean experiments with inspectors.  Shijian-17, officially declared as an experimental satellite, moves in geostationary orbit, approaching hundreds of kilometers with other devices, this suggests that we now have the Chinese equivalent of the American PAN or the Russian Ray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/4x/gb/1d4xgbrfzh1byvf9y21qqzuge9e.jpeg"><br>  <i>Shijian-17 approaches Chinese ChinaSat-5A, image Analytical Graphics, Inc.</i> <br><br><h2>  Why is it all </h2><br>  Inspector satellites are often accused of being able to be used to destroy other countries' vehicles, but I personally strongly doubt this.  The main reason is orbital mechanics.  Slow movement in geostationary orbit allows you to look at one satellite and eavesdrop on which stations it communicates with (deciphering modern codes is extremely difficult, but when and with which landline subscribers communicated useful information), and then slowly move on to another.  And for military purposes, the destruction of enemy vehicles requires a short reaction time.  Quickly knock down an arbitrary satellite is much more convenient with a rocket or, even better, disable the ground-based laser or microwave emitter.  In the lower orbits, the inspector is extremely limited in maneuvers and can only visit devices that are very close in terms of orbital parameters (I remind you that the Cosmos approached their upper stages).  But reconnaissance tasks for inspectors are ideally suited - a long-lived apparatus in geostationary orbit can visit various satellites for years and observe their work.  Nevertheless, the tasks of the destruction of satellites and the observation of them are mixed up regularly, for example, the analytical company CNA in its <a href="https://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/IOP-2019-U-020191-Final.pdf">recent report</a> publishes known data on inspectors in the chapter ‚Äúanti-satellite capabilities‚Äù. <br><br>  Technologies run by inspectors can also be used for peaceful purposes for vehicles that will refill or repair other satellites. <br><br>  Material prepared for the portal <a href="https://nplus1.ru/material/2019/06/28/inspectors-in-the-space">N + 1</a> , published in the author's edition. <br><br>  Small announcement: Saturday evening, July 20, exactly 50 years later, there will be a <a href="https://youtu.be/-xXwL-goHzk">stream reconstruction of</a> the Apollo 11 landing - a combination of historical data, reconstruction in the Orbiter and Anton Gromov‚Äôs comments (‚ÄúThe Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãClarity‚Äù) and your humble servant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460319/</a></p>
