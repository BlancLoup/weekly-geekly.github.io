After several years of rigorous testing, the specification should be finally ready by the second quarter of 2014.

      ‚ÄúDevelopers can use HTML5 today, and we encourage them to do it,‚Äù says Ian Jacobs, head of marketing at W3C. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The web cannot evolve at the speed of a standardization organization; it moves in the wake of web browsers and innovative developers.  No one, at least in the HTMLWG, expects the web to wait until HTML5 reaches the status of official recommendation.  In fact, developers are already <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/05/where-on-the-web-is-html5/">using HTML5 and related standards throughout the web</a> .  HTML5 is already here, even if it does not reach official status in a few more years. <br><br>  2014 may seem very far away, but it is much more encouraging than 2022, which was never an official date, but is often cited as the date that the W3C is targeting.  If HTMLWG reaches its goal, 2014 will be the year when we receive the first official update to the HTML specification since HTML 4.01 was released in 1999. <br><br>  HTML5 will give the web a few new tags for markup, for example, video and audio, a canvas element for animations and new semantic elements like header, article and aside, which give more meaning to elements in web pages.  Developers should also keep in mind that 2014 refers only to the HTML5 specification, and not to associated APIs like Geolocation or Web Workers, which are separate standards. <br><br>  With a clearer date on the horizon, HTML5 is now entering the home stretch.  There are still two years of testing ahead, but HTMLWG is already preparing to concentrate on the future - the next version of HTML. <br><br>  The WHATWG, consisting of providers of browsers that implement the HTML specification, recently announced that their version of HTML would be a ‚Äúliving standard‚Äù and that the group would no <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/01/meet-html-the-spec-formerly-known-as-html5/">longer make versions of HTML</a> (see also the guide to understand the <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/glossary/the-difference-between-the-whatwg-and-the-htmlwg/">difference between HTMLWG and WHATWG</a> ). <br><br>  Jacobs says there are no plans in the W3C to follow the WHATWG unversioned path.  ‚ÄúMany organizations need a stable version [of the HTML specification] ... they need stability in the standard and a very high level of compatibility.‚Äù In other words, moving toward a moving target like the HTML version from the WHATWG is not for everyone. <br><br>  This means that HTML6 may appear one day, but today the W3C uses the unofficial name ‚ÄúHTML.next.‚Äù <br><br>  However, although the specification may eventually expand again, Philippe Le Hegaret, head of the Interaction Domain at W3C, says that the future is in the API.  ‚ÄúNot everything should be directly in the specification itself,‚Äù says Le Hegaret.  Various APIs already cover many features often attributed to HTML5, for example, the Geolocation API, the offline storage API, and the Web Workers API. <br>  The advantage of the API is that their development can go with greater speed and some new technologies can be sharpened independently, without dependencies on some elements in the specification. <br><br>  This is good news for the future of the web, because  development speed only increases.  The web has already gone beyond the PC, it is already on your mobile devices and is starting to fill the space around you. <br><br>  Whether it‚Äôs in the specification or as a separate API, both Jacobs and Le Hegaret believe that at least some of the features of future versions of HTML can lead to a merging of the web and television.  Netflix, Sony and LG have joined the W3C and are interested in seeing more TVs directly connected to the web. <br><br>  Television on the web is likely to bring in a new set of requirements ‚Äî perhaps new tags, new APIs, and even a new platform for their implementation.  Le Hegaret says that there are already proposals for new features in HTML.next, but so far none of this is official. <br><br>  Meanwhile, let's see how HTML5 will reach Last Call status later this summer.  After that, the only thing that will separate HTML5 from the finish in 2014 is thousands of tests to make sure that HTML5 works as it should everywhere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113805/</a></p>
