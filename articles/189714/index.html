During training, students receive a monthly stipend of 15 thousand rubles.  We will offer the best graduates next spring to join our team. <br><br>  This year we have radically changed the curriculum - students will be trained in two independent areas: <b>front-end development</b> and <b>mobile application development</b> .  Each student will now be able to choose in which direction he will study.  In this case, all students will have a general course of lectures.  Even more attention will be paid to solving practical problems - first of all, we want graduates to be well prepared to work in a business environment.  The recruitment rules have also changed: instead of several qualifying rounds, we offer potential students to perform a <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">test task</a> , according to the results of which the best will be invited for an interview.  So we do not lose in the quality of selection, but we significantly accelerate it. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/66891158&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiVHSAsudUhUClqRJGfTyClerqelQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="School programmers HeadHunter: how to become a good developer" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <a name="habracut"></a><h5>  New school </h5><br>  The fourth school of programmers is two schools in one: a front-end development school and a mobile application development school.  On the <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">site</a> you can apply for one of these areas. <br><br>  As part of the front-end development course, teachers will talk about modern web technologies and their use in creating high-loaded projects, development tools, debugging, profiling, and testing client web applications.  Also, students will listen to lectures on the use of Unix-systems and best practices in development.  Separate lectures will be devoted to the Python language, which is widely used in the development of the fhndomend hh.ru. <br><br>  In the course of developing mobile applications, students will learn about the Android architecture, creating universal and effective applications, developing user interfaces on guidelines.  Mobile platforms are one of the key areas of the company's development, and this year a new direction under the strict guidance of our Android guru <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/tum0rc0re/" class="user_link">tum0rc0re</a> will be entirely devoted to the development of a mobile operating system from Google. <br><br>  We will give lectures to students of both directions on agile-methodology, quality control and testing, effective use of version control systems, we will tell about the architecture and operation of high-loaded systems.  Our designers will hold several classes and workshops on the development of user interfaces.  We will acquaint students with the workflow in the company, so that in the future those who join us will not have problems with adaptation. <br><br>  As always, we try to ensure that students can not only get new knowledge, but also successfully apply it.  If earlier they started working with real projects only in the second part of the training, now it will happen almost immediately.  While working on projects, students learn to apply their knowledge, make technological and product decisions, and interact with customers. <br><br>  A little more detailed <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">training program has been</a> published on our website. <br><br>  The change of training directions (we used to focus mainly on a developers with knowledge of Java and Python) is primarily associated with the needs of the company.  The school of programmers has long been a kind of forge for HeadHunter. <br><br>  Potential students of the school are recent students, recent university graduates, graduate students.  For them, this is an excellent chance to get what no university can currently provide - real practice and experience in developing complex and heavily loaded systems.  During the three years of the school‚Äôs existence, nine of its graduates have been invited to HeadHunter and are now working in a variety of teams: search, web services, mobile site, marketing, SRE. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0d/568/2bb/c0d5682bb9e3c0dc1ea5b3e1bd4f10a3.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Results of the 2012 set </h5><br>  Last year, more than 300 people applied for admission, every third successfully solved a test task and reached the second stage.  As a result, we invited more than 60 people to the interviews, selecting 12 of them, who became students. <br><br>  Training involves not only attending full-time classes, but also about 10‚Äì15 hours a week to perform practical tasks and work on team projects.  For failure or lack of motivation, students can be excluded.  In the 2012 recruitment, five people dropped out during the course of training and as a result of the session, but of the seven remaining, almost all were ready to immediately become company employees.  Unfortunately, we could not call everyone physically and after a hard choice, four students continued to work as full members of the HeadHunter team. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a8/143/f57/0a8143f57d0d2227582d2a8ed8f51481.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Set 2013 </h5><br>  This year, the set will last until September 15, and in early October, students will begin their studies.  Lectures are held on weekdays, the specific time and days of classes will be agreed with the incoming students.  Many of the future students are still studying at universities, so for the time of the winter session we are leaving for a short vacation.  In April-May next year, we will summarize and recruit the best students. <br><br>  Call <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">for</a> applications is <a href="http://school.hh.ru/">already open</a> .  We are waiting for you at the HeadHunter School of Programmers and wish you all good luck!  With someone from the readers of our blog, I am sure, I'll see you in the fall in the class =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189714/</a></p>
