In many ways, it is fair - indeed, not all low-cost devices can boast at least some quality.  However, at least in one aspect it is still possible to argue with this almost axiom - and we are talking about manipulators - after all, not everyone needs an expensive Razer to simply play comfortably in your favorite strategy or shooter. <br><br><img title="A4Tech X-760H" alt="<str" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7d/c3/7dc3f295e4f7363209a28e1b61bd57c4.jpg"><br><br>  Today, we‚Äôll consider quite a budget X760H mouse, one of the novelties of the well-known Korean manufacturer of various peripherals - A4Tech. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will <strong>allow</strong> myself a small reservation - I am not a <strong>Boomburum</strong> , I do not have a good camera, and therefore in this, with your permission, review, I will alternate not very good pictures and very bad pictures.

    <h2>  Part of the hard (talking about the mouse itself) </h2><br>  Let's start with the TTX: <br><br>  <strong>Type:</strong> mouse wired, optical <br>  <strong>Form:</strong> anatomical for right handed <br>  <strong>Number of buttons:</strong> seven (right, left, scroll, ‚ÄúTriple-click‚Äù button, two additional buttons on the left side) + button to change the resolution of the sensor <br>  <strong>Sensor:</strong> presets 400 \ 800 \ 1200 \ 1600 \ 2000 DPI, manual tuning in the range of 100-2000 DPI <br>  <strong>Memory:</strong> 64 KB ROM (for storing macros) <br>  <strong>Optional: the</strong> ability to change the USB polling frequency (125-1000 Hz), the AntiVibrate function for fixing the cursor when the mouse is detached from the surface, an indicator of the current sensor resolution, a set of interchangeable legs. <br><br><img title="Appearance of packaging" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0b/3b/0b3b5e69225d9cd9e1af5b48ca64ed29.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Contents of delivery:</strong> <br>  Actually a mouse <br>  Five sets of replaceable legs <br>  CD with instruction, Oscar software (macro editor) and MiceJudge <br><br>  <strong>Package dimensions:</strong> 25x20x8 cm. <br>  <strong>Weight:</strong> 247 g. <br><br>  So, unpacking the package, we first stumble upon the mouse itself.  She, as I have already noted, has an anatomical body shape, and if you are left-handed, then alas, you will at least be inconvenient to use the device, since the left side of the body has a characteristic notch for the thumb, and, in fact, are located there all function buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/58/31/583108ec03b0ebb3f000a12ca5767879.jpg"><br><br>  The manipulator itself is made of plastic - the base is solid, but matte, and the upper part is made of a soft-touch, the one that feels like rubberized.  In the hands of the device is easy, as poured - and even more or less large.  The buttons are arranged in approximately the same pattern as in the earlier X7 series manipulators - i.e.  monolithic with lid.  A scrolling was very well between them, this time made according to a combined scheme - the wheel was made of hard plastic, which in the middle was wearing a silicone ring allowing the fingers not to slide, and the Triple Click button, which the manufacturer intended to Inveterate players in shooters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/1d/021d87d094365249a983ea92211a0648.jpg"><br><br>  A little closer to the middle there is a button for switching the sensitivity modes of the optical sensor, which, in addition to the main function, indicates with light which of the modes is currently in use.  So, at 400 DPI, the button does not glow at all, at 800 - it glows bright green, at 1200 - pale green, at 1600 - red, and at 2000 it blinks red and bright green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9d/70/9d70d7d88b9c03021b8a804361fd7248.jpg"><br><br>  On the underside of the device, we find five Teflon legs, one of which is a button, and is responsible for the operation of the AntiVibrate function, which fixes the position of the cursor on the screen when the mouse is separated from the working surface.  According to the experience of using the X7 series, I will say that a full set of legs is enough for about 7-8 months - if there is, of course, a good rug - when used on a cheap plastic carpet, or, God forbid, a wooden table, the legs will come in disrepair after two weeks. <br><br>  What to do when the legs become useless?  At A4Tech, they took care of this by putting a set of spare legs in the box, which is enough for five replacements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2c/ac/2cac97d1bd35336e611329220fda5495.jpg"><br><br>  So, I think we are done with the iron part.  Let's talk about the software that comes with the manipulator. <br><br><h2>  The part is soft (talking about software) </h2><br>  The software bundled with the mouse comes on an eight centimeter CD, and includes the MiceJudge utility, and also, which is most interesting for us, the macro editor, <strong>Oscar</strong> .  It will allow us to hang complex combinations of clicks on one click, and subsequently save them to the mouse ROM, which will allow storing these macros autonomously - they will work when the mouse is connected to another machine where Oscar is not installed. <br><br>  Appearance of the editor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/99/a0/99a084a3e67a35a68affadac06ebc029.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, we can remap absolutely any mouse button for the macro, including the sensor mode toggle button. <br><br>  But the functionality of the editor is not limited to this.  It allows you to write real scripts executed by just one keystroke, which will be a real gift for MMORPG fans: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/39/88/39884b31dbd33155c593f11a5dfa0478.jpg"><br><br>  Scripts can be commented on, keystrokes of certain keyboard shortcuts can be performed, a mouse position can be assigned at which the script will start, and so on, and so on.  The number of scripts that you can use is limited only by the amount of ROM chips. <br><br>  The localization of the editor is done more or less incriminatingly - there are only minor flaws, as, for example, the inscriptions that do not always fit in their fields, which, however, practically do not interfere with the use of the editor. <br><br><h2>  Game Tests </h2><br>  After a little digging on the shelf, the following milestones grew in front of me: <br><br>  Sid Meier's Civilization IV <br>  STALKER: Clear Sky <br>  Counter-Strike 1.6 \ Source <br>  well, of course, World of Warcraft Wrath of the Lich-King <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/96/c2/96c2a400843ce2fa196e647114c8e5c7.jpg"><br><br>  The mouse showed itself in a very good way - in almost all games I even had 1200 DPI (in CS 1.6 I even switched to 800 DPI), and only in WoW, during test two raids, I sometimes wanted the 2400 DPI mode to be available.  However, even without it, it was comfortable to play, and the macro editor helped save a lot of time without finding the right button on the keyboard in the dark :) <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  So, we have quite a decent product even by gamer standards.  With its price of 14-16 euros for this mouse, aimed at an active gaming audience, there are practically no competitors - after all, gamers also know how to count money.  Personally, I gladly changed my good old X-718F, which I worked for almost three years with our X-760H, and I don‚Äôt regret it at all.  Of course, it's nice to amuse yourself with the fact that you have a <strong>Razer Viper</strong> - but on the other hand, even if you can't play, even she won't help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95850/</a></p>
