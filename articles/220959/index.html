  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I vs openSUSE</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear members of the Habrahabr community!  In this post I would like to tell about my impressions related to the attempt of my return to openSUSE. <br><br>  As it is known, the openSUSE distribution goes about the opinion that this OS is extremely user friendly, all parts of which fit well with each other.  I fully agree with part of this opinion.  As far as build quality is concerned, openSUSE, in my understanding, is close, or even stands in line with MacOSX.  No other distribution kit caused such feelings to me.  But with regard to user friendliness, here I am inclined to somewhat doubt.  Details below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  How did it all start? </h1><br>  This is my second approach to the "projectile".  The first was a few years ago, and it was as if he was successful.  Only, at that time I did not have normal access to the Internet.  Yes, and with the ATI video chip there were some problems.  So I decided to postpone further acquaintance until better times, replacing it with AgiliaLinux, I do not remember which version.  And when the best times came, I decided to try Linux Mint, at that time 13, with the Mate desktop.  So he has since caught up with me.  And he would have stood further, but yesterday before I wanted to look at something new that I could not stand, and installed openSUSE 13.1. <br><br><h1>  Installation </h1><br>  As you know, Ubuntu and his brothers / sisters can be downloaded and installed from an iso-image lying on a flash drive or on a hard drive.  Can openSUSE do the same?  I think we should try.  It does not work, it means no luck.  And I will not try.

      So, a short search on the Internet led me to <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/Commercial_linuxes/Suse/Installation/installation_from_iso_image.shtml">this page</a> .  Without thinking twice, I mounted the image of the freshly uploaded distribution, took the grub.cfg file from it and made the following corrections (in bold): <br><br><blockquote>  menuentry 'Installation' --class opensuse --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os { <br>  set gfxpayload = keep <br>  <b>loopback loop / openSUSE-13.1-DVD-x86_64.iso</b> <br>  echo 'Loading kernel ...' <br>  linuxefi <b>(loop)</b> / boot / x86_64 / loader / linux <b>install = hd: ////openSUSE-13.1-DVD-x86_64.iso</b> <br>  echo 'Loading initial ramdisk ...' <br>  initrdefi <b>(loop)</b> / boot / x86_64 / loader / initrd <br>  } </blockquote><br>  This file, along with the iso-image, I put on a USB flash drive, in the root directory, renaming it to grub-suse.cfg.  Earlier I installed grub2-efi on the same flash drive, although, as practice has shown, it is not necessary to do this if there is already a grub2 on the hard drive.  Anyway, I reboot.  The grub2 menu appears.  Pressing [Esc] I go to the command line and write the following: <br><br><blockquote>  set root = (hd1,1) <br>  insmod /path/to/grub2_modules/loopback.mod <br>  configfile /grub-suse.cfg </blockquote><br>  A menu appears.  I choose the first item and, lo and behold, the download has gone!  And not only did she go!  The installer booted up and installed the system just as well.  After some short time, the computer rebooted into a freshly installed system.  Update applet showed that the system wants to upgrade.  Well, let it be updated.  Only for the update, I gave the command sudo zypper up in the terminal.  And then the applet on the taskbar is uninformative.  After the upgrade, I connected Packman and installed the codecs, making a few discoveries for myself, how to do it correctly. <br><br><h1>  Re-introduction to the system </h1><br>  As I wrote above, this is my second approach to the ‚Äúprojectile‚Äù.  So, if not everything, then a lot, should be already familiar.  In principle, the way it is.  But not everything turned out to be as rosy as I expected.  About this in order. <br><br>  Firstly, the overall impression of KDE is depressing.  There was a time when I thought that KDE was the only full-fledged desktop, and the rest was just pathetic crafts.  But having lived first with AgiliaLinux, and then with Linux Mint, I got used to GNOME2 first, and I fell in love with Mate.  The environment is very simple, fast, not overloaded with beauties and excesses.  In its background, KDE looks like something big, too brilliant and rather heavy.  Until I installed the drivers from AMD, the fan on the processor periodically spun up and then stopped. <br><br>  The problem described above is, in general, not a problem.  This is just a matter of habit.  But the problems began to appear a little later.  Performing simple actions, such as minimizing windows or switching between them, sometimes the screen turned into something indecent.  The image looked like a dump of triangles.  Moving the mouse around the table, the whole pile of triangles was moving and nothing could be disassembled in this mash.  Only switching to the first system console with the subsequent sudo /etc/init.d/xdm restart command helped.  Faced with such a problem five times, I just turned off the visual effects.  Now there are no problems, but there is no such unusual thing either.  Anyway.  The main thing, everything works, and without a rough reset. <br><br>  Then there was a problem with IPTV.  Just does not show and that's it, although all the necessary codecs are there.  The problem lay in the firewall.  The fact is that in openSUSE it is active by default.  And, among other things, extinguishes all broadcasts.  Well, open / var / log / firewall, read the last lines, find the broadcast address in them and insert it into the list of user-defined firewall rules.  In the end, everything works. <br><br>  So far this seems to be all the problems.  And as you can see, these problems can be solved.  But they are simple not for the beginner.  Not knowing where to dig, you can quickly become disillusioned with the system.  Take at least the installation of codecs.  The network has many descriptions of the process, but in few places at least something is said about the ‚Äúchange of supplier‚Äù.  At first, the proposal to upgrade packages with a change in supplier caused me doubts and fear of breaking the system.  Later, I discovered that you can go into the zypper GUI (before that I used the command line - a habit) and select the version I need.  In this case, dependent packages will also be replaced by packages from the same supplier. <br><br>  The system is installed.  There are no problems with packages.  Video, audio and TV work.  It would seem, use and rejoice!  But, constantly gnawing some kind of strange feeling.  There is a constant desire not to wait for Mint 17, but to return the 16th right now, demolishing openSUSE.  At the same time, something stops.  Well, let's live - decide what to do next ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220959/</a></p>
