I will not put a banal question - ‚Äúwho knew about it?‚Äù, But rather put another one - how did this week go in Russia? <br><br>  Yes, almost nothing, and if we now conduct a survey on Habr√© (where a large proportion of active and savvy representatives of entrepreneurship in Russia are gathered), we will easily confirm this.  What is most interesting is that even the most well-promoted and well-promoted programs of support for the initiative young people have died out.  Seliger to November, apparently, froze.  The people were rounded up, a teleconference with big cones was made, and the questions ‚Äúwhere the projects were and what else they did, the answer is‚Äú we helped them ‚Äù. <br><br>  It is worth noting the <a href="http://www.unova.ru/event/global_innovation_tournament">international tournament "Global Innovations"</a> , addressed to the initiative youth - indeed, the project is quite interesting and attracting with its global scale.  But they say something about the event in a low voice, surely many will find out for the first time about this event, and this article will serve them as an extra PR.

      Have you noticed (or, rather, NOT noticed) that you have not heard a single loud advertisement that traps us from all corners of the Internet, and even comes from friends and colleagues - as is sometimes the case ‚Äúwhen someone needs it‚Äù? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Somehow quiet and uninteresting, gentlemen. <br><br>  I managed to accidentally get on one event from Skolkovo, which took place just as part of the Russian Entrepreneurship Week.  We didn‚Äôt even know what was going on, just leaked information that professors from MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the world leader in science and technology, would arrive.  I think many have heard, and if not - then you can easily find a lot of information about this scientific and practical center. <br><br>  In general, we really tried and were able to interview two representatives of MIT.  And got interesting and unexpected answers. <br><br>  The attitude of Americans to the level of development of Russia, to be honest, surprised us.  <i>‚ÄúYou have a very solid foundation, consisting of technologically advanced, progressive people who start their business here.‚Äù</i>  And this opinion is not just some inhabitant of America, like, ‚ÄúHi, John, how do you assess the technological potential of Russia?‚Äù We managed to talk with two experienced managers who have devoted 30 years of their career to practical work, and now they are engaged in teaching transfer your experience to the younger generation.  And both of them gave high marks to our innovative development. <br><br>  Do we believe in ourselves as in a country with high potential in entrepreneurship? <br><br>  The fact is that we don‚Äôt have any particular concerns about business as such - to make money in retail, get rich from selling raw materials, building up money for real estate, etc.  - we have quite real and vivid examples of our famous businessmen confirm this.  But in its pure form, entrepreneurship, that is, innovative development, the development of new technological solutions, and development for the future, is still slowed down.  What is the reason?  Most likely, with high risks that accompany any economic activity.  The risk in trade and the risk in startups is simply incommensurable.  And it is difficult for us to completely believe in ourselves, and not only in ourselves - but also in that country, which we, in fact, enrich. <br><br>  And the Week of entrepreneurship, the absence in Russia of large-scale training, developmental, and support events for entrepreneurs dedicated to this event is quiet and imperceptibly held in Russia (unlike the rest of the world!) Is a vivid example of this distrust and incompleteness.  We are afraid to develop all this and put on a massive footing. <br><br>  Of course, our potential is very high.  Many of our specialists work abroad, half of the Silicon Valley is occupied by Russians, our professors abroad teach foreign students.  And when we see Russian names in the composition of the directorates of large Western firms, we are not surprised, but just think what kind of Russians are in demand. <br><br>  But we are talking about specific Russian specialists who, in general, are not visible in Russia itself - these are people who are doing something not here. <br><br>  Notice that Americans emphasize the technological effectiveness of Russia itself as a country, that is, the general level of those who live and work here, and every day builds the present and the future of our state. <br><br>  I can agree that such an opinion could have been formed under the impression of a specific event held by the Skolkovo Business School.  Looking at the high level of students and invited guests, they concluded that Russia is an advanced country. <br><br>  However, I have the confidence that if they had attended any other meeting of our enterprising, initiative guys, they would have the same opinion.  And what is especially pleasant is that there are more and more such events, movements, meetings where you can listen to experienced specialists, communicate with like-minded people, find partners and start your own business on your own.  This is the best and most convincing indicator of our development today.  After all, it is these people who raise the level of our entire country as a whole. <br><br>  Read the full interview, it is given below.  Moreover, we also posted a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hpodcasts/76879/">podcast</a> - a direct recording of the interview - so do not miss the opportunity to listen to the American speech. <br><br>  Interview with <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php%3Fin_spseqno%3D25556%26co_list%3DF">Peter Kurzina</a> <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/12/01/05/46/6145964_145x217.jpg" alt="Peter Kurzina" align="left">  <b>Please tell us a little about yourself.</b> <br>  My name is Peter Kurzina, and for 32 years of my career I was engaged in training, financial rehabilitation, temporary management and crisis management - I helped companies that are in crisis from the financial and organizational side.  Most often, these were new young companies that made mistakes, and they needed help - then I would come with a team of my people and help them fix it.  However, sometimes these were old companies.  But it was always those companies that got into serious difficulties.  About 20 years ago, I received an MBA from MIT Sloan and became a teacher.  For the past 6 years I have been a senior lecturer at <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan</a> . <br><br>  <b>Are there many Russians among students, scientists, researchers at MIT?</b> <br>  I can only say about MIT Sloan - a business school at MIT.  We, of course, have Russian students.  And even two days ago, Howard and I had dinner with a Russian woman who helped us teach three years ago.  She returned to her homeland, works at Disney, and now 40 people are subordinate to her.  She is very successful.  She is an excellent and intelligent person, and a good manager. <br><br>  <b>How would you rate the work here in Skolkovo?</b> <br>  I think the efforts that, in my opinion, were originally laid by the founders of the school, are simply wonderful!  I say ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù, because in Russia there is a large deficit in professional, educated managers and entrepreneurs.  And Skolkovo was created to promote the growth of entrepreneurship in Russia, and I believe that they will succeed.  We are very pleased that we were fortunate to come here for a week and teach.  As part of this course, we teach this whole week, 9 hours a day.  In general, this course should last for a semester, but we managed to focus the attention of the students well, and they showed their best, behaved very lively, confidently, constantly asked us questions.  We divided them into teams, and each of them had to come up with a new business idea, develop a business plan, assign responsibilities, think over the product, choose a market, understand how they would sell it, and provide us with calculations and financial indicators.  And today, on Friday, each team presented its project.  It was great!  All made very worthy.  And what especially inspired us - that they really learned something.  They did a great job.  They can be even better!  Of course, they are still far from who they have to become in order to start earning serious money for their own business.  We were very pleased with what we saw. <br><br>  <b>Can you highlight a particular student, or a specific team?</b> <br>  Yes, in particular, there was a team that promoted the creation of a company for the development of wood fuel and was going to produce briquettes from woodworking waste.  They studied how to produce their product and figure out their market - and this is one of the most important elements of exactly where they will sell their goods.  The market for them was Finland and Sweden.  And they calculated all prices, built financial models.  All our students actively discussed each presentation.  And the two of us thought that this particular project was the best.  They had a very convincing business plan and financial plan.  They were the best.  But, here we presented 9 more good ideas: some good, some, maybe, medium ones ... And it was a great workout. <br><br>  <b>How do you rate the scientific and technological level of Russia?</b> <br>  I would rate it as very high.  Many Americans already realize that a very large number of people are receiving scientific, technical practice and training in this area, and they respect this trend in Russia.  Here is a great intellectual power.  And we respect intellectual power, especially at MIT. <br><br>  <b>Some Russian entrepreneurs have been here, can you single out, are there any differences between Russian and American entrepreneurs?</b> <br>  It seems to me that this generation has exactly the same entrepreneurial spirit as in America.  Usually entrepreneurs are young people who easily accept new ideas and want to do something new.  And I think that Russia can create its own business community.  Skolkovo is a great first step.  Because entrepreneurship is a process, it is not just the development, the advancement of an idea.  This is a real process.  Yes, you must have an idea, you must have customers, and you need to put together a team that will help you create a company.  You must have worked out sales figures and financial indicators.  These are the most significant elements of the process that we talked about and talk about this whole week.  And these students can understand this process in the same way as American ones.  And they clearly showed it today. <br><br>  Interview with <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php%3Fin_spseqno%3D13173">Howard Anderson</a> .  Howard was not so verbose as Peter - apparently, fatigue affected.  And failed to make a quality podcast. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/12/01/05/46/6145967_145x219.jpg" alt="Howard anderson" align="left">  <b>Please tell us a little about yourself.</b> <br>  I am the founder of the <a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/home.do">Yankee Group</a> (the <i>first independent company engaged in research and consulting work - approx.</i> ) Co-founder of <a href="http://www.battery.com/">Battery Venture Capital</a> ( <i>venture capital fund investing in technology projects - note</i> ), which invests billions of dollars in new companies, and I teacher at MIT. <br><br>  <b>Are there many Russians among students, scientists, researchers at MIT?</b> <br>  Surprisingly, they are not so few.  And they are very respected in academia for their research contributions. <br><br>  <b>Now students are more interested in science, technology?</b> <br>  At MIT, they are always interested.  Manufacturability is our name. <br><br>  <b>How do you rate the students you taught this week?</b> <br>  Students are very ambitious, they are looking for good samples, examples for themselves.  Therefore, we have gathered here many successful Russian entrepreneurs, so that students can see those who managed to realize themselves. <br><br>  <b>Can you identify a particular student that you remember?</b> <br>  Yes, Katherine Harwood, from Australia <br><br>  <b>How do you like Russian entrepreneurs, do you see the potential for Russia in them?</b> <br>  Some Russian entrepreneurs, whom we have seen here, are experts in physics, mathematics.  You have a very strong foundation consisting of tech-friendly, progressive people who start their business here.  I'm very impressed. <br><br>  What I would like to say in the end? <br>  Firstly, those who wanted to leave Russia in search of a better life - do not rush. <br>  Secondly, those who are wondering whether we have a suitable business environment - re-read this article. <br>  And, finally, it is worth starting to believe in yourself and try to make this world better on your own. <br>  And, of course, make your own conclusions, friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76877/</a></p>
