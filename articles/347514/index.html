Understand popular abbreviations in English</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The correspondence has become quick.  Online communication has won and significantly simplified written and spoken English.  People are increasingly using abbreviations, and even stickers.  And not only teenagers.  Adult serious professionals, whose time is expensive, also often respond to messages with an unintelligible set of letters.  You can treat this as you please, but you need to understand the cuts.  We have made out for you the basic and most useful letter combinations so that you can talk on an equal footing with a modern native speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/sh/sn/usshsnwuc5rrfnnskoorq5tlcqo.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Letters and numbers </h2><br>  The names of some letters in English sound like frequently used words, and this is used. <br><br>  <b>C</b> - to see <br>  <b>U</b> - you ("you") <br>  <b>Y</b> - why ("why") <br>  <b>K</b> - ok ("good") <br>  <b>R</b> - are, verb conjugation to be

      <br>
      The same applies to numbers: some numbers are consonant with completely different words. <br><br>  <b>2</b> - to (the preposition "in", "on") or too ("too" or "too") <br>  <b>4</b> - for, for <br>  <b>8</b> - ate, the verb "is" in Past Simple <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y4/br/tt/y4brttzx03igvjf2u4eoxlfuz_e.png"><br><br>  Sometimes numbers replace whole pieces of individual words. <br>  For example, <br><br>  <b>GR8</b> means Great, that is, "great" <br>  <b>2day</b> - today <br>  <b>L8R</b> - later, that is, "later." <br><br>  Thus, an abracadabra like the <b>GR8 CUL8R</b> makes sense ‚Äî this encryption only means ‚ÄúGreat, see you later.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Official abbreviations </h2><br>  Phrases and phrases that are often used in correspondence usually abbreviate to a few letters ‚Äî many use abbreviations even in relatively formal correspondence.  Here are the most common abbreviations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/e7/c3/ine7c3pycuewxnnjfh_milwxdve.gif"><br><br>  <b>FAO</b> - For the Attention Of, an indication of the addressee, if the letter is sent to the corporate address.  For example, <b>FAO Mr.</b>  <b>Petrov</b> means that the letter is intended for the manager Petrov, and not for the accountant Ivanova. <br>  <b>NDA</b> - Non-Disclosure Agreement, ‚Äúnon-disclosure agreement‚Äù.  NDAs are signed to protect trade secrets, and this is a fairly common practice. <br>  <b>RSVP</b> - R√©pondez S'il Vous Plait.  It is not even English, but French.  Literally - ‚Äúanswer, please‚Äù, but in English correspondence is used in the meaning of ‚ÄúPlease confirm your participation‚Äù.  If RSVP is at the end of the invitation, they are sure to get an answer from you. <br>  <b>NRN</b> - No Reply Necessary.  That is, ‚Äúit is not necessary to answer.‚Äù  This abbreviation can often be seen in ezines, technical messages from various online services and simply in newsletters. <br>  <b>We're meeting in Room 5A instead of 4C.</b>  <b>NRN</b> means ‚ÄúWe are going to office 5A instead of 4C.  Answer not necessarily.  This abbreviation is set so as not to litter the sender's box with answers like "I received the letter, thank you." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/wp/ta/7ywptaqjgz4aly3nkycgpmbxyqq.png"><br><br>  <b>LET</b> - Leaving Early Today.  This means "I will leave early today."  The reduction informs colleagues that in the evening you will not be in the office, even if they are not looking. <br>  <b>Can't help clean up after the presentation - LET</b> means "I can not help with cleaning after the presentation - I leave early." <br><br>  <b>FYI</b> - For Your Information, "for your information."  Example: <b>FYI: Next month, IT support will be upgrading everyone to Office 2016</b> - ‚ÄúFor your information, next month IT specialists will upgrade Office to version 2016‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>PRB</b> - Please Reply By.  That is, "Please respond by a specific date."  This postscript can often be seen in letters where some hot questions or events related to a specific date are discussed. <br>  Example: <b>I need you to know this weekend.</b>  <b>PRB Thursday 8/24</b> - ‚ÄúI need to know who can help with a charity event this weekend.  Please reply by Thursday, August 24th. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>HTH</b> - Hope That Helps - "I hope this helps."  A polite response to someone's gratitude for the help or postscript, in which you offer someone a solution to the problem.  Especially often it is used by employees of the IT department.  <b>Try turning it off and then on again.</b>  <b>HTH</b> means "Try turning it off and on again."  Hope this helps. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>WFH</b> - Working From Home.  This means "Today I work from home."  For example, <br>  <b>WFH today.</b>  <b>Our meeting in 24B will take place on Wednesday instead</b> - ‚ÄúToday I work from home.  Our meeting at the 24V office is postponed on Wednesday. " <br><br>  <b>TLTR</b> - Too Long To Read.  "Too long to read" (or, as expressed at the beginning of the zero, "niasilil").  This means that your letter is too verbose and the respondent asks to highlight the essence in a brief extract. <br>  For example, <b>TLTR.</b>  <b>I don‚Äôt need to know how to do this.</b>  - ‚ÄúToo long to read.  I would be happy to help, but now I don‚Äôt have time to go into your message. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Y / N</b> - Yes or No?  That is, "Yes or no?".  So the sender makes it clear that he does not need additional explanations and is waiting for a simple answer. <br>  <b>Is it a new internet restriction affecting your work?</b>  <b>Y / N</b> - ‚ÄúDid the new restrictions on the use of the Internet affect your work?  Answer yes or no. <br><br>  <b>OOO</b> - Out Of Office, "I am not in the office." <br>  <b>I am OOO until Friday, August 25. Please contact Simmons.</b>  ‚ÄúI won't be in the office until Friday, August 25th.  All questions to Mark Simmons. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>LMK</b> - Let Me Know, "Let Me Know."  Usually put at the end of the letter and invites the recipient to share their opinions on the described case or keep you up to date.  <b>LMK if you will be at the meeting tomorrow</b> means "Let me know if you come to the meeting tomorrow." <br><br>  <b>IMHO</b> - In My Humble Opinion, "in my humble opinion, I think."  A polite way to express your point of view without claiming to be expert.  For example, I <b>MHO, Den's calculations are wrong</b> - ‚ÄúIn my opinion, Dan <b>‚Äôs calculations are wrong</b> .‚Äù <br><br>  <b>BTW</b> - By The Way, "by the way, by the way."  A clever transition from one topic to another or a standard beginning for a letter after, when you already sent a message and suddenly remembered that you forgot to discuss some important point. <br>  <b>BTW, I forgot to mention it.</b>  ‚ÄúBy the way, I forgot to mention that I am serving lunch to anyone who will help me with this business.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>IDK</b> - I don't know, "I don't know."  A relatively informal abbreviation, most often used in correspondence in instant messengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/g-/4s/w0g-4scdhdxleissrmdsijioy-w.gif"><br><br>  <b>FWIW</b> - For What It's Worth, "whatever it is."  Another polite way to express your opinion and not look like a know-it-all or show that you do not intend to enter into an argument.  For example, <b>FWIW he did a great job</b> - "Anyway, he did an excellent job." <br><br>  <b>TYT</b> - Take Your Time.  "Do not hurry".  Use when waiting for feedback, but not urgently.  For example, <b>Tell me what you think about this idea.</b>  <b>TYT</b> - ‚ÄúTell me how you like this idea.  Do not rush". <br><br><h2>  Informal correspondence </h2><br>  <b>BYOB / BYO</b> - Bring Your Own Booze, Bring Your Own Bottle (‚ÄúBring a drink with you.‚Äù So they indicate in the invitation to the party if the owner provides only snacks, but expects guests to come with their alcohol.) <br>  <b>IOU</b> - I Owe You ("I owe you") <br>  <b>THX</b> - Thanks <br>  <b>PLS</b> - Please <br>  <b>OMG</b> - Oh My God, Oh My Goodness or Oh My Gosh, in general, "Oh my God!" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j4/b7/xy/j4b7xygq-tdfnzccnetxb2fey-u.gif"><br><br>  <b>AFAIK</b> - As Far As I Know ("as far as I know") <br>  <b>F2F / FTF</b> - Face To Face ("face to face") <br>  <b>NP</b> - No Problem ("not a problem") <br>  <b>ATM</b> - At The Moment ("at the moment").  Outside the Internet - an ATM (automatic teller machine). <br><br><h2>  Chat and messengers </h2><br>  <b>BRB</b> - Be Right Back (‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù, ‚ÄúI will be away for a while‚Äù).  A useful abbreviation if you need to move away from the computer for a minute, and you are chatting with someone. <br>  <b>B2W</b> - Back To Work (back to work) <br>  <b>BBL</b> - Be Back Later (‚Äúcome back later‚Äù) <br>  <b>TTYL</b> - Talk To You Later ("talk later") <br>  <b>BFF</b> - Best Friend Forever <br>  <b>EOD</b> - End Of Debate (‚Äúend of discussion‚Äù, ‚Äústop arguing‚Äù). <br>  <b>HAND</b> - Have a nice day <br>  <b>LMAO</b> - Laughing My Ass Out (literally ‚Äúi'm laughing ass myself‚Äù, in Russia in such situations they say ‚ÄúI laugh to colic‚Äù, in a decent version of the translation) <br>  <b>LOL</b> - Laughing Out Loud (‚Äúlaughed loudly,‚Äù the same meaning as the previous cuts, but much more decent) <br>  <b>TBH</b> - To Be Honest (honestly) <br>  <b>NVM</b> - Never Mind ("drove, it does not matter, never mind") <br><br><h2>  Important nuance </h2><br> <code>        (LED = ¬´--¬ª).   (ASAP),      .</code> <br> <br>  Alas, abbreviations do not take place in schools, but this is a very important part of a living language, and if you are not familiar with abbreviations, it will not be easy to communicate with native speakers.  Abbreviations in English more than in Russian - much more than we could fit into this text.  In addition, the language is constantly changing, so you can not take and learn abbreviations or slang once and for all.  New ones will appear, you need to follow this: watch the latest TV shows in the original, communicate with the media, surround yourself with the modern English language environment. <br><br>  If you need such an environment - sign up for a free introductory lesson at the online school <a href="http://skyeng.ru/go/habra-3"><b>Skyeng</b></a> .
