  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google changes name to Topeka</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Early last month, Mayor Topeka, Kansas, hit the whole world, saying that his city was changing its name to Google.  We wondered how best to thank for this gesture.  Today we are pleased to announce that on April 1, at 1AM (Central Daylight Saving Time), Google officially changes its name to Topeka. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f6/6dc/a64/8f66dca64fa7916f0d962d0a9a1d033e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was not easy for us to make this decision, because we have a fairly <a href="">high brand value</a> associated with the old name.  But the more we walked around the (former) municipal state of Topeka, the more we felt a relationship with this beautiful city on the edge of the Great Plains. <br>  In fact, Google‚Äôs Mayor <s>Topeka</s> expressed it best: ‚ÄúDo not be fooled.  Even Google admits that all roads lead to Kansas, not just those paved with yellow bricks. ‚Äù <br>  Over 150 years, its good location at the confluence of the Kansas and Oregon rivers made the city, formerly known as Topeka, the starting point for the new world in the West, as well as 150 months ago the company formerly known as Google became one of the starting points for the new Internet.  When in 1858 a crucial bridge across the Kansas River was destroyed by flood, it was quickly restored - and we also got used to releasing the second (2.0) version after the tumultuous reviews of our beta releases.  And since the city‚Äôs nickname is ‚ÄúTop City,‚Äù and the word ‚Äútopeka‚Äù itself comes from the term used by the Kansa and Ioway tribes, meaning ‚Äúgood place to dig potatoes", we would like to think that our site is one of the best places on the Internet for obtaining information. <br>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the former Topeka gained substantial political importance by embellishing the nation of Margaret Hill McCarter, the first woman to apply for a national political convention (1920, Republicans), Charles Curtis, the only Indian former vice-president (from 1929 to 1933 under Herbert Hoover), Curry Nation, leader of the old sobriety movement (and owner of one of the most famous axes in US history), and, most importantly, Alfred von Neumann, perhaps the most influential figure of a whole generation of Americans.  We cannot help but be happy by adding our own chapter to this rich story. <br>  Such a dramatic change will not pass without consequences, perhaps even with some violations.  Here are some questions that we hope each member of <a href="http://google.com/">the Topeka community</a> will have in mind when we start one of the most important transitions in our company's history: <br><ul><li>  Correspondence for our headquarters and offices should be addressed to Topeka Inc., but can be addressed as usual </li><li>  Google employees, previously known as ‚ÄúGooglers‚Äù, should now be called ‚ÄúTopekers‚Äù or ‚ÄúTopekans‚Äù, depending on the result of the meeting of the board of directors at this time.  Nevertheless, the conclusion is clear: we are no longer Google </li><li>  Our new product names will require some getting used to.  For example, we have to guarantee the users of Topeka News and Topeka Maps that these services will continue to provide news and local information from all over the globe.  Topeka Talk, likewise, will be an instant messaging service, and not, say, a folk show in the Midwest. </li><li>  We don‚Äôt know what to say to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/we-get-letters-3.html">Oliver‚Äôs Google Kai‚Äôs</a> parents, except that if you are interested in our opinion, Oliver Topeka Kai is a great name for their boy. </li><li>  As our lawyers remind us, the names of our products can achieve such popularity that they lose their trademark status (for example, cellophane, lightning, trampolines, etc.).  So we hope that each of you will do everything possible to remember the rules for using our new name: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01d/892/dfa/01d892dfada5c9dce0d98ae0a6f830af.png"><br><ul><li>  + Before the date with a stranger, I searched for him with Topeka </li><li>  + -Before a date with a stranger, I Topeka'ed (topkeked?) It </li><li>  -Before a date with a stranger I topeka'd him </li><li>  --Before a date with a stranger, I Topeka'ed him in Alta Vista </li></ul><br></li></ul><br>  Finally, we want to make it clear that this initiative is an April Fool's joke, which has nothing to do with the municipalities participating in our pilot project to provide high-speed access to the network, in which Google, Kansas is just one of many communities in the world. <br><br>  Minus - please write in the comments that do not like. <br></div>
