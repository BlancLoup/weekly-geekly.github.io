  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Worthless excuses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Excuses are a lie with which we reassure ourselves, trying to avoid a collision with the unpleasant truth.  But as soon as we fall for them, it is impossible to get rid of them.  Instead of solving a pressing problem, we hide the symptoms.  One of the most important steps in the development of personality is to eradicate the excuses and to meet the truth behind them face to face. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some common excuses, and what lies behind them: <br><br>  <strong>"I don't have time for this."</strong> <br><br>  When you make such a statement, deep down you know that it is not.  The truth is that the result of this action is not important enough for you.  "I do not have time to do exercises in the morning."  "I do not have time for a long relationship."  "I do not have time to open a business."  Of course, you have time.  As much time as any other person.  And so many people do the same.  The difference is that they set priorities in a different way.  You are not a victim of circumstances.  If you do not like the circumstances - change them.

      It‚Äôs funny to watch people claiming they don‚Äôt have time to find him to watch TV.  If you do not have time to charge, the more it is not on the TV.  In fact, this means that charging is simply not important enough for these people.  It is easier to blame everything on the lack of time than to admit to yourself the lack of will. <br><br>  <strong>"I do not know how to do that".</strong> <br><br>  The most worthless excuse of all.  "I do not know how to make a website."  "I do not know how to write a book."  "I do not know how to find a better job."  Are you able to learn?  Or, barely learning to crawl, you stopped and complained that you did not know how to walk?  For the phrase "I do not know" is covered, "I do not want to learn."  In other words, you need to admit that you are a bummer. <br><br>  <strong>"I have no money for this."</strong> <br><br>  If you want to buy something, the lack of money does not justify giving up the goal.  You can always make money or find a way to get what you want at a discount.  Behind the phrase ‚ÄúI have no money‚Äù is covered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really need this‚Äù.  Making money is a matter of time.  As we already know, lack of time or ignorance of the method is not a reason to fold our hands.  If you want to buy an expensive item, you can easily give this wish the highest priority, and then find the time to find out how to make money on this item. <br><br>  Don't let excuses rule you.  If one of the statements mentioned is about you, immediately replace it with the truth behind it.  At first, the truth may not like it.  But when you recognize reluctance, laziness or lack of motivation - only then you will have the opportunity for further growth.  For example, having realized the unwillingness to learn, you can decide, despite the difficulties, that you could do it in case of urgent need. <br><br>  It is convenient for our vanity to blame external factors for our failures that do not depend on us: lack of time, information or resources.  Justifying ourselves, we can never solve problems.  Need to find the reasons.  You can only improve what is influenced. <br><br>  We cannot influence the course of time, but are fully capable of prioritizing the affairs that our time takes.  We can not control the information, but we can choose what to learn and how much effort to make it.  We can not control the money, but we can take more effective measures to increase income.  By controlling what is in our power, we can attract as much time, information and resources as we need. <br><br>  Do not let pride stand in the way of development.  Find the courage to face the truth.  This is the only way to change anything.  By recognizing laziness, lack of motivation or skills, you can start working on it.  But to influence directly on time, information or money is impossible.  Get rid of the excuses, face the bitter truth and take the first step in the direction you want to go. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/">Self-development for smart people</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31328/</a></p>
