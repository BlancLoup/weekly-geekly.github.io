Surely everyone saw a child's game in the park in which you are given a hammer and you have to hit the heads of bunnies or moles that come out of 6-7 holes.  To be honest, I would not even notice it, that the sound that this unit makes makes it involuntarily turn in its direction.  Some incomprehensible Chinese phrases and also very loud.  Just at this time, a fresh idea was needed for a mobile game.  The task was to come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa game for the iPhone with minimal effort, because  According to the plan, the next game was to be published in the Apple AppStore this year. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After returning home, I began to look for similar games in the AppStore and found a bunch of games with the same plot, however, they were all the same person, i.e.  everywhere it was necessary to beat on the heads with a hammer.  It was here that it dawned on me - "Why beat, if you can suck."  A simple tap on the screen is not very interesting, but moving your hand up is much more fun.  Then everything went on the thumb, came up with the name of the game "Space Tube", the characters decided on the location (the whole plot takes place on Mars), quickly made up the formulas and now the game is already in the store.  During the development came a lot of different ideas for the introduction of new characters, new functionality, survival mode, etc.  Most of it was implemented in the current version, the rest was left for the update.  By the way, at the end of the game itself, they just wrote ‚ÄúTo be continued ...‚Äù.  All development took 2 months, managed even earlier for 2 weeks from the planned date, taking into account the iPad version of the game, which was not planned for the first launch.

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis game, of course, is not new, but I think its implementation is very original.  It is well known that, in general, all the original ideas of games have long been implemented, and to come up with something completely new is not quite a commercial approach, such ideas come very rarely and there is no need to count on them.  For example, let's take the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game according to the tower defense genre.  The Apple AppStore has a lot of games with this genre, and many sell very well, judging by the rating.  One of the first such games is ‚ÄúField Runners‚Äù, the last update of which was made on February 11, 2011 (10 months ago).  One of the latest games of this genre, Jelly Defense, which, as far as I remember about a week, was not only in the TOP of the Russian upstate, but also in almost all other markets.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is of course a very important element of success, but its implementation is no less important, especially for Apple devices, in which I think the most spoiled audience. <br><br>  So, where to look for ideas?  The answer is simple - by combining, analyzing and, of course, implementing, preferably non-standard. <br><br>  By the way who cares what kind of mercy we ask.  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/space-tube/id478831801%3Fmt%3D8">Link to the AppStore.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134094/</a></p>
