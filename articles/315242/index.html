However, the latest developments of enthusiasts and intruders may cast doubt on this fact.  Hacking technologies are developing almost faster than security methods. <br><br>  Recently, the media <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdl.acm.org%252Fcitation.cfm%253Fid%253D2978397">learned</a> about the emergence of new technology hacking personal data of users through a mobile phone connected to a Wi-Fi network. <br><br>  In the popular <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/11/10/when-csi-meets-public-wifi-inferring-your-mobile-phone-password-via-wifi-signals/">blog</a> of SpringSource's former technical director (creator of Spring's Java framework) Adrian Colyer, The Morning Paper has a description of this technology.  It works when you enter the PIN code by contact. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  To track down the PIN code set, attackers analyze the WiFi signal.  In order for a device to be hacked, a hacker must create a remote wireless access point, choosing as his victim, for example, a cafe visitor sitting at a table with a smartphone in his hands. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      It turned out that the movement of the user's fingers while dialing a PIN code affects the WiFi signal of the device. <br><br>  Therefore, by changing the signal, an attacker can trace how the numbers change.  The position of the user's fingers on the gadget when entering the password creates vibrations of the wireless signal - micro-interference.  Specially created algorithms analyze information and select several PIN-code options.  During testing of this method, the system offered three possible password options, one of which turned out to be correct.  As a result, it was possible to make a purchase using the Alipay payment system. <br><br>  Thus, almost any smartphone owner who is not afraid to connect to open and free wireless networks can become a victim of hackers.  Such an access point, organized by the attacker, can become a ‚Äúfree cheese mousetrap‚Äù.  Using this technique, you can take possession of passwords from social networks and payment services. <br><br>  Analysis of changes in the WiFi signal to identify the entered PIN-code is carried out using special software. <br><br>  The attack was called WindTalker ("Speaker with the wind") - by analogy with the Navajo crypto-Indians. <br><br>  Unlike other methods of hacking devices, for example, determining passwords by the sound of keystrokes or tracking a user's movement (or computer mouse), this method does not require direct access to the gadget and connection to it via the existing Wi-Fi channels in this zone.  Moreover, it turns out that the technology also works for HTTPS connections, or, more correctly, to bypass them. <br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br>  In addition to finger movements, the technology takes into account another parameter - how the user holds the smartphone.  In aggregate, on the basis of these two parameters, a unique Channel State Information (CSI) pattern is formed in the time series.  Only then can the analysis algorithms be applied. <br><br>  CSI is part of the Wi-Fi protocol and provides basic information about the state of a Wi-Fi signal. <br><blockquote>  Previously, CSI was used to recognize larger movements and made it possible to determine the presence of a person in a room and capture gestures.  Based on this technology, the WiHear system was developed that can recognize mouth movements, that is, read lips.  WiKey brought WiHear to a completely different level - now with its help you can not only read lips, but also determine the movements of fingers, hands and keys. </blockquote>  The attacker collects the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the CSI signal Wi-Fi using a malicious access point.  To do this, send the corresponding request via the ICMP protocol and receive a set of packets in response.  For analysis, it is necessary to ensure a transfer rate of at least 800 packets per second. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bb/c92/19d/0bbc9219db96e4db8878e1cc293df2cc.jpg" alt="image" width="450"></div><br>  After analyzing the received signal, an attacker can identify the characters typed by the user with an accuracy of up to 68.3%.  Accuracy varies by smartphone model, but it can be improved by training the algorithm and obtaining more data. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75b/78a/de4/75b78ade4c464ac7d5b499b03e6a3035.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The more attempts the PIN user makes, the higher the recognition accuracy will be, as the array of CSI values ‚Äã‚Äãin this case grows. <br><br>  "Thus, the most vulnerable are applications that allow users to try to enter a password multiple times," sums up Adrian Collier. <br><br><h3>  Predecessors </h3><br>  The calculation of personal data from signals was repeatedly used by various intruders in the creation or development of existing technologies.  For example, a smart watch recognized the password with an accuracy of 65%, tracking the movement of the user's hand over the keyboard.  With an accuracy of 94%, the microphone of the smartphone, by the sound, determined the sequence of keystrokes on the gadget and so on. <br><br>  As for the Wi-Fi technology, it was previously considered for use in order to spy on people.  One of the developments suggested using Wi-Fi to find people in neighboring rooms, tracking both actions and movements, up to obtaining an image comparable to the video of the cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8df/891/be6/8df891be6d123060dd57bf024bea451a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Previously, the WiKey attack was introduced, allowing CSI to intercept keystrokes on a physical keyboard. <br><br>  According to the researchers, WiHear is not only provides a vast field of attack, but also provides great opportunities for human-computer interaction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315242/</a></p>
