Nearly 200 comments on this post gave us a rather interesting feedback, so we decided to post announcements of our new developments even a little earlier.  Meet blockchenizer: Blockchain as a Service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/124/575/4a3124575778444d95abc45d4e2e74bc.png"><br><br>  Arguing about the benefits of the blockchain in different areas of life, we sometimes forget that, in addition to development problems, the implementation problem is even more important.  Therefore, we decided to simplify as much as possible access to blockchain technologies so that, in principle, a blockchain wallet is not required. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We offer the possibility of storing NVS records up to 29 KB in the Blockchenizer, which is basically enough for almost any statistical, registration information as it is or for larger files in the form of a hash sum.

      Development, like our previous projects, is based on the <a href="http://emercoin.com/">Emercoin</a> blockchain. <br><br>  Blockchenizer (the site is still in development) provides an API for blockchain operations with the option of paying with fiat money. <br><br><h2>  Who needs it? </h2><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "Blockchenizer" did not come out of my head, but responds to the demand, which is formed from various sources. <br><br><h4>  State and private organizations </h4><br>  The demand for the blockchain is growing all over the world, and Russia is no exception - for us, for example, we are drowning Sberbank and German Gref personally.  But at the same time, almost all organizations that are already directly eager to implement the blockchain cannot and do not want to deal with cryptocurrencies as such. <br><br>  It is ridiculous: the guys from Emercoin for the presentation of their technologies in public and private institutions had to redo their wallets, removing from there any mention of koin, calling them instead "blockchain editor".  Why do companies, having just caught fire with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe blockchain, shy away from cryptocurrency like the plague?  There is also a national specificity: most recently in Russia there was a serious talk about the inclusion of cryptocurrency in the Criminal Code.  Now the question is no longer so acute, but the sediment remains.  There are also more pressing problems that any Zinaida Mikhailovna, a chief accountant with 40 years of experience, will visually explain to you: what is the legal status of cryptocurrency?  How to put it on balance - as a foreign currency or an asset? <br><br>  Even if you assume that you took the risk and, not being afraid of questions from regulators, officially included cryptocurrency in the balance of your organization, new risks arise: if you control the cryptocurrency, you can always lose it - for example, the employee made a mistake in the translation.  It is technically impossible to cancel a blockchain transaction (for this we both love and fear). <br><br>  "Blockchenizer" removes all these problems entirely: the organization does not need to start the wallet itself and introduce the concept of cryptocurrency into its own accounting.  Calculations with us are fiatnym money, and we already provide a service. <br><br><h4>  Private Blockenizer </h4><br>  Private users will also benefit from the "Blockchenizer".  Two weeks ago, we talked about another of our development, " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hashflare/blog/284228/">Avtorayzere</a> ."  The bottom line is that we solve the problems of authorization security on the Internet and the loss of user data radically, changing the authorization method from username / password to EmcSSL certificates. <br><br>  However, in order to register the certificate now, you need to put the wallet on the computer and somewhere to take the emmercoins to pay for the transaction.  It is clear that this is not very convenient - the further, the less people like to put new software on their computers, getting used to doing everything online. <br><br>  On the other hand, with ‚ÄúBlockchenizer‚Äù, the user can simply go to the site, register his certificate in the blockchain without having to download and install the wallet and some additional fees - at least 3-5 of the first downloads we will provide to users for free.  In the future, we will integrate the <a href="https://emcssl.org/">EmcSSL certificate issuance service</a> with the blockchenizer, so sending the certificate to the blockchain will be done in just one click. <br><br><h4>  Blockchenizer for our needs </h4><br>  The Blockchenizer idea develops with the rest of our projects on Emercoin - Blockchenizer will help simplify the implementation of Avtoblokchein, integrate with Avtoraiser, etc., together with our other developments, forming a powerful blockchain-ecosystem that will be simultaneously both powerful and functional, and with the lowest entry threshold compared to any other blockchain technology for ordinary users and organizations. <br><br>  It is possible that 2017 will be a turning point for the blockchain, when, as a technology, it will finally confirm its intrinsic value - regardless of any cryptocurrency, including even Bitcoin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400515/</a></p>
