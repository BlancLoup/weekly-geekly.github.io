The driver, of course, was the sale of content to mobile phones that began 8 years ago on legal grounds.  It is easier to reach a mobile user, he has a convenient payment terminal in the form of a phone, and he does not hold this money in his hands, so there is no psychological barrier in the form of ‚ÄúI give physical papers for some intangible garbage‚Äù.  As the Internet penetrated into the cities and the vastness of our vast online stores began to appear, trying to do business - mp3.ru, muz.ru, fidel.ru, soundkey.ru and beyond.  Then the heavyweights were involved in the game - Scartel, MTS, Megafon, Yandex.  But things are going all shaky or shaky.  Why?  But because ... <br><br>  First, if you suddenly, suddenly, decide to open a store that will legally sell legal content, you will have to overcome a lot of obstacles.  As you know, the rights to a musical work consist of the rights to the phonogram, the performance, the text and their association in the form of a work.  In this case, the rights may be in different companies.  Accordingly, in order to obtain 100% of the copyright for a work, you may have to enter into agreements with a dozen of labels and copyright societies in which they are located.  But here you are waiting for a complete back-up regarding the systematization by the labels themselves of their rights - the lack of synchronization servers, structured information, and manual reporting will be your terrible nightmare. <br><br>  Ok, that didn't scare you and you are still determined and decided to sign up for this deal.  Here you are waited "secondly" in the form of an annual fee, minimal guarantee fee or, according to simple rules, a guarantee.  If suddenly you want to make users enjoyable and give them access to the entire library of four majors, you will have to lay as many as 700kbaksov a year in your business plan (if you still think this is a business) and pour burning tears every day, wondering how to convince users that legal content is better than illegal content.

      But there is money, and you are just an <s>upright</s> patron of the arts and decided to work for the future.  Ok, comes "third."  As you know, album sales are infinitely small in these of your networks.  Housewives buy what they play on MTV, and these are tracks.  And here you suddenly find out that the ‚Äúpatent troll‚Äù is not only profitable entertainment in distant States, but also a completely legal business of small studios that clear the rights to Russia to hits, pulling them out of the albums that are published ‚Äúover the hill‚Äù on the large.  We'll have to be friends with them, too, because the business is legal. <br><br>  (I leave out of brackets the details of how to sign contracts with big labels for half a year; how to legally place the album cover on the site you need to get either information about its author, or the label‚Äôs consent to anonymous use of the cover; how labels are trying to squeeze out of you more money, bringing hits from the main directories to other companies and offering to pay them twice, how difficult it is to get a Russian-made Russian catalog and how sometimes you have to buy and manually digitize a CD, and move on to the main  ) <br><br>  Recently, quite often there is a discussion about what the right holders are bad, what they are trying to sue users, VKontakte and the whole world, so that the music does not lay out illegally.  In these discussions, such arguments as ‚ÄúI do not steal, I copy‚Äù often arise, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not in itunes, and I would buy it of course,‚Äù ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm just half a penny, and then I‚Äôll delete it immediately.‚Äù  Nikitin, who was suddenly agitated and decided to make an exemplary spanking, was completely showered with shit, and ‚ÄúAnd what is he?  I would have sued VKontakte and it would be like always, and the contact is big, if the penalty will pay. ‚Äù <br><br>  I understand labels.  They invest in artists, in the purchase of rights to represent foreign catalogs in Russia.  This is a lot of money and they need to somehow beat.  Sales of physical carriers fall dramatically for the third year.  Physics is dead.  And with it, the old business model died.  But the new model will not be born, because everyone has different views on life.  Sasha Blinov, in my opinion the most progressive manager among krupnyak, develops a local directory, directs his artists to record singles that will be commercially successful on any platform (physics, selling on the Internet, selling on mobile networks in the form of realtons and ringbectons).  Nikitin promotes his artists in runet and spends a lot of resources so that the Warner catalog can be distributed as convenient for the user (the best prices, plenty of concessions under the terms of distribution).  You can write a lot about Sonya and Yuniversal representations, but foul language is not welcome) Universal owns the best catalog of all and realizing it requires a lot, and Sony is firmly sewn into the Procrustean bed of guidelines and KPI by revenue. <br><br>  I never understand labels that declare that they are doing everything to enable users to buy content on the Internet.  In practice, ‚Äúdo everything‚Äù goes to a partner who pays labels, pays for platforms, pays for hosting, servers, traffic, advertising. <br><br>  Sometimes sharks of the music business have the feeling that something is going wrong (usually after summing up the financial year or quarter) and start combining to fight torrents.ru, courts with Mail.ru, VKontakte and other large resources that host UGC content.  Their goal is to explain to users that despite the anarchy that reigns in runet, if we act within the framework of the legal field, everyone can sit down for something that is already in the order of things. <br><br>  All the arguments mentioned above and taken from this resource are untenable for several reasons.  As practical - our legislation prosecutes for illegal copying and bringing to the public, as well as for theft;  and moral character - if you look at any topic about how someone stole the product of his intellectual work or, even worse, forced him to work out his salary, then immediately begins howling and wailing about the injustice of the world.  Blogging about startups on blogs that their idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa regular social network is stolen from them, 51% of a non-existent company will be taken away and shaky at the thought that 10kbax should be taken not from an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù, but in an unsecured loan bank, they argue that what kind of copywriting is copywriting is an oxymoron, just like Nikitin with his logic. <br><br>  Those who say that they would buy music if it were available - ay, where are you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113733/</a></p>
