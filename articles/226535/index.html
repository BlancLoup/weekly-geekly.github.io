  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to honestly work as a freelancer in Belarus?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Because with the <a href="http://tech.onliner.by/2014/06/16/paypal-3">advent of PayPal in Belarus</a> , there was another way to become attached to the international market and withdraw money earned from freelancing.  Of course, there is a desire to work honestly and pay taxes in order to avoid all sorts of difficulties with the law.  However, after a brief discussion with familiar IT people, I realized that none of them has the full picture.  Someone says that it is necessary to conclude acts for each fact of work and almost send checks by mail to customers from abroad, someone says that this is called ‚Äúincome from abroad‚Äù and this is generally a separate compote, someone it just scored and displays everything in the black. <br><br>  I myself, unfortunately, also do not have sufficient aggregate knowledge of the topic, so I suggest that the Belarusian community should share knowledge with each other.  I think this problem is not close to me alone, so please express any of your freelance experience in the comments (the more specifics, the better). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For starters, I will give my example with oDesk: <br>  I sometimes work not so long ago through oDesk.  On oDesk account already accumulated a certain amount of money, which I would like to get on your hands.  oDesk offers several ways that are available, including in Belarus: <br><ul><li>  <b>Payoneer:</b> order a card directly on the site payoneer, confirm your identity with a passport scan and wait for the card to come by mail.  The card costs $ 30 per year + commission for each withdrawal in the area of ‚Äã‚Äã$ 3.  Money can be withdrawn at any ATM with Maestro card support. </li><li>  <b>PayPal:</b> from day to day it will be possible to tie a card of any Belarusian bank to PayPal and drive finances back and forth (as I understand it).  One-time withdrawals with PayPal in Lithuania, for example, cost around $ 3, so one can hope that there will be a similar price in Belarus.  Total: card per year from $ 0 per year + withdrawal fee of ~ $ 3.  Money can be withdrawn at any ATM where your card is serviced. </li></ul>

      The above applies only directly to the issue of withdrawal of funds, however, there is still such an aspect as taxes.  I would like to work legally, so in any case it is necessary to open the PI and follow some of the taxation schemes.  Most stick to two: <br><ul><li>  <b>Simplified:</b> you pay 5% of revenue. </li><li>  <b>Single tax:</b> at the moment you pay around 600k BYR per month regardless of income. </li></ul><br>  And here begins the circus: they all say in one voice that it will not work to do everything clean, that the tax <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/84417/">will</a> still <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/84417/">find</a> something to complain about.  We share a successful, and even better unsuccessful experience, gentlemen! <br><br>  PS: if the text describes some aspect is wrong, well in the comments, I will correct. <br>  PPS: I understand that the format of Habra is not quite, but the maximum target audience is here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226535/</a></p>
