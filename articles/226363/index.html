  <section class="page js-page"><h1>No cards. We pay bracelets, jackets, sounds and phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In an effort to replace "plastic" in non-cash payments with modern gadgets (which can be not only a convenient means of payment, but also an original accessory), tireless developers decided to develop a "contactless theme", and enterprising bankers to gain additional profit and achieve customer loyalty through the use of innovative products in a unique form factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4b/2b1/9d4/b4b2b19d46834107c5ea3c455969532f.jpg" alt="rubber bracelets"><br><br>  For example, the British Barclays Bank decided to produce <a href="http://credit-card.ru/news/barclaycard-bpay.php">rubber non-contact bracelets</a> for active people.  Such a device can pay for purchases of up to ¬£ 20 across the UK - just hold the wrist to a special reader at the checkout.  The convenience of calculations using contactless gadgets has already been appreciated by listeners to music festivals, where similar bPay rubber devices have been tested over the past 2 years.  According to the developers, bracelets can be paid in shops, bars, public transport, and they will be issued to customers of any British financial institutions for free.  You can manage your account and analyze expenses on the Internet through your account, to which a bank card is attached (you can leave it at home and enjoy outdoor activities). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another interesting novelty in the field of contactless payments has become a <a href="http://credit-card.ru/news/heritage-suit-paywave.php">men's suit from the Australian Heritage Bank</a> .  A chip (tied to an account in the Heritage Bank) is sewn into the sleeve of the jacket, with which you can pay for purchases using Visa payWave technology in any TSP that accepts payment for contactless cards (just touch the special terminal with the sleeve).  The novelty in Japan is made of the finest merino wool.  As part of the pilot project, 12 wallets were sewn and sold throughout the country.  The bank notes that such a suit can be safely dry-cleaned, but it is better to block the bill for a while.

      And the owners of the new Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphones have the opportunity to log in and <a href="http://credit-card.ru/news/paypal-samsung-fingerprint.php">pay with fingerprints</a> in any stores that accept PayPal.  Thanks to a secure biometric solution, the user is no longer required to remember passwords, registration data for making a purchase.  To enter the account, the client only needs to put his finger on the phone screen.  In Russia (along with 25 other states) a new convenient way to pay for purchases was introduced this spring. <br><br>  In turn, residents of Zimbabwe will soon be able to <a href="http://credit-card.ru/news/zimbabwe-edgepay.php">pay with the help of sounds made by smartphones</a> .  A new mobile payment service based on NearBytes technology was developed by local Edgetech Solutions.  For each transaction, the Edgepay application generates a one-time unique code that is transmitted via sound signals to the merchant's payment terminal (the device must be equipped with a speaker and microphone).  The developers claim that the new method of payment confirmation is safe, since the possibility of unauthorized access to the transmitted data is completely excluded. <br><br>  But the <a href="http://credit-card.ru/news/mobile-service-cashfon.php">CashFon mobile service</a> offers to make payments without using a card at all, directly from a bank account.  Owners of smartphones who opened a card account in any financial institution can use the unique application.  In this case, all expenditure transactions are carried out online without the use of complex processes.  Payment for an order in the online store is made on the phone screen using a unique invoice.  Thus, a convenient, safe and easy start-up can become for the client a ‚Äúpersonal ATM in your pocket.‚Äù <br><br>  In fact, every week in the world there are new original developments that allow making non-cash transactions truly comfortable for users, as well as guaranteeing additional protection of secret data of bank card holders.
