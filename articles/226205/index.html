Going through things in his mind and devices that would be worth making smart, so to speak, the author decided to choose an unexpected option - a cup. <br><br>  At first it was just a concept with incomprehensible deadlines for the implementation of the idea.  The prototype of the smart cup, which got its own name - Vessyl, is already ready.  A cup can do a lot - to determine the name of a drink that is poured into Vessyl, the composition of the drink, its caloric content and some other parameters.  The device synchronizes the data with the smartphone, transferring all the available information.

      As mentioned above, this group is not just a design idea that will never be implemented.  There is already a prototype that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/12/5801106/vessyl-smart-cup-that-knows-exactly-what-youre-drinking">fell into the hands</a> of a Theverge edition journalist. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to him, Vessyl really works, and not bad.  For an hour, the journalist had the opportunity to try the possibilities of a smart club.  During this hour, he poured into a mug, alternately, about 12 different drinks, including coffee and all sorts of juices. <br><br>  Vessyl defined drinks from Crush, Vitamin Water XXX, drink from Tropicana, Gatorade Cool Blue, plain water and some other liquids. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lu4ukHmXKFU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQIQPW9juL_q8FSannH_ucQbTIrA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Among other things, this cup can show the difference between strong and weak coffee, as well as determine the level of sugar, proteins, fats, caffeine, plus the calorie content of the drink.  It does not matter if it is a famous drink or you made it yourself at home. <br><br>  If you use Vessyl constantly throughout the day, the cup shows how often you drink, predicting the level of hydration of the wearer's organism.  Many of us consume less fluid than needed, so Vessyl can monitor water consumption by teaching a person to take the right amount of fluid a day.  Of course, there are some difficulties here - after all, you will not be in a cafe / bar (a cup, by the way, ‚Äúknows‚Äù and determines many sorts of beer) to use your mug.  Nevertheless, the idea is quite interesting. <br><br>  Another interesting fact is that the sensor in the cup, according to the developer, is non-contact. <br><br><img alt="Vessyl_app" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62b/97b/ebd/62b97bebdb3c05624a1b7121df2ba4e5.png"><br><br>  As mentioned above, the cup transmits all data to a smartphone, in a special application.  It, among other functions, defines the data on hydration according to its own (proprietary) method.  When calculating the used weight, height of the owner, as well as some other parameters that are entered when you start working with the application. <br><br><img alt="Vessyl_app_timeline" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/187/a70/82e/187a7082e9a08b18fe7d1db8e3a8b66b.png"><br><br>  Now the developer is in talks with manufacturers of various kinds of fitness trackers, in order to increase the capabilities of Vessyl. <br><br>  The author <a href="https://www.myvessyl.com/orders/new">collects pre-orders</a> for his creation, at a price of $ 99.  Shipment orders are scheduled for early 2015.  After the completion of the first period, the possibility of direct orders will be opened, but already at a price of $ 199. <br><br>  In general, the device is interesting, although it can be perceived as a high-tech toy.  Nevertheless, Vessyl can help with fluid intake, monitor the calorie content of drinks and help control impulses to drink something harmful :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226205/</a></p>
