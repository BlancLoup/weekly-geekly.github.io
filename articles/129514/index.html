He is now in closed beta. <br>  I will not write long introductions, but immediately get down to business. <br><br>  Tactoom is a web service built on three basic <b>‚ÄúI Want‚Äù</b> : <br><br>  1. I want to share with people who are interested in the same as me. <br>  2. I want to learn from others only what I find interesting. <br>  3. I want people who are "close in spirit" to find me, and I - them.

      * Auto-invite only works from this page * <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>All functions and service logic are aimed at providing these ‚ÄúI want‚Äù (UserStories).</b> <br><br>  In details: <br><br><h3>  1. I want to share with people who are interested in the same as me. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4de/121/682/4de121682944a70cf40d206a319412ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each person in Tactoom has a list of their interests (for example, the interests of <a href="http://tactoom.com/octave/interests">Yura Bogdanov</a> ).  When you publish a post in Tactoom and mark it with, for example, the tags ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, this means that you relate this post to the interests of specific people.  That is, those of your readers who have the interests of ‚ÄúComputer‚Äù and ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù see this entry. <br>  In Tactoom, you do not share with all your readers, but with people who are obviously interested in your particular post. <br><br><h3>  2. I want to learn from others only what I find interesting. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0eb/7c1/68a/0eb7c168a3db369dcbc0049709641e34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, you have a list of your interests.  It depends on how your news feed looks like. <br>  For example, if there are no ‚Äúdogs‚Äù among your interests, then you will not see a photo session of the classmates' dogs in your news feed, even if you read it.  If she posts something within your common interests, then you see it in your feed. <br>  I.e.  In the news you see posts from the people you read, if they attributed these posts to the interests that you have.  Of course, if you read spammers or just happy owners of IQ &lt;60, you will see spam.  In another case, spamming or posts like ‚ÄúI had a delicious breakfast, here's a photo of my sandwiches‚Äù is unlikely. <br><br><h3>  3. I want people who are "close in spirit" to find me, and I - them. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/f3b/682/31ef3b68238f684f086326dd1fd00177.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Where can you find people close to you in spirit?  In social networks, at work, on vacation ...? <br>  I am sure that there are many people in the world with whom I have something to talk about and with whom it would be interesting to communicate.  But for some reason I cannot find them on such a large and social Internet.  And I know that they can not find me. <br>  In Tactoom, pointing out your interests, which represent you as a person, you find people close in spirit, those who have many interests coincide with yours. <br>  Tactoom is designed to simply find people who value the same thing as you. <br><br>  <b>So.</b> <br>  In Tactoom, you are yourself, if you like, multifaceted and real.  You are not an employee of such a company, not a classmate, not a colleague, not an old friend or a man from the conference.  In Tactoom you are you.  And when you want to share with others, you will not have a question like ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt need it‚Äù.  Here, communication and communication are built on the principle of "for those who need to." <br><br>  <b>Functions that will be launched soon:</b> <br>  - Notifications online <br>  - Color settings (theme selection) for your blog. <br>  - Upload photo / audio <br>  - Bookmarklet <br><br>  <b>Some features that will be launched later:</b> <br>  - Private messages <br>  - Improved recommendation algorithms <br>  - Real time, fewer page reloads <br>  - Auto-mode algorithms based on the collective mind <br>  - RESTful API <br>  - Issuing to Atom / RSS news feeds, blogs and communities <br><br>  Also publish here the answers to two frequently asked and significant questions from our users: <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> ‚ÄúWhat prevents a person from posting a post about‚Äú Cats ‚Äù, and in tags indicate the interest‚Äú Programming ‚Äù, so that all his readers who are interested in programming have‚Äú Cats ‚Äùin the news feed, they are not at all interesting. <br>  <b>Answer:</b> First.  If you mark ‚Äúkittens‚Äù in your posts about ‚Äúprogramming,‚Äù will you have readers? <br>  The second.  Soon there will be a function that allows all users in two clicks to mark a post as inadequate.  The mechanism is simple: roughly speaking, if 100 people have marked "inadequate" from the user - a ban for him on some tags.  Systematic "inadequate" - aufviderzen from Tactoom. <br>  Third.  Later algorithms based on collective intelligence will be launched.  Radically mismatched in essence and meaning, the tags will be sent "into the fog." <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> ‚ÄúWhat prevents a person from repost to change the post tags for some nonsense?‚Äù <br>  <b>Answer:</b> By changing the tags (interests) of a post, the user changes them only on his page and only for his readers. <br><br>  Registration in the service only by invites and will be so long. <br><br>  P.S.  By the way, the project was personally written by Yura Bogdanov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/octave/" class="user_link">octave</a> ) on NodeJS, mongodb / redis for 8 months, about which a technical article is coming up in the near future. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><br>  Guys, invites from Habr will be available tomorrow.  Further free registration will be closed and available only by invite from other users.  Thank you for the good feedback, for the constructive criticism too. <br>  The next two days we will be focused on starting and setting up servers for fast Tactoom work.  The next two weeks are to launch the features described in the article.  First of all: the choice of profile design (blog), upload photos / audio, online event notifications.  Further more. <br>  There are two of us (Jura and I), we are not a corporation and we do everything ourselves, so we cannot physically respond to comments, forgive me. <br>  Now our task is to fully implement a useful, convenient, high-quality and fast service.  Really for interesting people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129514/</a></p>
