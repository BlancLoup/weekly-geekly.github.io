  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competition for young developers of AR-applications Epson Moverio BT-300</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0b4/290/dff/0b4290dffc724aef8aae58d24a1bee60.jpg"><br><br><p>  A few years ago (even <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/246063/">at Habr√©</a> ), we held a contest for Android developers for our Epson Moverio BT-200 Augmented Reality video glasses.  According to the results of the competition, the winners were announced, awarded prizes and wrote a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/246063/">post</a> about it.  Applications of participants and winners, by the way, still flaunt on our Application Market <a href="https://moverio.epson.com/jsp/pc/pc_application_list.jsp">Moverio Apps Market</a> . </p><br><p>  But in March of this year, third-generation augmented reality video <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-300/">glasses</a> ‚Äî the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-300/">Epson Moverio BT-300</a> ‚Äî went on sale. </p><br><p>  In view of the fact that not every second has such glasses, we will tell about them in more detail, and then proceed smoothly to the competition itself, which we hold together with the Kvantorium children's technology parks. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Repetition - the mother of learning </h2><br><p>  First, we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/217939/">suggest reading the previous post about Epson BT-200</a> . </p><br><p>  In short, we have the following: </p><br><p>  Transparent displays are embedded in the glasses, on these displays all the necessary information is displayed, which ‚Äúsuperimposes‚Äù on the surrounding space, complementing it.  Hence the term - ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù.  The home screen looks like the standard screen of any Android device.  A variety of sensors help to work with augmented reality: GPS, compass, gyroscope, accelerometer, camera.  The Epson BT-300 comes with a touch control panel that connects to the glasses with a wire. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/31a/2c4/b63/31a2c4b63e374507b120c9899f36056d.jpg"><br><br><p>  Anticipating questions - why you need a remote on the wire in the wireless age, we recall (since the days of the previous model BT-200): the control panel is also a power supply unit that allows you to work up to 6 hours without recharging.  Equipping the power supply with the glasses themselves is impractical: the glasses will become much harder, and having a powerful lithium battery right in front of your temple is not the most reasonable solution. </p><br><p>  We‚Äôll finish this brief educational program and return to our points, or rather to the third generation of Moverio points and what has changed in them since the days of Epson BT-200. </p><br><p>  The new model has received a number of significant improvements.  Moverio BT-300 became <strong>the lightest transparent binocular video</strong> glasses <strong>in the world (only 69 grams)</strong> , and most importantly - they got new displays! </p><br><p>  Now they have LCD matrices based on Epson Si-OLED technology.  I think, with the principle of the work of OLED, you are already familiar with us and guess how great it is for the contrast, because  only those fragments of the image that are supplied with voltage and signal are highlighted.  Accordingly, the highlighted background, which the 200th model had when displaying a completely black background, simply disappeared. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/92f/ce6/143/92fce6143b344511b807b717e9a6831c.jpg">

    <p>  For the rest of the characteristics points have also undergone a number of changes: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/51c/f98/476/51cf98476dec450a94509e3ca1004abb.png"><br><br><h2>  And now about the competition </h2><br><p>  Together with the <a href="http://roskvantorium.ru/">Kvantorium technology parks,</a> Epson announces an all-Russian competition for young developers of augmented reality applications. </p><br><p>  What kind of "Kvantorium" such? </p><br><p>  Surely, many of you remember footage from films about American schools, where children participate in science fairs and present their ideas and projects.  In Russia, a similar format is provided by the Kvantorium children's technology parks.  They are equipped with high-tech equipment and act as an additional education of children in the field of engineering sciences.  They are preparing, so to speak, personnel reserve for high-tech and high-tech industries of the Russian economy! </p><br><p>  But back to the competition.  Only paired teams can participate: students of technical universities, as well as all students in the Kvantorium technology parks. </p><br><p>  That is, if you are a university student and want to participate - you can write to the address below, colleagues from Kvantorium will acquaint you with young talents, and together with them you can start creating your promising, perhaps even commercially interesting project. </p><br><p>  And although there are only three themes for applications, the field for fantasy is quite extensive: </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>Urbanism</strong> <br>  Solutions for the urban environment: visualization of projected buildings and complexes, navigation on the ground, UAV control, etc.) <br></li><li>  <strong>Edutainment</strong> <br>  Applications for teaching science, conducting experiments, developing skills, etc. </li><li>  <strong>Science Art</strong> <br>  Applications for museums: ‚Äúrevitalization‚Äù of exhibits, excursions, quests, restoration of lost monuments of art, etc.) </li></ul><br><p>  At the end of the competition, winners in each category will receive valuable prizes from Epson: <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-300/">Epson Moverio BT-300</a> video <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-300/">glasses</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-home-3d/">Epson projectors</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-home-3d/">Epson</a> <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/factory/">Print Factory series printers</a> . </p><br><p>  We will show the best works to enterprises and business representatives. It is possible that some of them will be interested in the commercial implementation of your project. </p><br><p>  <strong>Dates of the competition:</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>August - September 2017</strong> - registration of participants </li><li>  <strong>September 2017 - March 2018</strong> - acceptance of work </li><li>  <strong>April 2018 - announcement of the winners</strong> , award ceremony </li></ul><br><h2>  How to participate </h2><br><p>  <a href="http://epson.ru/specials/moverio-ar-contest/">Fill</a> out the participant form. </p><br><p>  On <a href="https://moverio.epson.com/jsp/pc/pc_application_detail.jsp%3Fpack%3Dcom.DeltaCygniLabs.Pointr%26page%3D0%26key%3D%26cat%3D000%26tab%3Dnew%26device%3D2">the Epson Moverio developer site</a> you will find all the technical information, manuals, you can download the SDK, etc. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373781/</a></p>
