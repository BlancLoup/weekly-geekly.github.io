And since we are techies, we love mechanics, history and computer games, the choice fell on the subject of weapons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The application turned out to be geeky because of our perfectionism and love of details, but at the same time it is interesting for ordinary people judging by the number of users (more than 800 thousand in 4 months).

Yes, and working in slowing down to 1/500 of a second.  Yes.  Can.  I confirm.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5a1/a98/c82/5a1a98c82d0d4c30a63ed5a22f6ea6b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In a few days, Victory Day will come.  For 4 months we have been preparing for it a new release, which will be the result of the work of the whole community.  As the saying goes: ‚ÄúWe built, built and built!‚Äù <br>  The long-awaited release is already on google play.  What awaits you in it? <br><br>  First, of course, the long-awaited by many, Kalashnikov assault rifle!  Now someone will remember youth, and someone will get a new experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ccd/c3c/f1a/ccdc3cf1adc74173b9228004d65cd9d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The game has ceased to be faceless.  Mentors appeared in it.  These are real people in real colorized photographs by great artist Olga Shirnina.  We have been looking for a really suitable style for the game for a very long time.  Realism and our history is everything.  We will continue to develop the theme of creating a plot for the game.  Without a plot and historical context, weapon simulators look boring for most people.  Limit yourself to links to Wikipedia for sure.  It is very sad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cda/e79/634/cdae79634c934cc280c1dbc728a3c44a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By a vote of users added more than 20 achievements in the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8e1/af9/387/8e1af93876e34ded9f8bee54f808e898.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A full-fledged competition mode appeared both in the global ranking and for each weapon.  The first champions among beta testers have already appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f36/1a8/0c2/f361a80c24444f3a9abd4156e23d722a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to play it was interesting, we introduced the opportunity to receive not only global achievements, but also specific levels of a Class Expert for an excellent game.  For each level obtained, Glory Points are given, with which you can discover new weapons and interesting facts about them.  We, frankly, worried whether it would be interesting to users.  But closed beta testing has shown that people find it interesting and add meaning to the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/858/625/54d/85862554db26448c92f753754b32b51e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We collected 53 really interesting facts about weapons, many of which surprised even ourselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/be5/3d3/6d7/be53d36d7aec4e47b34539b7b3e68651.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By popular demand, users have finally added TTX for all weapons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/69f/7f2/f7a/69f7f2f7ae31401a98c25a0f69519225.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A target appeared in the game!  Consider this as the first step towards the appearance of Tyr, which craves for 70% of our users.  While this is done more for decorative purposes, but bullets fall on it and holes are formed.  You can try.  In the next version, we plan to make an accurate algorithm for calculating the trajectories and visualize the trajectory of the bullet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/988/ae5/a9c/988ae5a9c5d94a688c0b7e9767564570.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The product was created in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.museum-arms.ru/">Tula Museum of Weapons</a> with the support of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation.  Accordingly, thanks to access to experts and unique exhibits, all models are made very accurately.  For example.  You can see the very first serial model of the Maxim machine gun.  Along the way, we communicated with a large number of weapon fans (restorers, collectors, etc.) and they confirmed that everything was done with ‚Äúbestial seriousness‚Äù. <br><br>  Thanks to a close and truly friendly cooperation with the museum, exclusive exhibits appeared in the annex.  For example, you can shoot from the hunting carbine of Catherine II. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/385/284/deb/385284debba74be5bff87ee4cc021062.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During the rental period, it was possible to gather around the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa community of almost 10 thousand people at the moment, who offered a lot of interesting ideas that have been implemented and will be implemented.  We are ready to try any ideas at all that do not contradict the mission of the product.  Anyone can vote for their favorite weapon and there is already a kind of TOP weapon :) While the Soviet and German weapons of the Great Patriotic War are confidently leading.  And people from almost all countries of the world vote for it and they do not see the general voting figures. <br><br>  Thanks to the game community and its activists!  We certainly wouldn't have done a great project alone.  There will be a lot more interesting further.  For example, we are currently working on VR mechanics for the game. <br><br>  We hope you enjoy the game.  Happy Victory Day to all!  Hooray! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403735/</a></p>
