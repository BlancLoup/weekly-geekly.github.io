  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skype requires network neutrality in cellular networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The principle of <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/3085.html">network neutrality</a> is a fundamental principle on the Internet, which implies equality of all traffic, regardless of its source.  Thus, the VoIP traffic of one operator cannot be transmitted with a higher priority than the VoIP traffic of another operator, even if this operator owns communication channels.  Now the ‚Äútechnological lobby‚Äù in the US parliament (including Google and Microsoft) is trying to promote a law that legally enshrines the principle of network neutrality for Internet providers.  Apparently, the adoption of such a law in 2007 is almost a matter of business, and this problem caused <a href="http://www.savetheinternet.com/">too much resonance in the society</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, some people believe that the principle of network neutrality is applicable not only for cable Internet providers, but also for cellular operators.  To some extent this is logical, because the time is not far off when the majority of users will access the Internet via wireless communication from mobile devices. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that on February 15, 2007, Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, published the conclusion ( <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/wireless_net_neutrality">basic theses</a> , <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/files/WorkingPaper17_WirelessNetNeutrality_Wu.pdf">full text in PDF</a> ) about the need to observe the principle of network neutrality in cellular networks.  The logic is quite clear: with the proliferation of 3G and 4G standards, these networks are increasingly used for broadband Internet access, that is, they can be an ideal platform for VoIP telephony.  Naturally, in such a situation there is a conflict of interest.  Users need access to the Internet, and the operator is beneficial to block this traffic by selling similar services at exorbitant prices. <br><br>  Of course, now this problem does not exist yet, but it will definitely arise with the proliferation of mobile VoIP devices.  Analyzing the current state of affairs in cellular networks (operators strictly control users, severely limiting their ability to use the network), Professor Wu predicts an inevitable conflict.  Accordingly, he proposes to accept in advance the basic requirements for adhering to the principle of network neutrality.

      A week after Professor Wu, Skype <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1036_3-6161569.html">filed a petition of</a> similar content ( <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/files/Skype%2520Wireless%2520Device%2520Petition%25202-20-07.pdf">PDF</a> ) to the FCC commission, which distributes frequencies, issues licenses and other regulations on the activities of mobile operators.  This petition almost verbatim cites some of the key points that Prof. Wu voiced, as well as the requirement to apply the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carterphone_decision">Carterfone 1968 FCC decision</a> on the cellular operator, according to which the telephone operator AT &amp; T had to guarantee connection to the telephone network of any devices if they do not damage the network. <br><br>  From a theoretical point of view, the requirements of Skype and the theses of Professor Tim Wu seem quite logical, but they are completely absurd for experts familiar with the technical realities of the functioning of cellular networks.  Cellular networks operate at the limit of their capacity, so that the priority of voice traffic is an absolutely inevitable thing.  If you do not restrict low-speed GPRS, then even in this case, all base stations will instantly fall.  It is obvious that in 3G networks the load on the network will be even greater.  In addition, operators have spent billions of dollars on the construction of base stations, and so far have not returned investments.  In Europe, operators paid huge sums for 3G licenses, so they still have to return this money for many years.  Do they violate the rights of consumers to return investments?  Most likely, they have a difficult question, although everything depends on the position of legislators here.  They will adopt the law on a single number - and operators will keep the number when a user moves from one operator to another, although earlier operators did not even think to ensure the user this right, violating it everywhere.  The same situation is with other consumer rights, including those provided by the principle of network neutrality. <br><br>  Probably, the petition of Tim Wu and Skype can be considered as a little news from the future, when this problem becomes really urgent.  Of course, now operators are technically unable to ensure the principle of network neutrality, even if they are forced to do so.  However, in the future everything will change.  According <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20070223/131712.shtml">to experts</a> , everything goes to the fact that with the cessation of growth in the subscriber base, mobile operators will voluntarily turn into Internet providers and begin to observe this principle.  Competition will make them do it.  In this direction, the market develops in a natural way, so now it is not necessary to put pressure on "opsoz". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5075/</a></p>
