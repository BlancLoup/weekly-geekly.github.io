  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coming, leaving and rock and roll. How to choose the right time tracking system in 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working time accounting systems have already gained popularity in the West.  Gradually, innovations are also entering our post-Soviet space.  But what it is and what it is eaten with, many will only have to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/706/106/adf7061060e641e3980d4d0b3d1b96c3.jpg"><br><br>  I, a consultant to improve employee performance, asked the client to help him choose a time tracking system as one of the most effective methods for unlocking the potential of employees. <br>  Googling for different key phrases, I have a list of 7 companies.  By the way, such solutions are divided into 2 main types: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1) Programs that record the actions of a person on a computer.  Their main task is to issue a report: which employee on which site spent how much time - that is, tracking computer activity. <br><br>  2) Decisions fixing the arrival and departure of workers, especially popular in the sphere of trade, public catering and where the activity also goes beyond the execution of tasks on a computer.  As a result, the list of those who are late and those who left work prematurely is put on the table of the chief, which is convenient for calculating salaries, bonuses or applying penalties that are so popular in the news. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The customer perfectly saw that his employees are working, and not go about their business.  But he got tired of coming to the half-empty office every morning and fearing that as soon as he left for a business meeting at the end of the day, half of the workers would immediately run home.  Familiar? <br><br>  In addition, in the company, only part of the work is done on a computer, therefore, a system that takes into account the arrival and departure of employees is more suitable for us.  With this in mind, my list has been reduced to 3 systems. <br>  Next, we identified for ourselves the main criteria for the selection of a suitable time-tracking system, and among them were: <br><br>  1) <b>Easy installation</b> .  Having read about the "great tortures of a sysadmin" in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234611/">"Installing a time-tracking system: try it for yourself"</a> , we dreamed of installing it with a few clicks, because we did not have a regular sysadmin and had to do it on our own. <br><br>  2) <b>Operational technical support service</b> .  You always want to deal with professionals, and not so that you quickly get your goods, and then waved a pen pretty: "Good luck, understand now how you want."  Therefore, the speed of answers to our questions from the SRT has become one of the priorities. <br><br>  3) <b>Cloudiness</b> .  The client did not want to spend money on expensive equipment, its installation, maintenance, and in case of a breakdown repair.  The desire is quite rational, given that the technologies are developing dynamically and every six months to buy a new system is somehow not comme il faut.  Do you agree? <br><br>  4) In addition, he was interested in the so-called <b>‚Äúlong tail‚Äù</b> in marketing, that is, the additional features of the time attendance system.  ‚ÄúAnd the longer the tail, the better,‚Äù he remarked to me. <br>  Thus began the natural selection of 3 systems with a common set of the following functions: <br>  - the ability to customize the schedule; <br>  - set hospital, time off, business trips, holidays; <br>  - uploading information about the hours worked in time sheets or reports, which is convenient for the personnel department and accounting. <br>  - obtaining schedules in the context of the entire company, department or employees. <br><br>  We could only compare the companies with each other and find out the peculiarities of their offer: <br>  1) I liked the forethought and flexibility of <a href="http://www.biotime.ru/">the Biotime system</a> : <br>  - automatically determines the time spent by an employee in certain areas: in the office, in the dining room, etc .; <br>  - allows you to modify 14 reports for individual customer needs; <br>  - full compatibility with the software "1C: Salary and Personnel 7.7" and "Salary and Personnel Management 8.1 and 8.2" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ac/6b6/807/3ac6b6807f15498db409790814bf304a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But in addition to working on the basis of a biometric terminal, the system was still tied to the server, and our priority list included mobility, which is provided by cloudiness. <br><br>  2) <a href="http://yaware.ru/">‚ÄúYaware‚Äù</a> impressed us with the possibility of video surveillance, which is especially convenient in the presence of regional offices.  I liked that thanks to cloud technologies, you can simply create an account and use the service without worrying about maintenance.  They noted the compatibility of Yaware Dashboard with many systems, for example: CRM / ERP - systems, accounting, electronic store, task management.  But we simply did not need these functions, so we decided not to overpay for them. <br><br>  3) <a href="http://workly.io/">‚ÄúBiotrack‚Äù</a> - 2 advantages attracted the attention of my client: an intuitive interface and a free 2-week period sufficient to study the system.  "Long tail" offers a number of useful features, for example: <br><br>  - storing documents in the system and providing access to them, for example, an accountant Kate; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fd/2ca/801/8fd2ca801cce475d9a9b3efb69e689a2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  - accounting of additional funds issued to the driver Sergey for the purchase of a bouquet of flowers in honor of the birthday of the VIP client; <br><br>  - asset accounting.  By issuing Petya a corporate tablet, you can make a corresponding entry in the system.  Then you will not have to conduct a survey "who has the tablet?" With this option, we are already doing an inventory in the company. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c48/d26/bb9/c48d26bb95b64ceb81122ccefbd95eec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As was the case with Yaware, we are satisfied that this is a cloud solution with round-the-clock access anywhere in the world. <br><br>  But even more we were attracted by the free Timepad application for Android and IOS with 3 types of identification: NFC cards, QR code and PIN code.  That is, we saved on the purchase of expensive equipment, its installation and maintenance.  And in business they say: ‚ÄúThe saved ruble is the earned ruble‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/0c7/ffb/2640c7ffbaa14e019b3627376b593570.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, we just downloaded the application on the tablet and immediately started using it.  Yes, a couple of questions appeared in the process, but the support service quickly clarified what was where to press and why.  Therefore, from this point of view, we are also satisfied. <br><br>  If you are interested, you can connect a biometric terminal to the ‚ÄúBiotrack‚Äù system, but at this stage one <a href="http://workly.io/ru/timepad">TimePad application</a> is enough for us.  And then wait and see. <br>  It was such a fascinating search for a suitable time tracking system. <br>  And what would you choose? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294594/</a></p>
