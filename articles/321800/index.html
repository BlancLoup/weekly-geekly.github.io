  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Omnichannel: facilitating communication to customers and employees</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Omnicanality is quite a popular topic among marketers today.  Especially in such industries as retail, banking sector and others.  Immediately it should be noted that this concept may mean slightly different things, for example, when we are talking about trade or communication, but the essence is the same.  Since <a href="http://infobip.com/ru">our company is</a> known in the market as a provider of communication solutions and platforms, in this publication we will talk about <i>omnichannel communications</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a94/858/0bc/a948580bcdeb4f2a87c795d09474e2f5.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If we discard all complex formulations, then it is very simple to explain the essence of omnichannel communications - the user contacts you in the way he or she is comfortable.  And this is the main advantage of omnicanality for marketing.  It increases consumer loyalty to the brand and, at the same time, makes rational use of the communication budget.

      Another advantage of omnicanality is the ability to manage all communication channels with the client from a single center.  This increases the efficiency of communication, it is better to see the big picture - the overall picture of the processes taking place. <br><br><h3>  I want and communicate </h3><br>  The use of omnichannel communications is an opportunity to abandon the constant search for the most effective tool for communications in each individual case.  This decision is made by a customized platform with a fully integrated communications system.  All of them, of course, should be controlled from a single interface.  Omnichannel marketing is built in accordance with the requirements of users and, at the same time, is based on technological innovations.  Thus, previously separated channels we can use as a single tool, respectively, the three main principles of omnichannelity - full coverage, one structure and interconnectivity. <br><br>  Let's see how it looks in practice.  We all remember that the focus is on the client, and marketing communications are based on his requirements, and it is he who sets the pace of communication.  For example, a request for technical support can be received via SMS (it was more convenient for the client), a more detailed dialogue takes place through the exchange of e-mails describing the details, then the phone number is used for confirmation, and finally the user switches back to SMS to participate in polls.  The client must understand that in any case the company will find a way to contact him, not ‚Äúlose‚Äù him and the history of communication, will not shift the search for the most convenient channel to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0f/134/af3/e0f134af33464878891ea64b006d5116.jpg"><br>  <i>In a customer-oriented company, each client is at least a prince</i> <br><br>  Among the companies that actively use omnichannel solutions are such giants as Disney and Bank of America.  Disney <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/omni-channel-user-experience-examples">uses</a> absolutely every possible channel of communication to make the customer experience easy, convenient, and enjoyable.  First, the company's website works equally well on any device, whether it be a desktop computer or a mobile phone.  Secondly, a special application allows you to plan a trip to an amusement park to the smallest detail, right up to the choice of places where you stop for lunch.  Thirdly, in the process of rest in Disneyland, the company will tell you where the attractions you are interested in and how long you will have to stand in line with them. <br><br>  As for Bank of America, this financial institution is known for introducing a variety of services so that their client can conduct the maximum number of transactions remotely without worrying about account security. <br><br><h3>  No time to wait </h3><br>  For a company that chooses the use of modern omnichannel solutions, the issue of communication with the client is greatly simplified.  A single interface ensures the availability of all channels and ease of use, as well as the reaction rate.  We live in an era of radical transformations of communication as such.  Social networks have made possible online communication with companies and brands - now their representatives are always ready to answer customer questions, and smart phones allow such communication to take place anytime and anywhere.  Need to respond accordingly. <br><br>  Now consumers are not just waiting for the reaction of companies and brands - <b>they are waiting for it immediately.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/feb/7f2/045/feb7f204553f47f8a451c6d4f7d58edc.jpg"><br>  <i>In a customer-oriented company, there are always prompt answers to all questions.</i> <br><br>  According to a <a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/community/blogs/visebility/how-life-online-is-changing-consumer-expectations">study</a> conducted by the Lithium Center, more than 40% of consumers expect to receive an answer to their question within an hour.  And this expectation forces companies to continuously monitor and respond to requests coming through all channels.  Users not only want to be answered quickly - they want to communicate in the most convenient way for them. <br><br>  Omnichannel is not limited to messaging and offers a full cycle of marketing services for the consumer.  Take, for example, the travel industry.  According to Facebook and Deloitte, most users use multiple devices (and often simultaneously) when planning a trip.  To support communication with the resort, airline, hotel, the user contacts the brand each time, and this means that communication must be not only uninterrupted, but also supported by all devices and platforms.  The Disney example above shows that such communication has already become standard. <br><br><h3>  Communication channels </h3><br>  Let's look at the main channels of communication with the client.  Note that each of them is important separately, but only together they provide an effective level of communication. <br><br>  The first channel from which the client most often begins to get acquainted with your company is the <b>site</b> .  Everyone already knows that it should be convenient, simple, and informative.  This channel is the basis for other communication channels.  It forms the first impression of the brand and shows the client, both existing and potential, how to communicate with your company.  The site, information on which is not enough or it is outdated, and the form of communication is missing or does not work - is useless. <br><br>  The second, equally important channel is <b>e-mail</b> .  With the development of technology, e-mail has lost its importance as a way of fast communication.  It, unlike the messengers, is often checked only a few times a day, but it is read thoughtfully and in a comfortable environment.  Newsletter is a way to remind about a brand, to tell about news, to announce discounts and events.  At the same time, emails also have weaknesses - due to the huge amount of spam, emails are often lost, and therefore critical information is not to be trusted. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/">statistics</a> , in 2015, more than 200 billion letters were sent daily in the world, and on average, each office worker received more than 120 of them.  But to letters from customers should be treated carefully.  The times when phone calls were prioritized and processed faster were long gone.  Now it is often more convenient for people to describe a question in a letter and wait for an answer than to communicate by voice. <br><br>  <b>Voice calls</b> are the most effective communication channel, however it should be used very carefully.  This method of communication is the most active, calling the brand is aggressively breaking into the life of the client, which means that the reason must be really important.  According to <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/ee-stats-on-decline-of-voice-calls-in-uk-2015-10">statistics from</a> the Business Insider, people are less likely to call, and more and more use other channels of communication.  Thus, voice calls are irreplaceable in matters of security, but for advertising they should not be used. <br><br>  Despite the fact that <b>SMS</b> seems to be an outdated service to many, this channel of communication with the client is still important.  It is irreplaceable in cases when urgent delivery of important information is necessary, and at the same time the client is outside the Internet access area.  Companies can also send two-way SMS messages that are integrated with internal systems such as order processing and delivery.  Like all omni-channel components, SMS must be used in conjunction with all other tools.  More about this we wrote here. <br><br>  Finally, the newest communication channel is <b>push notifications</b> .  Unlike voice calls or SMS, push notifications are attached to the application and are limited to the phone's operating system.  Push notifications can attract the user's attention by switching it from another task.  This may be information on the order, a letter from the support service, advertising.  Push notifications serve to attract the user's attention, they can be interactive and redirect to SMS, e-mail or request a call.  According to experts, this type of notification becomes a necessary success factor for a business. <br><br><h3>  How to combine everything? </h3><br>  We went to the most important thing.  In order to combine all these channels, a separate <b>A2P API</b> platform is <b>needed</b> .  The API abbreviation stands for Application Programming Interface (Application Programming Interface), and represents the ability of applications to interact with each other, using the capabilities of each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd2/54d/702/bd254d702d464e13a342400e7b75809f.jpg"><br>  <i>In a customer-oriented company, they do not save on customers, but use technology.</i> <br><br>  Sending an SMS via a website is an example of this interaction.  A2P stands for Application to Person (from application to person), and is a technology for making newsletters. <br><br>  If today the use of omnichannel solutions greatly facilitates the process of company communication with the client and makes it more comfortable, then very soon without omni-channel, no business that works with people simply can not survive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321800/</a></p>
