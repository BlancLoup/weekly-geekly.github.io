Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/86444/">The first part of the</a> WormNET Alternative Games on WormNET contained a general view of the games.  Frankly, I did not expect interest in this topic, so I limited myself to a brief glance with a minimum of examples.  In this post I will tell in more detail about the main (and most interesting) types of games in this truly limitless game. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Types of games </h2><br>  Alternative types of games can be divided into four groups: <br><ul><li>  <b>Roping</b> - here the main feature is the active use of the rope.  This category will be discussed in more detail below, since in my opinion, all types from this group are spectacular and interesting. </li><li>  <b>Racing</b> is a kind of race: the attack is rarely present, the main thing is to get to the finish faster than others with the use of certain weapons.  As you probably guessed it - the most spectacular game is Rope Racing (RR) </li><li>  <b>Weapon</b> - games related to the use of one or more weapons.  There are very funny varieties, such as Holywars :) Read more below. </li><li>  <b>Other</b> - At least one game from this category, I was personally impressed with no less than at the time Roping. </li></ul><br>  In each group - about 10 games.  View their full list, you can on the "racially correct" <a href="http://worms2d.info/Schemes">site</a> .  Of course, I‚Äôll fail to describe everything (and you probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to finish reading to the end :) therefore, we limit ourselves to the interesting types themselves.

    <h2>  Fly shoppa </h2><br>  Shoppa is a subgroup of Roping, consisting of several modifications.  A regular shoppa (and an example of a map) is described in the first part.  On the basis of the rules of the usual shoppa, there is a very interesting modification - fly shoppa.  As the name suggests, flight is required here.  And there is absolutely nothing to do with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/85710/">jetpack</a> : the flight is performed with the help of a rope!  Take a look at the typical map for Fly: <br><br> <a href="http://wmdb.org/maps/12985-full"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e28/858/09d/e2885809d8011692b3db85e69614cac0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Of course, Homer is not a key element of the game :) All fly-cards contain two essential elements: a perpendicular in the middle of the field (central Homer) and a ground for pushing from both sides (forearms of other Homers).  The task is to fly over the central perpendicular, which can be just a line or some large object.  In contrast to the usual Shoppa, in which the top of the card is closed, Fly is always the opposite (since the take-off angle is different).  In Fly Shoppa, in addition to the usual rules of CBA and AFR, one more is added - FBA (Fly Before Attack).  That is, before attacking the enemy, you need to perform at least one flight through the central separator.  To make a flight, you need to cling to Homer‚Äôs hand with a rope, then drastically reduce the length of the rope (this increases the speed of the worm‚Äôs movement) and release the rope when it hits the <strike>forearm</strike> with a wall.  From the blow received - the worm as a ball bounces off the wall and naturally flies.  Having flown an obstacle, you need to re-shoot with a rope in order to prevent a fall.  Although it sounds simple - in order to perform a good fly, I personally needed several days of training.  This is given that the usual roping I already knew very well.  Here is a gif from the main site about Worms how fly looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/884/2a0/55e/8842a055e51a9972a5c8bf4bef0a01f5.gif"><br><br>  The skill of performance fly is needed not only for Fly Shoppa.  Flying is a fairly quick way of moving and an experienced wormer often uses small fly where others cannot do it, thereby gaining time.  On many maps, part of the relief is such that it is much faster to overcome with the help of fly, rather than the usual roping.  Just a small fly is part of a variety of roping techniques. <br><br>  Lack of fly-technology - the risk of losing the course.  If during the flight the worm hits its head - the move is lost.  An inaccurate fall will also lead to a loss of travel. <br><br><h2>  Wxw </h2><br>  The name of the game comes from Wall X Wall, where X is a number (usually from 2 to 8) indicating the number of walls.  The wall is a segment of the vertical part of the map highlighted with color (or in some other way).  For this game, the standard Wall Before Attack (WBA) is added to the standard CBA, AFR.  That is, before the attack - you need to touch all the walls.  Of course, the more walls there are, the harder it is to fulfill this condition (the turn time as for a regular shoppa is 30 seconds).  The authors of the maps are trying to make life harder for the Vormer as much as possible by placing walls a little longer from each other.  Below is an example of a map: <br><br> <a href="http://wmdb.org/maps/5613-full"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/688/c2d/bfe/688c2dbfe54e4a63a1143b29f009030b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Violet color, highlighted the places which the worm must touch while hanging on the rope.  As you can see, this is a W3W game.  The easiest way to do WBA is if your worm is near the outer wall.  Then, all the walls will be "along the way."  If you are somewhere in the middle, then, before you begin your turn, it‚Äôs nice to mentally plan your route and think about who you will attack (there is usually a couple of seconds for this before going).  Time, which happens little in Shoppa or Fly, in WXW is really worth its weight in gold.  Quite often, the enemy simply does not have time to complete the move (as there are seconds to choose weapons and attack), or go only part of the desired path.  Beginners have no chance at all and usually leave the game immediately.  True, some noobs, with anger for their inability, begin to play not by the rules (about this and how to deal with it - just below) <br><br>  WXW is a game requiring the most masterful roping skills.  Beginners lose due to the fact that having played in Shoppa and having achieved good results - it is naive to believe that WXW is the same shopp, only with walls.  However, this is not at all the case.  A classic map for shoppa, this is an empty square of a not very large size with a predominant left-right movement.  WXW is different in that it is a labyrinth and here you need to be able to move equally horizontally as well as vertically (and the ascent and descent require different skills).  On <a href="http://worms.org.ua/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D177">this page</a> - you can find descriptions and animations of most tricks from the world of alternative games Worms.  For example, the <a href="http://worms.org.ua/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D146">spike</a> technique allows you to quickly go down from the top down (using gravity or even a small, vertical fly). <br><br><h2>  Other options for Shoppa </h2><br>  Other varieties are the usual Shoppa but with some modifications of the map, the scheme and even the inclusion of non-standard features.  For example, <b>Pod Shoppa</b> - has a map consisting of many islands (that is, there are many empty areas in the map where you can drown).  Access from one island to another is usually achievable with the help of fly-technology.  This kind of shoppa is very popular: a high probability of drowning with an unsuccessful fly adds adrenaline and makes the games faster, which in a turn-based strategy matters :) <br><br>  There is also a shoppa where reduced gravity is used before each turn or time is halved.  Such varieties are not countless: their number is limited only by the imagination of the hoster.  Most of them are unknown to anyone and a small group of fans play in them. <br><br>  But there are interesting varieties.  For example, games with the prefix big or mini: enlarged or reduced cards.  I somehow had to play W5W on a map that is 4 times smaller than the original.  What can I say - it is very difficult to play.  It reminds RR with a labyrinth where there are very low "ceilings" and therefore the roping is either very slow or there are a lot of mistakes and loss of progress.  Big cards are also not sugar: when I played on big fly-cards, I never managed to complete the flight even once. <br><br>  Also there are very interesting hybrids.  For example, a hybrid of WXW and Fly, that is, a map containing walls and a central separator.  Both WBA and FBA are required.  Or a hybrid of Fly and Surf. <br><br>  About Surf Shoppa must be said separately, because  it just requires special features, which is TestStuff.  This is a mode that can be activated in a network game by typing / ts on the command line.  This mode includes some features in the game, for example, the ability to hang on a rope after the turn is over.  Also there is an opportunity to play <b>surf shoppa</b> and <b>air shoppa</b> .  The first is to glide through the water like a flat pebble.  To do this, you need to properly swing or run with a minimum angle to the surface of the fly.  The second is an attack at the moment of flight.  Due to the low accuracy of such an attack (although the pros manage to make sometimes surgical strikes), this game does not require mandatory KTL or ABL. <br><br>  There is another (apparently the very first) game with a rope - Roper.  Today we can say this is an outdated type: I very rarely had to see that they play it, although it is interesting in its own way and has its fans.  Many perceive only it, considering Shopper for noobs.  <a href="http://wmdb.org/14465">The map for Roper is</a> really more complicated than the usual Shoppa, just like the strategy of the game.  At the beginning of the attack, the worm is limited or absent and the players are engaged in assembling first-aid kits: the majority of them, due to the complexity of the card goes to the most dexterous.  Thus, the more experienced player has an advantage and the outcome of the game is actually determined.  In my opinion this is a drawback, and besides him, the game is designed for two.  Apparently, therefore, this type has lost its popularity. <br><br><h2>  Racing </h2><br>  The name speaks for itself - this is a speed competition.  The attack is usually absent altogether (sometimes it is allowed to "push").  Map - a complex maze with low ceilings.  They "chase" in such games on anything, but the most frequent way is of course the rope. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrSM7uBi4So%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhXKWSIrdFlzWT1SxIHPhPTjkBpLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the example above, several techniques of using a rope can be noticed, which can significantly accelerate the movement.  <a href="http://worms.org.ua/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D177">Here you will find a</a> description of the tricks and their animation in the GIF.  In general, if you are interested in the topic of Worms, then you just need to visit the site worms.org.ua, this is the most complete knowledge base about the world of Worms in Russian. <br><br>  One of the popular types of racing - Tower Race.  The game is a Rope Race, but instead of a maze a huge tower is used.  The direction of movement is always up.  Falling down can be very painful (the height of the tower can be more than skyscrapers, if you compare its size with the size of worms) or deadly: after all, among other things, the tower is gradually submerged (using the ‚Äúflooding‚Äù mode, which can be turned on for any game and even during the game). <br><br>  Of course, the white light did not come together on a rope.  Here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DjUV2h4Z0lmo">long</a> Sheep Race <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DjUV2h4Z0lmo">video</a> (using such a weapon: a flying sheep).  Anyone who has ever tried to fly a sheep in a confined space will think the skill of the authors of the video will be appreciated: although control of the sheep is very simple (two buttons are used, to the right and left) due to the inability to control the speed, turning sharp turns is very complicated.  The slightest touch of the landscape or any object on the map - explodes a sheep. <br><br>  In addition, there is Bangee Race, Jetpack Race, Parashute Race ... The community of players, trying to use the capabilities of any weapon to create new games all the time. <br><br><h2>  Games with a specific type of weapon </h2><br>  These games are interesting because they focus on the use of one weapon.  Consider the main ones: <br><br>  <b>Holywar</b> - the map consists of building blocks (griders) on which, at different levels of height, there are worms.  Of the weapons - more building blocks and, of course, Holy Grenade.  If you forget, this is a very powerful grenade with special physical properties (it practically does not ricochet and you can‚Äôt change the response time) which has a cross attached at the top and a second before the explosion a chorus is heard that plays one word ‚ÄúHallelujah!‚Äù.  Actually because of this and the name of the game went.  The game is interesting because it requires sufficient skill to throw these grenades and, in some cases, it is permissible to use a parachute and a teleport.  Beams, you can build in such a way as to make it easier for yourself to hit other players. <br><br>  <b>Bazooka and grenades (BnG)</b> - as the name implies, only bazooka and grenades are used.  Moreover, quite often it is required to calculate the attack with a grenade so that it explodes immediately after reaching the target.  For a bazooka, it is also required that it necessarily describe the curve, and not fly straight (although this is usually required by the landscape itself).  The worms in this game cannot move, and choose shelters for themselves before the game starts.  You need to hide in such a way as to protect yourself as much as possible and to simplify the attack on other worms.  The game is very difficult and requires at least a gold medal in training with a bazooka and a grenade, and a maximum - months of training.  Effective use of the wind for correcting the sight of a bazooka is necessary (and not many can do this). <br><br>  <b>Bow and Arrow (BnA)</b> is a ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù game, because the first few moves use randomness and have a big destructive effect.  A large map is used, on which there are many small islands, just for one worm.  The island at the beginning of the game is either empty, or occupied by one of the worms, or - there is a mine on it, the number of which is enormous.  All mines - work immediately, that is, they do not have a time delay, as is customary by default.  In addition, reduced gravity is included.  In worms, the main weapon is a bow, with which players try to shove the enemy from the island.  Plays as a rule the maximum number of teams (for a network game, these are eight teams).  After the worm has fallen on a mine (and this is most likely, given their number) further resembles a pinball: the worm flies like a ball, bumping into new mines, the blast wave throws it further and drops the nearby mines on other worms and, often, the pinball becomes "Multiplayer" :) The game is interesting primarily a bunch of positive emotions.  But, as in other types, professional players without any problems win here.  The fact is that after the downturn of the chain reaction, there are not very many mines left on the map and the skill of precise jumps and the use of a parachute is required.  Yes, and archery for long distances is also not so simple.  Below is an example of a map <br><br> <a href="http://wmdb.org/maps/14825-full"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/272/d53/cc0/272d53cc000d06d4746074bec001175c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  There are also a number of other games with less popularity.  For example, "Russian Roulette", uses the feature that the homing missile is not predictable, if you point it to a point in the air.  In this case, the rocket flies until it ‚Äúexhales‚Äù and falls into an arbitrary location.  In fact, with each type of weapon - you can make a new type: it is enough to prohibit the use of another weapon at the settings level and strain imagination a little to add some unique rules for a variety of gameplay. <br><br><h2>  Other types </h2><br>  Here I will talk about two games that do not fit into other categories.  In fact, there are a lot of such games, but they are all very specific and require special skill.  It is simply impossible to play all types of games, so I, like many others, specialize in a specific set of games. <br><br>  <b>Hysteria (Hysteria)</b> - this game stands out from all that, firstly, it is tightly controlled by the environment (there are no contractual rules), secondly, it is simple as all ingenious.  The only modification that distinguishes it from ordinary worms is exactly 1 (one!) Second to complete the turn.  To appreciate this little thing, you need to play this game at least once.  Beginners simply fall into a stupor and the first ten games stupidly try to catch the moment of the move itself, because it is lost in exactly one second!  However, when the moment of motion is caught - time can be stretched.  For example, if you have time to choose JetPack during this time, then you get extra time.  Another way is to press and hold the space after selecting a bazooka or grenade: while the indicator of the power of the shot is increasing, you can correct the sight.  The game is very effective and requires quick response. <br><br>  <b>WFW (Walk For Weapon)</b> is one of the most chic, thoughtful and congenial with the original game.  Explaining the meaning of this game, I usually compare it with chess.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game is quite simple: you can shoot anything, but under one condition - you need to be in that part of the map where this weapon is allowed.  To make it clear, take a look at the map: <br><br> <a href="http://wmdb.org/maps/13830-full"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/229/c70/797/229c70797a2098412656a9d85cd5c867.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the map you see a lot of weapon icons.  So, to shoot, say, from the bazooka - you need to walk and climb the icon with the image of the bazooka.  Constant walks for weapons - the inevitable reality of this game, why its name went. <br><br>  The running time is limited to 25 seconds, the use of a rope and Jetpack is prohibited.  The game requires a truly chess thinking, because to achieve only the jumps and parachutes of the desired weapon is usually very difficult in one move.  Card developers play an important role in this: placing weapons on a map must be carefully balanced.  I had to play about 10 different cards and all weapons were very skillfully distributed.  There can be no talk of any freebies in this game: you need to think quickly and walk quickly.  And in the pauses between his moves - think through a further strategy and try to understand the plans of other players.  In the game, every man for himself.  They usually play with two, because in a game in which there is the possibility of private messages, there is a possibility of collusion. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  This post is a big part of what I wanted to talk about Worms.  Of course, the Worms universe does not end there.  There are other games, there are fan clubs.  Championships are held for Worms, and for all of the above games.  There are interesting modifications of the game, for example RubberWorm.  This is such an addition to the game, which makes a variety of physics in the wormy world: worms behave like rubber balls.  I think about such additions, the developer Worms <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/cybershadow/" class="user_link">cybershadow</a> will tell in the comments (or even write a separate post). <br><br><h2>  useful links </h2><br>  <a href="http://worms.org.ua/">The main place of the Russian-language Vormer Party</a> <br>  <a href="http://wmdb.org/">International map storage for all types of games</a> <br>  <a href="http://worms2d.info/">Very complete English wiki</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_%2528%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%2529">Worms Russian Wikipedia page</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87808/</a></p>
