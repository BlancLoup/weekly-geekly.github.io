  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Auto dial: a good way to enhance customer base</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a highly competitive customer base is one of the core values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company.  The auto redial feature available in Zeon IP PBX allows you to activate customers with minimal cost and, with the right approach, make additional sales. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/h9/np/wch9npbxaftjkucy7ilzz-h_oe4.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When collecting customer contacts, retailers usually ask for a phone number, as well as an email address.  It is very easy to send news to all customers, but, as they say, ‚Äúwho reads them?‚Äù.  Make dialing more efficient, but at first glance - much more difficult: You need to go through the customer base, select the necessary contacts, dial their numbers.  However, it is possible without it - if you use the function of automatic dialing.  And today we will understand how this works. <br><br><h3>  When to use auto redial </h3><br>  In order to use automatic dialing, in general, you do not need a special occasion.  This may be a one-time action, a sale or some other event.  Moreover, a personal offer is ideal for a call, which can be ‚Äúone for all‚Äù or created individually within the CRM system.

      You can also call customers on the basis of the completion of the order or delivery.  For example, this can be done the next day following the results of the previous day.  But in any case, dialing manually is associated immediately with a whole set of problems.  If the operator himself dials numbers, the process is not effective, labor productivity decreases, and the quality assessment turns out to be problematic. <br><br><h3>  Auto Dial with IP PBX </h3><br>  Automatic dialing is much easier if you are working with an IP PBX, such as Zeon.  When installing such a solution, operators and other employees are initially connected to a programmable PBX, and their SIP phones allow not only to dial a number, but also to connect subscribers using a predetermined algorithm. <br><br>  Let's look at how auto dialing works with Zeon IP PBX. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/vb/pk/ajvbpkc6peu0nck6lylivb4mvvy.jpeg"></div><br>  To start the process, you need to go to the IP-PBX web interface and create a 'Queue' for auto-dialing.  Connection of operators occurs directly in the browser, and you can always see which of them is available for work. <br><br>  When the redial queue has already been created, you can add a "Customer List" to it.  It should be in CSV format with the name, phone and, possibly, notes.  This list can be exported from CRM, provided by a partner or transferred to the delivery department.  The essence of the note is that the operator sees it on the screen of his computer when he picks up the phone to talk to the customer. <br><br>  The 'autodial task' can be organized in various ways.  You can choose which of the previously downloaded call lists to use.  Which operators to use, as well as determine parameters such as the number of lines involved.  You can stop the task at any time, and then the calls will stop until it is convenient to continue the call.  For example, you can stop a task at 17 o'clock to continue at 10 am. <br><br>  When the operator picks up the phone, a customer card will be shown at his workplace, which contains the phone number, name and note.  If this is not about a ‚Äúcold‚Äù base, but about clients with whom you or your partners have already worked, the ‚Äúnote‚Äù field can be a good help for additional cross-sales. <br><br>  After pressing the ‚Äúsave and go to the next call‚Äù button, the system automatically dials the next client and immediately connects it to the released operator. <br><br><h3>  Use auto redial for your business needs. </h3><br>  The auto redial feature is available to all Zeon IP PBX users.  If you use the integration with the CRM system, employees will also be able to make notes on the CRM card, recording the results of dialing.  The advantage of this method is that you can call up customer bases without attracting outside contractors, but using the free resources of your employees. <br><br>  In sum with the available telephony from iptelefon.su, auto redial allows you to expand your customer base using new data and contacts, as well as activate passive clients.  Using the open CSV format makes it possible to start calls on any list of numbers - all entries from the list fall into the Contacts section and can later be used for a new call.  If you need to make automatic dialing - contact our sales department - we will find the best solution.  Leave the application on the website <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">iptelefon.su</a> <br><br>  PS In the article, under the concept of Autodial, we understand the automatic dialing of customers by the list. <br><br>  PS The article does not disclose all the complexity of working with Auto Dial.  Ask questions in the comments - we will try to answer. <br><br>  UPD: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/348990/">Link to the continuation of the topic</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348300/</a></p>
