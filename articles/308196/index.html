The transition to the new engine, which will happen very soon, also affects the user experience improvements.  Talk about it today. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/308196/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/a9a/d1f/7afa9ad1f4b44f9c91d94a78acde8f03.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Transactional emails are an effective tool for communicating with customers.  Their peculiarity is that they are sent automatically when the user performs an action.  Unfortunately, not all marketers know how to work with this tool. <br><br>  Well-known investor and founder of the 500 Startup Business Incubator Dave McClure created the universal model <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version">AARRR: Metrics for Pirates</a> , in which he outlined 5 main stages of the users life cycle: attraction (activation), activation (retention) retention), recommendations (referral) and revenue (revenue).  Thus, the abbreviation "AARRR", reminiscent of the battle cry of pirates, means the sequence of steps the user, who went all the way from finding your site to buying, and advised your product to friends.

    <h3>  Stage One: Attraction </h3><br>  At this stage, you must convince the user to visit your resource.  The first transactional letter you sent to the user sets the tone for his further expectations.  According to the results of the research of the company Experian, the probability of its opening is 4-5 times higher than in any other case. <br><br>  By adhering to the following rules, you can create an efficient welcome letter: <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> Try to respond to emails within a few minutes after receiving the user's email address. <br><br>  <strong>2.</strong> A call to action should have one goal - a specific user action (place an order, read information, make a purchase, etc.).  Several STA buttons are not the best idea, but pictures and large, bright STA buttons are hard to miss. <br><br>  <strong>3. You can</strong> encourage the user using a free trial version of your product or an ordinary discount. <br><br>  <strong>4.</strong> Do not perceive people as a homogeneous mass.  Even such a simple element of personalization, as the inclusion of the recipient's name in the subject of the letter, can significantly increase the percentage of opening letters. <br><br>  <strong>5.</strong> The welcome letter will not interfere with a brief guide on the use of your product or contact customer service. <br><br>  <strong>6.</strong> HTML layout is needed not only for the design of letters, but for a single logic of behavior (the letter and the website should have the same style and respond to the user's actions in the same way). <br><br>  <strong>7.</strong> The opt-out process should be as simple as possible.  The human approach to refusing to receive letters will help to know the real causes of what is happening. <br><br><h3>  Stage Two: Activation </h3><br>  Here you need to make sure that people use your newsletter.  To activate new users, you need to understand that they can prevent to do this.  At this stage, unsuccessful greetings or a confusing interface can interfere.  Users will only be happy to talk with a real person, but you know the desires of your customers, their problems and you can find a solution. <br><br>  Let's try to deal with onboarding letters.  Of course, they should not be too intrusive.  Customers need to ‚Äúlead‚Äù and ‚Äútrain‚Äù in order for them to fully understand the value of your product or service.  Your onboarding messages must meet activation goals.  It is desirable to set one goal and introduce only one call to action. <br><br>  As soon as you have independently led the first users to the activation phase, you can summarize all the knowledge gained and then automate this process.  Thus, new subscribers will be able to automatically receive the right information at the right time.  The marketing strategy takes into account the characteristics of each user segment and the time when they should write to make sure that as few subscribers as possible ‚Äúdrop out‚Äù from the funnel. <br><br><h3>  Stage Three: Hold </h3><br>  Users who have reached the hold phase become extremely valuable.  They are already using the product and are just one step away from paying.  At this stage, trigger letters are effective. <br><br>  Notification letters are letters sent in real time in response to any user action.  So that your letters are not boring and useless, divide users into segments depending on preferences. <br><br>  Regular mailings allow you to set clear expectations for users - they will know when to wait for the next letter, and as a result you will establish a trusting relationship.  Letters can be filled with educational and informational content - to keep people informed about how your product is developing.  There are also options with polls and reviews that will help divide users into segments and test the effectiveness of this action. <br><br><h3>  Stage Four: Recommendations </h3><br>  According to the Worthnoska School of Business research, customers attracted by recommendation or participating in referral programs are 20% more loyal to the business and have a higher retention rate than other buyers.  This marketing channel is especially good because it can be used at any stage of the funnel. <br><br>  Everyone knows about the example of Dropbox, which offers additional disk space to those who recommend the service to friends.  Such a simple move increases attendance of the referral program by 15% or more. <br><br><h3>  Stage Five: Income </h3><br>  Users have subscribed to your product, and officially become your customers.  You have come a long way, but there is still a lot of work ahead.  At this stage, your goal is to encourage users to purchase and keep their interest after the purchase.  This can be done with the help of automatically sent letters about the abandoned basket. <br><br>  It is important that these letters do not look as if they were written by a robot.  Remember that giving a discount is not a panacea, but do not underestimate the gift ROI.  This technique works equally well in SaaS and ecommerce.  And this is a great opportunity to remind you of purchases that your client has not yet had time to make or pay for. <br><br>  Remind users of what they are giving up.  It is possible that after throwing the basket, the client after some time still decides to make a purchase. <br><br>  <i><strong>PS</strong> Other materials from the blog <a href="https://pechkin.com/">Pechkin-mail</a> :</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://pechkin.com/blog/limit-sending-dispatches-from-the-public-domain/">Restriction of sending mailings from public domains</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://pechkin.com/blog/mailing-addresses-for-rules/">Recommendations for the distribution of addresses</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://pechkin.com/blog/how-to-improve-openability-mailing-list/">How to increase openability email-mailing</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://pechkin.com/blog/ui-ux/">Interfaces and usability: who designs UX and how</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://pechkin.com/blog/ux/">"Let's talk about it": The work of the designer</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308196/</a></p>
