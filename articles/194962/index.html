      Today we got to another Russian - Dmitry Vorotilin.  Dmitry is a leading developer at <a href="http://evrone.ru/">Evrone</a> , a Rails contributor, Poltergeist maintainer, Pjax_Rails.  Please love and favor! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4c4/e78/683/4c4e7868394ea906ee17fca12d24d02f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was during my youth, but it happened not so long ago.  My computer appeared only at the institute in the first and second year.  I was wildly interested in how computers work, and I realized that I had to figure out how it all worked from the inside, and I began to work hard on these issues. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I really love working on open-source, and in my free time, if I have one, I explore various open-source projects.  In particular, recently I have been working on the <a href="https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist"><b>Poltergeist</b></a> project a lot.  I talked to John Layton, and he made me the project's maintainer, now I have to answer a lot of questions and close the tasks in the githaba tracker.  Who does not know, Poltergeist is a driver for Capybara, and Capybara is a testing framework.  I will tell more in my speech ... <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  I like programming, and completely.  When I program, then from the moment when I sat down at the computer to the moment when I leave the table, it can take a couple of hours, but for me they fly by like a second. <br><br>  The worst part is that with the acquisition of experience, solving problems that I have solved many times becomes uninteresting, such tasks seem monotonous to me. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  I contributing to Rails, Poltergeist.  In general, the occupation of open source, when other people use what I did, is the greatest achievement. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  I think that programming and in general in computer technologies have no boundaries, they can be studied endlessly.  When you learn something and it seems that you understand something, it suddenly turns out that there are a lot of areas that you do not know.  I would like to answer that I want to understand everything, but it is impossible to understand everything, it is impossible to study all areas and be an expert in each. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  For me, the real leap was precisely when I began to engage in open-source projects, where I was faced with a number of truly complex tasks.  Rails, especially ActiveRecord, is quite a complex framework, and you need to spend a lot of time to understand how everything works there.  At the beginning, I started to learn Rails, and the commits to this framework raised my level noticeably. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  I do not know.  Since my education is not related to computers, for myself I feel a lack of basic knowledge about algorithms and the like.  And for the rest I don‚Äôt even know what to advise, everyone should choose a book for himself. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  I like to play football very much and I really like snowboarding.  Depending on the season, I do this or that.  I do football regularly, a couple of times a week, and snowboarding is worse, because the last years nature has not spoiled us with good snow. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> .
