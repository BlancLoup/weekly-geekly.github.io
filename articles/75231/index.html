Perhaps, the invented bicycle is described below and everyone has already known everything for a long time.  And do not philosophize slyly here.  But I didn‚Äôt read anything sane about this subject, so I started thinking. <br><br>  As part of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/71868/">my new course I</a> teach people how to search the web.  At first, the <a href="">Pechishchevsky course</a> ( <a href="">kowtow</a> to the author) to explain the principles of the work of the PS gave a great help.  He talked about the structure of PS, about queries and keywords, various services of Yandex and Google, their advanced search and search operators, about Nigma and Quintur.  But this is a theory.  And then the question arose: how to teach people to search in the Internet practically? <br><br>  I remind the situation.  There is a pedollektive school that studies the Internet - people are very different (by age, views, experience and attitude to E-no).  We need everything clearly, consistently and clearly.  To say to them ‚Äúlearn in a year‚Äù will not work, you need clear training, because  the concept itself is not alien to the audience :-))

      The answer ‚Äúit comes with experience‚Äù is not appropriate, since non-reflective knowledge is magic, not science.  The answer ‚Äúformulate the request correctly‚Äù is beautiful, but also from the field of shamanism, because it is impossible to explain what is ‚Äúright‚Äù.  From this, the idea was born - to try to formulate some principles (it would be too presumptuous to call them ‚Äúrules‚Äù), starting from which it would be easier to search on the Web.  Formulated.  Even on the basis of these rules, I made ‚ÄúSearch Games‚Äù (search training) and sent people through Google Docs forms. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There was the first part - simpler, the second - more difficult.  He took something and reformulated it with <a href="http://kubok.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Cub</a> , something with CPG ( <a href="http://izvilinam.chat.ru/">‚ÄúSheveli gyrus‚Äù</a> ), he invented something himself.  Questions such. <br><br>  <strong>The first.</strong> <br><br>  <em>1.1.</em>  <em>How many seconds after the launch did the first explosion take place on the space shuttle Challenger?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.2.</em>  <em>What does the Latin name of sorrel mean?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.3.</em>  <em>How tall is the monument to Siskin-Pyzhik?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.4.</em>  <em>Who was the first in the history of the award to become a Nobel laureate in literature?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.5.</em>  <em>The author of the line "in the living room talking aunts about Michelangelo Buonarotti"?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.6.</em>  <em>The White Star Line firm at the beginning of the twentieth century owned something very, very expensive.</em>  <em>But trouble happened and the company lost IT.</em>  <em>About the company today and do not remember, but the name of this LOSS is familiar to every student.</em>  <em>What is this loss?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.7.</em>  <em>Children's tale.</em>  <em>There is a main character in it, if his name is literally translated into Russian, then you get ‚ÄúPine Eye‚Äù.</em>  <em>Name the hero (heroine) and the author of the fairy tale.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.8.</em>  <em>Who was the historical prototype of Akunin killed in the death of Achilles?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.9.</em>  <em>Francois Rabelais published his works for the first time under the pseudonym Alkofibas Nazier.</em>  <em>He did not invent this name - he received it.</em>  <em>How?</em>  <em>(The correct answer is one word)</em> <em><br></em>  <em>1.10.</em>  <em>What day of the week did the Ice Battle take place?</em> <br><br>  <strong>The second.</strong> <br><br>  <em>2.1.</em>  <em>We now use these items for a different purpose, but when they appeared, they were indicators of wealth and eminence.</em>  <em>Many considered them an unaffordable luxury.</em>  <em>The French King Francis I had 13,600 of them.</em>  <em>What is this about?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.2.</em>  <em>How many cars can you park at Auchan store in Omsk?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.3.</em>  <em>On this day, a Russian composer and chemist was born, the author of ‚ÄúOne Hundred Days Before the Order‚Äù and a film actress, who in 1988 was called a Soviet sex symbol.</em>  <em>What is this day and indicate the years of birth of these three people.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.4.</em>  <em>Who owns the words ‚ÄúWork saves us from the three great evils: boredom, vice, need‚Äù?</em>  <em>Find 2 more sayings by this author.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.5.</em>  <em>Why L. Tolstoy was not awarded the Nobel Prize.</em>  <em>Give a quote from the Nobel Committee.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.6.</em>  <em>There are Voisins du Zero, Tiers du Cylindre and two Orphelins on this item.</em>  <em>And what is on it between 26 and 32?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.7.</em>  <em>What was the name of the sky god in the myths of the ancient Sumerians?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.8.</em>  <em>How much does baseball weigh?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.9.</em>  <em>How to say goodbye in Buryat?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.10.</em>  <em>If I left the house at 84 Lunacharsky Ave., then what is the nearest OKay hypermarket to go to?</em>  <em>Enter the address.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.11.</em>  <em>How many episodes were in the TV series ‚ÄúMy Second Mother‚Äù?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.12.</em>  <em>The Strugatsky brothers wrote the story "The Rat", but in the final version changed the name, taking a quote from a poem by a famous poet.</em>  <em>What was the name of the poet and what was the name of this poem?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.13.</em>  <em>Continue the phrase: The first is the pilot instrument, the second is the recording material, the third is typography, the fourth is explosive.</em>  <em>But all together they are four great ...</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.14.</em>  <em>Is Mount Olympus only on Earth?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2.15.</em>  <em>In the museum-apartment of Pushkin in St. Petersburg, among other subjects of the poet, there are 3 canes.</em>  <em>One of them was especially dear to Pushkin, because, according to family belief, she had a special knob.</em>  <em>What is this feature?</em> <br><br>  And now, after long prefaces, the promised "bicycle": the search principles. <br><br>  <strong>1. The selection of key, unchangeable words.</strong>  Highlight the most important thing in the task.  For example, in question 2.1, this is ‚ÄúFrancis‚Äù and ‚Äú13600‚Äù, in question 1.6 - ‚ÄúWhite Star Line‚Äù.  That is constantly and not reformulated. <br><br>  <strong>2. Translation into other languages</strong> Example 1.2.  or 1.7 In the first case, one should look for the Latin name in the dictionary (although it is possible through the reference book of medicinal plants - there will be Latin), in the second - in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãthe words ‚Äúpine‚Äù and ‚Äúeyes‚Äù to be later combined. <br><br>  <strong>3. The reformulation of the search infinitive.</strong>  By "and." Here we mean the initial form of the request, more specific.  For example, in 2.9, ‚Äúsay goodbye‚Äù should be translated into ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù and look for a Buryat-Russian phrase book. <br><br>  <strong>4. Quote</strong> This is the simplest.  Just drive in and see who the author.  As in questions 1.5 or 2.4 <br><br>  <strong>5. Search from a small amount - hit quantitative.</strong>  Maybe not the best example, but 1.10.  You can enter "Monday Ice Battle", "Tuesday Ice Battle", etc.  On ‚ÄúSaturday‚Äù we get the maximum, i.e.  in which case the qualitatively more results are the right one.  It is clear that the option "in the forehead" and very relatively accurate, and it can be more elegant, but interesting for the typology. <br><br>  <strong>6. Search for a specific site.</strong>  Question 2.2 or 2.10.  It must be assumed that these stores MUST have a website.  And then it's easier. <br><br>  <strong>8. How does it look?</strong>  The situation when in text form or nothing is found, or it is easier to see how IT looks.  Question 2.6 Understood what it was about, then through Yandex.Kartinki or Google.Images they found, saw and answered. <br><br>  <strong>9. Where is it?</strong>  In a sense, the continuation of the previous question.  Again example 2.10.  Find the address on the map, find a list of stores, match. <br><br>  <b>10. Other values.</b>  Question 2.14.  Option: open in Wikipedia and pay attention to "This term has other meanings, see ...." at the top of the page.  Or the second, third value of the encyclopedia. <br><br>  ____________________ <br><br>  Probably (and most likely) I missed something, forgot.  But the problem seems to me to be interesting: to formalize the cognitive search processes for learning.  You don‚Äôt think about it if you are looking for many years and everything is formulated on the fly.  And with newbies, what to answer the question: "How to search correctly"? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75231/</a></p>
