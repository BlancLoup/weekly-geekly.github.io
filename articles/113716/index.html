  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free Gaming Club - Answers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In a previous post, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/113479/">Free Gaming Club</a> , the process of moving a gaming club to a fresh Ubuntu was described.  The article was received by the habra-community with interest.  In particular, quite a lot of questions were asked.  On these issues, I interviewed the author. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I did not know what will be placed on the Habr√©, a note was made initially for our forum. <br>  The point was to show that it is not only possible to start the games, but it is also possible to earn money from this in the club business.  To begin with, no one will pay money for crookedly working and slowing down games.  As correctly noted in the era of anlim for 250 re and having 2-3 computers at home.  I will answer the memorable quotes, thoughts, questions. <br>  <b>- For what?</b>  - Of course, free of charge, saving for the club, for example, from 80 machines only at launch gives savings on software of about 484 thousand rubles.  For this business, believe it is money.  Scalability  For the new club, as the Chisinau club recalled here (hello Sereg), the benefit is minus 80 screws, which gives another 120 thousand savings. In total, this is a new foreign car.  I have a club for 10 years, 2 of them for Linux, so there was no point in making a garden with diskless stations.  All the iron was and throw out, I did not plan anything.  Screw cloning, sticking to the machine, changing the network settings (everything is done by the script), changing the keys.  And the machine without shamanism is ready for work. <br>  <b>- What is iron?</b>  Iron is very modest - dual core from e5200 to e7200, 2 gig operatives, mother on g31, NVidia9600gt.  I use drivers from off site NVidia * .run.  I put my hands.  For example, l4d2 runs only with the latest drivers. <br>  <b>- Why not Cedega?</b>  What for?  All I need is running on wine.  I repeat - why make a fuss? <br>  <b>- In general, they do not care !!! ???</b>  Yes, do not care!  Unfortunately, Linux platform is not common in the gaming business and I will explain why.  Indeed, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãinformation - just googly.  But all the information concerns routers, shapers, how to make dhcp, how to raise PPPoE, etc ... But as for games, this is an ambush.  There are issues that can be solved only with their own cones.  All Linux club owners know each other and gradually from competitors turn into good friends - the only reason is information is minimum, and information is needed as air.  Today, I know only 3 full-fledged gaming clubs in the CIS on Linux. <br>  <b>- How do all the top games work?</b>  I DO NOT KNOW!  I have only what is bought.  And only what is needed.  In the software and so many downloaded funds.  To buy what would just be - not commercially profitable.  For example Crisis.  This is not a club game.  Club games - KSY, KODY, DOTA, Halva, Kvaka, the list is large - but wherever there is a network drive, which can cause a healthy op in a club. <br>  <b>- Does it work faster than on Windows?</b>  Counter question ... How can we evaluate?  There is no cross platform software that did it correctly and intelligently.  Therefore, everything is subjective.  My subjective opinion.  All games that load a large number of files when downloading - load faster, really faster.  By the performance of the games themselves (fps) - we look at the very beginning.  The people do not pay for lags.  The question is only a line - when the siege or the masses of the batch where it is necessary to draw at the same time 1000 characters, or even more, but here the Windows also squander.  I did not notice a decrease in ping.  All the same as on Windows.  To be honest, this statement infuriates me - just like on Windows ... It is safer than on Windows !!!  Ruler, BOB, DOTA.  Pings are exactly the same to the host and it does not depend on the platform.  Questions probably your provider. <br>  <b>- How does Warcraft work?</b>  Yes, it works great.  The only advice is do not bother with the license.  I bought it, but everything is set to playgraund.  Pings I have 38-51ms that playable.  On Euroservers, pings reach 200ms and cannot be reduced due to my provider.  By the way, too, fell off, I think because of the big delay.  For 2 years, that the club is sitting on PG fell off only because of the "liver".  At 7.04 there was an unpleasant moment when you try to go to bn, to the card where everything is already taken, then there was a stupor for a minute, waiting to fall off.  In the new version of this glitch I do not observe. <br><br>  Separately, to a colleague, since ALL questions on the case, and it is clear that the person also beat the head of the AP wall.  But will it be interesting to others? <br>  1 - In short, that's all. <br>  Yevgeny RNDLUG - why do I blur the login on the incentive - will it be the same? <br>  Not the same)) unique login.  There is a prefix of the country in front <br>  2 - What is your country?  Ukraine / Russia?  There are nuances. <br>  RF <br>  3 - Buka.  She swallowed 1c.  What about the license for games from 1c?  soft club and other "absorbed." <br>  Yes 1C absorbs all, including absorbed and Buka.  And I suspect 1C wants to crush the lion‚Äôs share of the Russian gaming market.  Buka and EA work more accurately with clubs in the Russian Federation, her representative, and all the rest - see above, ‚ÄúBut they don‚Äôt care !!! ???  Yes, don't give a damn! ‚ÄùWell, except of course Department K and DAEC. <br>  4 - cyber cafe from Steam.  How much did the rent cost you?  In Ukraine - a pancake, a little expensive.  + It does not save from obepa.  Cafe gives access to games from 1c.  If not licenses from her - all go to a cyber cafe. <br>  <a href="http://www.cyber-cafe.ru/">www.cyber-cafe.ru</a> I have a valid contract (with the application where all games are listed).  And I have to lay on the BEP, having in my hands the original legal document.  Buy through <a href="http://www.uacc.kharkov.ua/">www.uacc.kharkov.ua</a> - cheaper than in Russia, it is a great pity that such an organization does not exist in the Russian Federation <br>  In addition, all owners of medium and large clubs use software that controls the number of running Steam licenses.  It consists of the server part and the client part.  In the server part all your keys are stored and it controls their use.  Why pay for keys if they are idle?  After all, not all the clients play the game at the same time.  Therefore, keys are distributed dynamically when requested.  The same software was written under Linux for the order. <br>  5 - lineup and gameguard.  GG on Linux - how does it work? <br>  x1 in the club?  IMHO hardcore.  Ruoffs don't work on Linux and I think they won't work, but I don't give a damn. <br>  6 - code4 and pankbuster.  PB on Linux - how does it work? <br>  No  They play without PB, and they normally tear everyone. <br>  7 - 4game games are Innova, I mean, offs are different.  How are things with the launcher, which is on qt. <br>  Look about x1 <br>  8 - why sneakers, if the task was to find less voracious - and if the option Xfce 4.8? <br>  because <a href="http://extragear.kde.org/apps/kiosktool/">extragear.kde.org/apps/kiosktool</a> under KDE, Xfce no such solution.  And to freeze and defrost the system is not productive under the conditions of "flow" <br>  9 - what is the total number of cars?  How is everything in service?  - I ask, because under the very little more than 1k machines on Windows. <br>  I think it does not matter, but everything was done on the development and scalability of the project, there are plans. <br>  10 - how are you doing with support for aa no. Framework, direct x ?, adobe, Microsoft Visual C ++ and so on? <br>  What's wrong with winetricks? <br>  I miss a number of statements about the curvature of work and stuff, I don‚Äôt even want to engage in controversy.  I pay money probably not for the fact that I'm so beautiful. <br><br>  <b>Now how everything is organized.</b> <br>  Most importantly ... I upgrade the system every 2 weeks.  And oddly enough wine does not fly off.  If you think a little bit, and not stupidly press apt-get install wine.  So you can organize everything creatively. <br>  Wine I have 7 versions compiled by hands.  /home/user/.wine - 6 directories.  Yes, it is not convenient, but everything works as it should for me. <br>  About the compilation of wine, I will not write about this sea of ‚Äã‚Äãinformation.  As for /home/user/.wine, it's more interesting here.  Why are they 6?  Above was a colleague's question - how are things going with support for ala no. Framework, direct x?, Adware, Microsoft Visual C ++ and other things?  Not all games need the same settings.  And for some they are diametrically opposed.  We start everything through WINEPREFIX.  With the indication of the wine we need and the .wine3 directory for example.  This is the luck of launching such a number of games. <br>  There is a wonderful resource <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">www.winehq.org</a> , if you occasionally dive there, you can find ALL the answers to your questions.  To describe how to set up one or another game, you need to quit a lot of material.  Literally all games were customized thanks to the winehq resource.  All labels are organized through kiosktools.  Generally crazy software, to close all that is possible.  The client can only run what he sees on the desktop.  Allows you to remove the buttons in all applications such as save, save as and so on.

      <b>UPD</b> <br>  Which game setting is interesting?  Choose <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php%3FsClass%3Dcategory%26sAction%3Dview%26iId%3D2%26sTitle%3DBrowse%2BApplications">appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=category&amp;sAction=view&amp;iId=2&amp;sTitle=Browse+Applications</a> <br>  d3dx9 and even d3dx10 is in winetricks - how to put it?  I recall winehq.org ALL the answers to your questions, including an explicit link to winetricks. <br>  wget <a href="http://winetricks.org/winetricks">winetricks.org/winetricks</a> <br>  sh winetricks <br>  ATTENTION!!!  all changes are made to /home/user/.wine.  If you already have something from the games and you are playing, I recommend the current pac before you make any changes to winetricks, for example, in .wine1 you will have to run through wineprefix if something does not work. <br>  Club software, already mentioned in the first article - <a href="http://ccl.sourceforge.net/">ccl.sourceforge.net</a> with sources. <br>  To be honest, to install Windows for the sake of seeing fps there is no desire, I can give out real fps KS saurs, I chose 47 people online - dust2, I was 48, for a respawn 24 people - 78fps - more than IMHO. <br>  crtl + alt + bcksp / f1 caused a smile.  If you are interested, in the first case you will be offered to reboot, in the second case we call Wang or press * / f7.  In other cases, if even by some miracle it turns out to call the console.  Then the killall -9 konsole script runs every 3 seconds. <br><br>  According to Warcraft - I will test, I will write it off necessarily.  Unfortunately we sit tight on the PG and I don‚Äôt plan to change the server honestly, all the hosts are Russian, the pings are amazing.  No complaints about work at all. <br>  Separately, I want to raise the topic for a colleague on new games, although this is not the topic of this top.  Unfortunately, 146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation actually works in Russia.  After reading it, you will understand why it is so hard with the politics of games in my club. <br><br>  Evgenii.
