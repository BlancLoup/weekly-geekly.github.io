  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTML5 has already changed the Web!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  HTML5 is the biggest breakthrough in network standards in almost a decade.  Now HTML enters the phase when it is not just created to display content, it is being tried to make it a development environment, an application platform, so to speak, where sound, video, graphics, etc. are all standardized and very clearly described in the specification. <br><br>  Free <a href="http://absolvo.ru/">Translation</a> <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/How_HTML_5_Is_Already_Changing_the_Web">How HTML 5 Is Already Changing the Web</a> by Scott Loganbill. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The last update to the HTML specifications happened in 1999, and that was when HTML4.01 appeared. <br><br>  Since then, there have been very few changes.  However, in the world of browsers, whole epochs began and ended.  Netscape is dissolved, MicroSoft is trying to make a human browser, Apple and Google have released their own browsers.  Browsers for mobile devices and other devices (such as the console) have become more relevant than ever.

      But all this rapid development led to the fact that there was some confusion.  I think the maker-ups will support me.  After all, IE6 is not bad, it just works according to other standards.  As a result, for these ten requirements for HTML5 were formed, most of which received their implementation in the specification.  And those that have not received the implementation - will receive, the specification is processed by the file daily, if not hourly. <br><br>  Several stakeholders joined forces and formed an organization called the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (or simply WHATWG).  This organization works independently of the W3C, it oversees the development of standards, makes its own proposals and, while on the front line, tries to inject new features into its browsers.  The organization includes representatives from Mozilla, KHTML / WebKit, Google, Apple, Opera and Microsoft.  And although there is little sense from their activities so far, but they continue to work. <br><br>  So what's so revolutionary about HTML5.  Below is a list of the very: <br><ul><li>  A new word with semantics, video lies in the video tag, sound in audio. </li><li>  Local DB.  When it does work, it will allow you to better cache the pages of sites, speed up the search for them, use for offline applications (remember <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/38983/">Gears</a> ?) </li><li>  The richest animation without third-party plug-ins, such as Flash or SilverLight.  Some support already exists in all browsers except IE. </li><li>  The browser will become an environment for real, serious applications.  As a rule, this results in a very serious API. </li><li>  The value of tags for the provision of information will continue to decline, as they say, styles (CSS) rule. </li></ul><br>  In essence, HTML5 is a clean slate for new ideas from all stakeholders, primarily from browser developers.  But this is still in theory.  Or it is more correct to say in the experimental phase. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHTML5 has been reborn,‚Äù says the vice president of Mozilla Mike Shaver.  This is facilitated by the WHATWG and W3C. <br><br>  HTML5 was born in the halo of impatience, as it became clear to many that the standards were stagnant and they needed to change in order to meet the requirements that are relevant for web development.  On the one hand, this is understandable, because the W3C was actively involved in XML, which was supposed to replace HTML, but apparently not for the time being. <br><br>  If you draw a line, you can say the following: <br>  All browser and standards developers agree on one thing - everyone is pleased that interest in HTML has reappeared, that HTML has begun to evolve, trying to become a kind of application platform for developing web applications of a new level. <br><br>  Ps. <br>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">www.w3.org/TR/html5</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/">www.w3.org/html/wg/html5</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39873/</a></p>
