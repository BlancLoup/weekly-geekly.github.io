Developer Bans on Google Play</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/ju/ry/ocjury5kotaeuuoekgl9gilwhjy.jpeg"></p><br><p>  <em>Our sorrowful work will not disappear ...</em> </p><br><h1 id="bez-predisloviya">  Without preface </h1><br><p>  Let's agree immediately.  There will be no long stories about the story from abacus to intel, right away - a snout on the table.  Who is in the subject - the one in the subject, who is not - will come later.  Of course, you can ask questions, wishes and comments in the comments and, without waiting for anyone right away, start answering yourself. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="kto-zdes">  Who is there? </h1><br><p>  Thinking out loud. </p><br><p>  Here are <a href="http://bit.ly/2FBlxKc">links on the subject, which managed to collect</a> . </p><br><p>  I must say that this is the most heartbreaking stories, the visible part of the iceberg. </p><br><p>  Freelance exchanges regularly began to appear tasks about placing applications on Google Play, or about buying a developer account, or about developing a custom application update system, which also hints. </p><br><p>  Yes, in Google there is a lot of slag, and developers from sunny India are like stars in the sky.  Ban - do not interrupt. </p><br><p>  The flesh itself is the bans of ‚Äúconnected‚Äù accounts.  They even ban accounts of companies where ‚Äúunscrupulous‚Äù developers work.  For the entire Internet, there is only one happy ending (it is in the selection), but this is not certain.  What other bot will go through them in a year - God knows. </p><br><p>  Tightening screws with permissions.  Example.  Users roar, they want a new feature, something there with SMS.  Google answers - it is impossible, there is no justification, not the main function of the application, it is not supposed.  Well, do not banned the same, so, cut off a piece, live and rejoice. </p><br><h1 id="otvet-na-vse-voprosy">  The answer to all questions </h1><br><p>  Well, here is the most recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8yKI-igsWVE">Google answer to all questions</a> .  Enjoy. </p><br><p>  Vae victis. </p><br><p>  Just a statistic: 150 people attended the webinar online, 15 in the telegram chat, and 500 video views in total. Within the limits of statistical error.  Not 500 million. Like the tee-serises or the Pyudipians, I wanted to say this.  So all is well. </p><br><p>  Why is that?  And then you do not know.  New features - money.  Feedback, bugfixing, messing around with these your bans / razbanami - costs.  Money is good, costs are bad. </p><br><h1 id="chto-delat">  What to do? </h1><br><p>  Who is to blame is clear.  To whom it is not clear, we approach the mirror. <br>  What to do?  Minimize dependencies. <br>  In a broad sense, to reconsider the approach to their development career. <br>  In the narrow - not tied to the services of one manufacturer. <br>  In a very narrow way - to apply an architectural approach to the development of applications, which will make it possible not to depend entirely on specific frameworks, services, databases and others. </p><br><p>  I would advise firms to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù their developers: at least no personal guglofonov and personal acco in the workplace.  Hard?  √Ä la guerre comme √† la guerre. </p><br><p>  Looking up from the plow and taking a look at the historical perspective, I can‚Äôt find examples when those who are on top would be led by those who are from below.  I mean both the IT history and the usual one.  Yes, sometimes the ‚Äúupper‚Äù people were frightened and seemed to make concessions, but then, when the people dispersed in their huts, special people always came and everything returned to normal. </p><br><p>  So let's be realistic, embedding in the existing system is our task. </p><br><p>  It's nothing personal, it's just business. </p><br><p>  Telegram chat for those interested <a href="https://t.me/android_developers_ban">android_developers_ban</a> .  Come, shuffle and grind. </p><br><h1 id="upd">  UPD </h1><br><p>  99.99% read clearly not in the subject.  Sero molunt deorum molae. <br>  I will explain in dotted lines. <br>  Nobody is against putting things in order. <br>  Ban you personally as a developer.  Forever and ever.  Without the right to correspond, literally. <br>  Not for every murder give life for at least and there is a court. <br>  Even if a person made a mistake (I said ‚Äúif‚Äù), is that all?  No chance for correction?  A startup where he works, too, must suffer?  If this is normal for you, then ok. </p><br><p>  I do not have a ban, but there are two completely legitimate applications in the unpublished status.  After a brief correspondence with the bots (naively, I even suggested they explore the source code;) I did, as they said;). </p></div>
