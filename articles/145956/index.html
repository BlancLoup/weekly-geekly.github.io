    <h2>  Part one.  Prehistory </h2><br><br>  So, some time ago, and to be a little more accurate, about five years ago I decided to finally switch to Linux and do everything that I did before, exclusively under Linux.  This was partly due to some of my reflections on the development of electronics and media, partly by understanding some impasse of the ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù paradigm and the desire to demonstrate the ability to use open, collaborative tools created by joint cooperative efforts to work on full-fledged professional projects, but incorporating all aspects of developing an audio-visual product entirely. <br><br>  I must say that before that, for almost 13 years I was engaged in what is commonly called the collective term ‚Äúvisual communication‚Äù, namely, I painted graphic design, shot ads and made design in motion, and later, with a fair school-student programmer‚Äôs baggage, interested in the development of interactive software, including  in relation to the growing web-industry. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Gradually, first with some fears and not without the difficulties of a neophyte, I discovered that practically everything that I did before can be done in Linux.  Moreover, I was surprised to find out that the principle itself (modularity), which was originally laid down at the system architecture level, makes it possible to solve simple, but previously seemed not so much laborious, as time-consuming, tasks without spending much effort on it.  The openness of documentation, a large and active community of users and developers, and, ultimately, an understanding that the world of software and electronics is incomparably wider than the popular notion of ‚Äúapplications for smartphones‚Äù + ‚Äúservers and web services‚Äù, all this prompted me to to look at the subject more deeply and, ultimately, gave rise to a host of different kinds of ideas linking my previous experience with new ‚Äúelectronic‚Äù horizons. <br><br>  I became actively interested in all kinds of embedded devices and microelectronics as such. <br><br><h2>  Part two.  Idea. </h2><br><br>  So, it was about a year after the events described, that is, in the winter of 2008.  From time to time I looked at websites like linuxfordevices.com and wondered what and how I could use for those ideas that I had at that time in my head.  Followed by the fact that publish other "seasoned" enthusiasts and asked the price for scarves and components in the light of new ideas. <br><br>  One day, on the way to Prague, on an airplane, I looked at travel ads in one of those magazines that are in the seat pocket opposite, and implicitly thought that pocket electronics was catastrophically focused on ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù and that it would be much easier to make simple cheap ones highly specialized embedded devices, rather than trying to cram everything and everyone into one box with a screen.  A couple of days before that, I came across the announcement of a great ‚Äúgumstix‚Äù shawl on the same previously mentioned site and the thought of purchasing it was spinning in my head.  Considering what can be screwed to such a small computer, I remembered the work of familiar artist Kaffe Matthews that I had seen recently.  I don‚Äôt remember the name of the work, but the essence is simple: Caffi installed loudspeakers on the bikes and changed the musical-noise accompaniment by changing the coordinates from the GPS receiver.  Here it is!  So two ideas, having closed into one, turned into a thought - it could be an interactive audio book, where the switching interface is your geo-coordinates.  On the approach to Prague, I had already planned how such a device could be arranged and what the content structure should be. <br><br>  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan interactive audiobook "Prague Electronic Tour Guide" was born. <br><br>  The idea seemed so bright and obvious to me that I was even somewhat surprised not to find any similar developments on the web.  Gradually, the business model was also drawn.  The next day, finally inspired by the project, but realizing that this is a very laborious undertaking not for a couple of months, and not being sure that I can do all the hardware and software without having more or less serious experience, I proceeded to finding a partner.  I considered various options, from being able to give a potential partner a complete development with equity participation, to a possible one-time order for a fixed amount.  Anyway, after a while I met Eugene. <br><br>  Eugene liked the idea and we signed a contract, threw TK and Eugene suggested not to run into the Linux-on-chip board and immediately make our own device on the microcontroller.  A pier and cost will be much cheaper and easier by morphology.  I was thinking about something like that, but at that time I was still with some trepidation about the development of low-level hardware and I was not sure that we would pull such a project ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù.  Eugene dispelled my doubts, assuring that it is all easier than it seems and that he will assemble the prototype in a couple of weeks.  They decided on that, but nevertheless agreed, first, to first make a test primitive for OpenWRT with GPS ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù. <br><br>  Further, as in the fairy tale about Winnie the Pooh: a couple of weeks passed, another couple followed, then another couple.  I, meanwhile, ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with my friends in Prague and was already explicitly chasing the phrase ‚Äúit would be time and honor to know.‚Äù  Finally, after a number of my persistent calls and requests to ‚Äúshow at least something,‚Äù Zhenya showed an application that ... included a sound file depending on location.  ‚ÄúDelighted‚Äù at least by some result, at least so insignificant and not being able to stay in Prague longer, I flew home expecting to receive a report on the status of a separate layout, if not in a couple of weeks, then at least a month. <br><br>  A month later, after a series of persistent reminders, Eugene contacted and informed that he was about to start work and that he needed (for a moment!) A soldering iron and an oscilloscope.  A month later, it turned out that the microcontroller that my colleague wrote out for the device is an engineering sample (it was fresh at that time Xmega), and that a) they are not yet in series b) due to the economic crisis, it is not clear whether to release into the series in general c) the power of this controller is several times higher than necessary (and the controller itself is chosen not according to the principle of relevance to the tasks, but rather to ‚Äúpick it up‚Äù for).  It was the last nail in the coffin of my patience, I thought about alternatives. <br><br>  Passed another couple of months.  I was bogged down in my own affairs and, it was already quite disappointed in the contractor, I sluggishly searched for a replacement.  However, partly to be "fully prepared" and, on the other hand, having my own serious cognitive interest, I was surrounded by the literature on the development of microelectronics, bought Arduino (yes and yes) and began to carefully try to design and assemble iron.  After some time it became obvious that this project is relatively simple from a technical point of view and that if I took it myself, then if not by September, then by October I would have had a working prototype for myself.  But I, nevertheless, was not sure about the electronic part and assumed that the circuit solution could conceal some hidden nuances that I see and I don‚Äôt see.  In the meantime, since the start, it has already been more than six months, I made a second attempt to find a developer, and this time very successful. <br><br>  In the spring, being in Prague again, I met Denis.  We talked briefly and in a very businesslike manner, agreed on conditions, and a week later Denis called and said, come, I will show you how he plays.  All that happened.  The device assembled by Denis on a breadboard played the mp3 cheerfully.  It became clear that this time everything had grown together and one could proceed to the second stage.  Those.  think about content creation.  I talked to my friend Anton, and, concurrently, an expert on Prague and one of the authors of one of the best guides to this city, we agreed on the conditions and the necessary volume of texts and, this time with peace of mind, I flew home.  It is fair to say here that I was going to make an intermediate pilot version a couple of months before and ordered compilation texts for this purpose, but the result disappointed me so much that I decided that such short content simply does not fit into the idea and waste time and money for any intermediate attempts there is no sense.  It is necessary to do at once a thoroughly considered Thing in every respect. <br><br><h2>  Part Three  Back to the roots. </h2><br><br>  By the end of the summer (and it had already passed more than a year since the start of the whole undertaking) everything had finally finally crystallized.  We (however, at the first stage) picked up a good body, I made the design, sat down to write software for preparing maps and waited for the end of the text and the news from Denis.  The news was not long in coming ... <br><br>  Even at an early stage, when we with Eugene only decided that we were making the device from scratch, I began to think how to give this all a pleasant appearance.  The idea to try myself as an object designer seduced me for a long time and it was just the case.  Having rummaged in a network I quickly found out that my funds, in the light of forthcoming expenses for translations and sound recording, would hardly be enough to develop my own body from scratch.  I decided to see what is from the acceptable ready-made cases and which of them can be somehow modified to fit, on the one hand, into a real venture, on the other, in order to ensure proper ‚Äúspace‚Äù for the author's design.  Found a great option and supplier.  It turned out that the supplier has a partner in the Czech Republic (which was very helpful).  Sent a request and a week later received samples.  Under them, we decided to make a fee and come up with an interface. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to make a reservation that I thoroughly checked the drawings, estimated the dimensions and, being confident in the chosen layout, proceeded to the design.  And the samples themselves were sent to Eugene (this, as I noted earlier, it was still in the first winter) and later transferred to Denis. <br><br>  So, 9 months after the start, one unforeseen detail emerged.  It turned out that those samples that were sent to us by Czech intermediaries, however, do not quite correspond in size to what I requested.  More precisely, they do not correspond at all, and in fact, one and a half times less than those I listed in my request.  I, without hesitation, wrote about this intermediary and received in response a bag of different buildings, none of which (!) Again matched my request, and after him, instead of an apology, an invoice for payment (!).  At the end, fucked up by such frankness, I wrote them a letter, where I set out everything that I think about them, not forgetting to share with them my thoughts about what and in what extent we will now have to redo it, not without their participation.  In response, a letter came with sincere apologies and ... an offer to pay for only three buildings that were ordered as free samples (!) Almost a year ago.  Deciding not to get involved and not enter into unnecessary correspondence, I agreed, sent the money and finally received my desired cases.  Do not wait, this is not the end of the story ... <br><br>  So, at that time, as long as we had old smaller enclosures, and the boards were divorced just for them and the design was thought out for them, we decided to try to finish the current version in a smaller case, despite what everyone said for that even if we manage to shove everything in, a battery of such volume will not be enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b5/3fd/0d9/9b53fd0d973a6788182ff59539b3bfb3.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide. The first design."><br>  <i>The first design of the device.</i> <br><br>  Anyway, I came up with an exterior design and worked on a prototype button keyboard, meanwhile, Denis drove to Peter and brought in ready-made boards.  Initially, I planned to make a tactile interface in the image and likeness of how it is implemented on some pocket players.  However, it later became apparent that it was impossible to place all the components in such a tiny device, and even if this was done, the location and proximity of the sensory contacts would not provide the necessary accuracy and it could unfairly complicate both the firmware and the interface itself, not to mention additional cost tactile controller and add.  boards + mounting complexity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/185/72b/490/18572b4904d3c437f9394b3108d77684.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide. Boards and keyboards"><br>  <i>Different variants of boards and user interfaces + masks for applying paste for the first version of the board.</i> <br><br>  There was an idea to make a simple one-button interface, which corresponded to my original idea - to develop such a ‚ÄúZen device‚Äù for people who are tired of looking at the world through the screen and like to just walk and enjoy the natural views of the city.  The idea has not changed, but the number of functions has, nevertheless, somewhat grown since then.  For a poem, I diligently tried to come up with some cheap way to create a keyboard without ordering a print run of plastic button panels and not complicating the installation.  And when I had already mastered the etching of flexible boards for our experimental keyboard, one day, a letter from Denis arrives, saying that this way and that, they fired my job, the visa ends, I leave, perhaps, home to Peter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91f/60e/cf1/91f60ecf1819b9eb376d6c19c2b89a51.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide. Flexible keyboard"><br>  <i>My experimental keyboard on a flexible basis.</i> <br><br>  Denis is a man of freedom, a lover of traveling and an avid enthusiast of electronics.  I assume that the loss of a visa and permanent job in Prague was only a part of the true motives.  It is quite possible that, as is often the case, the process itself and the peripeteia arising during the work on the project, and perhaps even simple human circumstances, have caused a banal extinction of interest.  Of course, I was quite upset, but as long as there was nothing to do, I packed up my suitcase, flew to Prague, in order to get first-hand instructions and with the understanding that I now have to do this all myself. <br><br>  At that time, I had already become adept with a certain degree of design, and it wasn‚Äôt much scaring me that the schemes didn‚Äôt look at the diagrams, but there were a lot of questions.  In general, upon arrival, Denis gave me a three-day ‚Äúyoung fighter‚Äù course, told line by line where and how what periphery is initialized, how intercomponent communication is arranged, and I, with a soldering iron in my hands, assembled on the boards brought by him and flashed the first device, which I later used to develop the first version of the firmware. <br><br><h2>  Part Four  Miser pays twice. </h2><br><br>  In general, autumn has come, it became clear that I successfully missed the second season, and that now it is possible to do everything in stages, unhurriedly.  I added a software for editing maps.  I finished the first version of the firmware, made a convenient integration with the editor for debugging via UART.  He figured out how to structure the content and store the data, and finally ordered the recording of speakers in Russian and in parallel translation into English (from his wonderful London friends Masha and Misha).  Translation into English is more than!  but with the record ... <br><br>  While I have been doing any kind of video for a long time, I decided that it is best to find a sound engineer or how it is now fashionable to call a ‚Äúsound designer‚Äù who probably has a dozen good speakers to choose from in his notebook.  A number of quite good sound engineers responded to the announcements scattered by me in profile communities, they sent samples.  I chose a man from Moscow named Oleg Markelov.  Immediately I was going to make a kind of story with the elements of a ‚Äúradio production‚Äù so that you could turn on the ‚Äúrole-playing‚Äù moments and structure the self-narration according to the timbres of voices, which fit perfectly into the supposed ‚Äúnon-linear‚Äù structure of the pitch.  Oleg sent two excellent demos (male and female voices), we signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA, I mean), and with a light heart I sent ready-made texts to Moscow hoping to receive ready-made audio materials in a month and a half. <br><br>  Time, in principle, was until next summer - the car, and I, not being customized by circumstances, expected that, if not for 6 weeks, then with at least all the approvals and modifications, in a couple of months I would have everything ready for build the first prototype, including content.  I decided to go to the site and related promotional design. <br><br>  As the reader must guess, besides the project, I was simultaneously engaged in my main business - namely, I made all kinds of web, I painted the design from time to time and made videos to order.  Clients went, how to selection, a lot of work.  I decided to give the development of the server part to my Belarusian colleague Vlad.  I threw in a technical description, drew sketches, agreed on a price and sent it to work with a light heart. <br><br>  In the meantime, the summer of 2010 was near. I finished the firmware, made new boards for the new case.  I picked up the batteries and the GPS module and even came up with an elegant way to make and place the keyboard inside with ‚Äúlittle blood‚Äù.  He began to disturb Oleg for results.  The results were, but their volume was not so far from what was planned ... half was done on the force.  And in what was, a third of the text was missing.  Oleg apologized, promised to finish ASAP and weekly referred (as everyone knows, doesn‚Äôt it?) To all kinds of force majeure circumstances.  That hard disk flew, then move to another office.  And so on in the same vein. <br><br>  In the meantime, I decided that since everything is already going as it is, you need to do many languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once and it‚Äôs time to give the text to the translation, and I began a diligent search for translators.  "Plastered" ads on freelance sites and, as a result, chose a contractor - a small Ukrainian translation agency in the person of one person named Anna.  Anna took on quite acceptable conditions to translate into French and ‚Äúscatter‚Äù the translation into other languages.  I, in the meantime, having achieved some progress with the Russian-language sound, experimented with the structure and waited for the remaining English part of the voice acting (ordered from the same Oleg from Moscow). <br><br>  I, in a sinful affair, thought that by this summer I would definitely release the bilingual version, and for the next season I would prepare a full-fledged multilingual one.  Soon the fairy tale is affected but it is not done soon.  While I fought with the sound and discovered all the new missing fragments (!), The translation went and Vlad worked on the site.  By the summer, the first translated texts appeared.  I, in the meantime, found good voices for other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand began to send the text to the record.  It quickly became clear that some languages ‚Äã‚Äãare quite tolerable in quality.  Some require editing.  But in general, it fit into my expectations and, as I suspect, in Anna's expectations.  Everything she sent was edited, with some discussions and arguments, but edited.  Gradually, all the announcers found the text with some compromise clauses acceptable, or made their own adjustments and, as a result, began to write.  Everything ... except French. <br><br>  The summer was nearing completion, more than 6 months had passed, and there was no French in any form.  French came in the fall.  I immediately sent it to the speakers and I received a brief answer: ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù.  I sought out familiar Russian-speaking graduates of French and received from them the expected resolution - an illiterate rubbish.  I contacted the announcers and asked them, perhaps, about self-editing for some extra charge.  The previous languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere not without problems.  But then the verdict was harsh, the speakers as one refused, arguing that they simply do not understand in some places what the author wanted to inform the reader.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, ‚Äúreluctantly‚Äù I gave it all to the editor (and in fact to the re-translation) to the professionals. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the meantime, not without the help of Skype and repeated telephone conversations, I managed to ‚Äúget out‚Äù Oleg's English sound and remnants of Russian-speaking. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I gave the sound to the thread and was puzzled by the state of the site.</font></font><br><br><h2>  Part Five<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The most dramatic or "our brother is a crook." </font></font></h2><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a full debugging of the site and server side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Much has changed both in the course of work and as a result of thinking about logistics within the framework of the chosen business model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I corresponded with Vlad and tried to find some compromise options, knowing that the changes will be another car, and my budget is rapidly coming to an end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was increasingly argued that it might be worthwhile to simplify the model and, perhaps, take up the site yourself.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The summer has passed, and autumn has followed. The third missed season. Much has already become clear in how it would be worthwhile to build work. Somewhere, my inner caution and the simple human uncertainty of a novice did not allow me to make sensible decisions right away, somewhere the very commonplace human factor turned out to be stronger than common sense and all sorts of obligations. I am not inclined to argue in terms of ‚Äúslobliness‚Äù and ‚Äúunprofessionalism‚Äù, because behind this sometimes there are quite understandable human weaknesses and personal problems. Inability to motivate themselves, deformed self-esteem, communication problems. I believe that Zhenya, who volunteered to ‚Äúmake a prototype in a couple of weeks,‚Äù could theoretically do it. And it is completely obvious to me today that I could. And my personal observations confirmthat the true reasons for his disastrous ‚Äústart‚Äù were not technical lacunae (although, frankly, not without it, see the illustration with the antenna), but partly lack of experience, partly serious problems with personal motivation and, as a result, self-esteem.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was this kind of reflection that I indulged in the fall of 2010, especially since the London weather at this time could not be better for the development of all sorts of melancholy melancholy. My customers cooled down, the money came to an end. In front of me, the sound editing in myriad loomed and I was already thinking for a moment whether I shouldn‚Äôt sit down to write the site from scratch, because there are no orders anyway, I have long wanted to bring my framework into proper condition and the whole winter is ahead for endless ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù "To the state of" as needed. " </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, one dark autumn evening, I turned on Echo of Moscow radio to listen to the news from the Motherland and the corresponding to my state of mind at that time ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I ...., at first I didn‚Äôt believe my ears ... bravura screensaver, science and technology news, all things ... Sergey Parkhomenko and the head of the GPS Guide project in the Vokrug Sveta publishing house Ilya Kusy. Good evening ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think - oh! I wonder what it is? blah blah, word for word and ... it sounds MY TEXT! read by my reporters! and then bravado almost literally repeats MY TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION written for Oleg, they say, our wonderful developers invented such a wonderful ... (y-ops) application for iPhone.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I reacted stupidly. I listened to the Jeans to the end, turned off the radio, computer, soldering iron, telephone, bought a bucket of beer and plunged into the deepest three-month depression. It became clear why the text was recorded year, it became clear all these endless departures from the topic "when will I get a signed NDA?". Fuck the idea with ... published! God bless her with the idea. The idea is in the air, and I myself have nothing against others developing the ideas of others, because ultimately this is the essence of all development processes, this is the core of evolutionary development, and ultimately, we are reworking each other‚Äôs ideas, to make something of their own. But the dregs didn‚Äôt do anything of their own, they simply and brazenly appropriated the finished one and pass it off as their own achievements. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, by December, oklemavshis from shock. (</font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And that, unreal shock, let those unscrupulous people read it, because it is such a feeling that you carry your child for many months, and then they steal it from you in the maternity hospital and sell it to an unknown ‚ÄúMasha‚Äù, who herself is barren but enough secured and influential to give to the head physician and obstetrician for ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù. Here you have the image visible and relief, so that little does not seem. The female part of the audience, I believe, certainly understand.</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> )</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, after recovering from this event, I decided that my despondency was in vain. Partly because the business model invented by stupid rogues is clearly a dead end (I didn‚Äôt advertise that it would be a separate device, and in a smartphone format this kind of undertaking is not enough that it loses its charm, it is simply unrealizable due to the limited media and bandwidth, as well as the limited power resources (try to turn on the GPS for a couple of hours in your pocket gadget), except that you can make some cut-down tourist option or take money ‚Äúfor every street‚Äù, which you did, judging by all swindlers).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everything is practically ready for me and I just need to finish the nuances and finish with the site. With these thoughts, I sat down at the site in January and, having decided to ‚Äútake a horse by the horns‚Äù, refused to shovel someone else's code, rewrote everything from scratch ‚Äúas I need‚Äù, for one deciding a lot of questions implicitly related to the logic of device movements between rental points and organization work with partners. Slowly I finished the design and by the spring had assembled the first full test specimen. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8e/12f/dc6/f8e12fdc6466d8c8fc6a489aebbec186.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide.    ."><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All boards at once. From the first version to the final prototype. (Pay attention to the delay in the first device. This is in the view of the developer - GPS antenna.)</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> With In April of 2011, I went to Prague with the goal of finding retail partners and testing the finished device in field conditions. </font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first tests gave their results.</font></font></font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Found some technical flaws and poorly thought out nuances. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, nevertheless, it became clear that the pilot print run, in principle, can be collected. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What I do. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then a couple of surprises awaited me, however, against the background of all the previous upheavals, which seem to be quite insignificant. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e0/bca/898/1e0bca89815f239b60167fd53a281616.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide. GPS   ."><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some GPS modules and antennas tested during development.</font></font></i> <br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Part six, final. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A pair of spoons for the Czech comrades.</font></font></h2><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first is that a batch of cases ordered from the same notorious Czech intermediaries arrived on time (that is, less than two weeks after the order, which is almost instantaneous by Czech standards. Those who know will understand me. But the devil was in a snuff box. The order was brought by a courier, but instead of a standard invoice for transfer ... an invoice for payment in cash upon receipt of an added amount for ‚Äúthat bag.‚Äù That is, the guys must have been in financial difficulties and decided to make a deal with their own decency and force me into a hopeless situations about latit all their rubbish. With me, of course, the guys worked last time. Included in the blacklist. A letter to the parent company will be sent along with the purchase of the second batch.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second step is board manufacturers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, I am in the process of finding out that the best motherboard manufacturers in Eastern Europe are located, you won‚Äôt believe, in Tepro Moscow and Rezonite in St. Petersburg. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fast, high quality, inexpensive.</font></font> But there is one thing.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the idiotic modern laws that have a place in our vast, in order to expel these fees to foreign customers, we need a notorious license for foreign economic activity, which is extremely difficult to obtain, and as a result - the subject of a sickly corruption bar of nomenclature idlers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, about ordering a print run in Russia, paying it from my Czech account (I‚Äôll keep silent about the credit card), enter it in the accounting department and bring it all to Prague, could not speak. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Czech producers are a) almost three times more expensive b) are cumbersome and slow, like cats in a valerian.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Reluctantly" once again, I found a more or less suitable for the price of the manufacturer in Prague and ordered the board there. What was my surprise when it turned out that the entire print run under the net was printed on a 1.5 mm textolite (do not think, we discussed it all three times, we specially pronounced the specification). To hell with him, but the boards do not fit in the case! In general, I, being in earnestly annoyed by the situation and frankly angry, promised in the hearts of the director (who went out to talk on this occasion with the client personally), appealing to my many years of advertising and marketing experience, to make specials. Facebook page and radically eliminate the problem with the influx of customers for the next couple of months, talking about such a setup. And when I was ready to leave this establishment and move on to my competitors, I rememberedThat did not take the receipt of payment, all the costs, you can add to the accounting department. He returned and was stopped now, oh, a miracle, by a very friendly director with the question of how many boards I need and an offer to do everything at cost in the shortest possible time. In general, we agreed, shook hands, but the sediment remained, as they say.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c58/401/999/c5840199911f964f2217704d80912d56.jpg" alt="Prague Electronic Tour Guide.    "><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first board of the circulation. </font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meanwhile, the season was in full swing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already fully aware that in a rush nothing sensible will come out, and that it takes time to prepare all the promotional materials and agree with sub-partners to finally collect the circulation itself (I collected the first batch manually and I must say, I have done a lot of stuff in sealing SMD components with 0.2 mm foot pitch, I can work at a Chinese factory now (relevant emoticon)), I decided to postpone the launch for the next season. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This spring, I successfully found partners, screwed up quite insignificant but pleasant ‚Äúbows‚Äù to the firmware and launched my brainchild.</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Project "Prague Electronic Tour Guide", results </font></font></h2><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, we have: 8.5 hours of stories about Prague in six languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including, of course, Russian). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than 100 locations (more than a hundred! This is such a medium-sized book, if that). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nonlinear specially structured narration (hello to Borges and Jan Potocki).</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> one can walk almost throughout the central part + Vyshegrad + Prague Castle + Petrina and a bit of Andel, and even Zizkov did not stand aside. </font></font> And this is just the beginning.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In the next version ... well, I will not rush things and spread spoilers ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, it turned out a great thing for people who like to walk around the city themselves, alone or together, without tour guides and without being tied to maps with a pair of three standard ‚Äútourist‚Äù routes. You can go anywhere, a wonderful box will not just talk about what you see firsthand, but also suggest in which direction you can walk more. All this with role inserts and musical arrangement. I did it the way I would like to see it (hear it?) Myself. Because I can not stand group walks with memorized banal "carts", but I madly love to walk around unfamiliar cities, stopping from time to time in summer cafes to skip a glass or two, admire the architecture of the city, secretly watch its inhabitants, enjoy the warmth branchy streets,feel the real living spirit of the city (the genius of the place).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is a story. So you will be in Prague, well! (I will not give links to not fall under the sanctions, however, the search engine will help you). </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nb.

The text was written by me personally, sincerely from the first person. In addition to the understandable desire to talk about a large-scale undertaking (well, to boast a little), I would like to inspire my colleagues with my text to develop electronics and not be afraid to make new interesting ones, and let them, at first glance, complex and very heavy projects. Do not be afraid of the unknown!</font></font> Dare! <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PPS I wanted to publish the data of the aforementioned swindlers here and give references, but decided not to do this, partly so as not to mediate once again these people who were not burdened with honesty and decency. Moreover, in my case it will not help me in my business, but add to the crooks unnecessary references. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Instead, I would like to separately thank all my friends and my wife Olesya, who supported me all this time in a chorus, did not allow me to succumb to despondency in difficult moments, as well as everyone who, one way or another, was involved in the work on the project or simply helped with advice and simple human warmth and participation, and separately all the friends who unselfishly entered me in Prague (there should be one more relevant, but, alas, smiley forbidden in these places).</font></font> Thanks you!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I love you all! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, I am aware that this is only the beginning. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now it is necessary to engage in the marketing of this venture, which is a separate and, certainly, no less complex story. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, start thinking about the next version and other projects, postponed for the time being.</font></font><br><br>  Oh yes!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another special thanks to the person with the nickname dihalt, for initiating and making an excellent project easyelectronics.ru. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reading local articles and links to useful literature helped me right at the beginning! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">and do not hit the sneaker! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is my first post on Habra.</font></font><br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145956/</a></p>
