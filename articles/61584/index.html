  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"According to the old friendship - 2". If your friends and acquaintances take out your brain, then you can benefit from it.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost a year ago I wrote a post titled <a title="According to the old friendship - how friends and acquaintances endure the brain to business owners" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/37354/">‚ÄúFor Old Friendship‚Äù - how friends and acquaintances endure the brain to business owners</a> . <a title="According to the old friendship - how friends and acquaintances endure the brain to business owners" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/37354/">‚Äù</a>  Then in comments on Habr√© and in LJ there were many reviews on the topic.  As it turned out, the brain is carried out not only by business owners, but also by sysadmins, programmers, students-techies - many who are more or less connected with the computer field.  If you normally understand computers, you will definitely be asked to reinstall Windows, save it from viruses, advise what kind of laptop to buy so that it is ‚Äúthe best and cheapest‚Äù.  And if you respect people at least a little, then you will help them. <br><br>  At that time, almost immediately one idea was born, the realization of which we arrived at just now. <br><br>  I, as the owner of a computer store, pay salaries to managers for helping people make their choice and make a purchase.  It turns out about 1.5% of the purchase amount.  And if this work is performed by someone else for them, then this someone should receive this money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And this work is often essentially done for the buyer by his friend, an acquaintance, a sysadmin from work.  At the same time, it is not customary to take money for a little help from friends in Russia - such a conscience.  But getting money from a commercial organization is a sweet affair.

      So we came to the implementation of an offline affiliate program.  The scheme is simple: if you helped someone with a purchase in our store, you will receive a reward of 1.5% of the purchase price.  In the role of this "someone" can be your friends, acquaintances, colleagues, even clients and partners.  Purchase can be made out both on physical, and on the legal entity. <br><br>  On the part of the buyer, it turns out that it is more profitable to buy through you, because: <br><br>  - you have more confidence.  It is unlikely that you will vtyuhivat what is absolutely not necessary for a person.  After all, you still have to communicate with him after this.  And although normal stores usually do not like it, buyers are almost always sure of the opposite.  Therefore, through you, the buyer is somehow calmer. <br><br>  - rather, all of you will help the buyer with the first launch of the equipment after purchase. <br><br>  From the partner‚Äôs side it turns out that: <br><br>  - I would have to help with any advice, and compensation can be obtained for this. <br><br>  - Solves the ethical problem of obtaining money from friends and acquaintances.  Partner receives a reward from the store.  And the final buyer does not know that the partner receives a reward, unless he himself tells about it. <br><br>  - If you make a little effort, you can turn it into an additional source of income.  To do this, we supply partners with the necessary materials, such as business cards.  We even developed a <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app624875_-6472531">Vkontakte application</a> for this purpose.  There is also a <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club6472531">group</a> where there are already 12,000 people. <br><br>  - if the partner lives not in Moscow, not in Petersburg and not in Kaliningrad, and his affairs will go well, i.e.  he will do sales of at least $ 30K per month, then we will offer him to open his own online store in his city.  To do this, we will provide him with a website, supply channels, successful sales experience, advertising.  And the income will not be 1.5%, but much more.  This is your business already. <br><br>  And now a question for you, dear colleagues: whether it will be interesting to the IT community or not.  Interested in adequate criticism or approval. <br><br>  <strong>And more attention - competition!</strong>  Who will come up with how an affiliate program can be extended even to services and maintenance, to which a weighty prize is a portable hard disk worth up to 3000 rubles.  Model choose yourself.  You can take money :) The problem with the affiliate service is that if a person turned to a friend for protection against viruses, then he is unlikely to be willing to pay for it.  Most likely he wants to get a service for free.  Answers can be thrown to me in a personal, so that competitors do not read. <br><br>  I will answer some questions in advance in order not to answer them 10 times later: <br><br>  <strong>Why 1.5%, not 10% and not 20%?</strong>  Because the average margin of an online store selling electronics is 5-10%.  And from this money you need to pay the salary to managers, accountants, couriers, programmers, rent an office and still leave something to the owners.  Margin services can make more. <br><br>  <strong>You have only laptops on your site.</strong>  <strong>In my environment laptops are not bought so often that you can earn on it.</strong>  Yes, now only laptops.  Until the end of June, we will expand the range.  There will be monitors, printers, system units, TVs, etc.  So far, just do not have enough hands to put it on the site. <br><br>  <strong>I live in Moscow.</strong>  <strong>I will not order equipment from St. Petersburg for 1.5%.</strong>  Our store in Moscow should open within the next 3 weeks. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61584/</a></p>
