Hacker's Notes Part 1 of 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> We offer you a fascinating reading inspired by the posts of the past week in the life of Soviet hackers. <br>  A total of 5 issues are planned, depending on how the habrasoobschestvo perceive them. <br>  These stories were overheard on the Moscow-Peter train about six months ago, and told in a strong way by two friends traveling with me in the same compartment. <br>  I note right away, since we have not talked, and on the train we met for the first time in our life.  So all attempts to affiliate me with these two people are a dead idea, I had nothing to do with their actions, I don‚Äôt have, and I hope I won‚Äôt have, but the stories they told may be interesting to you. <br><br>  I will lead the story as if from my own face, so more convenient. <br>  All names are fictional and should not coincide with real ones, also colors are added for epochality. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, let's begin.

      Our first story is dated 97 year, the era of dial-ups and computer clubs.  I was still in school, and often, scoring lessons, my friend and I visited the Orki computer club, which was popular at the time.  If anyone remembers, at first it was located in the Oktyabrskaya metro area, then, after the landmark tax game in Diablo for 3 days, they moved to Shabolovskaya metro station.  That's where we headed.  On this day, although it didn‚Äôt bother us much, some Q2 championship was planned there, with a huge prize fund at that time, I don‚Äôt remember the amount. <br>  Actually, we paid a couple of hours and settled for computers.  These were cars with Win98 on board, and the entire network was a standard "workgroup."  At that time, there were about 100 computers there. It should be noted that they often hung up and gamers constantly rebooted them.  This, in particular, we decided to use for our own purposes. <br>  It turned out that it was quite easy to get to any computer from the working group through the network environment, if you specify something like C $ as balls, getting directly to the root of the system drive. <br>  Further, the matter of technology - we prescribe <br><br> <code>format c: /q /autotest &gt; null  autoexec.bat <br></code> <br>  and wait for the computer to hang so that it is rebooted.  Thus, in about 20 minutes of our paid hour, we tucked all the computers at the club.  What to do the remaining 40 minutes?  I must say that we were the only ones who played Q1 - everyone played Q2 and Starcraft, it seems.  As it turned out later, this played the most immediate dramatic role. <br>  In general, we got bored, and we decided to ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù the process.  Neighboring computers were empty, and we ourselves clicked on the reset. <br>  The players arrived.  They got new, free computers.  Surprisingly, they did not work!  The players called for help. <br><br>  Came caliper.  I stuck it for a long time, then took out some kind of a balloon because of the sinus.  We, to our shame, have never seen anything like this.  It turned out to be a cylinder of compressed air.  The caliper began to actively purge the entire computer, paying particular attention to the hard drive.  It cost us a tremendous effort not to lie. <br><br>  The problem began when our villainy went into the second phase, and, literally, seizing the moment when the caliper turned away, rebuilt the next car, right next to it.  They tried to do everything quietly, idiots. <br><br>  A massive epidemic began.  Calipers simply went nuts, watching as every minute a new and new computer failed. <br>  We realized that it was time to leave. <br>  A small lyrical digression - the local admin had a nickname Z. Type Zed. <br><br>  And now, the end of the story is near, we are approaching the exit from the club, and here, remembering the wonderful quote from Pulp Fiction, I speak quite loudly, addressing my friend: <br>  ‚ÄúZ's dead, baby.  Z's dead. " <br><br>  Already after 2 seconds, with the efforts of all the staff of the club, we found ourselves pressed to the wall in rather uncomfortable positions.  We were pushed into a corridor, held, shouted: "Who sent you ??". <br>  We could not understand from what they thought that someone sent us at all ... <br>  They decided that this is the machinations of competitors who wanted to thwart their championship.  We were escorted to some room where their admin was directly sitting.  By the time we were scared, do not forget, we were only in the 9th grade.  While the owner of the club was pretending to call the cops, he interrogated us, recognized the home phones, and called them to check if the numbers were real.  The time was already late, we should have returned home a long time ago, and imagine when my mother is at home in the evening, she receives a call asking: ‚ÄúHello, please Ivan to the phone‚Äù ... <br><br>  Admin figured out how we managed it.  It so happened that in the course of the demonstration we crashed into his car too.  Thank God, he turned out to be adequate and understood that our slogan ‚Äúwho is smarter than he is right‚Äù is not an empty phrase.  In short, we were able to agree on ‚Äúfixing the amount of damage‚Äù - the club was idle all night until the computers were restored, and the amount was something in the region of 300 bucks.  For us, schoolchildren, with 100 rubles a day for food a maximum, it was an incredible amount. <br><br>  However, the next day, we borrowed several killed hard drives from the computer science office at school, specifically WD Caviar, and gave them to Z'u in the morning, in the hope that he would not check them. <br>  The end. <br><br>  The following releases can wait for you: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/86887/">‚Äúan attack on the terminals of the largest computer hardware store in the Sovka region‚Äù</a> , ‚Äúa provider with frank advertising and a default snmp-community‚Äù, ‚Äúa provider who forgot to remove the demo.php file from the standard spaw delivery‚Äù, ‚Äúa small provincial provider and thunderstorm to order.
