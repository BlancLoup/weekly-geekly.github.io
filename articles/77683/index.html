      Ideas car, that's really work (so that work there - not childishly embroil) on their implementation, few people want. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now to the point. <br><br>  First, cook the loot.  No, not for me, but for hosting, experiments with advanced and runners, for beautiful design and programming.  In general, if you are not a "multi-station", then prepare the dough car, otherwise you will get pioneering (we will talk about attracting dough and resources from the side in the next issues). <br><br>  Imagine: you got a brilliant idea.  Suppose a certain site with interesting content, on which a ton of people has to come and forever zatusovat, which can be used for any services.  Or, we will not sell services to them, but we will show advertising.  Or even this: we will not show advertising, and we will not push services, but catch up and warm the crowd (well, the community or the community, as various specialists like to say), and then sell the project to Rambler, or another Runet megaportal that is bending down from incompetent management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecd/6c5/3b0/ecd6c53b06efe7a48e9b795b7480fc5a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Your project should in the future bring grandmother.  Directly or indirectly, immediately or slightly later.  If you have other plans, then you can not read further.  If there are insignificant glimmers of hope that your guano will be necessary and interesting to someone, go ahead: <br><br>  1. Cycle of product life, business plan and the actual start. <br>  Initially, assuming that one day your project will start earning, it makes sense to estimate the path to this happy moment on paper.  In this way, describe for yourself all the required expenses beforehand (see above about the loot) and the main functionality of the project. <br><br>  Also, do not miss such a thing as a target audience. <br>  Who are you making the product for?  How will you advertise it?  What budgets and actions are needed?  Think about it right away, for the quintessence of knowledge about your project creates a dozen interdependent "points of competence" that you must consider from the very beginning.  For example, if you are targeting young people from 15 to 20, then the design, interface, methods of promotion and advancement may be somewhat more awkward than the site with stock quotes. <br><br>  Next - the calculation of loads.  If you plan to post chats, forums, large amounts of data with regular samples, as well as other resource-intensive services, it makes sense to pre-charge for a separate car, so that at a critical moment of dramatic increase in attendance (God forbid you) you didn‚Äôt think what to do such an emergency, so as not to lose accumulated sweat and blood of visitors. <br><br>  Nota bene.  If there are adequate questions on the topic - there are contacts in the profile, I can advise in more detail and, basically, for free.  Only pliz without village leading questions - we tell you inside and out, your stupid projects I steal no sense no time, because  from my ideas the head already swells, but I will be glad to find competent or interested colleagues for the subsequent mutually beneficial exchange of traffic traffic (joke). <br><br>  To test the viability of an idea, you need to watch the competitors (and they will love it, you can be sure), or sometimes it makes sense to make a layout - a small site with a minimum of functionality that you show to friends and acquaintances to assess adequacy, and also catch up traffic through PPC and look return.  If a new ad site views more than one page, if an AdSence is done on 1000 hosts at least one and a half dollars a day, then it makes sense to engage in a project and build reasonable extrapolations in a business plan. <br><br>  Of course, when creating layouts, there is a certain risk that tomorrow, Microsoft will steal your precious idea and make a megaportal on its basis in two days.  Well, it means that you made a mistake in identifying niches and you had to invent a project that would be more profitable for Microsoft to buy, and it is for you, and not to do it from scratch. <br><br>  Something else I wanted to say, so soon will be more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77683/</a></p>
