      <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22226/">Presentation of the product, work with objections, completion of the transaction - part 2 of 4</a> <br><br>  As can be seen from the names of the previous parts, the basics have already been passed.  All stages of sales were dismantled and there were additional, but very significant questions for b2b, to which I will give answers in this part. <br><br><h4>  How to create a sales script </h4><br>  I will describe the general principles, but mainly focus on scripts for cold sales, since hot ones will be of little interest to banal ones because few people have a stream of incoming calls or an extensive customer base.  If suddenly there is someone who needs help with hot sales, you can <a href="https://vk.com/truba666">write me</a> - I will help for free, than I can. <br><br>  Many people think that the sales script is a set of rules that should be strictly followed, but this is not at all the case.  In fact, the sales script is the mass of your prepared responses to the client‚Äôs intended reactions. <br><br><h5>  Contact options </h5><br>  * have previously learned from the secretary the name of the director or another decision maker * <br><br><ul><li>  Simple greeting </li></ul><br>  <i>- Good afternoon, my name is Kim Sargsyan, a marketer of the video studio Videolom.</i>  <i>You can just Kim.</i>  <i>Vasily Ivanovich, right?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Yes, right.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Very nice, Vasily!</i>  <i>I call you to discuss the possibility of mutually beneficial cooperation.</i>  <i>Tell me, how much time can you give to our conversation?</i> <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> this is the driest and most inefficient method, but it is quite working and can be used in everyday life. <br><br><ul><li>  Statistical data </li></ul><br>  <i>- Good afternoon, my name is Kim Sargsyan, a marketer of the video studio Videolom.</i>  <i>We are committed to increasing sales of any business through video with a one-month payback period and we are the only ones who provide such services in the market.</i>  <i>Vasily Ivanovich, right?</i> <i><br></i> <br><ul><li>  Non-standard analogy </li></ul><br>  <i>- Good afternoon, my name is Kim Sargsyan, a marketer of the video studio Videolom.</i>  <i>We are committed to increasing the profits of people in your circle using selling video.</i>  <i>Our video was somehow called the seller of the year, but not requiring a salary.</i>  <i>Vasily Ivanovich, right?</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Beautiful cases </li></ul><br>  <i>- Good afternoon, my name is Kim Sargsyan, a marketer of the video studio Videolom.</i>  <i>We make selling video for business.</i>  <i>Google, Facebook, Uber are our customers this quarter.</i>  <i>Vasily Ivanovich, right?</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Demonstration of benefits </li></ul><br>  <i>- Good afternoon, Vasily Ivanovich.</i>  <i>My name is Kim Sargsyan, a marketer of the video studio Videolom.</i>  <i>We make a selling video, increasing sales of any business with a payback maximum of a month.</i>  <i>Due to the fact that the video works around the clock and seven days a week - it makes a profit when employees at the rate of rest.</i>  <i>If you are looking for sellers who do not need to pay a salary - you are our client (it is not necessary to specify the name, but it is desirable, but this is not always appropriate).</i> <br><br><h5>  Options for identifying needs </h5><br>  It is advisable to use open-ended questions.  For this, it is worth starting the question with the pronouns: <i>‚ÄúWho?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù</i> .  Actually, the options for questions that should be asked: <br><br>  <i>- What do you think about ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- As usual you ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Tell me, what is the reason that you ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What are the next steps?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What do we do?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What is our task?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- How do you feel about ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- How are you currently ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What do you mean by ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What can you get if ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- How did you come up with the idea ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What would you like to change in ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- How do buyers react to ...?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What are you doing to provide ...?</i> <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> before asking a question regarding the "kitchen" of your interlocutor (that is, any question) - be sure to substantiate your question: <br><br>  <i>- In order for me to find the ideal proposal for you, let me ask you a few questions / clarify some information ... * a very short pause, followed by your questions *.</i> <br><br>  Working with the same product, but with different clients, you will definitely notice that the problems of all are about the same.  Record and memorize every need of each client - so it will be easier for you to quickly understand what ‚Äúhurts‚Äù it is for the current interlocutor.  And do not forget about joining the client‚Äôs values: for his ears, you have similar problems with him, there was a ‚Äúsuch‚Äù situation;  Your opinions surprisingly coincide, and you completely agree with the client. <br><br><h5>  Options for product presentation </h5><br>  The presentation stage is closely connected with the stage of working out objections, therefore it is possible to concentrate the main attention at this stage.  Further similar principles will be used. <br><br>  * The property of your product + the prepared beginning for the presentation of benefits * <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt allows you to ...‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- It gives you ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúThanks to that, you can ...‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- With this you will get ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúFor you, this means ...‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Due to what you save ...</i> <br><br>  <b>It was:</b> <br><br>  <i>- We work directly with suppliers.</i> <br><br>  <b>It became:</b> <br><br>  <i>- We work directly with suppliers, so you save 12% on each purchase.</i>  <i>Thus, making an order for 100 thousand, you only pay 88 thousand.</i>  <i>For you, this means that with a monthly order for a year, you will save about 140 thousand rubles.</i>  <i>This saved amount is almost enough for another two, consider free shipments each year.</i> <br><br>  In addition, in order to demonstrate the benefits of your product to a client, you can also get rid of unnecessary problems in the future, by anticipating the most common objections. <br><br><ol><li>  Make a general list of objections (you still need it); </li><li>  Consider how many times you heard the objection; </li><li>  Form top objections, where you select 10% of the most common objections among your customers; </li><li>  Find the perfect argument for parrying this objection; </li><li>  Without waiting for objections from the client, you mention the problem yourself, immediately giving your perfect answer to it; </li></ol><br>  Thus, you simply take away from the client a chance to object to you, because there is no reason to object.  <b>Important:</b> Do not use this technique if you are going to voice a rare objection.  Otherwise, you will voice an objection that the client might not even have thought of. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><br>  <i>- I noticed that people usually say "I will think" in cases where they do not see a clear benefit for themselves.</i>  <i>If you do not see it, immediately tell me honestly about it.</i> <br><br>  What do we have specifically in this case?  The client will not just give you the most honest answer in the world (probably), but will say straightforwardly what exactly confuses him.  Thus, it will become much easier to repel an objection in the future. <br><br><h5>  How to work out the objections </h5><br>  The algorithm is very simple: <br><br><ul><li>  Listen to customer </li><li>  Partially agree (let the client understand that he is entitled to an opinion) </li><li>  Specify the reasons for objections </li><li>  Turn an implicit objection into a pronounced </li><li>  Parry the objection with your argument on the situation (more on this below) </li></ul><br><br>  <i>- Your prices are too high.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- I agree that our prices differ from the average in the market.</i>  <i>Tell me, I understand that you need some reasons and justification to pay that kind of money?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Of course.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Let me ask another question: suppose that with the price we settle the question - is there anything else that holds you back?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Probably not (if yes - find out what it is. It also happens that the customer‚Äôs demands are excessively high and he just doesn‚Äôt suit you, no matter how cool. Not everyone can sell everything, no matter how well you are able to sell).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Unlike other prices on the market, our price includes the attraction of video views on your YouTube channel, as well as the development of a personal image saver for your selling video.</i>  <i>All this allows in a short time to raise awareness of your brand.</i>  <i>Consequently, your profits increase, and you do not spend a penny of extra money.</i>  <i>What do you think?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Sounds good.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- I am glad that you like this option.</i>  <i>Tell me, are there any other questions that we should discuss?</i> <br><br>  <b>Or:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Listen to </li><li>  Partially agree </li><li>  Parry </li><li>  Switch attention </li></ul><br>  <i>- We are not interested in your offer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Of course, you have not yet seen the calculation of how much money the selling video will bring in the first month of work on your site.</i>  <i>Last month we received 5 new customers thanks to recommendations.</i>  <i>Would you recommend us if you didn‚Äôt find our services useful?</i>  <i>Of course no.</i>  <i>Tell me, what is the current conversion on your site?</i> <br><br>  <b>Or:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Listen to </li><li>  Parry </li><li>  Switch attention </li></ul><br>  <i>- We are already planning to order a video from another studio.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúOur scripts are developed using advanced research data in the field of neurobiology, which allows us to have the maximum impact on the target audience of our clients, who increase their income in the first month of our video on their websites.</i>  <i>Take a look at the latest works catalog ...</i> <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> I would not recommend using the latter option if the client is initially negatively disposed, since without emotional attachment (which is not there) you will only move away from the interlocutor. <br><br>  Record every objection of every client.  Memorize the objections and responses to them.  Simply put, the discharge of several hundred clients is simply inevitable, because I recommend using a less valuable contact base than the one that you will use as a result when you have a scheme with working out objections.  It will be better if for each objection you can find 3-5 answers with arguments of different ‚Äúforces‚Äù. <br><br>  A few tips in brief: <br><br><ol><li>  Record and memorize; </li><li>  Use the property-benefit rule in your answers, as in the product presentation; </li><li>  Do not try to focus only on logic: not every your answer should be logical, especially in cases when it comes to dealing with ‚Äúequal in rank‚Äù.  The stronger your position regarding the interlocutor, the less logical your arguments may be; </li><li>  If the client is very loyal, then use weak arguments first and then strong arguments.  At the end of the conversation, the strongest arguments; </li><li>  If the client is of medium loyalty, then first use the middle argument, then the weak one, and at the end the strongest; </li><li>  If the client is not set up loyally, then use the strongest argument at the very beginning, and then constantly intercept the initiative in order to twist the whole essence near this argument </li></ol><br><h5>  Options to complete the transaction </h5><br>  At what point is it time to lead the conversation to complete the transaction? <br><br><ul><li>  Verbal signs: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Perhaps it suits me.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Yes, I like it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- It suits me.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Why not.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Good offer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- I like your suggestion.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- This is exactly what you need.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Let's not waste time.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Billets to summarize: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Well, it remains only to issue a contract?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- We make out?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Well, persuaded?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- I understand that all the questions have already been discussed.</i>  <i>Send a contract?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Pay by bank transfer or cash?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- You send documents to the company or buy them as physical.</i>  <i>face?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Let's get down to work on this or early next week?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- How much time do you need to prepare the documents, what do you think?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What do you think, how quickly can you transfer money?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- What do you think, will you have time to pay by the end of the week?</i> <br><br><h4>  Let's sum up </h4><br><ol><li>  You come up with 5-10 options for making contact and use any of them to choose from; </li><li>  Create a list of typical needs and come up with 3-5 open questions that should allow you to determine the need of the client; </li><li>  Create a list of benefits that can cover the needs from the list in the second paragraph, use these benefits according to the situation, applying the ‚Äúproperty-benefit‚Äù bundle; </li><li>  Create a list of objections, come up with several options for arguments of different "power" for each objection from the list.  TOP objections (first 10%) can be used during product presentation to preempt future objections; </li><li>  Finish the transaction as soon as you feel that the client "inside yourself" already agrees.  Summarize the essence of the conversation, using your own or proposed language, incline to the target action.  I recommend creating a list of 10 options for completing the transaction that are relevant to your industry and testing each of them. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  How to get around secretary </h4><br>  Personally, I divide the methods into ‚Äúhonest‚Äù and ‚Äúcunning‚Äù.  The former imply the conviction of the secretary with the help of logic and arguments, and the latter - tricks and lies.  At once I will make a reservation that I prefer the second option, since it is more efficient (greater% of successful ‚Äúpasses‚Äù) and takes less time.  It is about the tricks I will tell.  For the most part, the secretaries ask to drop the offer to them by mail, and communication ends there.  By the way, if you ask to connect you with the right person and give something to him, it‚Äôs extremely rare for the secretary to really give something, not just make it, and if he gives it, the person you need will instantly forget about it. <br><br><h5>  How to find out the name of the decision maker </h5><br><ul><li>  You can pretend that you have already worked with the director and that you have another contract: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Tie me to the director, Vasily Petrovich *, invent any name *, we have another contract here.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Yes, a second (if you know the name) / Actually, his name is Gennady Petrovich.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Yes exactly.</i>  <i>Constantly forgetting.</i>  <i>Connect with Gennady Petrovich.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Now I will connect.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Pretend that the director himself wants to work with you: </li></ul><br>  <i>- My name is Kim Sargsyan, Videolom video studio.</i>  <i>Connect me with the director, we want to clarify the information in the contract that he sent us.</i>  <i>By the way, remind his name?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Yes of course.</i>  <i>His name is Gennady Petrovich.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Play a simple artist who works for the director on a personal basis: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Tie me with * the wrong name and middle name *.</i>  <i>He asked to contact him personally if we have any problems with the work that he assigned to us.</i> <br><br><h5>  How to contact the director if his name has already been clarified </h5><br><ul><li>  Pretend (if you need to pretend) to be a very important person to whom everyone must: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Link me to * the name of the director * and tell me that Kim Sargsyan calls him, he will understand.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  You can still pretend that your call is already waiting: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Gennady Petrovich is waiting for my call under contract No. 23123214, which we discussed yesterday.</i>  <i>Tie me to him, please.</i> <i><br></i> <br><ul><li>  Pretend that you have a serious conversation and that the director knows you: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Tie me to Gennady Petrovich, we have an important business with him.</i>  <i>Say that Kim Sargsyan is calling, he will understand.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Pretend a longtime friend of the director: </li></ul><br>  <i>- Link to Genka, we need to review working issues, he is aware.</i>  <i>Say that Kim is calling.</i> <br><br>  If you have your own blanks that work (all the blanks above work, I spent several thousand calls with these blanks) - write in a comment, many will be interested. <br><br>  <b>In the next part (4 of 4):</b> <br><br><ul><li>  36 common mistakes made by sales managers + solution to every mistake </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296826/</a></p>
