We are pleased to inform you that we have released a version of Nimbus Note for Windows, which will allow you to conduct full-fledged work with notes on your computer, as well as synchronize notes with other devices.  We already have applications for browsers, mobile devices and a web part, but we rightly thought that it was impossible to call this type of service full-fledged, without a normal desktop program, because, what would not be said, but working on the desktop with notes is much more convenient, than on any mobile device.  Work on the program was carried out for almost a year and its results can be seen under the cat. <br><br>  Download Nimbus Note - <a href="http://nimbus.everhelper.me/download.php">http://nimbus.everhelper.me/download.php</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/67b/315/58067b3154415f34d721ebc23334a7ec.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Functional editor </h5><br>  Our editor can have almost all functions that rely on any decent text editor, ranging from bullets and superscripts to superscripts to creating and editing tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/502/d7b/103/502d7b1034a8bc207f01220a96db4bf8.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Import Microsoft Word documents and txt files </h5><br>  Nimbus Note allows you to import Word documents and TXT files and work with them as with a regular note, that is, change text, insert pictures, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/68a/ab6/cac68aab6cc659d0c76cc9256c9f6273.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  High speed </h5><br>  The application for notes should be fast and this is an immutable rule.  The program can have a fantastically beautiful interface, but if it hangs while working, then it is unlikely anyone would be interested.  We have worked a lot to optimize the program and are rightly proud of the result.  The program was tested on accounts, where there were thousands of notes, and the size of the database exceeded gigabytes, but this was not felt at all at speed. <br><br><h5>  Smart Sync </h5><br>  Why wait until all the notes are downloaded, if only a specific one is needed?  That's right, no need.  The program has a phased synchronization, when first snippets of notes are downloaded, and only then their bodies with attached files and you can always select the desired note and download it out of turn.  And there are situations when, in principle, you do not need to download all the notes, even with pictures and attached files.  For such cases, we added a ‚Äúfast‚Äù sync, in which only the snippets of the notes, as well as their bodies, are downloaded, and the pictures and attached files are downloaded on request. <br><br><h5>  Syntax highlighting </h5><br>  A function (while in beta status), which we think Habr users will be interested in :) I think it‚Äôs not worth explaining its meaning, and so everything is clear on the screen.  You just need to select the desired piece of text and select Format as code block.  So far not many designs are supported, but over time we will improve. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc8/361/9aa/dc83619aab339678fc8789ba34a4fbbe.jpg" width="800" height="350" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Task list for each note </h5><br>  We did not work with tasks quite normally, but it was we who generally separated the tasks from the note.  For tasks we have a separate panel, where you can create as many tasks as you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bf/31d/d37/1bf31dd37aca43c0967243411722e917.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Search and Search Items </h5><br>  Search is conducted throughout the database, but you can also search in separate folders.  There are no tips yet, we hope to push them in the next version.  But there are Search Items, which allow you to keep a search history and at any time return to the desired results. <br>  The notes themselves have Search &amp; Replace, which performs the same functions as the good old Notepad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/995/d50/ba6995d50cf5d5653915c70d7562b8b4.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  ... and many other features </h5><br>  In addition to the above, there are many other pleasant features: full-fledged work with proxy servers, the ability to select the font for the list of folders and notes (who do not like default Tahoma), creating screenshots, support for hot keys, etc. <br><br>  This is the first version of the program and far from all the functions that were conceived (and are constantly thinking) implemented, but we hope that you will like everything.  At the moment, the program is available only in English, as the team is small and we don‚Äôt have enough hands for everything (this is certainly not an excuse), but nevertheless we will try to make Russian localization as soon as possible. <br><br>  If you find any bugs or need additional functions, please immediately report it. <br><br>  To work with the program you need an account in Nimbus Note, which can be created in just a minute, but if you want to just look at the program's work, then you can use a demo account - habratest@everhelper.me password: password </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211967/</a></p>
