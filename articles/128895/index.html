And if 1-2-3 credits intersect in time, it makes sense to try to use the remaining ‚Äúfree‚Äù funds with the greatest benefit. <br><br>  <i>For example</i> : ‚Äúhanging‚Äù mortgage, with the possibility of early repayment, reducing the total cost of the loan. <br>  Need to buy a car. <br>  Options: <br><ul><li>  Buy a car at once, without a loan </li><li>  Buy a car on credit, 50% of the initial installment, ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù by paying for a mortgage </li><li>  Buy a car on credit, 15% down payment, ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù for a mortgage </li></ul>  What will be cheaper, and how much? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>The second example</i> : hanging two loans, both with the possibility of early repayment.  The ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù money that I want to use for partial early repayment has arrived.  One loan is more debt, but the minimum early repayment, for example, only in quanta of 20 thousand each;  the second loan is unlimited, but the commission for early repayment is 5% of the amount contributed.  What is the best way to deposit early funds in these loans? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      <i>The third example</i> : promoted at work, income increased.  Already have a couple of loans, I want something else.  To estimate - the possible maximum additional credit, and the possible savings from using the increased income for repayment (subject to the limitations on early repayment). <br><br><h4>  Technique </h4><br>  The main method of calling and providing services: a site that allows you to make the above calculations without authorization, registration - saving data in the browser. <br><br>  If you wish, you can register (and explicitly confirm the storage of your personal data - hello, FZ), and transfer data from the browser, gaining access to a large range of functions - an accurate forecast of the moment of depositing funds, calculation <br>  optimal monthly amounts, email reminders, etc. <br><br><h4>  Initial data </h4><br>  Calculation uses the mathematics of calculating percentages of different types. <br><br>  Banks' programs are taken from the Yandex API for banks (deposits and loans), historical information on banks' offers is kept on time (so that you can easily add a loan on the time it is taken, without copying and studying each time paper), manually replenishing banks' special offers . <br><br>  The ability to fill in the exact conditions of the contract (in case of special conditions, for example, or the absence of a program in our history). <br><br>  The ability to fill in the contract by downloading an electronic copy (scan or doc / rtf / odt / docx) - automatic parsing of standard forms and human viewing (in cases of errors or ‚Äúextended‚Äù account). <br><br>  The possibility of correction on the basis of actual data (checks with an extract after depositing funds, a request from the bank of the current loan statement, etc.). <br><br><h3>  Monetization </h3><br><ul><li>  Targeting advertising.  The main clients of advertising are anti-collectors, assistance in obtaining loans, assistance in returning a commission, offers from banks, special programs for lending to banks. </li><li>  Secondary layer of advertising: advertising of goods on credit, corresponding to the solvency of the respective client and the chosen goal of the current / historical credit, without revealing the identity of the client. </li><li>  Special offers from / with banks.  Creation of offers for banks that match the client‚Äôs conditions, with a printout of the corresponding offer with a unique code confirming the creation under our partner agreement. </li><li>  Special offers from / with sellers of goods on credit. </li><li>  Paid telephone services. </li></ul><br><h4>  Satellite phone to Dill </h4><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  Mobile loan assistant / express financial advisor. <br><br><h5>  Implementation scheme </h5><br>  Call to the short number where the greeting ‚ÄúMultiple tell your region and location where you are, the purpose of the desired loan, the purchase amount, current monthly income, current payments on other loans, available documents confirming income, and we will send you an SMS with the most profitable proposals and a brief calculation of them. ‚Äù <br><br>  Call cost: ~ 100 rubles / minute (60% of users will be able to give everything they need in 2 minutes, 40% in 1 minute). <br><br>  The operator listens to the recording (and uses the history), drives it into the operator‚Äôs form on the site, receives the answer and sends it to the client using the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button.  The average time to process a request is 3-4 minutes. <br><br>  Second round: in response, you can send a number with the number of the desired result, and get a detailed description of the proposal.  The cost of one SMS is 25 rubles. <br><br>  The third option: a call to a short number with a cost of ~ 25 rubles per minute, processed by the operator ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù for the selection of parameters and additional specifications.  An ‚Äúinstant‚Äù operator response is required ‚Äî no more than one minute for the operator to wait.  The average processing time should be the same 3-4 minutes as ‚Äúuttered and received,‚Äù but the person should receive more detailed information.  The cost will be slightly higher, but the speed and accuracy of help is higher. <br><br>  Decryption of the request, offers and calculations are attached to this phone number. <br>  The subscriber, having authorized in the service (see above) sees his requests and offers.  In the future, using a call, he can receive detailed answers to his requests more precisely, since the operator will be able to use data from past requests. <br><br><h3>  Mobile applications </h3><br>  The mobile application will allow you to receive the same information through filling out the form in the phone (specially optimized form).  Monetization of the application goes through the display of relevant offers of banks and sales firms in response to requests.  Important: promotional offers must be clearly distinguishable from the answer system.  Ideally, the advertisement should be ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù through the generation of the bank‚Äôs proposal corresponding to the request - see monetization number 2 above.  Actually, the mobile application is just a modification of the site, ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for express use on the fly for those who know how to do it and / or do not want to call. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128895/</a></p>
