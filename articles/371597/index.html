All these unusual features were sold, as a rule, badly, but, according to marketing theories, they drew attention to more ordinary products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/354/c39/80f/354c3980f16c450883d02275f69a94ae.jpg"><br><br>  So it is, or not, but the situation in the consumer IT-market in recent years is such that there are neither funds nor human resources for extravagant solutions.  All companies need products that can be sold.  It is desirable huge circulation.  Because money is really very necessary.  Perhaps that is why at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2016 there were practically no new products made specifically to attract attention.  Well, except that with the exception of the Samsung refrigerator with a tablet integrated into one of the doors.  All the others clearly planned to please the buyer without intermediaries, right on the store shelf.  And Acer is no exception. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Acer traditionally shows the newest features in the Hard Rock Hotel, among rock and roll artifacts and popular culture.  Passing the costumes of The Beatles, the guitar of Johnny Cash and his favorite Elvis robe, you arrive in the secret room a little agitated.  Which, of course, on hand to the organizers of the show. <br><br>  New products, however, this time were relatively few.  Most recently, the next portion was presented at the IFA, and in general the arms race slowed down a bit, which makes it possible to successfully sell the models announced last year and even the year before last.  The performance margin even for quite budget devices is hefty, changing a laptop or tablet a year after buying has long ceased to be really necessary.  And that's what Acer found necessary to add to its range. <br><br>  My personal favorite is the monitor with the musical name XR342Ck (his portrait is in the post screen saver).  I myself have long switched to a model with a 21x9 aspect ratio.  At first it was very unusual, but now you can‚Äôt be lured to the standard 16x9.  It is very convenient to work on such a monitor - for example, it climbs three pages of Word in full size.  And in 21x9 games are simply superb.  A wide panorama not only pleases the eye and enhances the effect of presence, but also gives real advantages in the game. <br><br>  So, the XR342Ck is not only an IPS-screen of excellent quality with a diagonal of 34 inches and a resolution of 3440x1440 pixels, so it is also concave.  From close range, this is much more useful than from a couple of meters from which we usually watch TV.  It is even more pleasant to work with text.  There‚Äôs nothing to say about games and movies - after such a monitor you look at ordinary people as something archaic.  Like the old models with CRT. <br><br>  Honestly, I did not expect to like it that way.  And if it were not for the price in the region of 1190 dollars, I would seriously think about buying a home.  That is, of course, I still think about it now, but I understand with my head: the existing copy is still enough for my tasks, even if it is much simpler.  Acer XR342Ck is designed for fairly wealthy users who use the monitor professionally.  It does not matter whether it is about working with video, multi-window applications, or even about gaming in the name of earnings.  In March of this year, XR342Ck will arrive in Moscow. <br><br>  At the same time with the curved miracle Acer showed two monitors simpler.  The R1 is a thin (7 mm) and relatively inexpensive model with good color rendering and a USB-C port.  Screen diagonal can be 21.5, 23.8, 25 and 27 inches.  The resolution is the same for everyone, Full HD.  Price starts at around $ 150. <br><br>  For those who need something more serious, there is the Acer H7.  It has a more refined design, a diagonal of 25 or 27 inches, the resolution of IPS-matrices is 2560x1440 pixels.  There is also a USB-C port, without it in 2016, it seems, almost nothing will be released.  Good in all respects model, but for good, as usual, you have to pay.  It costs H7 from 500 dollars.  Honestly, it is quite difficult to get used to what Acer does not only budget monitors.  But they turn out well. <br><br>  The development of the Aspire Switch hybrid tablet line continues.  At CES, they brought a model Switch 12 S with a screen diagonal of 12.5 inches.  By default, the resolution of the latter is 1920x1080 pixels, but you can also choose a model with a 4K screen equipped with a Gorilla Glass 4 coating. I don‚Äôt really understand why I need 4K on a 12-inch screen, but wealthy people with eagle vision will probably explain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a4/8f6/f05/1a48f6f0545f4f8585c0765dc134f610.jpg"><br><br>  The assembled Switch 12 S is very similar to a small ultrabook.  And, in general, such is.  The power reserve of the new generation of the Core M family is more than enough for work and games (the 6xxx models used in the Switch 12 S have confused some of the media that called them the sixth generation. In fact, this is the second incarnation for Core M).  You can choose the amount of RAM 4 or 8 GB, as well as the capacity of SSD 128 or 256 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95a/98e/f14/95a98ef14be9466fb6390b59ff3b06f5.jpg"><br><br>  All major components are in the tablet part, which weighs 800 grams and is completely autonomous.  So, unfastening the keyboard, you get a real tablet.  A bit ... special, on Windows 10. But he taught everything necessary.  The thickness of the tablet part 7.85 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/a0b/1a5/75da0b1a52c74b249dd0803034a4fda3.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0f/584/1d8/e0f5841d8d6f417bb2b2778a380f27de.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/961/a7d/fc7/961a7dfc70d2428cbdf14bf6264e7f0e.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard, in addition to 600 grams of weight, adds two USB 3.0 ports.  Also, despite the compactness, the new ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù found a place for the Intel RealSense R200 3D camera and the Thunderbolt 3 port. And - of course - it was not without a USB 3.1 Type-C. <br>  Pleased with massive gold contacts at the junction of the tablet with the keyboard.  It is immediately obvious - it is done solidly, the data will go back and forth quickly, reliably, and nothing will oxidize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6b/68f/3fc/a6b68f3fc1474665a8164fda389adde7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cc/1a5/0d4/5cc1a50d4205447cae065b30dcd6c794.jpg"><br><br>  About the battery life in press releases is not written, it must be checked already on the serial sample, when he gets to Russia.  Most likely, everything is normal with autonomy, Core M eats a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f9/11a/e06/3f911ae065774ecc99be3b81d9ca78d3.jpg"><br><br>  The price of the tablet is quite reasonable, from $ 1,000 for the basic configuration (4/128 / FullHD).  Like Microsoft Surface Pro 4. For Russia, this, however, means at least 80,000 rubles, but this is not Acer like that, life like that. <br><br>  For fans of savings, Acer offers the new Iconia One 8 tablet on Android.  That's where everything is cute and modest: a gigabyte of RAM, 16 GB of onboard flash plus a microSD card up to 128 GB, an 8-inch screen with HD resolution and an unnamed 4-core Mediatek processor.  Simple, but it works.  And even the IPS matrix.  For a hundred dollars, it‚Äôs quite an option to be torn to pieces by children, mother-in-law, and other people ruthless to gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/342/bb4/5c7/342bb45c7c9c44bcb10015113dad87cc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66b/818/68b/66b81868b4b24d1792aa5378c30d1261.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a01/dfc/ebc/a01dfcebce0540aaa976618580b302b9.jpg"><br><br>  Hrombuki in Russia take root hardly, but in the States and Europe they are quite popular because of the very affordable price.  It is possible that our computers on the Google platform will come into vogue for the same reason.  Acer began to make products on Chrome OS one of the first, and continues successfully so far.  Acer Chromebook 11 with a 11.6-inch screen (frosted!) Arrived at CES, weighing a little more than a kilogram and working from a battery for 9 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9e/a48/fec/f9ea48fec6654eef9b0583629db58464.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70a/740/f34/70a740f34b734d2f9846b5d72dfd4591.jpg"><br><br>  The resolution of the matrix, however, is not very, very much - 1366x768, but with such a diagonal is normal.  In general, a chromabook is an excellent working machine, and its only weak point is the constant need for high-quality Internet.  Otherwise, well, quite a bit.  Therefore, on a journey I would not take a Chromebook.  And for the house - very much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82b/095/28a/82b09528ae874265a3909c1343f6985a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b4/7ec/660/0b47ec6606d34638afe6165916b6a54b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da6/5cb/2e5/da65cb2e5c77405396ac5d9431deba31.jpg"><br><br>  I wonder how different the price of Acer Chromebook 11 for the States and Europe: 180 dollars and 329 euros.  None other than on the home market Google coolly subsidizes.  I wonder how much it will cost in Russia (I‚Äôm prompted here that the American version will be more simplified, and the right European one will be brought to us. With the same price). <br><br>  And for sweets - about the new gaming laptops Aspire V Nitro Black Edition.  There will be two versions - with 15-and 17-inch screens.  In hardware, they are almost identical, the only question is in usage models.  15-inch can still be carried, and about the older - not at all sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94e/611/353/94e61135356d439d9002809cfbf2bbf0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97c/0fe/073/97c0fe07341d442d9d28f5a89517e149.jpg"><br><br>  As befits a gaming laptop, the iron in it was a serious one.  Intel Core 6 processors, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M graphics with 4 GB GDDR5 own memory, fast SSDs with NVMe PCIe interface.  The highlight of laptops is the Intel RealSense camera, suitable in this case not only for Windows 10 authentication or gesture control, but also for creating 3D models of your own physiognomy for further use as a game avatar.  It is, of course, self-indulgence, but since a laptop is bought for games, let everything be in it as it should. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/185/10a/f15/18510af159a64d53ac1ed25bffae8300.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/242/633/705/24263370521a41e2b7ea5a134c5530ad.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the press release says that the laptop has an especially powerful Wi-Fi antenna that provides minimal ping even in places where the signal penetrates with difficulty.  But for real gamers, who despise everything wireless, there is an Ethernet port, which has long been successfully eliminated in laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dd/73d/37e/5dd73d37eab340858d81c37a13b6a1f6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3b/d91/3d1/e3bd913d13a843e483114cc79b0ad1d9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/153/697/f90/153697f90c274b1e80f0fb174574dce3.jpg"><br><br>  Despite its power, the Aspire V Nitro Black Edition will cost from $ 1099, only a little more than Switch 12 S. That‚Äôs what it means to have a lot of space, and there‚Äôs no need to pack everything too tightly.  Immediately save both for the manufacturer and for the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cac/011/5bd/cac0115bdb4d499789c433a4d16f2419.jpg"><br><br>  I repeat: Acer has some new products this year.  Of course, compared to some other manufacturers that have announced new colors and names at CES, this is just some kind of abundance.  But compared to previous years, modestly.  On the other hand, last year there were enough announcements - both at the exhibitions and between them.  There are a lot of goods.  Good <br><br>  So let us raise our glasses so that in the new year we always have enough money for everything that we like. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371597/</a></p>
