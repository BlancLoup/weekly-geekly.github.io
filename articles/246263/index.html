Most companies have websites, but only a few use all their opportunities to increase sales and increase revenue.  And this is annoying, because a lot of time and money are invested in the site, and in order for the site to remain relevant, you have to work a lot. <br><br>  Fortunately, there are a few relatively simple things that you can do to help your website attract and retain customers, as well as increase sales, revenue and customer loyalty.  These steps do not require hundreds of thousands of dollars in investments, but small companies and corporations can take them. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/246263/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b1/ee2/04c/7b1ee204c9c546dbbddd1752cd3ac570.jpg"></a>

      We in <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D5_website_tweaks">Alconost</a> translated these tips for you and even added a few words from ourselves in the comments.  True, the figures of the projected sales growth indicated by the author for each of the tips seemed to us insufficiently substantiated - but the point is not in them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. Add a video </h4><br>  Customers love the video.  What are you waiting for? <br><br>  Our brain processes visual information 60 thousand times faster than textual.  So give up wordy descriptions of products in favor of video content that your site visitors could interact with.  Landing page videos can <a href="http://blog.wishpond.com/post/70300587846/10-reasons-visual-content-will-dominate-2014">increase conversion</a> by 86%.  At the same time, 44% of customers <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2014/25578/consumer-psychology-and-the-e-commerce-checkout-infographic">make more purchases</a> on the site with informative videos.  And these figures are only growing. <br><br>  On video sites, customers also tend to spend more time, and that's not all: customers are more likely to return to such sites.  Involving product videos, customer reviews, and even a video tour of your workspace can help increase conversions. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note.</i>  <i>As they say, it's better to see once.</i>  <i>Therefore, we propose to evaluate the remaining arguments in favor of using videos in this video:</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/120628048" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Possible perspective:</b> sales growth up to 86%. <br><br><h4>  2. Go beyond one culture </h4><br>  If the content of your site is offered only in English, you do not use as much as 2/3 of its <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2014/25549/four-ways-to-give-your-website-that-local-flavor-all-over-the-world">marketing potential</a> .  By making the site accessible to a multilingual - and multi-cultural - audience, you will get a chance to increase your market share by doubling the demand. <br><br>  Choose a translation management system that can be integrated into your website.  This is much more efficient than manual translation, which often requires lengthy correspondence with translators.  New translation services simplify the implementation of translated text and site management in the long term. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note.</i>  <i>We also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/214567/">work with cloud platforms</a> , simplifying the life of the client as much as possible.</i>  <i>For example, we have automated the delivery of texts from the client and sending them finished lines using the cloud platform File API.</i>  <i>A ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù is taken over by a personal manager: he organizes communication with translators, quality control and deadlines.</i> <br><br>  In addition to translation, it is important to pay attention to the differences in cultural characteristics of markets.  Make sure that you do not allow the <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705364808/Color-meanings-can-be-lost-and-found-in-translation.html%3Fpg%3Dall">same blunders as Pepsi, for example,</a> whose light blue gamma of branding has cut off the entire market, whose customers associated this color with death.  Having made your website international, you open a whole world of new opportunities for your business, and literally. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note.</i>  <i>By the way, this is why, when preparing a site for a foreign audience, it is more correct to speak not so much about translation as about localization.</i>  <i>It includes both translation itself and content adaptation: data formats, national codings, currencies, and so on.</i> <br><br>  <b>Possible perspective:</b> sales growth up to 200%. <br><br><h4>  3. Warn lags </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f2/5a1/80b/3f25a180b9d741c49ab3a857395f18d3.jpg"><br><br>  On Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday, users of the whole world <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/26/5245008/amazon-sees-prime-spike-in-2013-holiday-season">bought 36.8 million units of goods on Amazon on the</a> <i>first working day at the beginning of the Christmas sales season</i> .  Minute "brakes" could cost the company a tidy sum;  similar to your site.  If the site does not load quickly enough, you can lose customers before they even look at the products.  In fact, <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232003">57% of visitors leave the site</a> if it takes more than 3 seconds to load it.  It is important that the site easily adapts to the high load, since 24% of respondents called the slow loading of the site the reason why they abandoned their virtual baskets with unpaid purchases. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note.</i>  <i>We at <a href="http://alconost.com/services/video-production/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D5_website_tweaks">Alconost</a> made a whole video about how much a second of waiting on the Internet actually costs:</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/120628047" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Take care of site scalability to get rid of slow loading and lags.  As a result, customers will linger on your site, not because it takes a long time to load, but in order to make more purchases. <br><br>  Make sure your site is located on a flexible cloud platform, which allows the site to operate even on peak traffic.  And do not forget to frequently test the speed of loading pages on the site using <a href="http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google</a> . <br><br>  <b>Possible perspective:</b> sales growth by 24%. <br><br><h4>  4. Use responsive design </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/16/cell-internet-use-2013/">Most customers</a> visit sites from more than one device.  Use responsive website interface design to visit and use it conveniently from any device.  <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/12/mobile-commerce-sales-to-top-100-billion-in-2014-forrester-estimates/">This year it</a> is expected that <a href="http://recode.net/2014/05/12/mobile-commerce-sales-to-top-100-billion-in-2014-forrester-estimates/">29% of all electronic transactions</a> will be carried out from a mobile device or tablet.  Adaptive design allows you to take advantage of this type of sales, as well as simplifies <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/4-seo-benefits-responsive-web-design/92807/">search engine promotion</a> and site database management. <br><br>  Make sure you use a modern content management platform, such as WordPress or Drupal, which makes it easier to set up a responsive design.  Still in doubt?  Consider that responsive design is not just different sizes of windows and screens.  This is a tool that will make your website in demand in the future on new devices, the popularity of which, in accordance with the concept of " <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/25/what-is-the-internet-of-things">Internet of things</a> ", is gaining momentum. <br><br>  <i>Translator's note.</i>  <i>Practical tips on responsive design and layout methods are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/232991/">in this article</a> .</i> <br><br>  <b>Possible perspective:</b> sales growth of 29%. <br><br><h4>  5. Post customer reviews </h4><br>  For visitors to the site to go all the way to the purchase, the site content must have this.  And one of the most important things about this content is the feedback from your customers.  Why?  Get acquainted with the experience of the service <a href="http://www.angieslist.com/">Angie's List</a> : it is based on the idea that when looking for reliable suppliers, people trust the opinions of their friends and acquaintances. <br><br>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/21/70-percent-brand-recommendations-friends/">According to Forrester Research</a> , relative to the brand, customers trust the recommendations of friends in 70% of cases, and advertising - only in 10% of cases.  Customer reviews on the site act as a kind of friendly recommendation.  If there are customer reviews on your site, you can expect an <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234110">18% increase in online sales</a> . <br><br>  <b>Possible perspective:</b> sales growth by 18%. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The improvements described above can significantly help you achieve your ultimate business goals.  Do not be afraid to try new methods and techniques to make the content more attractive, and the site is more profitable.  But the most important thing to remember is, in fact, your client.  Making your website as accessible as possible is the key to sales success and revenue growth. <br><br>  We are confident that some habrayuders can confirm the effectiveness of the soviets, and some - to put their benefit into question.
