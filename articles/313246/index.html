      Is it possible? <br><br>  Usually not, but not today.  This is not a sale, but a kind of social experiment.  How long will this last?  We do not know.  But if you are honest with us - as long as possible.  In any case, I would not postpone the decision on renting a brand server with a guaranteed channel and magic support for tomorrow, they can end up today.  This is not a thousand, or even hundreds, the first batch is just dozens, and some configurations are few. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/684/bbc/ff4684bbc4094db0a823d29549e36a6b.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, we are a hosting provider providing rental services of dedicated servers mainly in the Netherlands.  And unlike the CIS region in the Netherlands, it is customary not only to sign, but also fulfill long-term obligations.  Thanks to this, the service can be made much cheaper, since the service provider has more or less clear logistics for the purchase of the following equipment lots and expansion of the data center infrastructure.  The larger the batch and the smaller the final idle time, the faster the occupancy of free data center modules - the lower the cost. <br><br>  And the price difference can be quite significant.  After all, when we are confident that the subscriber, even with a monthly payment, will not abandon the service during the year - we can safely plan a development plan, taking into account only the dynamics of new orders, as the probabilities of refusals become more predictable. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Ukraine and Russia love pieces of paper (unlike Europe, where contracts have already acquired electronic form for a long time), to achieve execution of what is written on them, in most cases it is simply impossible, or more expensive, than to write off this debt.  It is for this reason that foreign data centers never conclude any serious contracts with customers from the CIS market without providing additional guarantees, which often significantly affect the marginality of the final offer. <br><br>  We have been criticized for a long time because we do not want to give a price at the level of competitors, that not everyone needs our support (yeah, of course, on this point we will prepare a separate publication and arrange a public dispute), that someone has automated the project and the price is more important.  What's better with competitors ... <br><br>  Having studied the question thoroughly, we realized that it was not so better.  It turns out that most of these ‚Äútasty‚Äù offers, even from such major providers as OVH, often do not contain a RAID controller, servers are assembled from components from different suppliers and are far from the first freshness, but really effective solutions are not much cheaper than ours.  There is no support!  Automation, of course, sounds cool, but how many companies ordering infrastructure can afford it?  Especially when the server of a large enterprise is unavailable, automation will save little.  Most of the software does not know how to instantly migrate from server to server and not everyone needs fault-tolerant clusters, not everyone has the money for them, for many it‚Äôs important that the engineer just come up and restore the server‚Äôs work.  And not all parameters can be tracked automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/e40/2f9/fb4e402f96234281a52f320d345f068a.jpg"><br><br>  But now let us dwell on how all these low-cost people like to use the technical ignorance of people.  This is of course a topic for a separate article, where we will uncover the pitfalls of the "competitors", conducting real synthetic tests of their equipment on various applications and compare them with our solutions.  But today we will stop at one moment.  Just to understand what it is all about. <br><br>  For example, one of our clients, who rents a certain number of servers exclusively for the business segment working with 1C, showed the importance of the battery.  Not everyone thinks about the importance of the BBU and the raid controller as a whole.  But it affects the performance, and very significantly!  Just think, you are renting a server, it seems, and with a raid controller, but with a non-working battery (BBU) - well, you did not check the server in the data center for you 100% upon issue.  You rented and also did not attend to this issue. <br><br>  What are the results?  Drop in performance up to 10 times!  On order!  Only because of a dead battery!  And this is not fiction, but real test results.  Array performance drops to rebuild performance. <br><br>  Did you suspect such a "contribution", only from the battery? <br><br>  Well, now imagine how inefficient can be servers with beautiful RAM / CPU numbers and without a good raid controller in general or with a controller, but with certain ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the controller or drives that make a seemingly productive server into an inefficient solution?  No, of course, in some unique tests, with a mode of operation that is possible only for some small% of clients, there is an advantage in these low-cost offers, but there is only one thing - price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c99/d97/708/c99d977085724ecd90f8a540924f6fa2.jpg"><br><br>  Nevertheless, we decided to try to correct this moment as well.  Brought down the price.  For a while, not forever.  But for those who have time to take advantage of the offer, the price will be valid for the entire rental period. <br><br>  And now, when you provide a long-term lease guarantee (for at least 1 year), we can offer you DELL brand servers in the Netherlands, even with new processors, at minimum prices: <br><br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ade/38b/b59/ade38bb59c224deb82e5d85ea5dd0c49.png"></a> <br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81d/a37/dd8/81da37dd8d694b2ca03e0fed4cdf55fa.png"></a> <br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/635/bd5/b06/635bd5b0698a478ab2bb24e45f9afa16.png"></a> <br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/533/610/a1c/533610a1c3cd43f3b4b7264adef2ec40.png"></a> <br><br>  Need something in between?  Have you got rid of prejudice?  Not necessarily the latest processor, but a good amount of RAM, high-quality drives and a raid controller?  You are welcome!  Brand servers from HP! <br><br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/084/a9b/e7d/084a9be7d34d43628c8ed97e412dbcec.png"></a> <br> <a href="https://www.ua-hosting.company/servers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/28d/a77/c8128da77b4747f9bb53454b190022c3.png"></a> <br><br>  In this case, all we will not ask you to engage in paperwork.  As mentioned above, in our countries, such a guarantee does not mean anything.  The most reliable - payment solutions for the long term (this you insure yourself, as the price is 100% fixed for the payment period). <br><br>  <b>But what about those who have no money to pay for the server immediately for a year?</b>  <b>What other performance guarantees can be?</b> <br><br>  We are ready to provide the following options: <br><br>  - payment by installments (terms and amounts of payments are considered individually in each case); <br>  - for customers who are already renting some kind of infrastructure with a long-term payment - the ability to pay monthly, without additional prepayments and cost increases; <br>  - the ability to pay monthly, but at a slightly higher cost, or at the same cost (if you provide any other guarantees on your part). <br><br>  We are open to dialogue and ready to go to meet everyone.  Write and the solution is sure to be found! <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, I would like to conduct a survey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89e/2b5/f1e/89e2b5f1e16ce094c0264c5fedf06963.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313246/</a></p>
