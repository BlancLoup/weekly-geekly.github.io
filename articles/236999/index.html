Motivated traffic - the concept is quite clear, but you can find many and different interpretations on the network.  The purpose of this article is to streamline this information and answer the question: how can motivated traffic be used to reduce the budget of advertising campaigns and increase the customer base.  Welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The shortest definition can be formulated as follows: <br><blockquote>  Motivated traffic (motivational traffic) is a tool to attract users in the digital industry, based on user rewards for actions performed. </blockquote><br><h4>  The essence of motivated traffic </h4><br>  The essence of motivated traffic is to reward the user for any actions regarding your product, service or website, for example: <br><br><ul><li>  finding a site in search and transition from issuing </li><li>  browsing the site with a specified time interval </li><li>  placement of product reviews or services </li><li>  use of social buttons in relation to content (likes, ‚Äútell friends‚Äù) </li><li>  view commercial </li><li>  installation of a mobile application </li><li>  and etc. </li></ul><br>  Here you need to immediately clarify that motivated traffic is very different and, accordingly, the remuneration does not necessarily imply a payment of cash.  Earned funds can also be issued in the form of votes in a social network, various game currencies are converted, etc. - however, the method of reward for the actions performed is stipulated in advance in the conditions of use of the service.  However, most often users consider such activity as additional income for themselves, and the money earned is withdrawn using WebMoney, PayPal and other payment systems.

It is also called a cash back (cash back), it is also motivational traffic or advertising.  But for a wide audience it would be incorrect not to give a brief definition here: <br><br><blockquote>  Motivated traffic is traffic that is attracted through the user payment system for actions performed on the Internet.  The principle is similar to CPC, CPA or CPL - pay per click, registration or action, but without intermediaries.  Motivated traffic is attracting motivated employees to your site who will perform the actions you need from users. </blockquote><br>  In this case, guaranteed and final are: <br><ul><li>  completed actions </li><li>  payment for the actions performed </li></ul><br>  With all the simplicity of the solution, site owners in most cases cannot create motivated traffic on their website in the necessary industrial volumes, so they turn to specialized services like <a href="https://profittask.com/ru/">ProfitTask</a> , <a href="http://socialtask.ru/">SocialTask</a> and similar systems in their principle.  Simplifying it, it sounds like this: do you need registrations and leads?  - That way! <br><br><h4>  The main types of motivational traffic </h4><br>  User traffic is the most modern kind of motivational traffic, the demand for which has arisen in connection with the development of analytics and methods for controlling spam on the Internet.  Ordinary Internet users, usually sorted by gender, age and geo-targeting, receive tasks, which are then performed under the control of the task distribution system and moderators.  This type of traffic is natural and can be used as a means of increasing ROI. <br><br>  Robotic traffic - had spread for various kinds of ‚Äúcheating‚Äù in the era of ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù and sunk more or less ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù Internet.  There is to this day, it is significantly cheaper than user traffic, but it carries enormous risks of detecting the fact of markups and is not recommended as a means of increasing ROI for digital resources in modern conditions. <br><br><h4>  How do advertising offers work? </h4><br>  Ofer is one of the basic concepts of motivational traffic.  As the name implies, this is the final offer for the user to go to the customer‚Äôs site, which in this case is called the advertiser and perform a certain action or series of actions for a fee.  The remuneration is transferred if the job distribution system and moderators accept its correct execution. <br><br><h4>  How is motivational traffic used? </h4><br>  <b>For startups:</b> motivational traffic can be a relatively easy replacement for banner advertising and other advertising tools that require a certain advertising budget, usually several times higher than the cost of campaigns to attract motivational traffic. <br><br>  <b>For applications:</b> among developers it is considered that a good and popular application will be downloaded and so.  However, in conditions when applications enter the market every day in batches, this picture is smeared.  User motivational traffic can be used as a way to draw attention to the application in this case as part of guerrilla marketing. <br><br>  <b>Guerrilla promotions:</b> here the use of motivational traffic is limited only by the framework of legislation.  You can attract increased attention to promotions, links, profiles and other advertising tools. <br><br>  One of the tangible benefits of motivational traffic, I believe, is that it allows development teams with a fairly limited budget and without basic knowledge in advertising and product positioning to draw attention to their product. <br><br>  Also, as a way to cut the advertising budget in the event that I would like to focus more on the development.  In principle, this is good news: the modern Internet makes it possible to start, if not completely from scratch, then, nevertheless, ‚Äúalmost‚Äù. <br><br>  In the event that a product or service after the first ‚Äúpush‚Äù receives an audience response and is supported, from the next round you can begin to attract more serious and heavy advertising mechanisms that require a budget both for the relevant specialist and for their implementation.  We will talk about this in the following articles of our ‚ÄúInternet dictionary‚Äù cycle: subscribe to our hub, we will find something else to tell about! <br><br>  For advertising: ALTWeb Group presents a <a href="https://profittask.com/ru/">ProfitTask</a> solution for managing motivated traffic.  In ProfitTask, you can specify the necessary sequence of actions and the necessary types of tasks - for the type of motivational activity that you currently need. <br><br>  <b>More on the topic:</b> <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Motivational traffic</a> , Wikipedia <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">Guerrilla Marketing (Guerilla Marketing)</a> , Wikipedia <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_Per_Action">CPA, Wikipedia</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/understanding-cost-per-click-and-cost-per-action-for-mobile-ads/">TechRepublic CPA and CPC Article</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdMaI2UW7fbA">Video: Motivational traffic and CPA networks</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236999/</a></p>
