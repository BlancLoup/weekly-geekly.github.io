  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the USB-Lightning Transcend JetDrive Go 300K flash drive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, GeekTimes!</b>  How many times has the question of the need for memory expansion for Apple devices?  External hard drives helped more than one thousand iMac and MacBook users, and iPhone and iPad users continue their ordeals.  Traditionally, Transcend showed interest in this niche, and once again pleased with the new product - JetDrive Go 300K.  Lightning + USB 3.1 - nowhere fresh that in performance and ease of use?  At the same time, I already had a flash drive from Leef - Bridge for 16 gigabytes - was it not wasted money?  Read under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/279396/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b3/e37/9ad/8b3e379ad4374ae7a479f894ef3d7293.jpg"><br></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the millionth time I will write a commonplace: ‚Äúthe theater begins with a hanger, and the product begins with the packaging‚Äù.  The product from Transcend stands out from the series of simple plastic blisters - cardboard packaging with a transparent window, in which the flash drive is visible.  I will not paint what exactly is put on the cardboard - buy and read it yourself.  On the back of the box there is a QR code - scanned - a page was opened in the AppStore - downloaded proprietary software.  Without it, nothing will work.  However, more on that below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff8/84a/b61/ff884ab6132644fbad3420c717d620a0.jpg">

      The main thing that interests the buyer is the volume and speed (it is declared to be read at 130 MB / s). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7e/1da/e25/c7e1dae254314d86a64d251607ee24d4.jpg"><br><br>  The device specifications are listed in the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/281/50b/4bf/28150b4bfd8940b2ae44f57c2d5df30c.png"><br><br>  I have the youngest version of flash drives, there are another 64 and 128 gigabytes, but there should be no differences in the speed of work. <br><br>  Externally, the flash drive makes a very apple impression.  Aluminum housing and two color options, almost matching the color of smartphones and tablets from Cupertino.  It will look great with the Apple gadget, but be careful about% username%, watch out for plastic caps.  Unfortunately, they are not tied to the case of the flash drive, and therefore they can easily get lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49d/880/e23/49d880e23fb04229aa6cd9b663809c56.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/52a/97a/af352a97ae4642c8ace869f2707fe1eb.jpg"><br><br>  The flash drive itself contains data on the volume, the Transcend logo and several marks on certification according to different standards.  Nothing superfluous, and nowhere to write poems on a small device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/c0b/80a/640c0b80a5084bb186d28b86c7d8d3eb.jpg"><br><br>  Well, now to the comparison and understanding of the meaninglessness of being.  Here is my "former" and the current flash drive next.  Obviously, transcend is smaller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36b/600/6f8/36b6006f8d924693b338fe074288eea8.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the Leef at that time was convenient and compact, and monolithic, but progress does not stand still.  IMHO, it is much more convenient to put the phone on a stand, or to hold it in your hands when the horn does not stick out from behind, like the best representatives of fabulous animals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35e/d22/a12/35ed22a12a67483f813aa56af16ecac3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/ff3/468/ba3ff34687b34dd58a31527e3200a8fc.jpg"><br><br>  You can not just take and start using the drive JetDrive.  The official desktop utility was downloaded from the official site (in my case, MacBook Pro Retina 15 mid2012 with installed for tests via BootCamp Windows 10 Pro). <br><br>  Welcome window.  No functionality, just information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/217/576/805/217576805c1249df973f35f0fbb04caa.png"><br><br>  The second tab - Backup - you can see what backups are on the flash drive (I did not have time to do any more). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/005/0a2/ecd/0050a2ecdabe47918284e5b4daded032.png"><br><br>  Recover - bookmark for data recovery from backups.  Camera archive is perhaps the most popular type of content that passes through these items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/944/703/c379447033644fdfaf454ae240a73d65.png"><br><br>  Formatting (under the mysterious point Optimized Format hides the prosaic FAT32, which with the same agility will correctly perceive both Mac OS X and Windows).  I chose the disk, set the volume label, pressed Format - the output drive is ready for use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e4/977/455/5e4977455ce646279a8ce0f3e9363237.png"><br><br>  Cognitive information: inside the controller SiliconMotion SM3269, which can work with Lightning, by the way, his brother SM3268, is used with might and main in double-sided flash drives with USB Type-C connector.  Samsung's memory is also the freshest, made on 16 nm process technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/078/027/ac6/078027ac60f2493f8dc68e06f95f5651.png"><br><br>  Standby comparison reference test - Crystal Disk Mark.  When reading a record of small blocks, sadness-sadness occurs in both drives, but linear read / write is much better given to a new toy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/d56/526/9e4d5652620c4cf088fc1b84b557b14f.png"><br><br>  What is used flash drive in the first place?  Correct for copying files.  Therefore, the main test will be copying multiple movies to a USB flash drive.  It does not make sense to use a large BDRip for verification purposes, because the purpose of the Transcend JetDrive Go 300 (as well as any other flash drive) is to bring along more content. <br><br>  To measure the time, the utility TeraCopy was used, it was used to measure the time of copying from the working SSD to the cinema drive about robots (part 4) in fairly good quality.  File size - 3 117 881 344 bytes, about 2.9 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b9/4ec/6f1/2b94ec6f10c24ee795fed264e8a23290.png"><br>  For a clear advantage Transcend won (now it became clear why I bought a new flash drive). <br><br><h3>  Mobile app </h3><br>  To use the drive on your phone, player or tablet, you need to install the Transcend JetDrive Go utility.  This can be done either by scanning the QR code on the package, I mentioned it at the beginning, or by finding the application in the AppStore. <br><br> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b72/c07/e2e/b72c07e2e1774f9194b88539a34c6d16.PNG"></a> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/3eb/01e/e3d3eb01e84f4e4bb95a7354dffcfe60.PNG"></a> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/26c/03c/0ee26c03cc564d19be6e8994326141d3.PNG"></a> <br><br>  The functionality is quite diverse: you can open files from a flash drive, including playing video.  Here it should be noted that the 2.9 gig rip was read without any problems, but there were brakes with the BDRip.  On the other hand, why on the BDRip phone 12 or more gigs? <br><br>  Here you can copy all the pictures, videos, contacts from the device and save them ‚Äúfor every fireman‚Äù (this is if the owner does not like iCloud). <br><br> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/5f1/062/c015f106275044b68ae85892eadaa5f6.PNG"></a> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/038/fb6/b44/038fb6b440c0455ea6a030a99fda58ea.PNG"></a> <a href=""><img width="320" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07c/9d1/6a6/07c9d16a61014f41888729f077760be4.PNG"></a> <br><br>  You can protect the launch of the application with a password, but you can not assign a TouchID to unlock, just old-school poking buttons on the screen.  You can find out information about the free space and read a huge amount of information that is not very necessary. <br><br>  Actually, why did I write all this?  I just brag, upgrade my portable storage, it‚Äôs convenient to take TV shows with you to the dacha (they fit all seasons).  And of course to state the fact: progress does not stand still.  Two years ago, my old comrade Leef iBridge was essentially interesting, but time takes its toll ... Now in the Transcend JetDrive Go 300K pocket, if only he could live longer and not lose the caps ... <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, read me, I will write again;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396661/</a></p>
