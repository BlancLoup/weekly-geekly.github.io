Some of them know how to give a signal when trying to steal them, show their own coordinates, and even move independently.  Such suitcases are all good, but there is always the possibility that something will break in a complex system of this type.  On the road, it would be very undesirable. <br><br>  A couple of weeks ago there was information about another project of the suitcase, which can make it easier for the traveler to live.  It's about Marlon.  This project differs from all others in that it is not as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù as the others.  But reliable, plus it has a couple of unique features that can ease the owner of the journey. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is Marlon?  This is a suitcase with a large capacity, strong frame, practical and replaceable wheels, a battery for recharging the devices of the owner and the ability to pack things yourself.  The handle and other mechanical parts of the suitcase are assembled so as to last as long as possible.

      As for packing things, the suitcase helps in this difficult process.  If you have a lot of things - just try to place so that the suitcase is closed.  After that, you need to press the side levers, and the system will begin to compress the contents.  As a result, a suitcase can reduce the apparent volume of one and a half times.  In order to gain access to your belongings, again click on the same levers, and the system opens itself.  If you do not want, you can not compress anything.  You never know, suddenly the user decided to transport not things, but crystal ware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac0/239/2e7/ac02392e745ff7bdd7add31cce7f0768.gif"><br><br>  The case comes with a built-in removable battery with a capacity of 10400 mAh.  During the trip, gadgets are discharged - this is the law.  And as soon as this happened, the device can be charged.  The battery is fixed in a special pocket, so that it can be removed if necessary (for example, when passing control). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47c/4f8/d0a/47c4f8d0a40d581ee074d0f9aa468829.gif"><br><br>  Marlon wheels are big.  This is done in order to increase the stability of the suitcase.  If necessary, they can be replaced - sometimes the most reliable things break.  Large wheels make it easy to roll a suitcase both on asphalt and tile or pavement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8dc/540/9cc/8dc5409ccde0b5da09e19a2e288b2a70.gif"><br><br>  Usually in the suitcase on wheels, the first handles are out of order.  With the wheels are much less problems, although they do happen.  So, the handle and all the other elements of the body are made of reinforced aluminum.  Suitcase zippers are made on special order, zipper type - YKK.  Fabric - ballistic nylon with a protective coating.  He is not afraid of water and moisture inside the suitcase will not fall under any circumstances. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0b/aac/aed/e0baacaed4dc929c5a6ae6b7143c8e5d.jpg"><br><br>  In the suitcase there are several compartments where you can place various items of clothing, packing them along the tim.  Marlon body is flexible, not solid, it allows you to place more things.  Front pocket is great for placing a laptop and tablet.  Clearly, before passing control at the airport, these things must be removed.  This is done quickly and without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d74/24d/f50/d7424df5041edbb1211fd7ea2f6c8f06.gif"><br><br>  The Marlon developers have launched a campaign to raise funds for their project on Kickstarter.  Already collected 10 times more than was planned: 324537 US dollars instead of $ 30,000.  So in May 2017 the suitcase will already fall to its customers. <br><br><h3>  Invitation to test dadzhetov </h3><br>  The dadjet invites authors interested in testing our devices ( <b>we don‚Äôt have Marlon</b> , <u>our own devices are offered for testing</u> ) and write an objective review, for cooperation.  The device after the publication of the review remains with you.  <a href="http://dadget.ru/autors">Read more about the offer here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397003/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397003/</a></p>
