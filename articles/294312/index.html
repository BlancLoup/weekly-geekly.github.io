  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How it was? DataTalks # 3: Online Surveys</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  DataTalks # 3: online surveys took place in Minsk on July 23.  This time I was lucky to be among the organizers.  And now I would like to share my impressions with you.  Of these, the most important thing is that the topic of online surveys is really in demand in the community.  DataTalks # 3 included both professional researchers and newcomers to conducting surveys.  Everyone was able to learn something useful for themselves.  The meeting turned out to be very intense: 3 reports from practitioners and a lot of informal communication among the participants. <br>  Under the cat you will find recordings of speeches, as well as my comments to them. <br>  Enjoy watching! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/722/e22/0e4/722e220e40614ad89973807537a97335.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  <b>How not to lose your head reading the thoughts of users: the secrets of online surveys</b> <br>  <i>Svetlana Polovinkina, Head of the Research Department of the Audience of Game Stream SOOO, Wargaming Minsk Development Center</i> <br>  I spoke directly about the specifics of conducting and using the results of online surveys.  They do not provide such accurate data as internal statistics, but they allow us to understand why the user behaves in one way or another, and also to reveal his needs. <br>  There is an opinion that online surveys are not representative.  In my speech, I give an example of how the results of the user survey on the forum and the targeted research can differ (when an invitation to take part in the survey is sent to a sample of users with certain criteria).  In surveys, the most involved and loyal users are most often involved.  They are the audience of specialized forums.  Therefore, in order to make the survey representative, you need to study your audience and find a way to determine who exactly is responding.  Combining behavioral data with answers, we get the opportunity to adjust the sample and understand the differences between users with different experiences.  I am convinced that the indicators of user behavior in relation to the product are the same socio-demographic characteristics that are used to adjust the samples in offline surveys. <br>  You can find my presentation <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DataTalks/1168770569803668/">here</a> .  It will be interesting to those who conduct online surveys and would like to increase their effectiveness.  If you're only going to conduct your first survey, then read the article <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/wargaming/blog/18288/">"8 facts about online surveys that every researcher should remember"</a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1UztshvolMo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhFhHH0mfl609MPQQCC1UiR0ce8_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <b>Needs and hidden objections: how to investigate them and when do polls lie?</b> <br>  <i>Tamara Kulinkovich, co-founder of "Studio Sorokin and Kulinkovich"</i> <br>  Tamara spoke about the seven misconceptions that researchers most often interfere with when conducting online surveys (and in my experience, customers are subject to the same errors).  She clearly demonstrated the main mistakes, inviting the audience to become respondents.  We must pay tribute to Tamara for her humor.  When filling out the questionnaire, the listeners at the beginning were a bit dumbfounded, but then they gradually came to understand how the respondents feel and what answers they give. <br>  Tamara also tried to predict the participants' answers to the questionnaire.  This helped her knowledge in the field of psychology.  Aggravation, social desirability, projection, causal attribution error, and other psychological effects often mislead us.  Despite the abundance of terms, Tamara explained in her speech what the essence of these phenomena was.  It turns out that people tend to exaggerate their deplorable state, often choose socially desirable answers, do not always talk about their actual behavior, and also tend to justify themselves and judge others. <br>  The main conclusion is that you cannot blindly believe the respondents and be sure that we are asking the right questions. <br>  Since you didn‚Äôt fill out Tamara‚Äôs questionnaire, you may not be ‚Äúfit into the skin‚Äù of those present at DataTalks # 3 while watching the video, but just reconsider your approach to the polls.  Tamara's presentation and a few life hacks, how to write questionnaires correctly, you will find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DataTalks/1168789416468450">here</a> . <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYs34hel7ow%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6rdsdQxCL0ohv335uObZObdcAwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <b>The main trends of online research: audience, mobile devices, gamification</b> <br>  <i>Aigul Mavletova, Deputy Dean for Science, HSE</i> <br>  Aigul prepared a detailed overview of the main trends of online research in the world, explained why it is important to pay attention to mobile users, and shared her experience in optimizing questionnaires and involving respondents in online surveys. <br>  All respondents of online surveys can be immediately divided into at least 2 groups depending on which device they answer from - mobile or desktop.  The features of the device interface with which the user answers the questions affect the duration of the questionnaire filling, the likelihood that the survey will be completed, etc. In order for the study results to be representative, representatives of each group should be included in the sample.  Aigul told how to cope with this in world practice. <br>  Now gamification is a popular trend in all areas.  Often it is used in online surveys.  It can be expressed in correcting the wording of the question in the direction of the fan, applying unusual tasks (you can read about it <a href="http://question-science.blogspot.com.by/search/label/Gamification">in the Jon Puleston blog</a> ) or in completely changing the approach to form the questionnaire and the survey process: the respondent is informed about the rules and objectives of the research, describes the tasks, gives the opposite communication and rewards, passage levels are introduced, etc. Aigul is a follower of the second variant of gamification and talks about it in detail in his speech. <br>  In my opinion, gamification is only a way to involve the respondent in the survey.  When conducting a survey, the most important thing is a qualitative result, since mistakes in research lead to wrong business decisions.  If the use of gamification reduces the ability of the questionnaire to solve a research problem, then you should use the traditional approach.  Aigul adheres to the same principle. <br>  Aigul presentation you can find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DataTalks/1168770956470296/">here</a> .  Information will be useful to those who are already conducting online surveys or are about to start.  Aigul raises professional research questions, but the material itself is available and contains good examples. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tIQr1Rr7Fy4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSyvDFv0tqvACkdfZqkO6DtoQbjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  I hope the recordings of speeches and other materials from the last meeting were useful for you.  I will be glad to answer questions and share experiences. <br>  Meanwhile, the next DataTalks are just around the corner.
