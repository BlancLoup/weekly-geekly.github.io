Someone just took an ‚Äúacademic leave‚Äù.  Someone took the post, which was empty for six months. <br><br>  Some employees were lucky to get an invitation to work in the ‚Äúhigh-tech city‚Äù.  And some companies are no strangers to making massive reductions, even when the bill goes to tens of thousands of laid-off ones.

Among other things, the bill allows entrepreneurs not to issue employment <a href="http://government.ru/activities/22728/">records</a> for employees, <a href="http://government.ru/activities/22728/">according</a> to the government website. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn these cases, an entry is made in the employment contract on the date of termination and on the basis for termination of the employment contract.  By agreement of the parties, the place where the employment record is kept (for the employee or for the employer) is also determined, ‚Äùthe government‚Äôs website says.  The report notes that the model contract form has yet to be approved. <br><br>  The government believes that the adoption of the bill will contribute to raising the level of protection of labor rights of workers, as well as reducing the risk of imposing sanctions on employers for violating labor laws. <br><br><h4>  Waiting for ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">Intel has</a> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25697/">announced</a> the imminent reduction of 12 thousand employees - about 11% of the company's staff.

The company intends to save $ 750 million in 2016 and $ 1.4 billion in 2017. <br><br><h4>  Chinese False Twitter and Time of Troubles </h4><br>  The Chinese branch of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Twitter</a> <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-china-heads-past-ties-to-military-spark-concern-1461146188">will be</a> managed by a manager with no experience working with social networks. <br><br>  The news of Katie Chen‚Äôs appointment as head of the Chinese division of Twitter corporation, which appeared on Thursday, caused outrage among many Chinese users of this social network and surprised analysts of the IT market.  Ms. Chen, 50, was in the past connected with the security forces of the PRC, and she doesn‚Äôt have experience working with social networks. <br><br>  Twitter has been blocked in China since 2009, but many journalists and public figures in this country continue to use it through various means to bypass the blockage. <br><br>  For ordinary citizens of China, the microblogging service is closed, but the country's government structures use it to publish their official messages. <br><br>  Chen promoted cloud computing at Microsoft, and previously led the corporate sales department at the Chinese division of Cisco Systems.  It is also known that Chen for five years headed the antivirus company CA-Jinchen, JV American Computer Associates International and one of the divisions of the Ministry of Public Security of China. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300340/</a></p>
