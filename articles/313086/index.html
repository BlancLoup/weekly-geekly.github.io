Part 2: Visa Issues</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚Üê <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/313048/">The first part here</a> <br><br>  In this article I want to describe the process of collecting and submitting documents for obtaining a national visa (the Blue Card is already obtained in Germany). <br><br>  So, the original of my contract came, and I was ready (as it seemed to me) for the visit to the consulate.  I appointed him for August 25th.  In the list of required documents it was clearly stated that the exact indication of your specialty (word for word) must be present on the site anabin.kmk.org.  Here is a very interesting situation.

      My engineering degree was absent word for word, although there were many analogues.  But my diploma of the candidate of science was naturally attended by ‚Äúkandidat techniceskich nauk‚Äù.  Thinking that it is the highest level of learning that plays a role, I decided to try.  But at the consulate, they made it clear to me that the blue card implies a higher education and my academic degree does not interest anyone, and you need to make a request to KMK (ZAB).  But there was also good news - all other documents are in order and, if there is paper from KMK, my visa will be done in 2-3 business days. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was upset, because until my release to work remained almost a month.  I began to read information about the confirmation of the diploma and found a post that, if there is a contract, it is done quickly. <br><br>  That same evening, I filled out a form on kmk.org, received the identifier of my request.  Two days later I put in the envelope the certified translation of the diploma, a copy of the contract, a copy of the school certificate without translation (I did not understand why, but the list indicates) and a printed questionnaire from the site.  Departure made via DHL-express so that everything comes as soon as possible. <br><br>  On September 1st, I received a letter (in German) that my documents had been received.  In response, I wrote (in English) that I ask you to do everything as soon as possible.  A couple of hours later I wrote a letter with a receipt for payment for their services.  I immediately ran to the bank, then to another, then to the third.  Only in the third bank it was possible to make a payment, it was said that it would go to the addressee within 3 days.  Meanwhile, I signed up for a return visit to the consulate on September 19th.  According to my calculations (and according to reviews of experienced ones), confirmation is sent by ordinary mail for two weeks. <br><br>  On September 2, I was told from KMK that my payment was received and they will send the documents today.  I was amazed at this speed of work.  By evening, they sent me a scan of my confirmation and said that they had sent the original by regular mail.  Now I understand that it was possible to do this: ask to send the original to the employer (in Germany it would take 1-2 days) and then the employer would send everything via DHL-express.  But then this idea did not visit me, but in vain! <br><br>  Began to check all documents for a visit to the consulate.  My wife and I served at the same time, I‚Äôm on a blue card, she‚Äôs to be reunited with her spouse (with me).  Filled again questionnaires.  It required a transfer of employment record to confirm 5 years of experience in the specialty.  Apostille was pre-recorded in the marriage certificate, it was all translated together.  Full list of documents <a href="http://www.germania.diplo.de/contentblob/3736096/Daten/6359078/bluecard.pdf">HERE</a> . <br><br>  The date of the visit to the consulate was approaching, but there was no confirmation of the original, I was beginning to worry.  As a result, day X came, and the original never came.  I decided to go with a printed scan that I was sent by e-mail.  September 17, we again appeared at the consulate.  Got to the same secretary, he recognized us.  They handed him all the documents, and he began to leaf through them.  Dolistal to scan diploma confirmation.  And then the question is: "Can you show me the original?"  My heart beat anxiously.  I told him the whole story that the original did not have time to reach, but the deadlines were tight, and he believed me.  Success! <br><br>  They said that I could come for a visa on the 21st, but my spouse will receive a visa only when my blue card is approved (already in Germany) and the labor department will consider her case.  Plus, I will have to provide (already in Germany) confirmation of sufficient living space and finances.  This did not frighten us, because at that time the usual Schengen visa was opened and we could enter together.  The passport was returned to her, and my one was taken away for sticking a visa.  Her national visa should appear in the lists of ready months in two months, then you can come with a passport and paste it. <br><br>  Then we realized that this is only the beginning of the journey (although it used to seem that finding a job is the success of a lifetime).  Began collecting / selling / distributing things. <br><br>  Regarding housing in Germany, we discussed this question at the interview and agreed that the employer would assist in this matter (but did not specify in what form).  The employer offered a couple of accommodation options for the first time, but they did not suit us (in the neighboring town).  Then we were given contacts of my future Russian colleague and we discussed further questions with him.  It turned out that renting an apartment without a personal presence is not so simple.  Everyone has different tastes, and without personal inspection it is hard to draw any conclusions. <br><br>  We came to this decision: we found an apartment on AirBnb for the first week of residence (350 euros per week, with the possibility of weekly renewal), and then we come and look for accommodation on the spot.  The apartment was fully furnished, within walking distance from the office, and it was not difficult to live in it. <br><br>  Well, we decided on housing.  On September 21, I took out my visa and on October 1, tickets were bought from us (the visa was issued for 3 months from the start of the contract). <br>  September 23, I found in the mailbox a battered envelope with the original diploma confirmation.  It turns out that the delivery time was 3 weeks. <br><br>  Then we packed our whole life in 2 large (23 kg each) suitcases, the rest was taken to parents.  We said goodbye to the owner of our rented apartment and on October 1, at 11 am, satisfied but happy, flew to the German land. <br><br>  About our adventures on the German side, I will write in the next article. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315416/">Continued here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313086/</a></p>
