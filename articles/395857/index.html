The acuteness of the problem forces us to seek and find new solutions, using both familiar and proven and innovative air purification technologies.  More than 50% of US residents are also forced to complain about health problems directly or indirectly related to air quality, and 40% of Americans live in counties where there is an excess of all standards for the content of harmful particles in the air.  In Europe, this figure is much lower.  The situation in Russia also looks disappointing, where residents of more than half of the country's cities are experiencing a shortage of clean air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e9/2c7/97f/3e92c797f1f7fe462d2e46b80f451064.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The project of the Dutch engineer and designer Daan Roosegaarde, dedicated to creating a unique air purification tower of its kind, was launched 3 years ago at the Kickstarter site, where it managed to raise 113,000 euros.  The current model after multiple modifications and tests was created in Rotterdam in the fall of 2015, at the same time, taking into account the market orientation of the Middle Kingdom and the need for a series of approvals from the Ministry of Environment of China and related institutions, the transition to the final practical stage was delayed for another year .  Now that all the necessary points have been <a href="https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/stories/smog-free-tower/">agreed</a> , the project of Daan Rosegaard will finally be able to be implemented.  The first air purification towers on the streets of Chinese cities, according to the designer, can be seen this fall.  Publications informing readers about this news appeared almost immediately on the pages of the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-06/30/content_25910837.htm">China Daily</a> , <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/01/technology/smog-free-tower-china/index.html%3Fsr%3DtwCNN070116smog-free-tower-china1111AMVODtopLink%26linkId%3D26118132">CNN</a> , <a href="http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/daan-roosegaarde-smog-free-tower-heading-to-china">Creators Project</a> . <br><br>  Residents of developed Western countries, whose daily life is far from the problems associated with the reverse side of industrialization, are genuinely amazed to see the landscapes of endless dumps of man-made waste, which turned into the poorest regions of the planet.  But they also often do not know how serious the ecological situation is literally outside the window, ‚Äúat arm's length‚Äù, and how significant the danger posed by the airbag is.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/216/609/9ab216609fe143c681bf1795f984b0ef.jpg"><br><br>  It is expected that in September 2016, the production of the Smog Free Tower, designed by the venerable Danish designer Daan Roosegaarde, will finally be put on stream.  The authorities of the Celestial Empire have not only fully approved the idea, but are also going to extract commercial benefits from it - selling to tourists original decorations made in the towers of absorbed smog. <br><br>  Smog Free Tower is an 8-meter urban tower that filters 30,000 cubic meters.  m of air per hour in real time, pumping it through its design.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Daan Rosegaard Tower is a climatic installation of the scale of a modern metropolis, which can radically affect the atmosphere of cities in several ways. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e6/8bc/34d/9e68bc34d0032c0d6c8e38947701c12e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The system, designed by a Dutch engineer, consumes only 1.4 KW of energy, which it itself produces.  The final product produced by Smog Free Tower is purified air + costume jewelry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dda/d1d/8cd/ddad1d8cd2d047759e6e94efe16811fa.jpg"><br><br>  The first four towers of the vacuum cleaner-cleaner are planned to be installed in the city parks of Beijing and other large cities.  If the test samples demonstrate the expected efficiency during the heating season, when soot emissions are maximum, the project will be launched at the national level.  And these are hundreds of thousands of air purifiers in a matter of months across the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/2d7/b64/d962d7b64150455ca00d4e700f50efa4.jpg"><br><br>  One of the advantages of Smog Free Tower is its ease of manufacture, while an enterprising engineer laid one more opportunity into the project to talk about its partial self-sufficiency.  Each cubic meter of smog eaten by the tower is used to produce simple jewelery - great souvenirs for the mass of visiting tourists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b0/efe/b16/8b0efeb16e1e4af8a9ba48056909db91.jpg"><br><br>  Giant cleaner works on the principle of "electrostatic vacuum cleaner."  The space in the upper part of the tower is saturated with positively charged ions, which ‚Äúprecipitate‚Äù dust particles.  Further, being carried away by the air flow blown by the fan, they come into contact with the filter in the form of a negatively charged surface, where they are deposited.  Of course, this is not about large flakes, but about an ultrafine suspension, the most carcinogenic and dangerous component of smog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d9/674/0f6/3d96740f6503e24994f154d891e119cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, the collected dust is compacted to the state of a solid, and then it is packed in an airtight casing of transparent plastic.  The content of this tiny capacity - 99% carbon is the main component of natural diamonds.  A carbon crystal of the correct geometric shape in each of these rings made in a futuristic style will be made of carbon black, collected from 1000 cubic meters.  m. of air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2e/62f/fff/a2e62ffff0b6eb14d2970173ec7b0ad8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Celestial Empire is not the only place on the planet where Daan Rosegaard intends to launch his Smog Free Tower project.  In the foreseeable future, the inhabitants of densely populated Mexico City, suffering from the influx of migrants in Paris and the "city of contrasts" of Los Angeles, can also see the tower. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IWaSHJCE80%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjkDu2aSYr9HIjoCjeD6qmfz2TUEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
