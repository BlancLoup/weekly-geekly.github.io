However, it is very effective - and you need only instead of a one-dimensional assessment of a potential feature - asterisks, likes, etc., to ask a quantum pair of questions - functional and dysfunctional, and to figure out the attitude at the same time to whether it is good, what this feature will be, or not will be.  This is now done elementary, with questions in Google Forms, via SurveyMonkey or other services ... but then, on the “Kano square” you will immediately understand the attitude to the feature - whether it is “Exciter”, or “just should be”, or - the classic “ Ninuzhno ™. <br><br>  The stuff needed by product managers, business analysts, UX designers, for many have already discovered that not always “more features are better”, and even when it’s better, the dependence of satisfaction on the features and quality of their implementation is wildly non-linear, changing over time, and - who would have thought " <i>people do not care a lot.</i> "  “Atypical” in the title of the report is that this method can be used not only for evaluating prototypes, but also at the stage of hypothesis verification, with competitive analysis, for audience segmentation ... <hr>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/201503052">Design in B2B</a> ": <blockquote>  <i>In the design of projects, where clients are companies, not individuals (the “Business to Business” segment), there are a number of significant features.</i>  <i>The most important thing is that nobody needs a design; nobody cares about design.</i>  <i>We will talk about how and for what purpose to make design in the B2B segment, so as not to go crazy (it will be useful for designers) and to bring real company profit (it will be useful for managers).</i> </blockquote><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/118003811&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh2eZmFiedq9L3kQeKXBHHn1WGasQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="201503052 Design in B2B" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  (on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/5KEIV2i6IdU">YouTube</a> ) <br><br>  Both speakers, looked very design (in my opinion successful cosplay " <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3DAlice%2BDilbert%26newwindow%3D1%26safe%3Doff%26tbm%3Disch">Dilbertova Alisa</a> " and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D99%2B%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%26newwindow%3D1%26safe%3Doff%26tbm%3Disch">Octava Parango</a> ), work in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.b2b-center.ru/">B2B Center</a> , and before that they also worked in "business development", in 1C and SKB Kontur, companies that in many reports it seems they have declared their adherence to the ideals of usability ( <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/93361560">[1]</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/53534270">[2]</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/23323542">[3]</a> ) ... and from the height of their experience they seem to say to the young - <i>Humble yourself!</i>  <i>Stop making use of beauty and convenience!</i>  <i>This is a business - that is, "beat", "Ptsu", "without us."</i>  <i>Here it is necessary to satisfy the stakeholders who have never seen the product, or, more scientifically - here the functional requirements are an order of magnitude more important than non-critical non-functional ones.</i>  <i>Do you want to improve the world - look for how to sell yourself ...</i> <br><br>  The topic is obvious, eternal - here, a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD_%2528%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB,_ProductCampMinsk-2014%2529">whole round table</a> pondered how to sell UX research and design to a business. <br><br>  As a result, the audience had to stand up for design and usability in business applications, at the same time (what a shame for designers!) Had run into the pointlessness of the presented slides.  There were a lot of discussions on the sidelines, they remembered cases when design helped to fill a niche with new business products, for example, the Glavbuch and Lawyer systems with the design of a famous studio ate a healthy share from the seemingly eternal monopolists of the Guarantor &amp; Consultant. <br><br>  In general, everything is not so bad, but B2B is obviously not the place where you can effectively pump a portfolio on Dribble. <hr>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/201503053">Crowdsourcing in the bank - how to involve 44162 employees in joint activities</a> ": <blockquote>  <i>I will tell you how we are doing a crowdsourcing platform for Sberbank - the largest project of corporate crowdsourcing in Europe</i> <ul><li>  44162 participants </li><li>  18,000 offers </li><li>  26,000 comments </li><li>  240,000 ratings. </li></ul>  At the same time, 10-15 crowd projects are always in operation. <br><br>  I will tell you what benefits the bank brings to crowdsourcing, what it is used for, and what we understood during the three years of work on this project. <br><br>  The report will be useful to anyone who thinks about the introduction or development of corporate social services.  networks, knowledge bases, a bank of ideas, etc. — or wondering why all these wonderful tools don't work for them? </blockquote><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/118003798&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTnQRxDQjEHsXZq3aMYjTPJkoPzw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="201503053 Crowdsourcing in a bank - how to involve 44162 employees in a joint" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  (on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/5-k2Hsd7gUE">YouTube</a> ) <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%25AE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Jura Kupriyanov</a> with the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wikivote.ru/">WikiVote</a> service managed the impossible ( <i>practically “break the unbreakable ... touch the untouchable ... row-row ... fight the powah"</i> ): <ul><li>  In Sberbank: <ul><li>  Monster Company (even in a good way) </li><li>  Bank (paranoia on security, inertia and lack of initiative as a modus vivendi) </li><li>  Who has many thousands of its developers, evil tongues say that even too overfed. </li></ul></li></ul>  sold and successfully used: <ul><li>  In fact, the usual Habra-forum, with comments and ratings. </li><li>  SAAS solution - even the code is not given, Sberbank's internal top-secret documents are discussed on another site. </li><li>  And under the supervision of their own moderators. </li></ul>  Cool result!  Actually, this report was to be read last year at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://secr.ru/">SECR</a> , since then the number of employees involved in the savings bank increased from 20K to 50K. <br><br>  Actually attending all kinds of “knowledge management” conferences for businesses, I often heard stories like “well, they put a sharapoint, a forum there ... we track activity ... we <s>reward the</s> active <s>with a blackjack and a</s> business trip to the Bulgarian branch at sea with ... but still, what something garbage turns out. "  There were also startups trying to order the perfect knowledge management platform, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.ru/%3Fgfe_rd%3Dcr%26ei%3Dw7AWVYfPA4HHsAG5oYG4AQ%26gws_rd%3Dssl">whose stories were all amused</a> . <br><br>  Jura also managed to avoid <ul><li>  and the insanely revamped platform - the first years were being introduced to Semantic MediaWiki, and she was given the resignation in favor of a self-made forum. </li><li>  and the chaotic nature of the forums: <ul><li>  “Free crowdsourcing discussion” is clearly formalized, governed by official orders with seals and the signature of German Oskarovich himself. </li><li>  “almost finished documents” go down to the discussion, and it is almost impossible to deviate from the topic, except to suggest changes to specific paragraphs. </li><li>  It is not a code that is being sold, but a service with a forum, with medics-facilitators who clearly hold the context of the discussion. </li></ul></li></ul>  Well, of course, you need a stick and gingerbread, without it you would not have flown in the banking environment.  What is a “stereotypical bank employee” participants got a view from the discussion that happened directly on the report with a former bank employee: <blockquote><ul><li>  - An order has been issued in the bank, according to which all internal regulatory documents must undergo a crowdsourcing examination ... </li><li>  - That is - all ordered to check these documents? </li><li>  - No, crowdsourcing is voluntary. </li><li>  - And the order? </li><li>  - The order is for document developers.  They should put the documents on the site and consider the comments proposed by the community, the most useful - to take into account in the document. </li><li>  - Yeah, and the community ordered to check this document. </li><li>  - Not.  They are simply invited, and they check voluntarily. </li><li>  - I do not understand.  Is it written in their job descriptions - to participate in crowdsourcing projects? </li><li>  - Crowdsourcing is a voluntary activity.  Nobody forces anyone to participate. </li><li>  - But they do it during working hours? </li><li>  - Well, who how.  In working too. </li><li>  “So they were assigned this?”  Order, or something else?  once in working hours, but they do not work. </li><li>  - Well, how - do not work?  This will concern them later, and the authors of the documents will benefit from such consideration.  The quality of the documents is improving. </li><li>  - But why would people break away from their main work in order to read some kind of document?  If they are not controlled ... </li><li>  - They then live according to this document - it’s also regulatory.  It is better to get acquainted in advance, and make the necessary corrections, while there is an opportunity. </li></ul>  ... <ul><li>  - Well, let's say.  Here they read this document and give their suggestions and comments.  And then - vote and choose the best. </li><li>  - Yes. </li><li>  - And the author of the document then brings them into the document. </li><li>  - He can not contribute everything, but he has to explain if he rejected something. </li><li>  - Clear.  And those who did not submit any proposals, or their proposals were not accepted - they are then dismissed, right? </li></ul></blockquote>  There were funny built-in chips in the forum itself, such as visualization of a collaboration in the spirit of visualizers working with version control systems (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%2594%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_SECR-2014%2529">[4]</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lib.custis.ru/ShowTeamWork">[5]</a> ).  But the trick here is rather in the synergy of the administrative principle, well-known Internet technologies, and good luck. <br><br>  In fact, the company has several more stories, including a more <a rel="nofollow" href="http://edu.crowdexpert.ru/">academic public discussing legislation in education</a> , and it is certainly good to gradually move towards Iceland, in which the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://geektimes.ru/post/125264/">constitution is written on the forum</a> .  We need to come up with a good, working platform for debugging legislative initiatives in advance — so that when the cartridge runs out of a B-Printer, be ready to offer a good, tested platform. <br><br>  Yes, ideally, I would like the laws to be written in formalized languages, automatically verified by the Continuous Integration system (“bleep ... merge with the XXX branch of the law by the YYY faction that did not pass autotesting ... 1234 conflicts were found ... 432 corruption loopholes ... build broken, edits were rolled back ...” ), but for now this could be replaced by “constructive crowdsourcing.” <hr>  If you are a Product Manager, Product Owner, Business Analyst, Project Manager, Usabilist, Designer and others who are not indifferent to how to make the right products - join the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/productcamprussia/">facebook group</a> , they are just discussing the program of the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://productcamp.ru/registration/">free conference ProductCamp-2015</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289026/</a></p>
