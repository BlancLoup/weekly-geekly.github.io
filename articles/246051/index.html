Cyberscotter is looking for domain names that will be of interest to entrepreneurs when entering the Internet market (or those businessmen who already operate, but want to expand the sphere of influence in the market), with a view to subsequent sale and earnings on the difference between the purchase price and the sale price .

    <h3>  Types of cybersquatting </h3><br>  Over the entire period of the existence of cybersquatting, it has been divided into several directions. <br><br><h4>  Industry </h4><br>  This type of business involves the registration of domains under the names that correspond to sectors of the economy or certain products.  This type is the most practical, since there is a myth, the search engines initially give sites that are consonant with the names of goods and services.  Therefore, entrepreneurs prefer this type of domain name, trying to stand out among many others. <br><br><h4>  Geographical </h4><br>  With this type of cybersquatter chooses a domain name associated with some name of the region.  In this case, the profit is not as great as with the industry, but sometimes this method serves as a good source of income.  The demand for territorial domains appears during regional business expansion.  Names associated with the name of the territory are most important for the tourism business. <br><br><h4>  Brand and nominal </h4><br>  This type of cybersquatting often becomes a reason for recognizing it as illegal activity.  The essence of brand cybersquatting is the assignment of domain names that are consonant with the names of brands (trademarks).  When selecting domains for branded cybersquatting, domain names correspond to the names of famous people.  You can earn a lot on this type of cybersquatting, but there are a lot of risks.  The rightholder can go to court and then the domain will be withdrawn from the cybesquotter.  Usually this does not happen, as the legal costs are too high, and it is easier for the right holder to purchase the domain directly.  So the question is solved faster and much cheaper. <br><br><h4>  Typesquatting </h4><br>  This type is not associated with the classic registration of domains for further sale.  When typosquatting domain is often difficult to sell, and it is not created for sale.  This type is based on the incorrect search by users of known domain names.  For example, some recruit pepci.ru instead of pepsi.ru.  This is due to the fact that many people do not speak at a proper level English, which is widely used in the formation of the domain name. <br><br>  These errors are used by Taipsquatters to their advantage.  Once there was a situation in which Yandex had a ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù - the jandex.ru domain.  And Yandex was able to sue this domain from cybersquatting.  Many users searched for the Yandex site, picking up jandex in search, and as a result, in a short time, the domain acquired significant traffic and gained a lot of advertising revenue.  Indeed, the amount of traffic is the most important for making a profit in the business of taypskovotterov. <br><br>  Russian legislation is not yet able to recognize the actions of cybersquatting and typosquatting as illegal.  In court proceedings, decisions made in favor of rights holders are based on non-observance of copyright and related rights.  Employees of internal organs, commenting on cybersquatting, say that they do not yet see a clear threat in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246051/</a></p>
