But when I compared the data, I thought that this material can illustrate the approaches of various manufacturers of SDLs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To add intrigue, first I will show the dependencies of power consumption, light intensity and temperature in comparison.  Our manufacturers are called Osidan and Atcon.

      This is the electrical power: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/687/20d/f4f/68720df4f41160ed8a6e1e0ce7555c7c.png" alt="image"><br>  Wow!  Osiden's lamp loses only 5% of power when it is warming up.  Outstanding, we can say the result.  Against this background, 11% of other lamps look pale. <br><br>  Here are the illumination data: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66c/7a8/973/66c7a8973bf0fe27a7870a1fa32862c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The same picture - Osiden shows itself twice as good as Atcon. <br><br>  The temperature rise in time looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23a/e09/6e4/23ae096e411e83bf88cb0d11a7607975.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here the difference is minimal. <br><br>  Considering that the power of the NLL Osidan is higher than a watt, we can quickly conclude that we are dealing with an outstanding creation of the Chinese genius. <br><br>  However, take a look at the other characteristics (the assessment methodology is described <a href="http://www.twirpx.com/file/2175185/">separately</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a2/f21/f04/5a2f21f040e992505a2c4ac67bdf6e9d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now it becomes clear that the advantage on the graphs is only apparent.  Graphs should be considered in conjunction with other data. <br><br>  It is seen that the lamps from the manufacturer Osidan simply poor quality.  This is expressed in the following: <br><br>  1. The manufacturer initially deliberately underestimated the electrical power of the SDL.  But the luminous flux announced in 1200 lm.  Although I could not help but understand that with low energy consumption this indicator is unattainable.  It is precisely due to the lowering of the power that satisfactory temperature characteristics and a small decrease in power during heating are obtained. <br><br>  2. The manufacturer used a frankly bad driver (in fact, this can be noticed even with the purchase, because for it the operating voltage of 220 V is declared (not even 230, as it should be for the RF!), And not the range).  As a result, the strongest ripple, extremely low power factor. <br><br>  3. Lamps exhibit low color rendering indices and have light with a green tint. <br><br>  Now about the Atcon lamp.  Most of all I was shocked by the fact that the manufacturer declared the electric power after warming up.  At par it is 9 watts.  When you turn on the SOD shows even higher than 10 watts.  And only after warming it goes to a stable 9.1 watts.  In addition, the warm version of the lamp has a very high color rendering index of about 85. <br><br>  Of course, not without a fly in the ointment.  The luminous flux does not add up to the declared value (by more than 20%), the power factor is low.  However, at the moment it is the best SDL purchased directly from China, which I held in my hands. <br><br>  As a finishing touch I will add that the prices for these lamps are the same. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373113/</a></p>
