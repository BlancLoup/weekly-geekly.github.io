Here's a little about what pushed me on this ... <br><br>  While still at school, he was influenced by a single artistic work of a modern domestic author.  The first impression from the read was - bewilderment.  The bewilderment from the fact that not everything is so simple in Russian history, and the history is not modern, but in almost all that is said until ancient times.  The second impression is confusion, as it became incomprehensible what to do and how to perceive the whole ‚Äúcontemporary history‚Äù art. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The answer was basically simple: the whole history of our people is in our <b>rich</b> language.  In the words that survived the emperors, kings, chairmen of the CPSU Central Committee and presidents.  Our words, and not introduced from other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(not cultures, but languages), reflect the essence and depth of the Russian nation.  It turns out that a simple word carries not only a collection of sounds and feelings (reflecting the current reaction to what is happening), but also the content of several word-forming components.  And these components, in turn, are the semantic designation of a process or object.  For example, the word <b>nettle</b> consists of several components: <b>k</b> - direction or indication of something, <b>ra</b> - the ancient Slavic name of the sun and the processes associated with it, <b>beer</b> - drink or get drunk.  It turns out that nettle is literally <b>"drunk of the sun</b> . <b>"</b>  And since nettle tends to sting, it is very similar to a burn from something hot.  Or another example with the name <b>Olga</b> : <b>ol (el)</b> - a young, wandering, intoxicating (fun) drink, and <b>ha</b> - movement (according to another Slavic), it turns out that this name says the following about the owner: a <b>cheerful, agile girl (woman)</b> .  <b>The mountain</b> (in Old Slavic it would have been said gara) - movement towards the sun, the mountain directed to the top, towards the sun! <br>  In other words, a simple word can carry deep meaning.

      And with the advent of "Cyrillic" in 863, when the monks (Greek) Cyril and Methodius took as a basis the 49-letter ‚ÄúBukvitsa‚Äù existing from the Russian people, removed 5 letters, gave four letters to the Greek letters and began to translate books from Greek into invented by them dead language, which the people did not take root, because  It had its own writing, more complete and acceptable to the Russian people. <br><br>  Here is a historical fact (in any reference literature you will find): Peter the Great introduces a new counting from January 1, 1700 - from the birth of Christ in digital designation, canceling the Slavonic-Aryan Calendar that existed in Russia, according to which, at the time of the Decree, Summer 7208 from Creations of the World in the Star Temple. <br><br>  Moreover, the Russian people wrote a number of years in letters, which proves the existence of writing by the Slavs and Aryans by that time, at least, already 7208 years. <br><br>  Another proof may be the words of Catherine II, who wrote the book ‚ÄúNotes on Russian history,‚Äù which says that ‚Äú... Slavs before the birth of Christ, many letters had.‚Äù <br><br>  And here is the modern evidence of the existence of an ancient language that has passed through the centuries.  <b>With the help of the Old Russian language,</b> the ancient Egyptian "hieroglyphs" on papyrus, clay and stone were read, Etruscan letters and inscriptions on the Phaistos disk were deciphered, proto-Indian inscriptions on clay seals from Chorapapp and Mohenjo-Daro were unraveled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe signs are different, the language is the same,‚Äù wrote our contemporary P.P.  Oreshkin in his work "The Babylonian Phenomenon" in deciphering ancient written monuments, the Proto-Slavic writing of this evidence. <br><br>  Today, a lot of ‚Äúpublic‚Äù organizations use the desire of young people and mature people to know their history and use the ‚ÄúSlavic‚Äù coloring in their ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù or ‚Äúsectarian‚Äù interests.  And I always wanted to just know the history of my country.  And as it turned out, the story is always there and it‚Äôs just that you need to hear it - these are words of the Russian language and therefore I want to offer you a non-commercial encyclopedia of the Russian word <a href="http://vedaman.com/">Vedaman</a> based on a wiki. <br><br>  If you also have a ‚Äútranslation‚Äù of words and you know how to handle wiki markup - Welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88154/</a></p>
