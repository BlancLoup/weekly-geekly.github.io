And if there are a lot of ways to attract people on the Internet, and there are plenty of ways to work with them, then there is practically no information on how to choose only effective methods for your business so as not to get scattered.  Let's try to answer this burning question. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have selected 22 ways to attract customers to your website / service.  Each method has its own criteria, they are listed under the description.  You need to select three or four ways to attract customers, the most suitable for you.  Why three or four?  Most of the methods in our list are not one-time, but require constant attention and work.

      <b>Type of purchase.</b> <br>  <u>Extensive</u> .  A purchase where a person has already defined any criteria, but he needs additional information to make a decision.  Such a purchase, as a rule, is carried out through cold settlement, without emotion.  More often they buy building materials, apartments, plastic windows, SEO, etc. <br>  <u>Impulsive</u> .  Saw - wanted - bought.  A purchase that is made impulsively.  The buyer is guided solely by emotions.  More often they buy phones, shirts, flowers in beautiful pots, cakes, but hardly an apartment, car or SEO-promotion service.  Impulse buying is extremely rare in the b2b market. <br><br>  <b>Services / products</b> .  Most channels are universal, but some are more effective for product promotion, others for services. <br>  The cost of implementation.  From ‚Äúfree‚Äù to ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù.  We do not specifically use specific numbers, because they will not be accurate.  Electronic mailing can be carried out for free, and you can order.  We try to evaluate the service at the lowest price. <br><br>  The choice will go from 4 properties: free, inexpensive, average price, expensive. <br>  Term result.  The time interval through which the effect will be. <br><br>  For convenience, we first painted each method of attraction in detail: <br><br>  <b>1. Blog on site</b> <br>  Maintaining a corporate blog is a powerful tool for attracting the target audience. <br>  Count on the flow of customers is only after 50 quality articles. <br>  The type of audience is mostly extensive, you can sell both goods and services. <br>  Deadline for the result is two to three months, due to the release of the top search engines for a large number of low-frequency queries. <br><br>  <b>2. SEO</b> <br>  This channel gives the most convertible visitors - with the right choice of promoted words, we will not only get an audience, these will be potential customers who are already interested in our service.  Universal method, suitable for almost all companies.  Check whether you are looking for through wordstat.yandex.ru.  Deadline for the result is three months. <br><br>  <b>3. Banner advertising</b> <br>  It is quite easy to agree on placing banner ads in a thematic forum or blog. <br>  The audience is focused on impulse buying.  Advertising is so worth the goods and rely on the average cost.  The result will appear literally within one to two days after publication.  Every two or three weeks is to change the site. <br><br>  <b>4. YouTube Videos</b> <br>  Absolutely free and, of course, a very powerful method of attracting customers.  You not only get views on the recommended videos, your video can also easily take the first lines on the search queries of interest to Google - two in one, so to speak.  The audience is mostly extensive if used in the standard, but maybe impulsive if viral methods are used.  You can advertise and services, and products.  The cost is either zero (only video production costs), if we do not use Adwords advertising support, or very low, if we use them.  The result of time without advertising is difficult to predict, depending on whether the video hits the top of the search or to the serious recommended videos.  With advertising the result will be instant. <br><br>  <b>5. Group in social networks</b> <br>  Groups in social networks successfully work in the direction of remarketing and additional sales.  Separately, you can select advertising "Vkontakte" in other groups. <br>  It's easy enough to arrange to repost any of your news in social networks for 200-500 rubles in a community with 50 thousand visitors.  Negotiate directly with community administrators. <br>  Sales can be both impulsive and extensive.  You can advertise products and services.  The cost is low - it is practically impossible to promote a commercial group (for an unknown brand) for free.  Effect after one month. <br><br>  <b>6. Communication on the forum</b> <br>  Communication on thematic forums is very useful.  You can place a link to your website in the signature and just chat on the forum, and all participants in the conversation will see your website and the services you provide.  The method is doubly effective if you have proven yourself on the forum as an expert.  The type of sale is extensive, both services and goods are advertised.  The use is free, but at first laborious.  The result is one to two weeks after the link is posted. <br><br>  <b>7. Placement in reference books</b> <br>  Put a link to your site in all major city directories, this is a bit of citation (tIs) from Yandex, and a small number of transitions.  Extensive sale.  It is possible to promote both services and goods, but here the brand or point of sale is more likely to move.  Accommodation is free;  Of course, there is also a paid one, but it is not worth it, since there are enough free reference books.  The result will be small, and it is worth waiting for it in a month. <br><br>  <b>8. Press releases / Guest blogging / articles on the forums</b> <br>  In short, if you wrote a quality article, distribute it and do not forget to include a link to your site.  Extensive or impulsive advancement - mainly depends on the site where the material is placed.  On the thematic forum, sales will be extensive, but in an online magazine it can easily be impulsive.  You can advertise both services and products.  Accommodation is usually easy to find free.  The first result will be in two to four days, still small, but a permanent one will follow in a month after the indexation of your article in search engines. <br><br>  <b>9. Webinars</b> <br>  Conducting a webinar, you attract people to your site, and these are people who already consider you an expert in the field, as well as those who are interested in your services.  A satisfied visitor to your webinar has almost become your customer.  The type of purchase is extensive; both services and goods are successfully sold.  The cost is absolutely free.  The effect will be within a week after the webinar. <br><br>  <b>10. Seminars</b> <br>  Extremely effective, but rather expensive method, if only you are not a celebrity in your industry.  Sales extensive.  Sold and services, and products.  Participation in seminars is quite expensive, requires certain skills and serious preparation.  Result in two to three weeks. <br><br>  <b>11. Business cards</b> <br>  Be sure to include on the business card the address of your site.  It would seem so simple?  But for some reason, not everyone has it.  The way fits all.  The implementation is inexpensive, and the manifestation of the result in a period of one day. <br><br>  <b>12. Brochure</b> <br>  By itself, it will not sell, but a visit to the site can be obtained from it.  Promise more information when you go to the site or any bonuses.  This is an endangered method, less competitive. <br>  The type of sale is mostly extensive.  Successfully sold and services, and products.  The implementation is average in cost.  Result from one day. <br><br>  <b>13. Podcasts</b> <br>  A very simple way to attract an audience, while being quite cheap in production and popular, especially among iPhone users.  Sales by this method will be extensive.  Easier sold services.  Adding podcasts to popular aggregators is usually free.  The term for obtaining the effect is from two to nine days. <br><br>  <b>14. ‚ÄúQuestion-answer‚Äù</b> <br>  Everything is simple: look for a question on the Internet, for example, ‚ÄúHow to attract users to your website?‚Äù, Find such questions in forums, question-and-answer services, and then give a link to your website, which, of course, contains a detailed the answer or solution of the above problem.  The link will hang and attract all those with the same question will go to this page.  Extensive sales, aimed at both goods and services.  Time-consuming, but free, the result in two or three weeks. <br><br>  <b>15.

Also, it does not hurt personally, anyone interested in your company (not spamming) to tell about your product / service.  If you have a popular service or product that is cheap at cost, choose the most active users of social networks with many friends.  Invite them to yourself, give them your product, service and tell them in detail why you are the best.  A friend will probably write about it on his wall.  Type of purchase - impulsive.  Thus it is better to advertise products.  Accommodation is free or relatively inexpensive.  The effect of one day. <br><br>  <b>17.
