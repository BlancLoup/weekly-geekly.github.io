Unfortunately, because of my employment, I was not ready to help him in terms of developing the site, therefore I could only help with one (as a relative :)) - recommend regional studios, where they could do it for such a cost - $ 6xx, more - less adequate "online store with limited functionality."  It turned out there was only one sensible studio, but the price of the question did not suit us, they asked for twice as much.  We said we would think and said goodbye.  My brother was a little disappointed, because now he had to look for a freelancer who would be ready to develop a site for the money.  And suddenly, in a couple of days, late at night, <s>I f ... I came</s> up with an idea for which I decided to donate a so-called.  free time and let it go for its implementation. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Task.</b> <br>  Before you talk about the idea, I would like to first get you up to speed% username%.  The objectives of an ‚Äúonline store with limited functionality‚Äù were as follows: <br>  - catalog of goods (which can be edited and filled with goods) <br>  - placing an order, and without payment systems, simply filling out a contact form and that's it. <br>  The point is that% username% that the store specializes in wholesale supplies, and here, as it turned out, quite a lot of nuances are discussed in the phone / email mode. <br>  And now about the idea itself ... <br><br>  <b>Idea.</b> <br>  Having unsubscribed another piece of code, I decided to distract myself for a cup of coffee and a cigarette (I understand that this is not useful, but it helps me to gather my thoughts), taking a little puff and drinking it with a sip of coffee, wondered - <b>‚Äúhow would I do to him store</b> , and not having time to use the next array of poison in your body, I replied to myself - <b>‚Äúlike a regular store‚Äù</b> (this apparently was a protective reaction of the body :)).  After putting out a cigarette and finishing his coffee, I rolled a letter to my brother, where I wrote about my willingness to cooperate. <br><br>  <b>Result.</b> <br>  As usual, the timeline is an ulcer that doesn‚Äôt allow us to calmly develop, but at the same time, it doesn‚Äôt allow us to dissipate during development, in my case I only had 2 months (the demand of suppliers), this is with the mode that I I worked on a permanent basis, + led my project (to which I temporarily had to score), + wife / house, i.e.  I had only about 4-5 hours a day to develop, + weekends, i.e.  real time to develop ~ a fortnight (but that didn‚Äôt scare me either :)).  Therefore, I had to concentrate mainly on the functionality, naturally there was not enough time (as usual) for design things, to set the exact angle to objects, etc., in short - the design is still raw.  Just besides the development of the store itself, I still had to come up with a name, develop a logo, etc. In general,% username%, those who saw it - <a href="http://www.urun.com.ua/">√úr√ºn - product range!</a> <br><br>  <b>Salt.</b> <br>  Based on my small engine, you can build almost any store, and nothing prevents you from attaching payment systems and other functionality to it.  You can also fasten any design, there would be a desire and resources - instead of tables with boxes you can watch hangers / mannequins with clothes (for a clothing store), or bookcases with books (bookstore) ... <br><br>  PS: By the way, I am now unemployed (but not carefree;)), you can find me <a href="http://www.ajat.com.ua/">here</a> . <br><br>  PPS I almost forgot, this is my first post on Habr√© - do not judge strictly;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85853/</a></p>
