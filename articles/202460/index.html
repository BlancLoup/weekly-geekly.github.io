  <section class="page js-page"><h1>People with code past or sunset programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80e/4a6/11e/80e4a611e81969203ac5fb930c84d200.png" align="right"><br>  - Buggy sofa!  - Anton cursed, once again having crushed his fingers with a heavy sofa, which he and Sergey had already dragged 14 spans. <br>  - Buggy?  - Sergey asked, - did you also work as a programmer before? <br>  They had been working together for almost a month now, but Sergey never once suspected him of a former programmer.  Stony, muscular Anton somehow did not look like a former programmer. <br>  ‚ÄúI had to earn extra money in my student years,‚Äù Anton replied, a little embarrassed. <br>  - Yes, do not drift!  I am my own.  Three years of layout and js for all browsers, - Sergei perked up and pressed a little harder, crushing Anton. <br>  - Hush you!  Stuck heavy!  Because of her, only 7 fingers are already functioning.  In general, it is better to talk in a low voice about a code-past.  Spread - instantly take off from work.  Fuh, how heavy!  Move to the left until it stops. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - And what were the cases?  In my previous work, they didn‚Äôt dismiss for this, it was not accepted to talk about it, - Sergei was a little surprised, but he caught himself in time, almost letting the sofa go from his hands. <br>  - Yes, our boss - the passion as a former programmer does not like.  He says that someone who thinks a lot - he works a little.  There are only 10 programmers of the former, and they work here only for the reason that they were previously familiar with the local boss, just like I did. <br>  - That's how it is!  And I thought that I was a former programmer, and I won‚Äôt think about the others. <br>  - But who will tell about his code-story now?  Here we just keep quiet, and on that - thanks.  I have a friend - Vitaly, so he had a job at work that he invented to identify former proggers.  They will stand in a smoking room and start telling how someone‚Äôs phone made the site 14 times faster than a brigade of programmers and without any errors.  Or, like 9 years ago, someone‚Äôs friend got into programming competitions and won a victory over the best programmers in the city with the help of a telephone.  So, they are telling such stories as instigators, and they themselves gaze at the eyes - will anyone sleep.  A person with a code-pastor cannot listen to this for a long time, he will surely give himself off.  Let's take rest, or else 12 more spans, and the fingers are stiff and do not obey. <br>  - What passion.  I heard about this, but I thought it was fiction.  And did 9 years ago already have such smart phones?  It seems like a seven-year technology. <br>  - have been.  First, as a special firmware on the phone spread.  One sly guy worked honestly in a closed company during the day, and at night laid out secret firmware in a closed network.  I remember at that time I earned my apartment.  I registered on the freelance exchange and fed the assignments to the phone, and he gave me a clean and readable code.  During the night I had 2-3 tasks to do.  At that time, it was necessary to explain in detail to the phone, he couldn‚Äôt think it out himself.  This year he got wiser up to the web servers in his pocket, and a year later the programmers were not needed - even the new code for these damned phones was written by the phones themselves!  - Anton with anger hit his fist on the leg of the sofa, I heard a dull thump and smelled of dust. <br>  - How long will you fumble?  - came a nasty voice from above. <br>  - Four flights left!  - Anton shouted loudly up.  He grabbed the sofa and, turning, asked in a low voice, ‚ÄúHow did you know about the decline of programmers?‚Äù <br>  - And my mother called me.  I called and told me in such a satisfied voice that I had made myself a website, which I had promised to do to her for seven months.  I went in, checked it out - really, an excellent, well-structured site, it opens quickly, the code is clean.  Information about her gardening is not much, but it is clear that almost every day one or another article is added, everything is convenient, structured.  She said that a couple of weeks ago on TV in the news feed there was a story about how to make your site using a mobile phone.  You just need to explain to the phone what you want to make the site and what you want to put there.  She spoke with her phone for half a day and he did everything she wanted.  I, of course, did not believe it. <br>  - Wanted to check?  - Anton already knew that Sergei would answer. <br>  - Yes, I tried it myself that evening.  Before that, I didn‚Äôt communicate with the phone at all and kept its AI turned off, it was more convenient for me to use a regular dialer, - Sergey intercepted the sofa more conveniently and continued, - he turned it on and asked him to make a heraldry page.  A second later, I was looking at it on my desktop computer.  What is most surprising, the page is hosted right on my phone.  Goosebumps ran down my back.  I asked the phone to make me a page with my resume and with a history of my projects.  And here I give permission to access my computer.  Two seconds and I already consider my resume with current data.  Dumb phone found my old resume, updated the data in it, folded the page and scammed it.  As if reading my thoughts, he found all my successful projects and also added to the resume.  The worst thing is that this piece of iron even understands the meaning of the expression ‚ÄúPlay with fonts‚Äù and selects the design according to my taste.  It became clear how my mother managed so quickly to realize her plans.  Now she fills her gardening site with content, just talking to him, adds photos there, communicates with other people there.  And her server is just her phone, which is always in her right pocket. <br>  That evening, I spent a long time fiddling with the phone, forcing him to program complex algorithms, build complex models, and so on and so forth.  I frantically tried to find at least some advantage of a living programmer over artificial intelligence.  It was like a cold water tub for me.  I realized that I can be replaced by a simple mobile phone, which can be bought at every store. <br>  For some time, there was the echoing tense steps and the shuffling of the sofa against the walls. <br>  - And now I'm thinking about a script for a robot that would drag a sofa instead of us. <br>  ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù said Anton. </div>
