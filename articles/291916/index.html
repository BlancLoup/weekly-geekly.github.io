All this makes the company think more about the convenience of potential customers with smartphones and tablets. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Everything will be mobile </h4><br>  According <a href="">to</a> TNS and the Public Opinion Foundation (FOM), as well as Yandex, at the end of 2014, 68% of all Internet users in Russian cities at least once a month went online using mobile devices.  A year earlier, this figure was 56% - that is, people in different regions of the country began to use the mobile Internet more often.

      The importance of the mobile environment for business is also growing - in the spring of 2015, Google <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/04/google-mobile-friendly-on/">announced</a> that mobile search version would be ranked higher in search results (the event was compared with the end of the world - this is how <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-mobilegeddon-2015-4">Mobilegeddon</a> was born).  This means that if a smartphone user is looking for something from his device, then on the first page of the issue he will be shown websites that are optimized for display on a small screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/6b8/5d4/9a86b85d4717461d8e743cdec3455201.jpg"><br><br>  Another important point: with the help of mobile devices, Russians not only surf the web, but also <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/mobile-sales-increase-russia.html">make purchases</a> - many large retailers from Ozone to Eldorado show sales growth ‚Äúin mobile‚Äù. <br><br>  The growing importance of the mobile environment as a channel for attracting paying customers has a significant impact on various aspects of the business.  One of the main trends is the simplification of customer interaction. <br><br><h4>  The simpler the better </h4><br>  The Google algorithm already mentioned above checks the degree of ‚Äúfriendliness‚Äù of the site to mobile users according to four criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  Availability of text that can be read without increasing it; </li><li>  Use content that does not require horizontal scrolling or scaling to be viewed; </li><li>  The lack of content that may not be supported by certain devices (for example, Flash); </li><li>  Arrangement of hyperlinks at a sufficient distance from each other, so that they can be pressed with a finger. </li></ul><br>  In general, meeting the listed criteria is not even needed to climb higher in Google issuance - this is an elementary concern for its users and potential customers. <br><br>  If the text on the site can be read from any screen and get into the button with your finger - this facilitates interaction with it.  Users love when they are taken care of and are more likely to buy goods that are sold in many places, where it is more convenient to do this (the price may even be a little higher). <br><br>  People appreciate care and remember companies that have treated them well - this is called loyalty.  And since more and more users come to the sites of various organizations from their smartphones and tablets, and do not just come in, but spend money with them, business should think about building good relationships with mobile clients. <br><br><h4>  Battle for loyalty </h4><br>  The easier it is for the user to achieve the desired goal, the better.  For this, companies use a ‚Äúrubber‚Äù page layout, make contact forms as simple as possible and make large buttons. <br><br>  We at Cashmyvisit conducted our own small survey, which showed that, among other things, people lack an easy way to contact the right company directly from their mobile device. <br><br>  That is why we have developed a <a href="http://easycall.pro/%3Futm_source%3Dspark%26utm_medium%3DADV%26utm_campaign%3DEasycall.pro">special button</a> for making a call - it allows the visitor, who first appeared on the site, not to search for a page with contacts on it, but to immediately contact the company and ask their questions. <br><br>  The button is set at the bottom of each page, and by clicking on it one or more phone numbers are shown - the user selects the one he likes more and initiates a call with one ‚Äútap‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition to simplicity for users, for business it is also a great tool for collecting leads after business hours - if a potential client called you at the weekend, you can call him back on Monday and close the deal. <br><br>  Earlier in our blog, we <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/cashmyvisit/blog/8597/na-chto-vliyaet-komfort-kak-callback-vidzhet-pomog-povisit-loyalnost-pokupatelej%25D1%2591">wrote</a> about how the introduction of a convenient method for feedback (callback widget) helped Nissan car dealers to significantly increase user loyalty.  There it happened on the Web, but the same laws work in Mobile ‚Äî people buy where it is more convenient and easier. <br><br>  This means that companies that want to remain competitive in a crisis and growing competition should make efforts to facilitate users to interact with them.  Introducing a convenient feedback button to the site is just one small step, but it shows the concern for users, they appreciate it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291916/</a></p>
