  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VIZIO. Low cost laptop with Full HD IPS screen</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Quick Reference:</i> <h6>  VIZIO is a fairly well-known American company.  Exists since 2002.  Produces mainly LCD TVs and monitors.  Recently, attempts have been made to break into the market of ultrabooks and tablets.  Device development is made in the USA.  At the same time, not only the design is developed, but also the internal structure of all the equipment and nothing is given to the Indians or the Chinese to be outsourced.  Production facilities are located in Mexico, China and Taiwan.  All plants that produce equipment, partially or fully belong to the company VIZIO.  Differs aggressive marketing policies, accuses the world's largest brands in harming the environment, the use of penny semi-slave labor, and boasts of its policy of developing everything up to the ‚Äúlast screw‚Äù by competent American engineers.  There are no plans to enter the Russian market.  The likelihood of our products VIZIO or service centers tends to zero. </h6><br>  From this it follows that for a simple acquaintance with the VIZIO equipment, a simple Russian citizen will have to bear the cost of shipping a fairly weighty aggregate from the USA and the risks associated with Russian mail and a guarantee valid only in California. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/ffb/567/015/ffb567015996119a6e55f99df406dd17.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here it is which of itself - all such typically metallic minimalist American.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The VIZIO laptops that interest us in this topic are represented by a not too rich model lineup. <br><br>  <u>Old on Windows 7 and Intel Core i3-i5 processors:</u> <br>  - CT14 A1-A4 - thin and light (1.54 kg) ultrabooks and laptops with SSD storage and high-quality <b>FullHD TN</b> matrix <br>  - CT15 A1-A4 - thin and slightly heavier (1.77 kg.) Notebooks with SSD storage and <b>FullHD IPS</b> matrix <br>  the number depends on the number after the index <b>A</b> - with an increase from 1 to 4, the processor frequency, the amount of SSD and memory are added. <br><br>  <u>Fresh on Windows 8:</u> <br>  - CT15 A5 on Intel Core i7 - a thin ultrabook weighing 1.77 kg with a 256GB SSD drive, and a <b>FullHD IPS</b> matrix <br>  - CN15 A5 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 (but for some reason, Amazon has a 2.3 GHz Apple A4 processor) - a thin Notebook weighing 2.4 kg with a 1Tb hard drive, 32GB SSD for the system, NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M LE graphics and <b>FullHD IPS</b> matrix .

      All models with an index of 15 are equipped with the same matt IPS screen with a diagonal of 15.6 inches and a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  Although it is possible there are different screens, but those who had the pleasure to touch and compare the cheapest CT15-A1 standing next to the most expensive CN15-A5 claim that the difference is completely unnoticeable.  It was this screen that became for me the decisive argument in favor of the choice of VIZIO in spite of all the above risks.  As a result, in terms of moral satisfaction, I did not lose and absolutely do not regret my choice, which fell on the youngest model <b>CT15-A1</b> with such a configuration: <br><br><ul><li>  Mobile DualCore Intel Core i5-3317U, 1700 MHz </li><li>  4 GB DDR3-1333 RAM (Elpida 2 x 2gB dual mode) </li><li>  Toshiba THNSNW128GMCP 128GB SSD </li><li>  Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit </li><li>  Intel HD Graphics 4000 (embedded in the processor) </li><li>  Matrix monitor LG LP156WF4-SLB5 / AH-IPS;  contrast 400: 1;  The number of colors 262K (6-bit);  18ms response time </li><li>  2 USB3 ports </li><li>  HDMI output </li><li>  Simplo VZ3LS422P 52096 mWh battery (4 hours of work with one recharge) </li><li>  CD-DVD drive and network connector no </li></ul><br>  No one was going to play it on toys, but for the remaining tasks of the declared configuration, it is enough for the eyes.  Although the manufacturer claims 6 hours of battery life, after 3.5-4 hours, the indicator is already starting to blink.  Only once, when reading a book in a dark room with the brightness diminished to a minimum, the charge lasted for 4 and a half hours.  When viewing FullHD remuksov from home NAS on WiFi, after one and a half hours less than 10% remains. <br>  But even without looking at the technical specifications, the laptop amazes with its stylishness, screen quality and overall build quality.  Even in a quiet room it is not audible - in my standard conditions of use, the fan turns on extremely rarely and for a short time (although let's see what happens in the summer ..).  And even if you hold in your hands, the heating is almost not noticeable.  A little disappointing keyboard.  As in most modern laptops, it gives the impression of some kind of fragility and noticeably squeezes somewhere down with the buttons pressed.  But in principle, you can get used to it and this, although it saddens you, is not at all angry.  For Russian letters, some Chinese yellow stickers were bought for 50 rubles, which fit into the big picture, do not interfere, are not erased, and so far they are not going to peel off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5da/1be/d17/5da1bed171e983705a04e473e9b5ecee.jpg"><br>  <i>A dull set of inputs: HDMI + USB3 on one side and charging, USB3 and the combined Headphone microphone on the other</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b75/d50/4e1/b75d504e141043630822349d482004ae.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The bottom surface is completely rubber to the touch, with mysterious cogs and a hole labeled Reset</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/543/7f1/90e/5437f190e0f817bd99428a9be1d0e621.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <i>Power supply with variable charge indication color</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d31/243/cea/d31243cea74694f32a44a2470a80c27e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/220/46c/dff/22046cdff5314cf33ef693e1ac0fc446.jpg"><br>  <i>Box, profile view</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/459/6ba/350/4596ba3506b236b2060fc78570d3d3fd.jpg"><br>  <i>Made in China..</i> <br><br>  <i>Results of the integrated Windows performance evaluation (index 5.8)</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/cropped2/949/03c/9e1/94903c9e17fddb3ac8fb7424962a23a6.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/cropped2/fc2/f6e/6d4/fc2f6e6d4c0a3b87fd26efa429a86038.png"></a> <br><br>  <i>CPU-Z</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/799/3db/f2f/7993dbf2f4090be96a9fa3ff21c37473.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f2/64c/ffd/3f264cffd776860ec99d55b2f6bef49e.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f05/f0d/862/f05f0d862b71101c30d92fd0cded97e1.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb5/2a3/584/cb52a358489fb38519bde3de8495130a.png"><br><br>  <i>Wi-Fi BD-Remux playback with a bitrate of 38 megabits / c on the background of the task manager (pictures by half a mega)</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12e/a3a/190/12ea3a1905bc99c5346ba77a554c1720.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/480/1fb/f26/4801fbf2600352536025504692b3da41.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Warcraft with high settings - 37 fps in the city, 10-15 in the raid <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a94/d04/ace/a94d04ace17c1d6c0e5253dd0659ec0d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  There is no built-in CD-DVD drive in the device, but nevertheless it supports booting from almost any type of flash drive.  Some of them are recognized as USB-FDD, some as USB-Stick.  The currently connected USB flash drive is visible in the BIOS and you can switch the boot priority to the desired device.  AHCI mode cannot be disabled, which makes it difficult to install on a Windows XP laptop.  All XP-based boot disks, which I managed to reach (Ruslive, Stea, etc.), did not see the hard disk.  Normally it was possible to download the seven-and eight-dimensional images of the Live CD from Xalex rolled up on a USB flash drive. <br><br>  <b>At the moment, this model can still be purchased on Amazon and e-bay at prices ranging from 510 to 620 dollars.</b>  That, together with the predatory interest on foreign exchange transactions with Sberbank ruble cards and the most expensive delivery via Shipito (with all insurances, etc.), translates into approximately 22,000 of our domestic rubles.  And this is quite comparable with some purebred Chinese-plastic HP with an even worse keyboard and a disgusting screen. <br><h6>  <i>By the way, it only seems to me that laptop manufacturers somehow deliberately and intentionally worsen the quality of screens and assemblies?</i>  <i>And regardless of the price.</i>  <i>And my old man, the five-year-old MSI, stands out with a bright spot of vividness of the picture, high-quality assembly, viewing angles and keyboard convenience against the background of all these ‚Äúmodern‚Äù asus and Azeri.</i> </h6><br>  The package includes a power supply with an American cord, which <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/342097">we</a> immediately <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/342097">change to some suitable one for 115p</a> , a small instruction in English and everything (minimalism).  Do not bother with adapters - they sparkle and generally unreliable thing.  The box is good - big, dense, with gaskets made of thick foam rubber and even Russian mail will be difficult to damage.  Well, unless they specifically want it. <br>  After unpacking and first switching on, the look itself is stuck on the screen and no longer wants to peel off.  This, I tell you brothers, Screen with a capital letter.  Not some kind of macbuch retina, of course, but all the same - all the rest that I had before immediately fell in my personal rating to 92 points out of 100. Although I had to touch a couple of some expensive Sony with something similar in appearance screen, but I highly doubt that we can find something similar with a price tag below 50-60 kilorubley.  Viewing angles, dullness, even the demons on the desktop picked up some particularly colorful picture of the demons - no way to immediately hit the spot :) <br><br>  In conclusion, I repeat that for me, as a subjective user, I was pleased and what was not. <br>  So the pros: <br><ol><li>  <b>Screen with a capital letter</b> </li><li>  <b>price is less than 22 thousand rubles including delivery</b> </li><li>  <b>appearance, design, build quality</b> </li><li>  <b>heavy box</b> </li></ol><br>  And cons, without which anywhere: <br><ol><li>  <b>the keyboard is not very ..</b> </li><li>  <b>battery life is not amazing at all ..</b> </li><li>  <b>virtually no guarantee</b> </li><li>  <b>prices of heart drugs while waiting for the parcel and reading the waves of negativity to the Russian post office</b> </li></ol> <b><br></b> <br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> Anyone who thinks I recommend not to think, and while you still have it, you will not regret it. <br><br>  PS Arrived by the way in less than a month, and from this time more than 10 days was stoked somewhere in Belgium.  And through the notorious Vnukovo and it took only 9 days to import.  Plus, another 4 days for customs-handling and delivery by courier in Samara. <br><br>  Related Links: <br><ul><li>  <b><a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D17:47180">ixbt discussion</a></b> </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.vizio.com/">products webpage</a></b> </li><li>  <b><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/laptops/vizio_thin_and_light_ct15-a1.aspx">review and tests in English</a></b> </li><li>  <b><a href="">quick report Aida64</a></b> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177939/</a></p>
