  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass hypnosis or temples for collective hallucinations with soft chairs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From an early age, we are programmed to perceive the world as something ambivalent: on the one hand, the physical world ‚Äî the world that can be felt and ‚Äúreally touched,‚Äù is the world of science and the five senses.  On the other hand, the world of fantasy, which exists beyond reality, is a world that unfolds predominantly in our imagination, and which we can touch only with a kind of "sixth sense." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33a/ade/356/33aade356da11d00cee8e825c5080a32.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The whole system of education and the so-called social adaptation of an individual is aimed at shaping in a person an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe surrounding space, in which a person will perceive as reality only that area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world that he can fix with his main five senses (sight, hearing, smell) , touch and taste).  While that part of the world, which ‚Äúcomes to life‚Äù mainly in our imagination, is assigned the role of only a certain appendage to the basic ‚Äúreal world‚Äù.

      Constantly confronted with such a ‚Äúdual‚Äù interpretation of the world, human consciousness takes this state of affairs to be true, and draws a clear distinction between ‚Äúreality‚Äù and ‚Äúfantasy / fiction‚Äù.  Gradually, this ‚Äúlesson‚Äù is fixed to such an extent that it already passes into the unconscious, and then the brain begins to unconsciously filter the world into these two categories, continuously spreading the flow of incoming information along two shelves: the ‚Äúshelf of reality‚Äù and the ‚Äúshelf of fiction‚Äù. <br><br>  But is it really?  What if both worlds are actually equally real?  What if the whole world is one and there is only one stream in which fantasy and reality are the faces of one whole? <br><br>  If you want to hide something, put it in the most prominent place <br><br>  What if someone decided to hide "disagreeable ideas" from humanity?  Not just ideas, but in fact a whole world, pushing it beyond the boundaries of "reality" (after all, the whole supposedly external world, in fact, exists only in our mind).  How to do it the most elegant?  To make us believe that these ideas are nothing more than fantasies, an invention that have nothing in common with reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d19/91e/edb/d1991eedb4356c3f35a5849e76d609f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the best tool for such a focus is the so-called art (literature, cinema).  Cinema, like no other kind of art, can change a person‚Äôs consciousness, because such immersion is impossible in anything else.  There you can tell any story that, having passed through the ‚Äúfilter-implants‚Äù installed in the human subconsciousness, from this point on, will be further perceived and automatically ‚Äúwritten off‚Äù into the category of ‚Äúfiction‚Äù. <br><br>  Cinemas are a kind of temples for collective hallucinations, in which we are ‚Äúcut off‚Äù from the unpleasant reality for us, using the pattern of our own brain to divide a single stream of information from the world into categories of ‚Äúfiction‚Äù and ‚Äúreality‚Äù. <br><br>  What is described in many films as fantastic, non-existent in reality, from this point of view appears before us as that area of ‚Äã‚Äãreality that we are trying to hide from us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6eb/d15/dfd/6ebd15dfd5f13429a83ad451b92facab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the non-existence of this area of ‚Äã‚Äãreality, we are tirelessly convinced to believe, lulling us with spectacular high-budget films. <br><br>  Free energy, antigravity, space colonization, portals of time and space, extraterrestrial civilizations - everything is the same reality as everything else that surrounds us, and all this happens next to us, here and now, at these moments, and already for many years, centuries and millennia, but it was the privilege of separate groups who did not consider it necessary to devote the rest of humanity to these areas of reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d52/ac6/c63/d52ac6c632754e8131352aed7aa89b18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To see the world as it really is, and not the way we paint it, you just need to turn your ideas about it from head to foot.  For the imposed reality that now forms this collective dream has long turned everything upside down. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396609/</a></p>
