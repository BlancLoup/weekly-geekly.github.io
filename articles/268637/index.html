Years 2008-2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Year 2008, crucial </h2><br>  This year was a turning point in the history of instant messaging systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/785/9c1/39d/7859c139d3cc4ee4a25b415a06c715b0.gif" align="left">  It was in 2008 that <b>Facebook</b> instant messaging was introduced.  From the very beginning, the social network had a messaging function that looked more like an e-mail, but embedding the instant messenger into a giant social network, which at that time had 69 million active accounts, was a huge breakthrough and became one of the most significant events in terms of overall integration .  The social network already had user profiles with information about them, and they also collected lists of friends, so no one would have had to compile a list of contacts for the chat separately.  If ICQ or AIM started with messaging and expanded functionality based on this, then Facebook ‚Äúwent in‚Äù from the opposite side: collecting information about users, collecting users into interest groups and friends circles, at the time of launching the instant messaging system, FB had much more extensive "additional" (from the point of view of instant messengers) functionality than any individual program of the time.  If classic instant messengers lined up web-links between points of customers who needed communication, then Facebook was already a huge web that came to life and started talking. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Facebook‚Äôs high degree of integration as a platform that allows people to be connected in deeper and more intuitive ways has made instant messengers overloaded in the name of competitiveness with little-used functions and scattered across their individual networks less and less popular for a wide range of users.  From this point on, classic instant messengers are forced to look for new niches for further development.  One of these niches are mobile platforms. <br><br><h2>  2009 </h2><br>  In 2009, the <b>WhatsApp</b> messenger is launched - a smartphone-oriented service for instant messaging over the Internet.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/557/1ea/13c/5571ea13ce8940ac833310de36e680d7.jpg" align="left">  The technical capabilities of smartphones made it possible to transmit messages via the Network instead of SMS via mobile communication.  Soon after launch, WhatsApp published opinions that this messenger would do the same with Skype as it did with international phone calls.  WhatsApp creates an account based on your phone number, then scans the contacts in your phone and searches for the phone number of those who are already registered with the service.  This degree of integration does not require registration, authorization, contact lists, and friend additions.  If the person who is on the user's phone list is registered in WhatsApp, he automatically appears in the contact list of the messenger.  This concept was adopted by other mobile messengers. <br><br>  Straight from the phone book is taken picture for avatars.  The messenger allows you to insert a picture, video, voice recording, contact card and GPS coordinates into the chat. <br><br>  The message delivery confirmation system is implemented from the point of view of user perception as follows.  After sending the message in the interface is ticked.  When the interlocutor receives the message, a second check mark will appear.  And finally, after reading the message by the addressee, both checkboxes are marked with color. <br><br>  WhatsApp functionality allows you to create conferences with several contacts at once. <br><br>  In the same year, Skype client for iPhone was released. <br><br><h2>  2010 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94c/246/ee6/94c246ee693249d2b1752926d69e9df0.jpg" align="left">  Skype introduced support for offline chat messages.  A client for Android has been released, the trend towards mobile platforms continues. <br><br>  In ICQ 7, integration with Facebook and other websites appeared, a status bar was added.  An instant messenger and a VIP VoIP client was launched on the iPhone.  Its positive differences from competitors are in supporting push messages that are displayed on the screen of a mobile device, even if the client is turned off.  And Viber itself can run in the background. <br><br><h2>  2011 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a5/900/dbd/5a5900dbd21e468c9656874c1e70398b.jpg" align="left">  August 9, 2011 <b>Facebook Messenger for Mobile</b> was released.  By this time, most worthy messengers have already acquired or actively developed versions for mobile platforms. <br><br>  By this year, according to statistics, the popularity of <b>AIM</b> , one of the most important and previously popular classic instant messengers, has almost disappeared.  AIM used less than 1% of all clients instant messengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d45/983/510/d45983510a4e4d19b0eab782b3375151.jpg" align="left">  The largest Russian analogue of Facebook is the social network <b>Vkontakte,</b> which previously had similar to the instant messaging functionality of Facebook, this year received an important update.  New features include the creation of group conferences or channels for group communication.  Another innovation was the addition of a block with messages, which remains open when switching pages of a social network, also by analogy with Facebook.  You can still attach photos, audio and video to your messages. <br><br><h2>  2013 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e06/9aa/b19/e069aab197da40f5a933f312511d8cb3.png" align="left">  The creator and former owner of Vkontakte Pavel Durov launched the cross-platform <b>Telegram</b> messenger.  This service, focused on the international market, quickly gained popularity abroad.  The project focuses on security and privacy.  Accounts are tied to a mobile phone number, and messages use the encryption system developed by Paul‚Äôs brother.  In addition, the service supports the transfer of media content in messages with a preview, it is possible to create a conference of up to 200 participants. <br><br><h2>  2014 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c98/868/233/c988682339494bf4beff42b022aafda8.png" align="left">  The first version of <b>Tox</b> Messenger has appeared.  It provides text, voice and video communication, multi-participant conference mode, emoticon support, can transfer and change statuses.  It has an open source and message encryption system.  In fact, Tox is positioned as a free alternative to Skype.  Tox does not require registration, and the key that must be sent to the interlocutor for communication is created when you first start the program.  In addition, he has the ability to erase all the logs after the program is closed, which will please fans of conspiracy. <br><br><h2>  2015 </h2><br>  The variety of instant messengers that prevails today on the market means, above all, that the active process of finding new solutions continues.  There is no single standard that satisfies all needs.  Many people use several instant messengers at once to be able to exchange instant messages with all relatives, friends and colleagues who prefer different instant messengers, which often creates a certain discomfort.  The development of instant messaging and conversational communication does not stop. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268637/</a></p>
