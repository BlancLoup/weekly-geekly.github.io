  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The gaming unit of Mail.Ru Group on Update October 30: interactive entertainment market in the Russian Federation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habrayuzer!  On October 30, an Mail.Ru Group: Update event was held, which was attended by representatives of the gaming division of the company, headed by its Vice-President Vladimir Nikolsky and the project manager of Mail.Ru Alexander Kuzmenko.  We talked about what the game market in Russia is today, and also shared our plans for the near future.  Today's publication is devoted to market indicators. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  How much play? </h1><br><br>  The total number of players worldwide has already exceeded the landmark mark of 1 billion people.  In Russia, there is no such amount of population, but we still have our 40 million gamers.  This includes all: those who literally live in virtual worlds, those who grow crops in Odnoklassniki and those who only occasionally launch kazualki on their way to work. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59e/78b/461/59e78b4618221ca7d620a23aed1b6316.png">

    <habracut>  All points of growth are shown in detail in the table.  The most impressive dynamics of games for social networks, which from 2010 to 2011 increased by 181%.  At the end of 2011, the MMO-games segment overtook PC games and console games in terms of financial performance. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d64/629/632/d6462963227533d527b8b272173a43eb.png"><br><br>  Actually, the trend is obvious: the classic single-player PC game is a thing of the past.  Even in console games, developers pay a lot of attention to the multiplayer component.  Nevertheless, a strong single will remain the basis for console games for quite a while.  This is a giant ($ 10 billion) market with a huge installed base and an army of loyal fans around the world. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a2/31d/f68/2a231df68caaf4c05ba41e3c19016300.png"><br><br>  The number of playing audience in the Russian Federation will grow.  According to experts, by 2016 the number of gamers in Russia will exceed 60 million people. <h1>  Market volumes: how much do games earn in the Russian Federation? </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc7/0c7/13c/dc70c713c84d8bd32ec01416dfc9fd44.png"><br><br>  Although there are no billion players in Russia, our country has another billion dollars.  The volume of the domestic market of interactive entertainment in 2011 exceeded $ 1.1 billion. And most importantly, it continues to grow, confidently overtaking other types of entertainment.  The Russian gaming industry has already left behind the music and breathes in the back of the film rental.  Note, however, that the most important of the arts industries is still a concert activity with Stas Mikhailov and his companions as headliners. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9c/0f6/df7/f9c0f6df7ced849abceed196cc7e6ba0.png"><br><br>  In the context of the Internet industry, games take second place with a significant margin from web development and SEO.  The leader here is Internet advertising, but it is so closely connected with games that it is difficult to say whether the segments will exchange places, since the development of games just ‚Äúpushes‚Äù advertising that companies willingly place in hit projects. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/274/d6e/463/274d6e46352a08b64e1fa6e61fcba535.png"><br><br>  Games in the Russian Federation are increasingly attracting the attention of not only the traditional audience, but also people who previously existed with games in parallel realities.  Stars, politicians, brands and TV channels went to games.  Games have ceased to be the prerogative of a narrow circle of geeks that existed within their own universe.  More and more of those who need publicity, understand how games are an effective channel of communication.  The Russian game industry follows the same path that a western or two year ago was covered by the western one - but it does it faster.  Changing the view of gamers in the minds of the masses.  Pay attention to the situation in South Korea: the winners of the national e-sports events in this country are practically the stars of show business.  They carry in limousines, they have a crowd of fans who take packs of autographs.  Sooner or later, the Russian gaming community is also waiting. The Mail.Ru Group keeps up with the times, so our gaming unit develops all the game directions.  We deal with complex MMO-projects and casual mobile games;  the structure is quite extensive and diversified (and this deserves a separate post). We end on a positive note.  We, together with the entire domestic industry, are developing both quantitatively and qualitatively.  For example, our Allods Online has been translated into all European languages, is actively spreading on 5 continents, and has recently been launched in such a complex market as China.  Mobile development is also moving towards Asia.  Juggernaut: Revenge of Sovering and other mobile titles will be launched in South Korea and Japan soon.  Going to the market-legislator in the fantasy-MMORPG genre with its own development is not a trivial task, but difficulties do not frighten us.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about the results, but other international launches (for example, in Europe) have been very successful. We will be happy to answer all the questions in the comments, and we will also be glad to hear your wishes about the topics of future publications about our game division. <br><br>  <i>Post prepared by the team Games Mail.ru</i> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160203/</a></p>
