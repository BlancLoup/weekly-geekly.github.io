  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia creates an open base of near-Earth objects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>It is planned to add to this base also the US military satellites and their allies.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8f/5b0/b6f/b8f5b0b6f4cac5cb73df8ae4a8047142.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: TASS / Yuri Smithyuk</i> <br><br>  At the 59th session of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (held from 8 to 17 June in Vienna), the Russian delegation proposed the creation of an open information platform on space objects, Izvestia <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/619052">writes</a> .  Such a platform will include information on operating satellites and space junk.  The head of the delegation, Viktor Meshkov, also said that Russia plans to make a fully open service for issuing orbital data.  This service will provide all information on near-earth objects to everyone.

      Other data will include information that, for reasons of secrecy, is not published by the US space defense command (USSPACECOM).  This is the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) catalog.  The catalog contains information on more than 45 thousand objects running in the entire history of astronautics.  Each object has its own five-digit number NORAD ID.  At number 1 is the upper stage of the Soviet <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0-7_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9)">R-7 rocket</a> , delivered on October 4, 1957 into Sputnik-1 orbit.  The satellite itself is assigned the number 2. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost the entire NORAD catalog is in the public domain.  Various Internet services help to track those space objects that are listed in the directory.  You can find out, for example, the trajectory of any satellite.  But there is also classified information that is not publicly available.  Some data on space objects are intentionally slightly modified so that their exact location is impossible to know.  Information in NORAD is closed not only on US military satellites, but also on US allied defense satellites.  These are France, Germany, Israel and Japan.  At the same time, the catalog contains all the information on Russian military satellites.  NORAD also includes data on the latest <a href="http://ria.ru/science/20160604/1442928541.html">Russian military communications satellite</a> , which has already shown unusual mobility.  The satellite was put into orbit in June of this year. <br><br>  Information in the domestic catalog will be added regularly.  Domestic specialists can study near-earth objects without problems: the technical base resources are more than sufficient for this purpose.  Since 2010, 21 telescopes with a diameter of 19.2 to 65 cm have been manufactured by the order of Roscosmos. These systems were prepared for the ‚ÄúAutomated Warning System for Dangerous Situations in Near-Earth Space‚Äù (ASPOS OKP). <br><br>  In addition, the Ministry of Defense has its own system for monitoring near-Earth space.  This is the ‚ÄúScientific Network of Optical Instruments for Astrometric and Photometric Observations‚Äù (NSOI AFS) ", which has been operating since 2010. 31 observatories from 15 countries of the world, including Bolivia and Mexico, take part in this project. In a few years, these observatories received 54 new telescopes with a diameter of 12.5 cm to 80 cm. <br><br>  Due to this, the Russian network accompanies about 40% more objects than the American network.  In addition, domestic specialists have several times more telescopes compared to NORAD.  "... we use telescopes that have a field of view several times larger, which allows us to view much larger parts of the sky overnight and receive significantly more accurate orbits, discover more new objects," says Igor Molotov, coordinator of the NSOI AFS project, senior scientist employee of the Institute of Applied Mathematics.  Mv  Keldysh RAS. <br><br>  Now Russian experts suggest combining databases of different countries on space objects, turning the scattered information into a single directory.  The advantages of the joint catalog will be its greater completeness, accuracy and availability for virtually any country that conducts space activities.  Such a system can also be used as a system for informing about space threats, as well as for issuing information to launch services operators in the event of problems arising when launching spacecraft. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the US delegation at the 59th session of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space opposed this initiative.  At the same time, China supported the idea.  The problem, according to some experts, is that Americans do not want to give out secret information about a number of military objects. <br><br>  Many Russian scientists believe that a unified international base of near-Earth space objects should be created.  Andrei Ionin, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Cosmonautics.  K.E.  Tsiolkovsky supports the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such a base.  According to him, space junk is an international problem, and not a question that should be solved by any one country.  The same applies to the asteroid-comet hazard.  If something in space goes wrong, the whole world will have to solve the problem.  And the integrated database on near-Earth objects should become the main tool in the work of organizations that are engaged in space launches or simply study near-earth space. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395543/</a></p>
