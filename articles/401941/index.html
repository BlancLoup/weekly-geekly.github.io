Not really.  Oco's first home Wi-Fi camera came out two years ago.  During this time, the cameras have evolved markedly, leveling the line between the ‚Äúfor home‚Äù and ‚Äúfor business‚Äù segments.  Now you buy a universal camera for different tasks. <br><br>  Oco has changed its appearance, added new features and only the Ivideon service with which it works has remained unchanged.  Today, from our review, you will find out why Americans liked Oco2 so much, does it make sense to change your old camera to a novelty, who needs this device and why.

      (careful traffic) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How and where do they use the camera </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/553/330/5a1/5533305a1cb54645b610c682541811fc.jpg"><br><br>  The language will not turn to call Oco a domestic device or even say that it ‚Äúclings to the roots of the Motherland‚Äù, but there is a definite connection with Russia.  Three of our compatriots invented a camera that cost less than analogs, while being ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than ordinary Chinese surveillance cameras (through the use of Ivideon software).  With such a simple idea, the team designed the design, planned the capabilities of the device, agreed with the Chinese factory and went to the USA.  By March 2016, the US market gave a startup 80% of sales. <br><br>  The company got some money to make the camera independent of the capabilities of the Chinese supplier.  It was clear that you need to defend yourself from competitors who would like to repeat success.  In addition, we launched a fundraising for the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, where we received almost $ 200,000. Similarly, we decided to do the second camera on the basis of the Ivideon service.  In America, Oco2 began to be delivered in December last year, and in January 2017 the camera arrived in Russia. <br><br>  The main scope of Oco2 - home.  Remotely look after children, animal elderly relatives, monitor what is happening in the room, exchange voice messages.  But nothing prevents to put the camera in the office.  Under certain conditions, Oco2 will work even on the street, although it is not designed for this and there is no protection against moisture and dust in it.  Stress test in the conditions of using the camera at a low temperature (minus 16 ¬∞ C) <a href="https://markevich.by/testy-i-obzory/oco2-stress-test.html">showed</a> that the camera will work. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  <b>Optics</b> : 1920x1080, review 140 ¬∞, infrared shooting <br>  <b>Acoustics</b> : microphone / speaker <br>  <b>Memory</b> : cloud archive and slot for microSD with support for cards up to 128 GB <br>  <b>Network</b> : Wi-Fi (2.4 and 5 GHz), Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  <b>Size</b> : 65 x 45 x 25 mm, weight 137 g <br>  <b>Power supply</b> : microUSB, 5 V DC, 2.0 A (mains, can be connected to the UPS). <br><br><h2>  Complete set and appearance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/748/6f1/7cd/7486f17cdb184a61b44a071667f7d138.JPG"><br><br>  A small, compact, lightweight camera packed in a large, weighty box of thick cardboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/eee/346/9daeee3461e643d5812e84f97b514bea.JPG"><br><br>  Starting with packaging, the camera is as friendly as possible to the average user - you can tie a ribbon, having issued a kind of gift, and boldly give it to your grandmother and grandfather.

The plastic black case is designed so as not to cause rejection in the interior of any room and at the same time not attract undue attention to itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dff/45c/cf1/dff45ccf142043b7b6c89daa09870f89.JPG"><br><br>  Magnetic stand.

Grid connection and setup takes a minute: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ download the application on a smartphone or tablet ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/videonabludenie-ivideon/id464234175%3Fmt%3D8/%3Futm_source%3Dskolkovo%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Doco2">iOS</a> , <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client%26hl%3Dru/%3Futm_source%3Dskolkovo%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Doco2">Android</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/video-solutions-ivideon/9nblggh4129r/%3Futm_source%3Dskolkovo%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Doco2">Windows 10 Mobile</a> ); <br>  ‚Ä¢ connect the camera (via the app) to the same Wi-Fi network as the mobile device; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The application generates a QR code - show it to the camera. <br><br>  The camera is equipped with Ambarella chipset (the main supplier of microchips for GoPro), which allows you to shoot video in real time with a resolution of Full HD.  Thanks to IR illumination with a range of up to 10 m, you can record video in the dark.  H.264 compression standard makes it possible to increase the recording time on the SD card. <br><br>  The microphone and speaker in the camera allow you to communicate via smartphone and camera (speak and listen). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8f/3a6/814/d8f3a68142f34b2d82bd0e2d0e247078.jpg"><br><br>  The camera is on the dresser - you can see the whole room.  The viewing angle of the Oco2 is 140 ¬∞ diagonally, so that you can control the entire room with a single camera. <br><br><h2>  Video, day and night shooting </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4u9XCvwC9s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Record in the room by the light.  The camera is installed under the ceiling in the middle of the wall.  Magnetic stand allows you not only to fix the camera on metal surfaces, but also to easily adjust its position: direct up or down, turn to the sides. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJv2dvk4LFQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is how Oco2 shoots in the dark.  A wide viewing angle allows you to place the camera anywhere in the room. <br><br><h2>  Camera features thanks to the Ivideon service </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d6/42e/035/8d642e0356d741eea804fa327c7e9d90.jpg"><br><br>  One of the main problems of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù surveillance cameras is too meticulous detection.  The camera reacts to any movement and floods a ton of notifications in which useful events are difficult to separate from useless / random. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/515/f72/522/515f7252219b4da69d10bb661ff3cfb1.jpg"><br><br>  Oco2 motion and sound detectors are fine-tuned and become more accurate, which helps to avoid false positives (or the detector can be turned off).  Event notifications will be sent to mail or as push messages on mobile devices on iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile. <br><br>  Important feature: the ability to transfer access rights to the camera.  The function is activated in the mobile application in 15 seconds.  On the free tariff plan, access to the camera is provided to two other users (besides you).  On a paid home rate - four users.  And there are no restrictions on business tariffs: by placing the camera in the office, you can give access to it to all employees and customers. <br><br>  Other features of Ivideon for Oco2: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ export video from the cloud to the device - save an interesting entry directly to the phone; <br>  ‚Ä¢ organization of public broadcasts on business tariffs - post the broadcast on your website; <br>  ‚Ä¢ notifications about switching to online or offline - you will find out what is happening with the camera; <br>  ‚Ä¢ selection of the detection zone in the application - control only part of the territory, if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/763/960/c6d/763960c6ddd04751b2578b372a4a679a.jpg"><br><br>  Live broadcast from the camera is available not only on mobile devices, but also through any web browser.  Wherever there is internet. <br><br>  The Oco2 camera is integrated with <a href="https://ifttt.com/ivideon">IFTTT</a> .  This service unites devices and applications in an automatic chain of actions.  For example, you don‚Äôt want to manually turn active traffic notifications on and off depending on whether you‚Äôre home or gone.  Using the service, you can associate notifications with geolocation or, for example, with the moment when your smartphone is disconnected from your home Wi-Fi network.  Oco2 can be ‚Äúlinked‚Äù with 225 devices and applications. <br><br>  Another use case is motion detection and Philips Hue.  If the camera notices a suspicious movement, the smart lights will turn on a threatening red light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/d6c/a07/161d6ca0702647c894206584bf519287.jpg"><br><br>  Oco2 supports hybrid video recording.  At a free rate, the Ivideon camera will write all the events completely to the SD card.  The mobile application displays all events synchronized with the data on the map. <br><br>  The local recording method has a significant disadvantage: if the camera is stolen, then all data will remain on the card and disappear along with the camera.  But you can include an entry in the cloud archive (from 200 rubles per month) to fully record all events in the cloud for the last day.  Depending on the tariff plan, varies the number of days for a full record - up to several months. <br><br>  The camera records video both locally, to a memory card, and to the cloud.  If cloud storage is connected, and for some reason the Internet has disconnected, the recording will not be interrupted and will continue to the SD card.  Writing to the card is cycled: after reaching the memory limit, the old data will be deleted. <br><br><h2>  Hidden features </h2><br>  Once we are in HykTimes, let's talk about features that are not intended for ordinary users.  Questions, first of all, causes bluetooth.  It is necessary for connecting third-party devices / sensors, but this function has not yet been realized by the creators of the camera.  What will happen next, we do not know, but since it is, then why not use it?  Ivideon is integrating with OBLO Living, a home automation company.  This means that in the future Oco2 (and some other cameras) will become a full-fledged part of a smart home. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqWCj5Up0-4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Oco2 supports the Time Warp feature, which allows you to compress all videos recorded during the day into a short three-minute clip.  If you need to see, for example, at what exact time the customer entered the store, simply squeeze all the events for a day to 3 minutes.  The feature is not yet active, but we are implementing it (on the side of the cloud). <br><br>  In general, in the cloud, we have planned many useful additions.  Once you put the camera in the future, you will simply update the application for free. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  Price in <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/kamera-videonablyudeniya-oco2/">the Ivideon store on Oco2 11,990</a> rub.  The cost will not increase, but there may be another problem.  Unfortunately, Oco2 is supplied in limited quantities - the United States remains the main market for this camera.  Everything that comes to Russia is brought by us, but partners immediately bought the camera.  In general, while it is on sale, but at the end of the month may again disappear before the arrival of the new party. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 11990 rub price <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1080p HD video <br>  ‚Ä¢ 128 GB for microSD slot <br>  ‚Ä¢ 140 ¬∞ viewing angle <br>  ‚Ä¢ 12 months warranty <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hybrid recording: in the cloud or on a map <br>  ‚Ä¢ Magnetic base + fasteners <br>  ‚Ä¢ Voice messaging <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi + Bluetooth = smart home integration <br>  ‚Ä¢ Night vision <br>  ‚Ä¢ Traffic and sound notifications <br>  ‚Ä¢ MicroUSB interface supporting external battery power <br>  ‚Ä¢ All Ivideon features </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401941/</a></p>
