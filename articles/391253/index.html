  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shop without cashiers and security - it works. Swedish self catering</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  In Sweden, the first mini-market has opened, for buying a mobile phone, registering on the site and installing a specialized application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f0/ff6/e0c/4f0ff6e0ce694dd67b57c0d91819a2ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IT entrepreneur Robert Elajason does not believe in coincidences.  And it was not by chance, in his deep conviction, that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopening a mini-market without a attendant appeared.  And an enterprising Swede was inspired by a case from his own life that made him go in the middle of the night for baby food with a baby in the back seat of a car.  Then, having scattered the only bank in the house across the floor, Robert realized that he could buy a new one only in the nearest town, located half an hour away. <br><br>  Misadventures during the search for an open market with a suitable assortment with a young child in their arms, according to 39-year-old Robert, proved to be worthy of becoming part of an action-thriller.  Anyway, he came to a simple but important conclusion: in many provincial towns of Sweden and tiny villages there would be very appropriate mini-markets, available for visiting 24 hours a day.  It would seem, what is the actual novelty of the plot?  And the fact that the presence of service personnel - cashiers, security guards and administrators on duty in Robert Elijason's convenience stores is not intended by definition.

    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Swedish self catering</font> </h2><br>  The idea has already begun to materialize, and since January of this year, Robert has been successfully testing it in a small 24-hour convenience store without a cashier and cash register.  The whole process of customer service is reduced to the receipt of goods and its distribution by department and shelf.  The rest of the visitors are completely left to their own devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/943/942/9ae/9439429ae54f7558add423e1fd66b80a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The store, an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 45 square meters.  m. installed 6 surveillance cameras, scanning the entire commercial area.  In the case of hacking attempts or opening the front door for too long (more than 8 seconds), Elijason will receive an SMS notification on the mobile.  But, he smiles, there has not been a single such incident since the opening of the shop. <br><br>  Certain problems, recognizes the entrepreneur, are observed at the stage of learning to use the technology itself.  Despite the fact that there is nothing difficult for a modern person, there is no trace, some older people may not immediately appreciate the benefits of buying through the app.  The more mobile and progressive part of the population, on the contrary, took the idea immediately and with pleasure: in a couple of minutes you can load the bag with everything you need, while not losing time to stand in line at the cash desk and not deny yourself buying when there are not enough funds on the card or on your hands. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">How it works</font> </h2><br>  The assortment on the store shelves is not too diverse.  Selected the most necessary products - bread, milk, sugar, canned food, diapers, etc. Tobacco, medicines and alcohol are absent.  Most buyers are very comfortable that the payment of goods and products is carried out on the invoice sent at the end of the month. <br><br>  To access the service, Robert's clients will need to go through the registration procedure on the site, then download and install a mobile application on the phone.  The door is opened by scanning the fingerprint on the smartphone, after which the application gives the command to unlock the lock.  Purchases are also scanned by the smartphone and entered into the customer‚Äôs base, after which they are reflected in the invoice for payment once a month. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.phys.org/newman/csz/news/800/2016/inswedens1st.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A number of psychological problems encountered by older people of Viken, where Elajason lives, when using the application, made the entrepreneur think about alternative access methods.  Currently, he is pondering how to completely abandon the client identification procedure using fingerprint scanning (not every smartphone has a fingerprint scanner installed), having organized access to the store upon reading the magnetic strip of a credit card, as is the case in some banking institutions. <br><br>  The simplicity and ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù of the idea, the first results obtained during the testing phase of the ‚Äúself-service store‚Äù inspired Robert so much that he seriously thought about creating a network of such stores scattered around small Swedish towns and villages.  As a measure of popularizing the service and for organizing assistance to customers far from the world of innovative technologies, Elijason admits the presence of a consultant in the store who can spend no more than a couple of hours a day in this room. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy ambition is to spread this idea to other villages and small towns,‚Äù says Elijason.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very strange that no one has figured it out before.‚Äù  Thanks to the savings associated with the lack of need to maintain staff, open and maintain live 24-hour convenience stores in rural and provincial regions will be much easier. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://phys.org/">phys.org</a></i> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRobert Elajason looks very attractive, considering where he realizes it).  However, it‚Äôs hard not to agree that there will still be some costs in connection with the transition to a new service format. <br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
