It turned out that this is not enough, and in addition they decided that they need to know all the information about the subscriber and offer to introduce the following rules into the bill: <br><br>  Section 39. Obligations of Telecommunications Operators and Providers <br>  ... <br>  4. Telecommunication operators are obliged to install at their own expense on their telecommunications networks the technical means necessary for the authorized bodies to carry out operational search activities, conduct secret investigative (search) actions and provide temporary access to things and documents that contain information about the connection, subscriber, the provision of telecommunications services, including the receipt of services, their duration, content, transmission routes, etc., and to ensure the functioning  these technical means, as well as within their authority, facilitate the conduct of operational search activities, secret investigative (search) actions and temporary access to this information using information and telecommunication systems and prevent disclosure of organizational and tactical methods of their conduct.  Telecommunications operators are obliged to ensure the protection of these technical means from unauthorized access.

      For operators and providers, this means that they can wait for non-children's costs for equipment, personnel, protection of equipment from unauthorized access, personnel training, security.  This is an additional lever of influence on the part of the controlling authorities, another reason for the district police officer to come and check something, the operator who did something wrong there will be guilty for the next ‚Äúsign‚Äù.  I am silent about the constant requests from it is not clear who does not understand why. <br><br>  For subscribers, even more joy because besides where you went, now they want to write what you downloaded, what you watched, what you wrote.  God forbid you write something bad against the authorities, do not even think to upload a photo that degrades the honor and dignity of the official.  Did you watch a movie online yesterday and didn't pay?  Have you downloaded music?  Are you using torrent ???  Yes, you are not a citizen, you are a criminal, and you will answer for it.  It is necessary to answer, but a handful of the "elect" will answer again.  I am silent about confidential data, they are no longer as they are already stored somewhere, and we understand that in our realities this is the same thing as simply telling someone, albeit in secret. <br><br>  It is not even the fact of such an event that surprises, but the fact that such a question cannot be brought to the public in Tikhar without coordination with the public and organizations that represent this market segment. <br><br>  <b>PS As far as we understand, they want to push through this as an irregular act.</b>  <b>Therefore, it is not published anywhere.</b>  <b>As far as is known, this bill was not sent to NKRSI.</b> <br><br>  <b>For those who have questioned the authenticity of the information a letter from the Internet Association of Ukraine - <a href="http://www.inau.org.ua/52.4856.0.0.1.0.phtml">http://www.inau.org.ua/52.4856.0.0.1.0.phtml</a></b> <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Today (05.23.2013) a meeting was held in the State Enterprise on 2 issues:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>1) on the RFP on the sharing of the infrastructure of telecom networks</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2) according to the RFP of the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Article 39 of the Law of Ukraine on Telecommunications</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>InAU previously wrote letters on these topics to the State Enterprise:</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>1) Sheet number 74 of April 29, 2013 p.</b>  <b>Heads of the Government of Ukraine on the draft Law on the ‚ÄúAbout Spiral of Information Infrastructure of Telecommunications Hedgehog‚Äù</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2) <a href="http://www.inau.org.ua/52.4856.0.0.1.0.phtml">Sheet number 89 v—ñd 05/21/2013 p.</a></b>  <b><a href="http://www.inau.org.ua/52.4856.0.0.1.0.phtml">Derzh—ñdpri—îmnitstva without payment of a law to the Law of Ukraine "About the telecommunication"</a></b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>The meeting was attended by representatives of InAU, USPP, major operators, the delegation of NKRZI, headed by I.
