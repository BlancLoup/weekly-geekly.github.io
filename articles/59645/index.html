Actually, I will tell you how I solved this problem for myself.  Took and moved to New Zealand.  Well, we will not jump. <br><br>  I will tell you how and how it was, in the courtyard of 2007, I lived in Vladivostok, I was finishing graduate school, I was 25 and really wanted to improve my standard of living a little.  The university was completed in the specialty of automated control systems and there were 2.5 years of experience as a programmer in a fairly well-known Vladivostok Internet project. <br><br>  If so, the options were to go to Moscow, or where else away. <br>  I thought that I would always have time to go to Moscow, but it would have been nice to go far away.

      An example of a friend with an opportunity who left for Vancouver and tells how warm it is there, well, and the flies do not bite, they are very much urging. <br><br>  So what was done: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. English, from almost zero level, for about half a year, pulled it out on ielts 5.5 (this is an international test like this). <br>  2. I applied to the immigration agency about Canada, I was counted 58 points out of the necessary 64, offered to try to go.  For my money and without guarantees, the price of an attempt is $ 4k.  As it did not dare, and I passed the ielts, not directly so that would be very good. <br>  3. I applied for a STINI visa to Australia (sponsored by the state), looking now at that resume, I understand that I had no chance then.  The failure came.  Placed on Australia really very high expectations. <br>  4. The agency mentioned immigration through training and disappeared.  Hook!  Prosherstil Internet on this topic. <br>  5. From what I found, I realized that the money itself would be enough only for Zealand, and of course there seemed to be the softest policy for people like me. <br>  6. I found an agency that made me English in Auckland for the ‚Äúmodest‚Äù amount. (I would have known how much I really would have done it myself, but I knew nothing) <br><br>  While this was happening, he taught English - courses, tutor.  Saving money.  Sold all kinds of cars / things. <br><br>  7. Gone are the documents for the visa, ielts on hand.  Went to Moscow - was struck by the difference in life.  Received an invitation to work in Moscow for money raising my salary several times. <br>  8. Airplane, Vladivostok-Seoul-Auckland, tickets there and back with an open date. <br>  9. I came, I realized that English was 0, I went to school for a month, and I was away from the country <br>  10 I had permission for 20 hours of work per week (ielts was useful here), and one of the new acquaintances asked if I wanted to earn some money, but why not. <br>  11. I went after school to work at the minimum rate, work was 10 times easier than it was in Vladivostok. <br>  12. Because of not attending school, problems started, I talked at work ‚Äî they raised a bit of money and signed an immigration paper. <br>  13. After 3 months was on a work visa. <br>  14. After a year of work, filed for a residence permit. <br>  15. 1.5 years after the arrival, I was given a residence permit, I can live in this country for as long as possible and practically without any conditions, as well as: vote, receive unemployment benefits and so on. <br><br>  Now I live in a 2 bedroom house 10km from work, a lawn with barbecue, 2 cars and a motorcycle.  There are no credits except credit cards. <br>  Traveled during this time almost all of Zealand.  English pulled up and allows you to communicate without any problems. <br><br>  There is no doubt that Zeeland has its drawbacks, but they, as if to tell you, are not global and do not interfere with life. <br><br>  If anyone is interested in how it is in terms of money, then here, taking into account the crisis and so on.  money is two times less than for example in Canada, but you can live. <br>  And food for example is cheaper, with normal quality. <br><br>  Probably, it would be necessary to put it in ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59645/</a></p>
