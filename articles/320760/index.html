But how to quit, and, more importantly, when to quit - almost no one says anything.  It is understandable, the topic is very delicate and sometimes unpleasant.  However, I will try to partially fill this gap. <br><br>  And, of course, all that is said below is an exclusively personal and extremely subjective opinion.  Therefore, if you find in the text the words ‚Äúshould,‚Äù ‚Äúshould,‚Äù read it as ‚Äúthe author would do‚Äù, but what you do is up to you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, for my relatively small labor activity, I derived several basic signs (signals) at the appearance of which and their systematic repetition, I begin to look for a new job (or new partners). <br><br>  The main and fundamental is respect. <br><br>  The fact that the company pays you money does not give her (the company) any reason to treat you as a go.  Even if you lead a small segment of work, even if the results of your work are not so obvious in the results of the company. <br><br>  It is important to remember and not to forget one elementary thing - the company pays money, yes;  but you give your company time.  If money is a renewable resource, then there is no time.  At 25 years old - this is not so obvious.  In 35 years already thinking.  And in 45 you bite your elbows for puffing all the weekend a few months for the sake of raising, which you never received. <br><br>  But this does not mean that all requests (and even requirements) to work overtime "because ahtung!" Should be rejected.  No, you just need to do what the American proverb teaches us: ‚Äúfor what has been done, they do not require payment‚Äù.  Either you get something, or you send those who ask to rest on yukh.  And profit for you is not necessarily money.  Sometimes the project you are working on can beautifully ‚Äúlie down‚Äù in your CV.  Or work can give you access to resources, thanks to which you can work on something of your own.  Or maybe in the future you can become a partner.  You just always have to clearly define for yourself what you get from being overworked. <br><br>  On the other hand, a systematic and regular backlog of deadlines, constant breakthroughs, forced work on weekends (and further, further, further) more likely characterizes more problems with planning than with execution.  And if you get into such a company / team, where everything always ‚Äúburns‚Äù, then you will receive a bonus to your salary (possibly with retention): periodic nerves of nerves;  increasing the number of cigarettes smoked, reducing potency and stubble.  Do you need it?  Especially girls. <br><br>  Well, let's go back to the question of respect.  For me, the signal of a disrespectful attitude is primarily the appearance of phrases in rhetoric and controversy like: ‚Äúyou get paid for it‚Äù, ‚Äúthere is no irreplaceable‚Äù, ‚Äúthere are people on the street who wish‚Äù and so on in any languages.  This kind of threat is a signal. <br><br>  Again, only if this outrage appears regularly.  After all, tomorrow you can quarrel with your wife / husband / cat, give up with hot excess and in the morning already and you are not quite adequate with a sore head.  So individual breakdowns - ‚Äúthis is the norm‚Äù (c), after all we are humans, not robots (for now). <br><br>  Another thing, when disrespectful, boorish or prejudiced attitude is something for granted.  So one of my friends deliberately tolerates sometimes humiliating conditions, when the boss in critical (and even not very) situations can only talk with obscenities and only in raised voices.  Once, as a witness of such a hysterical call on Saturday (!) Somewhere after 22:00 (!), I asked him: ‚ÄúWell, what the hell are you tolerating?  With your experience, with your knowledge ... ".  Arguments are standard: the salary is above the market average, an interesting project, excellent office location, mortgage and blah blah blah. <br><br>  I am convinced that any interaction with people who treat you without proper respect, or even scornfully, is extremely harmful.  The thing is that with time, no matter how awesome a strong person you are, you start to get used to it.  Your perception of yourself begins to ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù with the attitude of others to you.  And all this always ends very badly.  There is no joke. <br><br>  Yes, perhaps, having left such work in the moment you lose something, but not a year goes by how you evaluate your decision and significantly increase your own self-esteem. <br><br>  The second criterion for me is responsibility.  It should have more or less clear boundaries and should be complete. <br><br>  In other words, you must understand what you are responsible for and what your opportunities are in the area entrusted to you. <br><br>  Here I will give myself as an example.  Working on one very large project, I led the front-end part.  Accordingly, all the issues registered by users of the rebound flowed to me from the head of the company in the form of not the most pleasant reviews and questions.  It is not difficult to guess what impression gradually developed about me, as a specialist.  But the whole zest was that most of the problems arose as a result of disputes with the project curator (manager).  Many of the solutions proposed by me (as a developer) were wrapped up and rejected, but a week later a dozen reports arrived about problems from the end users.  As a result, many things were altered at least twice, or even three times, but almost always, as a result, what was originally proposed by me was realized.  Alas, I failed to turn the tide and said my legitimate and reasonable "goodbye."  Because if you are responsible for something (and even more so you hear the terrible such ‚Äúit's your responsibility‚Äù), then you should have the opportunity to make decisions. <br><br>  It also happens that your immediate supervisor shows excessive insistence on choosing what to do and how: what technology to use, how to solve certain tasks and so on.  Scientifically, this is called the ‚Äúexecutor syndrome‚Äù - this is when a person himself is no longer a performer, but must deal with issues of planning and organization, but due to his own fears and indecision he buries himself into a routine that he shouldn‚Äôt do at all, but must delegate.  Let's be honest - this is the soreness of all young leaders (not in the sense of age), but there are cases when the problem becomes chronic and work with such a person becomes very difficult.  But, and in the absence of feedback from the higher management, in such situations sometimes there is no other way out than dismissal. <br><br>  Another example is the systematic work of the company without any plans and development schedules.  Literally on the fly.  Typically, in such companies, design, development and testing issues are thrown together, which makes the distribution of responsibility almost impossible.  If it is, then the problem with the probability close to 1 lies, that is, sits in the director's office.  Accordingly, if you don‚Äôt call for Don Quixote, then there‚Äôs absolutely nothing to do there. <br><br>  It is a paradox, but sometimes it is very comfortable to work in such kind of teams.  On the one hand, no one is directly responsible for anything;  on the other, there is a catastrophe every day, and the collective is a glorious army fighting shoulder to shoulder, which to some extent even unites.  The head is usually a rather emotional person, not without charisma, able to speak and promise (‚Äúlet's make a project, get an order, finish it and yes, yes, yes, we need to reconsider the organization of business processes).  But ... Personally, you will get almost nothing good from working in this team: neither experience, nor satisfaction from the results. <br><br>  The last criterion is very subjective, but I cannot say anything about it.  These are opportunities for self-realization and experience.  This is not about career growth - it is about experience and who you are primarily in your own eyes. <br><br>  I can say this about experience: your salary may not increase in a year or two, but the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of your resume is simply bound to increase.  Thus, if work somehow leads to a ‚Äúrise in price‚Äù for CV, then this is an acceptable option, and depending on future plans, you can make some compromises regarding, for example, the level of current earnings.  And on the contrary, if all your experience (regardless of the number of years) ‚Äúrevolves‚Äù around a couple of duties, one technology and one project, then you should think about how much you will ‚Äúcost‚Äù in the market in 2-3 years. <br><br>  No less briefly about self-actualization - if you are an intelligent specialist, if there really is something in your head, then after a very short time you will receive advice and you will be included in parallel projects as an invited expert whose opinion is valuable. and authoritatively.  This is exactly what happens in companies with a properly built system of motivation and verified business processes. <br><br>  Thus, if I feel (yes, it‚Äôs rather a matter of instinct) that I, very roughly speaking, tread on the spot, that I can‚Äôt really imagine what kind of sensible line in the CV I will describe, what I spent another year on - I try Do not waste time. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Of course, everything said above makes sense if we are talking about a responsible attitude to our work, about the desire to work and develop.  It is not much effort to become just a ‚Äúcog in the system‚Äù, but to be proud of yourself is a completely different story. <br><br>  In addition, we must not forget about the character.  We are all different and that one is a dream job, for another hell.  So in no case do not treat this post as a guideline and even more so as ‚Äúleadership to actions‚Äù. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  In conclusion, a few words about myself, to indicate the presence of a background though not so rich.  My work experience (that is, from the day I began to regularly receive money for my work) is ~ 20 years.  Of these, about 10 years is generally from the field of finance and insurance, where I went from an office clerk to a company director and co-founder.  6-7 years is IT, then my movement is mostly horizontal.  The remaining 3-4 years - work for the sake of money and entertainment exclusively - youth, what can I take from it? <br><br>  In total, I changed 12 - 14 positions for all these years (not companies, but positions) and formed my own basis for assessing "whether I want to work here or not" during this time. <br><br>  I sincerely wish everyone to engage in the fact that it‚Äôs fun and to communicate mainly with those who make your life bright and positive.  Remember the time, even if you are 25 years old. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320760/</a></p>
