  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the level of demand for PHP developers for Q1 2019?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the labor market, PHP programmers are among the most sought-after specialists.  Over the past 3 years, their popularity among employers has grown by more than 12%.  PHP is the most common open-source general-purpose programming language; many of our clients use it in development, so in our requests from employers we often meet with the need for programmers working with this particular language.  In the article we analyzed the labor market of PHP developers, formed the level of wages based on the salary expectations of applicants and the capabilities of companies, and also revealed the level of employers' interest in hiring PHP specialists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/q2/vl/nu/q2vlnud9cf2certson8nup10-uk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Universal Soldier </h3><br>  PHP language is interpreted and compilation is not needed for its work, ‚Äúthe result of the execution can be seen immediately after it is executed‚Äù.  Today, important modern commercial industries are based on PHP, such as software development, work on web portals, online stores, many electronic media, the banking system and, more recently, the electronic education system, which has been in demand for more than 3 years from 2015 to 2018. than 38%, 13% of government projects. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/5y/3g/um/5y3gummhpykbh7psxxbirwe7xvs.jpeg" alt="image">

    <h3>  What kind of specialist do you need? </h3><br>  Novice Junior programmers should have object-oriented programming skills, experience with HTML, MySQL, PHP.  Graduates of technical and IT faculties of colleges and universities, who wish to try their strength in PHP programming, in the capital can claim a salary of up to 80,000 rubles, in St. Petersburg up to 63,000, and in the regions an average of up to 51,000 rubles is Gross. <br><br>  PHP programmers of the ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù level, who have experience in adapting CMS systems, developing and launching Internet sites, web applications, understanding user interface usability, and understanding other people's code, can rely on a higher salary.  The earnings of specialists who meet the specified requirements in Moscow vary up to 130,000 rubles, in the northern capital - up to 95,000, in the regions up to 76,000 Gross. <br><br>  Senior-level developers know JavaScript, XML, Ajax, speak English at a level sufficient to read technical documentation.  Skills in work in the environment of Linux / UNIX, experience of setup and administration of web servers (Apache), version control systems are in demand.  Employers require experienced PHP programmers to have an excellent knowledge of this language and MySQL.  The best proof of the professionalism of applicants will serve as a portfolio of work performed.  PHP programmers of this level earn up to 210,000 rubles in Moscow, up to 170,000 in St. Petersburg, and a bit more than 120,000 Gross in the regions. <br><br><h3>  Let's talk about money </h3><br>  Based on the analysis of the labor market of PHP programmers for the first quarter of 2019, requests received from companies, as well as data from hh.ru, we compiled PHP salary charts for specialists from Moscow, St. Petersburg and the regions divided into years of work experience, because that HRs are often oriented in drawing up salary offers precisely for this level: without work experience, with minimal experience, with experience, with considerable experience. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/zq/ph/xnzqphdnddvpz-quruevraixvse.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/a_/an/bb/a_anbbppzzpgmrrw219_c0ojama.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since the highest salaries were recorded in Moscow, IT ATLAS analysts decided to track down the growth dynamics of PHP programmers at the Senior level and came to the conclusion that wages, starting from 2015, increased annually by about 15-20%, and the trend is likely to continue in the near future. <br><br>  What is the situation in the regions?  Again, according to the first half of 2019, the gross wages in the regions are inferior to the capital by about 30%.  In spite of such a run, this figure exceeds the figures for 2018 by almost 5% - a good result for IT companies, most of which are private. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/li/n9/ollin9szyc8nfbhw0fvdu_huckw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  If we summarize and summarize the capitals and regions, as of the first quarter of 2019, 325 vacancies are open in the ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù, ‚ÄúMiddle‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù competencies in Russia by the profession ‚ÄúPHP Developer‚Äù.  For 49.2% of open vacancies, employers indicated a salary in the amount of 50,600 - 70,500 rubles, 20.3% of advertisements with a salary of 79,400 - 106,300 rubles, and 16.1% with a salary of 112,500 - 210,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="http://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/bl/sy/ssblsyrpwyvie_gd3-57bxtqa4c.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the survey results, out of 400 PHP programmers, 150 are ready to work on complex tasks in emergency mode, 80 of them can really ‚Äúpull‚Äù burning projects.  The easiest option to check a new candidate is to appoint a mentor or control by the project manager. <br><br>  In 2018, educational institutions of the capital produced more than 5,000 specialists with specialized knowledge of the PHP language, an annual increase of about 6% for 2019.  The figure for Russian employers who need developers is small.  However, as part of the total increase in graduation of students enrolled in IT specialties, which is 19%, it looks much more weighty.  In other words, to find a decent PHP developer of any level of competence for an acceptable wage is real, you just need to know where to look. <br><br>  In the following articles we will explain where to find good PHP developers, give specific recommendations and links to resources.  We will be happy if our forecasts and search channels will help programmers and employers to reunite, for all other cases there is a professional IT recruiters help.
