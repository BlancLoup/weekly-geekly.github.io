  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 years "on the knee" and forced evolution - note for young</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Hello, have a seat </h4><br>  All of us here, we regularly try something, experiment, often in the context of ‚Äúlet me try‚Äù.  At the output we get a kind of intermediate result in the form of something functioning, but not suitable for use in business.  At least without bringing to mind, which will be discussed in the article, at the end of which it will reach a full-fledged API and related utilities that accompany the life of the author at a more industrial level. <br><br>  On the eve of the 28th anniversary, I decided to certainly touch on this topic with an eye now for 10 years of experience, recalling all the stuffed cones.  The topic was given attention due to the huge amount of time we spend on our studies, the result of which we often don‚Äôt use, but we can! <br><br><h4>  Do not blush tomorrow </h4><br>  Once, the handicraft on the shelf becomes useful in work, but when we did it, we did not pay attention to accuracy, the handicraft article is of functional value, but the appearance does not allow us to put it out to the public - cutting out Pinocchio, keep your hands clean so as not to slap. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Keep everything ready </h4><br>  From the car, standing in the courtyard with a flat tire, there is no benefit.  As there is no benefit from the forgotten, on the knee of the assembled project, not brought to mind in time.  When we achieve an interesting and even useful result, we rejoice and immediately forget about what we did, switch to something else, more interesting, without even keeping the minimum information from the head on how to start up, a brief working principle and information to reproduce the result.

    <h4>  Tell about achievements to your environment </h4><br>  They will never ask for a service for the one whose services they know nothing about.  Therefore, if you are an expert in any field, you should know about you!  As a specialist - talk about what you live, what you do professionally, about less professional hobbies.  This is comparable to the restaurant's sign - let's understand that you can turn to for something specific, keep a bright sign on your ‚Äúfacade‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Keep your designs in beautiful boxes. </h4><br>  When a visitor comes to the restaurant and asks for tea, he expects a pleasant drink - hot, fragrant, tasty and with the ability to sweeten to taste.  When people turn to us for a service, we should present it in a similar way, offer an additional portion of ‚Äúsugar‚Äù or ‚Äúdessert‚Äù to it.  I would like to dwell on this in more detail: in the box, the same thing, on my knee, was the once collected thing, which had not once been of great interest to the public.  But the world is so arranged that everyone remembers and stores in the subconscious, and when this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù becomes really necessary, you are surely remembered. <br><br><h4>  When there are a lot of beautiful boxes </h4><br>  Collect projects together, offer a range of services, bring to the new level all that you already have behind you.  Everything that is done with the soul and for oneself is often a very high-quality product - a product that cannot be compared with the product of large corporations for filling.  Your product is unique.  Promote him. <br><br><h4>  I will not succeed </h4><br>  Immediately, yes, probably will not work, but 10 times - definitely!  Each iteration occurs at a different time, in a different environment, in a different time of year, a different economic situation, and so on.  Even just repeating the attempt a year later, not soaring a year ago, can jerk like a rocket.  Recall the Nike slogan - ‚ÄúJust do it!‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  For those who waited for the technical unit </h4><br>  We are moving to a more technical language and let's look at all the "boxes" that they are.  In my case, this is a service: for data processing, external requests, interfacing with the world - for short.  Imagine that you once learned how to parse a television program‚Äôs television program because you once loved one series and preferred to receive a notification from a script about an impending series.  Or, perhaps, you are so skillfully using Arduino and similar things, that the TV even turned on itself at the right time, provided that your phone is in view of your home WiFi.  It seems to be simple, but then it will roll and gather dust ... <br><br>  But just think, in our world there are companies selling digital TV services, they all need TV programs - a spark between the meanders already slipped through?  Over the years, your paths will surely cross with those who are interested in this information and your cooperation will be very fruitful.  It was the simplest example, when a hopeless script is able to generate income in the future, and so on in everything! <br><br>  How much I read about those who analyze the captcha on the Russian Post website to track shipments, how many I saw sincerely touched people who learned about the existence of the API from the Russian Post itself - all these people invented something similar to the repetition of the bike.  When my surroundings matured with me, our views somehow changed, what we did earlier from the series ‚Äúsolve the problem head-on with scrap‚Äù now was done with the groundwork for the future. <br><br>  Using the example of the same Russian Post and tracking items, a task that a friend had at work was no longer simply realized by his own forces for the company, but by his own efforts for his company and other companies ‚Äî the service that would work for one company could now work for many companies, the only difference is that the more ‚Äústoned‚Äù brain realized the task not in the context of a particular case, but brought it to the level of a separate service, access to which the company paid for the implementation became free, but the fussy team of developers  I was able to capitalize on the provision of this service and other costs without special resources.  Just imagine how many times a 1C programmer encounters a similar task when the whole world revolves around the same data ... raw data ... <br><br><h4>  And what's next? </h4><br>  Solid ground under your feet, nights without sleep and putting the puzzle together - this is the way that I recommend not repeating and embedding them into the overall picture as the puzzle pieces appear, but I will tell you for a common understanding why everything should be done immediately and properly. <br><br><h5>  From side to side </h5><br>  Once I was brought to Vkontakte's applications, I never worked with him and did not write something like that, but I was not averse to shoving my nose.  This is just another experience, which affected the choice of the further vector of development of my paranoia, but paranoia is a protective mechanism of the body, it must be reckoned with, which I did.  So what was it so scary?  In principle, nothing.  Nothing but people: schoolchildren, students who were interested in breaking something, tearing someone‚Äôs template and then writing, they say, this is how cool I‚Äôve found a hole in the application.  Although I never had the chance to personally encounter such cases, but the path of development was chosen to be special. <br><br><h5>  Meanwhile </h5><br>  Amazon visited Moscow for the second time with the presentation of its services - AWS.  In short, this whole ‚Äúshobla‚Äù of services makes it very flexible to build a system that is resistant to increasing loads.  In general, the brain has expanded in the right direction and an understanding of how everything should be, taking into account the new information on the technical capabilities of short-term attraction of huge resources to meet the needs.  By the way, you can rent a very powerful server for one hour and process a huge ton of data that fell, for example, during a promotional event.  It will be very cheap against the background of statically working servers.  I also did not want to miss this opportunity and took it into account in the development, which at that time had been delaying for months already, as if in anticipation of new input data. <br><br>  The second part deals with the details and the process of developing the policy of building an API, the first pitfalls and the first service launched based on the new development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263117/</a></p>
