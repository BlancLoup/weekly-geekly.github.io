  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use color psychology to increase conversion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To form an opinion about the product, a user needs <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00251740610673332">90 seconds</a> .  The decisive role in the opinion of users is rendered by the chosen color range.  Color controls the emotions of visitors and determines the attitude to the site and the brand as a whole.  When you look at a color, your eyes interact with a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain, known as the hypothalamus.  It sends a signal in the hypotheses to the endocrine system, and then to the thyroid gland.  And the thyroid gland gives a signal for the production of special hormones that affect mood, emotions and behavior. <br><br>  QuickSprout's <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/01/24/how-colors-affect-conversion-rate/">Neil Patel</a> claims that 85% of color affects the decision to purchase a product.  Therefore, many companies invest a lot of money in research and the creation of selling packaging for their goods.  The same rule also works for selling sites: use the correct colors and you will always win. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Which elements to use color?</b> </h4><br>  Since there is color everywhere, you should decide at the very beginning what color scheme to use.  If you are making a selling site for children, use the green-yellow-red logo, phone number, menu, headlines.  Your task is to cause positive emotions in parents, which is why it is recommended to use more bright and saturated colors.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c25/410/893/c254108939484fb283349e468bfbccbf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to choose the right color scheme, you must follow the following principles: <br><br><ul><li>  correct color for the subject; </li><li>  the right color for the target audience; </li><li>  correct color depending on time; </li><li>  correct color for each target action. </li></ul><br>  Here are some key tips on how professionals use colors in their work. <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Women do not like gray, orange and brown.</b>  <b>They love blue, purple and green.</b> </h4><br>  There are large differences between color preferences for women and men.  Neath Patel revealed which colors are preferred for each gender. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/de6/f5f/4cdde6f5f31846bb8dd97fa8a2774de4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In a survey conducted by him, 35% of women said that blue is their favorite color, then purple (23%) and green (14%).  33% of women admitted that orange and brown were their most unloved colors, besides this, gray (17%) was also attributed to the most unloved women. <br><br>  Very clearly, the results of this survey confirm the WomansDay website, they use blue and purple on their home page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/dac/1b1/0e5dac1b1e6243dcb0175761968002f9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a paradigm that women love pink.  But it is not.  Only a small percentage of women chose pink as their favorite.  Therefore, it is recommended to use inserts of blue, violet and green colors in e-commerce sites.  This will improve the attractiveness of your site for women and increase conversion. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. Men do not like purple, orange and brown.</b>  <b>They are closer to blue, green and black.</b> </h4><br>  If you are selling products for men, then do not use purple, orange and brown as the primary colors of your site.  This may alienate a potential buyer.  The traditional colors for the male audience are blue and black.  These colors are associated with masculinity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d4/6aa/c35/8d46aac3559940b984681c98131522bc.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>3. Use blue if you want to inspire confidence among users.</b> </h4><br>  Blue is the most common color.  Not surprising, because it is he who is most preferable for both men and women.  Here are some other associations that blue color causes: <br><br><ul><li>  It is the color of trust, peace and order; </li><li>  Blue is the main corporate color in the USA (Intel, Dell, HP, IBM, etc.); </li><li>  He evokes feelings of calm and serenity. </li></ul><br>  Most of the scientific community is inclined to believe that the blue color causes confidence and calm.  And it is not surprising why the largest social network in the world uses precisely blue as the main one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/344/85b/9d1/34485b9d18f343b581fe865680692c08.png" alt="image"><br><br>  PayPal also prefers this color.  This color scheme helps to create trust from users.  If PayPal used red or orange as the main color, they would probably have less popularity in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/8e8/4c7/ab28e84c7b284897ad5a176424ed330b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Blue color is often used by banks and credit organizations.  For example, VTB24 uses it as the primary color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/fa9/634/583fa96342434668a20662d31a40849c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the fact that blue is a very common color, it is by no means recommended to use it when designing websites that relate to food and nutrition.  Evolutionary theory suggests that blue is associated with poison.  Therefore, never use blue if you are selling gourmet products. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Yellow - warning color.</b> </h4><br>  Yellow is used in warning signs, traffic lights and road markings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a9/275/181/4a92751817614501905ae463beb16e84.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It seems strange, because it is known that the yellow color is the color of happiness.  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/branding-and-the-psychology-of-color-2012-12%3Fop%3D1">Business Insider</a> reports that ‚Äúbrands use yellow to show that they are interesting and benevolent.‚Äù According to this hypothesis, yellow causes a sense of playfulness.  However, yellow probably stimulates the excitation of the central part of the brain, and playfulness is simply a consequence of a state of heightened emotionality, and not pure joy. <br><br>  The psychology of color is closely related to memory and experience.  So, if you constantly wore a yellow shirt, lived in a house with yellow walls and ate in fast food centers with yellow arches, then the yellow color you can cause joy, due to the association with memorable events in your life. <br><br>  Yellow can cause anxiety, so try to use yellow color in small quantities, as this can lead to the loss of your customers. <br><br><h4>  <b>5. Green is perfect for decoration.</b> </h4><br>  Green is associated with nature, clean ecology and the environment.  If the theme of your site is related to nature (construction, air conditioners, etc.), then it is recommended to use green color to make users associate with cleanliness and ease. <br><br>  Green is the most common color to use in buttons.  So SpringSled, known for its strategy to attract customers, uses exactly the green color in the design.  Therefore, green is the perfect color for a call to action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/251/df0/e7e/251df0e7e5914e6d83ec1663a7588a96.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The use of green will have a positive impact on the site and will improve the reputation among those who are puzzled by environmental issues. <br><br><h4>  <b>6. Orange is fun.</b> </h4><br>  The positive side of the orange color is that it can be used to invoke a cheerful mood.  According to some reports, orange helps stimulate physical activity, competition and self-confidence.  Maybe that's why orange is actively used by sports teams (for example, the Dutch national team) and in children's products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/6bf/3bf/6566bf3bffee4cacbaca4e9f7d2c17d5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Amazon uses orange to design the Kindle page.  Orange color means relevance, which makes the message more visible and effective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/070/d5d/f22/070d5df223084ed2985c3fd60520971f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Orange means pleasure and togetherness.  Sometimes, orange is interpreted as ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù  It is enough to compare orange with the color of luxury - black.  Therefore, if you are selling a product in the cheap price segment, it is recommended to use this color when designing the site elements. <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Black adds a sense of luxury.</b> </h4><br>  The darker the background, the greater the luxury.  An article from Lifescript describes black as "elegant, refined, strong."  Therefore, most high-class designers use black for e-commerce sites.  Black is also described as ‚Äútimeless, classic‚Äù.  This helps explain the use of black in high value-added products. <br><br>  Black can also be considered a luxurious color.  Black is also glamor, sophistication, exclusivity. <br><br>  Just open the D &amp; G website, everything will fall into place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/357/98e/4fe/35798e4fe7e241458b5e3382b54d82ae.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Black color is actively used by automakers.  Here, for example, Lamborghini website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/e2d/f1f/f95e2df1f7c7432e9bf493d5eec5604f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you sell expensive luxury items, be sure to use black in the design of the site to give a special elegance and exclusivity. <br><br><h4>  <b>8. Use bright colors for a call to action.</b> </h4><br>  The most common colors for a call to action are: red, green, orange, yellow.  Darker colors like black, brown, or purple have low conversion rates, unlike bright colors. <br><br>  Russian ebay uses red for pop-up windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/f24/ac1/4ddf24ac15e241ddb97e8f107c9a075f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Aliexpress uses orange on the main buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d9/60f/88b/6d960f88b76547919913cbb7746891da.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Orange is associated with ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, but if you want to capture the attention of users, then use this color. <br><br><h4>  <b>9. Do not neglect white.</b> </h4><br>  Abundant use of white space is a powerful design element.  Take, for example, the most popular site in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4b/9d0/26e/a4b9d026ee594f5790f91a15c66715d3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Most well-designed sites today use white to create a sense of freedom and lightness. <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  If you use color in the right direction, at the right time, for the right audience, and for the right purpose, you can achieve very good results.  The more freedom you have in color, the better.  Here are some tips to make your site better: <br><ul><li>  <b>Test colors</b> .  No need to dwell on one particular color.  Check various color combinations to find out which color your target audience likes more. </li><li>  <b>Do not drive into the ‚Äúcolor frame‚Äù of your designer</b> .  When working with a designer, do not put him strict conditions on the use of the same color. </li><li>  <b>Watch for color performance</b> .  Do not forget that your goal is not to create a design that will look cool on dribble.  Beauty is nice, but the main task of the site is to sell.  Do not forget about it. </li><li>  <b>Avoid overloading colors</b> .  Do not try to use all the colors at once in the same design.  This can lead to sad consequences.  Too many colors can create a sense of confusion. <br></li></ul><br>  The material is based on an article from <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/psychology-of-color-and-conversions/">the Kissmetrics blog</a> .
