      But the ‚Äúlive‚Äù meeting put everything in its place: the Xperia active device is certainly an interesting, but in fact, niche.  Very necessary for a certain category of buyers, but for the rest - a toy.  The toy is bright - it was very difficult to pull it out yesterday, everyone wanted to take a picture of it and dip it into the water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0385683a/1a12078d/c4ecdde0/5d084279.jpg"><br>  <i>Give everything!</i> <br><br>  But I will tell about it below.  For now - impressions from Sony Ericsson Xperia ray. <br><br><h4>  Fruits of evolution </h4><br>  In literature and cinema, there is such a genre, an alternative story - telling about how events could develop, if something happened to history is wrong. <br><br>  By the middle of zero, the thinnest, striving for geometric rigor in the form of a monoblock, became the most popular telephone.  It‚Äôs just worth reminding how the most popular and even legendary Sony Ericsson phone models of those years looked like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8ae44d1a/43f21d74/48aa65a4/e7f0f73b.jpg"><br>  <i>Sony Ericsson K770i</i> <br><br>  Now imagine what these phones would look like, don‚Äôt go the evolution of the telephone form factor in the direction of crossing phones and handhelds.  Of course, they would become thinner and sleeker.  Most likely, the size of the screen within the standard dimensions would have increased, and the number of hardware buttons became smaller - because, anyway, the big screen provides more flexible phone control options.  In general, they would look like Xperia ray: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bc39c4c0/06907ca4/d809804a/25fee32c.png"><br><br>  The peculiarity of this phone is that it looks like a bridge between the classic mid-size (almost compact today) monoblocks with a proprietary OS and smartphones proper.  On the one hand - a compact body and a rigorous design, on the other hand - the screen in the entire front panel (3.3 "with a resolution of 854x480 pixels - the" grain "of pixels is not visible at all) and the newest version of Android inside. <br><br>  In hand, the phone is comfortable, creating a feeling of high-quality, tightly knit things.  Aluminum perimeter edging works on the impression of high cost of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/503672ce/63c3559f/4f433f5d/a2a652bb.jpg"><br><br>  By tactile sensations, he reminded me of my beloved old Sony Ericsson W660i, and I think that the owners of the good old Sony Ericsson will feel a pleasant d√©j√† vu in connection with this model. <br><br>  Such a phone can be bought by a conservative user who needs ‚Äúa phone just to call,‚Äù you can give him to a girl who uses the No air gap technology (minimum air gap between the matrix and glass) to use the screen as a mirror, it will look appropriate in the briefcase business person and in the pocket of the student, they can use a housewife and an active lady.  Such versatility is a feature of classics, and Xperia ray is a classic in a modern incarnation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e9efc46d/e412a94a/738d3c12/fa3a1c93.jpg"><br>  <i>Four body colors.</i> <br><br>  And with a modern filling.  In the past, I wrote the material, but I repeat that all Sony Ericsson models of this year are based on the same platform - Qualcomm + Android 2.3 Gingerbread gigartz processor.  The Xperia ray camera is an 8.1 megapixel camera with an Exmor R back light array, digital zoom, HD video recording, autofocus and face detection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9bd9cfa9/f2558003/528e639e/d2640406.jpg"><br>  <i>The speakers in the back are like three smiling faces.</i> <br><br>  And of course the very first issue on the presentation was the prices - the Sony Ericsson Xperia ray will be on sale in the third quarter with a recommended price of 16,490 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Unsinkable </h4><br>  The compact but bright Sony Ericsson Xperia active has become a real star of the presentation: everyone wanted to touch it and drown it.  Fortunately, the event was even a special aquarium.  Everyone could make sure that the phone works under water, receives calls, and if you click on the answer under water, it produces real ‚Äúsounds of the sea‚Äù.  Unfortunately, there are no underwater photos from the presentation - let's leave it for the future test;) <br><br>  The phone screen perfectly perceives pressing with wet fingers, working adequately and without glitches.  This functionality is called Wet fingers, which has been the subject of many jokes at the meeting (‚ÄúCan we arrange a contest of wet fingers?‚Äù).  Well, a nice bonus for those who are 3 "-inch screen still seems too small - due to the effect of water refraction, the display in the aquarium looks much larger :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/db8a2e53/d07be5b3/814d4ab7/d61a6d00.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the device turned out to be pleasant - like the Xperia mini close in size, it lies comfortably in your hand, the soft-touch plastic of the back cover is still pleasant to the touch, and the aluminum frame around the case gives the impression of indestructibility.  By the way, the ‚Äúear‚Äù for mounting at the bottom does not break off and break, because  It is part of this frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cfc4da4b/d2f49c54/e9735ed6/a2b7708e.jpg"><br><br>  But, of course, protection from extreme conditions is not a goal, but rather a necessity for a phone designed for people leading an active lifestyle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f754ff53/34d8e7a1/f3e7d752/22ac75b6.jpg"><br><br>  The main thing in it is still a set of functionality that allows you to control your activity.  As I wrote in the announcement, Xperia active is able to monitor heart rate and count the pulse.  He does it not literally - you will not attach it to your heart, but with the help <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT%2B">of the ANT + chip</a> , which, in turn, interacts with sensors of various types, including heart rate meters. <br><br>  Thus, the phone will play the role of a kind of brain center, collecting and accumulating information about the state of the body during sports activities, recreation or training. <br><br>  In Russia, Xperia active will be sold at a price of 13,990 rubles. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  The story about the other premieres of this presentation: <b>LiveDock</b> docking stations, <b>LiveSound</b> headset and the new <b>Sony Ericsson txt</b> model - read our colleagues from Live Journal <a href="http://sonyericsson.livejournal.com/88625.html">on the Sony Ericsson news blog</a> : <br><br> <a href="http://sonyericsson.livejournal.com/88625.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/82f65c09/3615c78b/8f2fd9b6/80465d88.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>In front of reporters.</i> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In more detail about these updates we will tell after the full tests of each model.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/">Read our blog</a> and you will not miss anything! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122482/</a></p>
