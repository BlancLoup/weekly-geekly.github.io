This is a full-text MMORPG with elements of a role-playing game, hack and slash and interactive quests. <br><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  Back in 1975, when ordinary people could not afford to buy a computer, no one to Richard Bartle was given a teletype system ‚Äî a system with a time-sharing mode, where each subscriber answered in turn, and the whole ‚Äúconversation‚Äù was printed on a wide paper tape.  The question-answer had to type on the keyboard.  It was such an ancient type of ICQ.  The main feature of this teletype was that its operation algorithm could be changed.  Here, you need to add that Richard was an avid desktop RPG player and even released a small gaming magazine at school. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that Bartle was a good student at school, he managed to gain access to this technique and learn how to program it.  It was not difficult to guess what his efforts were directed at.  First of all, Richard wrote a simple text quest, where a specific team was responsible for each action.  It looked like this: "Before you stand a huge dragon, if you want to kill him, type 20R, if you want to escape, type 19R." <br><br>  In 1978, Richard entered the University of Essex and met there with the same complete gamer like him.  Roy Trabshaw was older in the course, but he already had programming experience and dreamed of his own fantasy game.  Richard's text quest interested Roy, but he wanted multiplayer.  It was Trabshaw who named his first online project MUD.  When creating the Mada, Richard was responsible for the game world, thought through ways of interaction between the players, and Roy turned his ideas into play.  By the end of the training, they were already working on the third version of the MUD.  When Roy left university, Richard had to finish the game alone.  By the way, Bartle made this game his thesis work. <br><br>  In Europe, MUDs have become particularly popular in university networks, where many people played in them, both from and outside the university.  Because of this, such games even began to be called the ‚ÄúMulti-Undergrad Destroyer‚Äù (Multi-Student Fighter) due to the fact that students spent a huge amount of time behind the game, forgetting about classes.  MPM was mainly inspired by board role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which at that time reached the peak of their popularity, especially after the release of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AD &amp; D) in 1977. <br><br>  In the early eighties, Alan Klets wrote a game called Milieu on the CDC Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãcomputer.  In 1983, he ported it to the IBM XT under the name Scepter of Goth.  The game supported simultaneous connection from 10 to 16 players.  This was the first commercial MPM.  The author sold the right to use the game, and even several companies bought it.  In 1989, TinyMUD appeared in which players had the opportunity not only to participate in the game, but also to create a world in which they play. <br><br>  In 1991, DikuMUD appeared, which led to the appearance of a huge number of hack-n-slash MPMs based on its source code.  There are also several code bases based on it (CircleMUD, Merc, ROM, NiMUD, SMAUG, Anatolia), which are still the basis for writing MMM around the world (and this is very bad). <br><br>  In Russia, the madas were not particularly popular.  Since our Internet was developing late with respect to the West, the peak of popularity was observed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while in the most visited worlds, the number of simultaneously playing participants usually did not exceed two or three hundred (in the western worlds this At the same time, up to a thousand people could be observed playing simultaneously. <br><br><h4>  General </h4><br>  Players interact with the virtual world using commands sent via the telnet protocol.  In response, they are sent descriptions of rooms, objects, events, characters of other players, NPCs and other various elements of the virtual world.  Because of the peculiarities of the Russian language, nouns have to be used in the nominative case, and the verbs - in an indefinite form.  For example, to kill a golden dragon, you need to write the following command: ‚Äúkill the golden dragon‚Äù. <br><br>  Usually, the actions in the game take place in a fantasy world, with battles and witchcraft, inhabited by elves, goblins, orcs, and other fictional creatures.  But there are MUDs with the entourage of tehnofentezi, cyberpunk, science fiction, post-apocalypse, there are even adult-oriented mads!  As in any RPG, there are points of strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, there is hp and mana, there are things that give certain characteristics. <br><br>  The playing space in the city is divided into cells (rooms) that have the appropriate properties ((for example: you can drown in a river, disguise yourself in a forest, weather phenomena do not affect you). A group of locations united by one concept is reduced to the playing area - the whole area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fictional world (castle, city, road, dungeons). <br><br>  The time in such games is divided into rounds approximately equal to one second (a round is the minimum time interval for which one event can occur - moving one cell, exchanging blows or spells during the battle, processing one team), and ticks approximately equal to the minute (each one or more ticks may occur in character character regeneration, recovery of dead NPCs, and so on). <br><br>  The gameplay in MPM is exactly the same as in the rest of mmorpg: a study of the game world, the development of the game character and interaction with other players, so it makes no sense to describe.  I would also like to add that there are immortals in the game - a special class of players who control the multiplayer world.  They carry out quests, maintain a fantasy atmosphere, keep order, identify bugs, create new zones, game code. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It should be noted that there is a fairly large number of open source MUDs.  In Russia, unfortunately, at the moment only <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Posvist/mud">one</a> .  But a <a href="https://github.com/search%3Fq%3Dmud%26ref%3Dcmdform">lot of</a> foreign. <br><br>  For those who want to play, here is a <a href="http://www.mudconnector.su/MudList">list of Russian-speaking madov</a> , for those who know the English <a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/top10.html">list of foreign MUDs well ..</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184714/</a></p>
