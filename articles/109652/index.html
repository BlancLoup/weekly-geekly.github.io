  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Black Onyx Boox A60</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In April of this year, I presented to you the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/89872/">Onyx Boox 60</a> e-book reader.  Half a year has passed and it is time to show you the updated version of this gadget.  So, meet, Onyx Boox A60. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8f3130c5/66e35205/aebc3eeb/491b51d7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, this model has few fundamental differences from the previous one.  But the changes that were made can not but rejoice.  As a person who used both devices, I can say that the A60 is more pleasant to hold.  The main addition was the update menu.  Now it is more structured and intuitive.  Also, the design has changed somewhat (for example, the volume button has become smaller).  The cover that comes in the delivery has become more pleasant to the touch because of the rough material.  On top appeared rezinochka, protecting the book from falling out of the cover.  And the back is now made of velvet, and not of leather, which contributes to fewer scratches on the device.

      <br>
      But, nevertheless, I want to make a full review, and not just to describe the differences.  So, let's start in order and analyze everything on the shelves. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0c/1e8/09d/f0c1e809df782c1054c9eb8b284dbf7e.png" alt="image">  General view </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4b73277a/e9f8a6f4/cb84a15a/44704e24.jpg"><br><br>  So, before our eyes a thin black tablet.  Immediately I liked the fact that matte, although it leaves imprints on itself, but still, they are less visible than on gloss.  Pretty elegant and stylish.  It lies comfortably in your hand, especially in a case that comes standard. <br><br>  Incidentally, the kit is not a lot of accessories. <br><ul><li>  Onyx Boox A60 </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  Power adapter </li><li>  Case </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/86cc0c4d/c4b6adec/d5a872e3/f1a79956.jpg"><br><br>  But this list is enough.  The cover, as already mentioned, is leather, with a velvet insert inside (protection from scratches).  It has a very comfortable velcro, which allows you to fix the cover of the cover in the closed and open state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/75703e36/4cf6a2ed/827e6151/e9ccbc55.jpg"><br><br>  In order not to be unsubstantiated in the subsequent part, I will provide technical specifications from <a href="">Yandex.Market.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dfb4d167/b8659d68/5372e61e/06f6781a.png"><br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aac/ad1/293/aacad1293e214462e762bdffce4cdb4c.png" alt="image">  Appearance </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/21938095/f12634e4/c2d390da/a01e7379.jpg"><br><br>  This is not to say that this e-book differs much from its fellows.  No, everything is basically the same.  E-ink screen, about which you probably know more than me.  Control buttons, connectors, and more.  Perhaps one of the distinguishing features of this model is the presence of a touch screen, which can be controlled using the stylus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b9b4acab/13f57bf0/a0e77d6b/078fb401.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, on the front of the book is a screen, a charging indicator and a control unit, which has 9 control buttons (the silver part is also a button). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/80bd0b4c/b9733c6b/788fef2a/af509c65.jpg"><br><br>  On the back, perhaps, there is nothing remarkable, except for the connector for the stylus and the "hole" Reset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4dca8314/81acb312/6420f034/693cbd2e.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side, in contrast to the pristine left, conveniently located switch Wi-Fi.  There is a slot in the case for it, so there won't be any difficulties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bb6a262c/d3ebb6fb/0412fcb5/e16f6fe7.jpg"><br><br>  Well, all the connectors are located at the bottom of the device.  Here and universal mini-USB, and no less universal jack 3,5mm, a slot for an SD memory card, and a volume ‚Äúrocker‚Äù button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e4da07ff/f6598e52/48cc5eb7/05ff8185.jpg"><br><br>  I think that it is not necessary to dwell on the external qualities of this device.  Well, unless its sizes were clear. <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98f/e8e/78b/98fe8e78b447202558fc84a4cfa24266.png" alt="image">  Size comparison </h4><br><br>  Onyx Boox A60 with a standard size book.  The e-book is even slightly smaller than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/89201f98/06f52078/f89ed215/4e044284.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, it is less, not only in thickness, but also in width and height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/71e6a625/12fc36e6/9b5a440b/e6c4f4be.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the comparison with HTC Desire, which I have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/HTC/104089/">reviewed</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4e9f3d7b/0a240e81/936144fa/686cba44.jpg"><br><br><h4><img src="http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/3268/wrench16x16.png" alt="image">  Filling </h4><br>  The main menu looks like this <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b56206e7/aeb956b3/7cc1ee2a/fdd7e7ee.jpg"><br><br>  Consider in more detail some of these points. <br><br>  The main part of the e-book is a library.  Because  the card is not inserted, then all the books are stored in the device memory.  Open the folder.  As you can see, there are a lot of different formats and all of them are supported.  I do not think that it makes sense to show how the text is displayed with various extensions, especially since it is the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/55ce71c6/38f64bbe/fd14fff1/9bd510d8.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the picture is displayed.  For a long time, of course, the screen is updated 2 times, but displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/feae5b0e/404ba404/aad332fe/3bb5db62.jpg"><br><br>  But the Scribble menu item, for example, allows you to create handwritten notes.  There are even a couple of templates in the form of a musical staff and some flowers.  Well, I drew Habr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d9068b2d/319f8620/11c8c8a5/4cf95f3e.jpg"><br><br>  Wi-Fi setup takes place here in this window.  Conveniently, even a password can be entered, because there is a stylus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/911a5620/6abf0931/b24d7708/78530fd4.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, you can see how various sites are displayed: <br><br>  Bash.org.ru <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bbd5e2f8/78d3f0fb/128c18aa/72146405.jpg"><br><br>  Yandex <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/72c87432/462132f2/a040326a/10090b3d.jpg"><br><br>  Google <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/af1f677b/742d4ca0/4b88258c/6d4c413a.jpg"><br><br>  Habrahabr <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e3405035/5ecc64f2/f06065ab/5340de8d.jpg"><br><br>  Wikipedia <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ff66c34d/59ad9321/f5fe0283/0ba8ee82.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing them is quite convenient, although the response time is great.  But nevertheless, sitting in some McDonalds, you can get a book and read news from it, for example.  It is a pity that the video does not lose.  =) <br><br><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89f/a80/bd4/89fa80bd464facb002076c94d8c6a228.png" alt="image">  Add.  facts and results </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/75703e36/4cf6a2ed/827e6151/e9ccbc55.jpg"><br><br>  The battery in my active use mode (reading, listening to music) sat down for about 6 days.  I think this is quite normal.  With Wi-Fi on, it worked for 2.5 days. <br><br>  Pleased with the possibility of reading .pdf and .djvu.  Often you have to read instructions or magazines in these formats. <br><br>  Charges via USB from the network and from the computer. <br><br>  The book has built-in dictionaries.  They are not yet implemented very well, I hope it will be better.  But in principle, to translate a few words in order to understand the meaning of the text is real. <br><br>  I also liked the fact that firmware updates are released periodically and can be downloaded directly on <a href="http://www.onyx-boox.ru/">the</a> manufacturer's <a href="http://www.onyx-boox.ru/">website</a> . <br><br>  Price: 11490r. <br>  Expensive, but if you compare the price-quality ratio, it is quite normal.  Although, I think that still a little bit, but the price is too high. <br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f5/0da/07b/4f50da07b59242257c3c45bdb6041c39.png" alt="image">  pros </h5><br>  + Ergonomics <br>  + Design <br>  + Wi-Fi <br>  + Additional features <br>  + Ability to change the font <br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d2/b28/d8d/5d2b28d8d429008e2f8d299bddf67a5a.png" alt="image">  Minuses </h5><br>  - Slow screen refresh (E-Ink feature) <br>  - Price <br><br>  In general, I am glad that the manufacturers took into account all the flaws and made this book better compared to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/89872/">previous model</a> .  In fact, now I have nothing to complain about.  From the previous version there was only one minus - this is the price.  And even then, I think that for a product of this quality it is not very overpriced.  In general, I was pleased.  Now the case is black, not easily soiled, the book does not fall out of it.  All glitches in the software removed.  The product is pleasant to use, there is no inconvenience.  Very much, by the way, helps the stylus when scrolling through web-pages, although I habitually flipped through books with hardkey buttons.  The only thing that still strains, and it is unlikely to change in the near future - this is a long update of the E-ink screen.  That is, during the transition, you lose about 0.5-1 second.  Summing up, I want to say that Onyx Boox A60 is an ergonomic beautiful e-book that will save you time on the road and in your home. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109652/</a></p>
