  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Think Different!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday happened what the Internet public has been waiting for a few months.  Idol IT-Schnick - Steve Jobs presented new items from Apple at the opening of the WWDC 2008 developer conference. I will try here to tell about my feelings and thoughts about this presentation.  I think my <br>  opinion does not coincide with the majority opinion.  In short - I was not lost. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the long-awaited iPhone 3G.  What's new in it? <br><br><ul><li>  3G. <br>  The feature is certainly a pleasant and necessary in the phone of this class.  On <br>  This moment is present in almost all top communicators.  And not in <br>  top too.  That is, here Apple is catching up rather than overtaking. </li><li>  Installing applications and games. <br>  The feature is good and necessary.  Again present in all top <br>  communicators competitors.  What is the ability to download and purchase <br>  applications from only one source - plus or minus, say <br>  difficult.  But the fact that Apple wants to make money on the face.  It's not me <br>  like. </li><li>  GPS <br>  Again, good, but there are many others.  For me, a personal feature <br>  not a priority, but its presence gives the "weight" to the communicator.  I use <br>  GPS is not often, but sometimes it is necessary. </li></ul>

      What are other news?  Never mind!  That is, the new iPhone is not <br>  nothing revolutionary, as almost all Internet publications trumpeting. <br><br>  In addition, there is a mass of negative in it, like this: <br><br><ul><li>  The impossibility of acquiring the device without a contract officially. <br>  There is a minus big and fat.  For me, this factor is one of the main ones.  I want freedom of choice of operator and contract! </li><li>  Not the strongest camera. <br>  I use the camera in the phone often.  In the apparatus of this class I want to see the camera cooler. </li><li>  The lack of voice dialing capabilities, which makes the device inapplicable in the car. </li><li>  Touch control is cool, but not for everybody. <br>  The absence of <br>  feedback and the impossibility of blind dialing is very large <br>  minuses.  Do not think that I have not tried.  I tried.  Getting very <br>  like, then begins to strain, then causes irritation. </li></ul><br><br>  Of the benefits andPhone worth noting browser Safari.  So far I have not seen anything more convenient for working in the Internet on a portable device.  There is nothing to find fault with. <br><br>  Summary.  Nothing new.  A good presentation of the evolutionary model.  Not ah-you, uhhhh-you and wow, but thanks a lot for the features that it would be good to present last year.  Before <br>  presentation expected to see something new and interesting.  I was pretty sure that in a month I would go and buy a telephone.  I even thought about changing the operator.  At the end, the same cooled to the device.  More hemorrhoids than pleasure. <br><br>  I can not say about MobileMe.  Everything is very interesting and looks cool.  But why take money for all this?  I think this is another wickedness of Apple.  I use .Mac myself <br>  service for the third year.  Last year, seriously wondered whether <br>  keep paying.  I decided to extend the contract for another year.  This year I will not sell.  Service is very slow.  Very much - it means VERY.  There are problems with encodings.  Galleries look beautiful, but because of the brakes it is impossible to use them.  MobileMe may be faster.  But anyway, I do not want to pay 100 bucks a year for this business! <br><br>  One more zhlobstvo from Apple - paid firmware update for the exact.  Not only paid, so for this, and also the Tunes account is required.  Complete disgrace. <br><br>  I titled my article Think Different.  So Apple positioned herself in <br>  the past.  Computers and gadgets for the elite.  But wait, it's already in <br>  the past.  Now, wherever you spit, everyone has either a macbook or, at worst <br>  the end, and Pod.  Now be different to have on your Windows computer or <br>  Linux and do not use iphone.  Think differently, just <br>  think.  And if you can, then sensibly. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27153/</a></p>
