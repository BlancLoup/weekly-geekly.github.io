  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Software Development Outsourcing Platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the past few months, although we have been working there for almost a year, we have worked hard to implement some of our ideas related to organizing the process of developing software products and creating conditions for the development of an open market for customized development of fairly large and interesting projects.  Available not only to companies, but also to simple teams of developers who are ready to implement such projects. <br><br>  And today we want to present <a href="http://devprom.ru/">our development to the</a> community, tell you a little about its creation history and try to explain why the country and the world need it and why it can be useful for you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How it all began </h4><br>  Several years ago, when we no longer have enough work alone for ‚Äúuncle‚Äù, we made our first dive into freelancing.  And it so happened that it began not with simple tasks for one person, but with a fairly large project, on which the team had to work, including both several developers and a couple of analysts and testers.

      And here we are faced with our first problem - how to establish effective cooperation within a distributed team, which also works with a free schedule, and how to connect to the customer who wants to understand everything that happens in the project and take a direct part in the development control? <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is to search Google for something like ‚Äú <em>online project management and collaboration tool</em> ‚Äù - search results give hope for finding a suitable tool.  But even now, when it would seem there is something to choose from, most of the proposals are just a set of integrated tools, as a rule, these are Wiki + Trac + SVN and their analogues. <br><br>  And we needed a tool that would: <br><ul><li>  He was "sharpened" specifically for software development - and not just a tool for interaction within the team, like the same basecamp. </li><li>  Could cover the entire development cycle, especially well planning, development of requirements and testing - here we generally found it difficult to name any suitable description tool (if you do not take into account such monsters as the rational suite). </li><li>  Allowed the customer to easily manage the wishes for functionality (to manage the priority of implementation based on business needs, to plan the composition of future releases). </li><li>  He was able to collect metrics and analyze statistics on a project, show the current state of affairs in a project, and make a forecast for the future (Agile features such as Burndown chart and Velocity are very useful). </li><li>  It would be easy to use and flexible in settings (on some projects we do not use the requirements development phase, for example). </li><li>  Cost is reasonable for the team money. </li></ul>  Many tools contain separately this or that functionality, but we never managed to find one that would answer all the points listed above. <br><br><h4>  How did the idea develop </h4><br>  Therefore, we decided to create a DEVPROM - a project management tool that would collect all the most necessary things for effective management of fairly complex projects that are made by distributed teams. <br><br>  So, we solved the first problem - we have a tool for project management, which we could only dream of. <br><br>  But after some time, the second problem appeared - for the successful implementation of the project, we needed temporary assistance from people like Oracle DBA for optimal server configuration.  In addition, at some point another project became necessary for the project developer and tester. <br>  Where to find competent professionals, the involvement of which in our team, we would be satisfied and who would be really professionals? <br><br>  Thus, an idea appeared to create a social network around DEVPROM, uniting IT specialists, both participating in the development of projects interesting for them, and providing one-off "near-project" services to other teams (administration, SEO, design, etc.). <br><br>  Moreover, in contrast to popular freelance sites, on DEVPROM the main unit that receives development orders is the team, not individual developers. <br>  Why did we team up?  Yes, because a team can get a much more complicated, interesting and, accordingly, profitable project for development.  And let the most common tasks ‚Äúto make a website for $ 50‚Äù let them stay where they are now, we are not interested. <br><br>  Customers, visiting DEVPROM in search of a team to implement their projects, can either directly give the order to the team they like, or arrange a tender between the teams, choosing the winner at the proposed price provided by the draft work plan and based on the team's rating. <br><br>  Thus, having DEVPROM at hand as a project management tool, the customer during the tender <sup>*</sup> receives a draft of the work plan (as the team sees himself) and then, during the project, will be able to control the progress of the project and the current state of the project.  This will allow the customer to be sure that with his money the team is really working to create the final product necessary for the customer, which will bring value to the business. <br><br><h4>  What is the result </h4><br>  Imagine how powerful the concept of DEVPROM turned out?  This is no longer just ‚Äúyet another online project management tool‚Äù and not a job exchange for freelancers. <br><br>  DEVPROM is a platform for the development of IT outsourcing, the purpose of which is to bring together professional teams of developers and customers to work on the creation of complex software products. <br><br>  At the same time for the customer the cost of product development will be significantly (very significantly) lower than with a similar order from a software development company.  And the quality of the final product, with rare exceptions, will be at least on one level.  We will take care of this with the help of a well-thought out team rating system based on feedback, statistics on completed projects and other factors <sup>*</sup> . <br><br>  I would also like to point out the value of DEVPROM for companies that invest in the development of startups - two problems are solved for them at once: the simultaneous management of several projects and the search for new people for actively developing projects. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Here, in brief, is the description of the idea and its implementation, which has been stirring our minds for a very, very long time.  And now we are close enough to complete its implementation. <br><br>  We would love to hear your opinion about our service: how much it is in demand, is it interesting for you, what else should you add or change in it.  We work very highly iteratively, so your comments and suggestions can be implemented literally from one to two weeks from the moment they are received. <br><br>  <a href="http://projectscloud.ru/">Join our growing community</a> , manage projects, team up and publish your services.  And we will continue to develop the service, making it all the more useful for you. <br><br>  All requests for service refinement leave through the feedback form on the left of any page of our service.  Well, welcome comments to this topic :) <br><br>  <sup>*</sup> Rating teams and individual participants, as well as tenders for receiving an order are underway. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51004/</a></p>
