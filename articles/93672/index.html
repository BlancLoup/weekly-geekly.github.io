  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D video at home: what to watch?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Work in this direction of world brands is in full swing: competitors are not lagging behind and releasing their models of 3D TVs, we recently wrote about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/91592/">world's first 3D broadcast of ballet from the Mariinsky Theater</a> , on May 22 of this year we are going to arrange another event - watching football matches in one of the bars of the capital (if you wish, write to your personal mail, it is possible that you are lucky and you can get to this event) with a demonstration of the work of the 2D to 3D image converter. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  On the other hand, Warner Bros.  so far I have signed a contract with Imax for only 20 films in 3D format, and has released only 10 for the whole time of the agreement (since 2003), which is quite modest.  Again, according to preliminary data, less than 20 films in 3D format will be released this year just for home viewing.  Who cares, statistics in the film industry on 3D can be seen here: <a href="http://www.3dathome.org/experience-theater.aspx">3D Theater Releases</a> , <a href="http://www.3dathome.org/experience-home.aspx">Packaged 3D Media for the Home</a> . <br><br>  Is it a lot or a little?  On the one hand, this is only part of the content, because there are still the above-mentioned 3D broadcasts of such fascinating shows as football and sport in general, as well as all sorts of theatrical genres.  Two additional advantages can not be recalled here: first, the technology of converting from 2D to 3D ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù (on the 22nd, it will be possible to observe his work on the example of the Champions League final) has already been developed, which allows you to get a 3D image even from a regular broadcast (the best it shows the quality just at sports broadcasts), secondly, in the above post about ballet there is information about ready-made devices for receiving a 3D signal from a satellite.

      3D films are also shot in popular genres of the mass audience - these are primarily animated films, as well as science fiction and action films.  That is, it will be interesting to watch such actions in 3D for a very large circle of viewers. <br><br>  On the other hand, even such a box office film like Avatar, this year it is <a href="http://www.vz.ru/news/2010/4/23/396052.html">not planned</a> to start selling in 3D format on DVD or Blu-ray.  According to the statements, this is due to the fact that the technology is still too raw and not suitable for this purpose. <br><br>  But today, quite unexpectedly, it turned out that youtube.com, or rather one of Google‚Äôs engineers (Pete Bradshaw), about a year ago, under the 20% rule (if someone did not know, then in the company all employees have the right to spend 20% of their working time on your own, for other projects), <a href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2009/07/now-in-3d-join-experiment-with-us.html">began work</a> on the project supporting 3D video content formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f5/2e2/173/5f52e217356c744d9963c3590fa1b33f.jpg" alt="Watching 3D video on youtube is a reality"><br><br>  As Pete himself says, the idea was born after viewing the already downloaded content in 3D format, which could not be edited in any way and which could only be viewed in one way or another.  After Pete made the first sketches of the service on his own working machine and showed it to several friends and received positive feedback from them, he decided to continue working on the idea.  For about three weeks, a working sample of the service was ready ( <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5536385/how-youtube-3d-came-to-be%3Fskyline%3Dtrue%26s%3Di">Full interview with Pete Bradshaw on Gizmodo</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dde/dee/612/ddedee612c757aafd133f86d6192abf1.png" alt="Watching 3D video on youtube is a reality"><br><br>  Of course, in the case of 3D, a lot will depend on the quality of the video and the power of the end-user machine, but this is more a matter of time and progress than a fundamental condition that prevents the spread of the idea. <br><br>  Also, the well-known site vimeo.com has its own channel <a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/stereoscopy">‚ÄúThe Stereo 3D Channel‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to say this: all world-renowned companies and one way or another related to the video industry are ready for the onset of the 3D era.  The matter remains for the consumer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93672/</a></p>
