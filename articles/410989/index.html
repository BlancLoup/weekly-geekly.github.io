Today it can be seen on hundreds of hands;  computer geeks and specialists in ‚Äúoffice‚Äù professions have been noticed in particular love for him. <br><br>  This device came to the market from professional sports - which is quite predictable.  But otherwise, the history of the invention of the fitness bracelet and its advancement to the masses is full of interesting twists and turns. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Long before the era of gadgets, wearable electronic devices for athletes appeared: heart rate monitors and cycle computers.  Their task was to collect activity data during exercise for later analysis.

      <b>Cyclocomputers</b> , or cyclometers, consisting of a sensor and a data processing unit connected to it, measured the distance traveled and, subsequently, the speed of movement.  The first of these devices was patented by the Veeder Manufacturing Company at the end of the 19th century (1895).  At first, the cycling computers were analog: the sensor on the wheel was connected to a simple odometer on the steering wheel, where the athlete could see the displayed data on the distance traveled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/8u/vx/fa8uvx_mcnsadcmaawn_trm2beo.jpeg"><br>  <i>Advertising cyclometer Veeder Manufacturing Company, 1899</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://books.google.ru/books%3Fid%3D6IHDDgAAQBAJ%26pg%3DPA88%26lpg%3DPA88%26dq%3D%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2Bveeder%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DJnnM1szr_m%26sig%3DqayjKIuXIYBIi113_-nph0O0Uwo%26hl%3Dru%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjdvdqYiv3ZAhWLC5oKHeACCBUQ6AEIYjAF">The book</a> ‚ÄúA History of Cycling in 100 Objects‚Äù (Suze Clemitson) describes in detail the following stages of development of this device: in the 1970s, Haret Multito invented a device connected to the front axle using an elastic drive belt.  It could also record the distance traveled.  And the <a href="http://www.avocet.com/instrpdfs/20.pdf">Avocet 20</a> cyclometer, developed in 1983 and launched on the market in 1985, became the first electronic <a href="http://www.avocet.com/instrpdfs/20.pdf">cycle</a> computer.  It was a system with a sensor and a magnet in which the sensor was mounted on the frame, and the magnet on the wheel rim, and every turn of the wheel was recorded.  The computer converted these indicators into speed and the number of kilometers traveled. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i0/r8/rw/i0r8rw1q_wluwt9zf0sm0o3voc8.jpeg"></div><br>  Later, the inventors added a wireless sensor connection to the main unit, and a few years later - navigation via GPS and Internet services, where users can save their tracks and compete with other cyclists. <br><br>  <b>Heart rate monitors are</b> much younger.  Although ECG monitors were known before, but they all consisted of a box with wires, the ends of which were attached to the chest.  And the first wireless wearable ECG monitor appeared in the sports medicine industry only in 1977.  The company Polar Electro developed it for the Finnish national ski team and patented it as an ‚Äúoptical pulse sensor‚Äù.  A year later, a version for mass production was released, but such monitors were used mainly in sports. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6_oVDkvkjM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Three years later, Polar Electro, which became a pioneer in the industry, developed the Polar Sport Tester PE 2000 sports smart watch with a heart monitor for mass production.  The sensor reads the pulse, and this value is displayed on the screen below the time readings. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/_m/au/rs_maulubouewuowrrmz376b0kk.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>Polar Sport Tester PE 2000</i> <br><br>  In the following model, Polar Sport Tester PE 3000, the computer interface was integrated.  After a workout, the owner of the watch could output data from the device to a computer and analyze it. <br><br>  Watch with a pulsator from Polar can be considered a direct ancestor of modern fitness bracelets with a heart rate monitor.  But there was no pedometer in them. <br><br><h3>  Pedometer for the recovery of the nation </h3><br>  Devices for counting the number of steps have been known since the 16th century (a sketch of such a device by the hand of Leonardo Da Vinci has been preserved), and the first patent for a pedometer was issued to the XX Briton John Harwood.  Their inventors were far from sport: in the days of Leonardo they tried to determine how much the army overcomes for the day's transition, and later versions of the invention should help in measuring the distance. <br><br>  The first marketing campaign of a pedometer as a fitness gadget was organized by Dr. Yoshiro Hatano, a professor at the University of Health and Welfare Kyushu (Japan) in the 1960s.  At that time, the problem of obesity of the nation and the related rise in cardiovascular diseases, as well as diabetes, became urgent in Japan.  Khatano conducted a series of studies of physical exercises and calories burned and concluded that the sedentary lifestyle of the Japanese was to blame for the problem.  In order to inculcate in his fellow citizens a love of movement, he began selling a compact mechanical device for counting the steps of Manpo-Key.  It was designed by Giro Kato (Tokyo), the founder of Yamasa Tokei Keiki Co., Ltd.  It was the first wearable pedometer released to the mass market. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/s_/lk/pfs_lkkalxqlsmflbj29h17nwx8.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vj/rt/dm/vjrtdmqum4opykqtftitka20qwa.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/sb/sx/8vsbsxudbgecl9oys1p9rs1p2qu.jpeg"></div><br>  The ‚ÄúManpo-Key‚Äù pedometer resembled an onion pocket watch.  It used a mechanism with a load that responds to the steps on the principle of a pendulum, and a simple counter.  The developers offered to wear a pedometer on the belt or in your pocket.  And advertising photos <a href="http://www.yamasa-tokei.co.jp/top_category/article_pedometer_first.html">emphasized</a> that this is a universal thing for people of any profession and income level: athletes, workers, civil servants, professionals and service workers.  The pedometer was set at 10,000 steps - that‚Äôs how much Dr. Yoshiro Hatano considered adequate for the average Japanese.  About the achievement of the result "Manpokay" notified the owner. <br><br>  In his works, Hatano writes that the average Japanese takes up to 4,000 steps per day and overeat about 300-400 kcal.  According to his calculations, 10 000 steps per day will allow to burn about 500 kcal daily, which is enough to solve the problem.  Now, after more than half a century, these studies are outdated.  But many pedometers still set this value as sufficient.  And the Ministry of Health of Japan and the National Forum on Obesity in the UK to this day include it in recommendations for citizens. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/za/op/wkzaoppw8h1-pguwmlrajms0rd0.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>Digi Walker MINI EM-200</i> <br><br>  The next stage of development was the emergence of electronic pedometers.  It is believed that the first such gadget was a device called Digi Walker MINI EM-200, which entered the market in 1987.  The electronic pedometers use an accelerometer, which measures the negative acceleration of the body at the moment when the foot touches the ground.  Therefore, the gadget is recommended to hang on the belt, where this indicator is particularly well recorded.  The belt pedometers, or pedometers, have an electronic display that shows the number of steps taken, the distance traveled, and other indicators. <br><br>  Pedometers with a screen are still sold and used mainly as a means of rehabilitation.  They are popular with older people because they do not need a smartphone to use them. <br><br><h3>  The course for compactness and versatility </h3><br>  Then the pedometer developed along the path of compactness and expansion of functions.  It integrated with wrist watches (2001) and mobile phones (2004).  In the early 2010s, fitness bracelets appeared: a separate gadget for counting steps, worn on the wrist. <br><br>  Fitness bracelet in the form that we know, took the functions of several gadgets.  Polar type heart rate monitor - pulse measurement technology;  pedometers have a method of counting steps using an accelerometer, step standards and distance calculation algorithms;  cycling computers have interactive applications to save and share results.  The first fitness bracelets with a small set of functions appeared in the early 2010s: Jawbone, which in December 2011 released its first model of this device, Jawbone UP, was called the mass production pioneer. <br><br>  The first bracelets appeared on the shelves in the pre-Christmas ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù.  Thanks to the well-chosen date and high-quality advertising campaign, the party was bought in a matter of days.  But then the manufacturer was bombarded with angry calls and letters: the bracelets <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/09/tech/gaming-gadgets/jawbone-explains-up-failures/index.html">spontaneously turned off</a> .  Jawbone had to urgently find the cause of the problem and exchange all the sold bracelets for new ones for free.  But, despite this embarrassment at the start, in the first 4 years the company sold over 4 million of these gadgets, and its market share reached 21%. <br><br>  Now fitness bracelets compete with each other in design, the number of functions, sensor accuracy and convenience of applications, where you can mark your progress and compare the result with other users.  The largest market players are Fitbit, Jawbone, Nike, Xiaomi.  However, today manufacturers of fitness bracelets have to make room because of the growing popularity of ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù by Apple, Samsung and other manufacturers with the functions of a pedometer and heart rate monitor. <br><br>  <i>Look at the latest developments in the field of wearable devices will be in the demo area <a href="https://mhealthcongress.ru/ru/news/mhealth-news%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D21-03">M-Health Congress</a> on April 3.</i>  <i>In addition, several reports at the conference will be devoted to promising trends in this area.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410989/</a></p>
