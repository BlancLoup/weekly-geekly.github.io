In mid-October, the sixth anniversary 404 Festival will take place on the picturesque Volga shores in Samara, where the best protein life forms will be gathered from the entire Milky Way galaxy. <br><br>  I am organizing a section of the UX there, and, faithful to the ideas of conciliation and opportunism, I want to ask for help from the world community and bend under the opinion of the majority. <br><br>  Below - 13 (Thirteen) excellent reports that you have a chance to hear in Samara, drinking brandy and smoking a cigar.  But time, fortunately, is not enough for everything.  Therefore, read their brief descriptions and select, pliz, up to five inclusive (this means one, two, three, four or five, but not more) that you are most interested in, and for which you are ready to jump even with a hangover and one sock.

Thank you, please move over and enjoy your meal. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  01. What Game Designers Know and You Don't Know </h4><br>  Playing computer games is a great job.  But game development is an equally exciting process.  Developers have to solve a huge number of creative tasks.  Some of the tasks are related to user interface problems: how to make the game interesting for all players, from beginners to experienced "professionals";  how to find the image of an ideal player with which you can compare interface solutions;  How to make so that good decisions are developed, and bad ones are filtered out?  All these problems exist in business software, but in games everything is much sharper and tougher!  Knowledge of the approaches adopted in the development of games can give all UX specialists new ideas and tools.  Let's talk about this on the report. <br><br><h4>  02. Secrets of a successful cheater: how to cheat users </h4><br>  The so-called Dark Patterns are increasingly used by large (and not so) user manipulation services.  With their help, people are forced to take any actions fraudulently (for example, to buy additional goods) or, on the contrary, they try to interfere in every way with user actions that are unprofitable for the company (for example, the repeated complication of the procedure for canceling a subscription to news of the service).  Sometimes this behavior is the result of a design error, but more and more often it is a carefully considered solution based on an understanding of human psychology.  I propose to find out why the designers deliberately harm users, what the consequences may be, and where the line between the light and dark sides lies <br><br><h4>  03. Ridability and other ways to visually display texts </h4><br>  Why is it important to think about how a user interacts with content on your site?  How do people see your site?  How to use design to simplify the perception of text on the site?  Why information needs to be presented logically and consistently?  Simple rules for "easy reading" of your site.  One text - one goal.  Simplification: how not to cause information to the cognitive dissonance of the user? <br><br><h4>  04. Emotional design </h4><br>  The product must be remembered.  And to be remembered better - it is necessary to cause emotion.  The goal of any business is to attract new customers and create loyal ones.  If the service fails to make a first impression, the user will leave it without thinking.  How to keep visitors and create a positive first impression?  How to make loyal users out of them?  What are the risks of using emotional design? <br><br><h4>  05. What is user attention, where it comes from and how to manage it correctly </h4><br>  When we talk about usability, we usually imply that the person who uses the interface already knows what result he will achieve, and you just need to navigate it through this interface with the least resistance.  Nevertheless, there is a huge layer of tasks, when a person needs to be somehow torn away from the current occupation, quickly explain what we want from him and interest him. <br><br><h4>  06. How to independently organize and conduct a full cycle of designing interfaces within the company </h4><br>  Every year more and more attention is paid to the design of interfaces.  Companies that are uncomfortable or can‚Äôt afford to appeal to design companies are looking for usability specialists.  The design cycle can take from 1 to 9 months.  Longer you will select a specialist than to design.  Therefore, I will tell you how to organize the design process on your own within the company. <br><br><ul><li>  Who can design? </li><li>  What needs to be done? </li><li>  What do we get at the output and what to do about it? </li><li>  How long will it all take? </li><li>  How much is it? </li><li>  Self Design Bonuses </li><li>  Designer Bible </li></ul><br><h4>  07. Adapting the site for users with disabilities is not difficult </h4><br>  Web developers to adapt sites for the visually impaired (and other categories of people with disabilities) are twofold.  On the one hand, I have not yet met a man who would say ‚Äúthey are too few to waste time on them‚Äù;  on the other hand, in the conditions of fixed budgets and tight deadlines, this is exactly what happens.  There are quite simple, but very useful tricks and recommendations.  Following them will simplify work with the site not only not only for users with disabilities, but also for users with limited technical capabilities (low-speed Internet; no mouse, like on smartphones; small screen), as well as the elderly. <br><br><h4>  08. The secret of mega-corporations: millions for products with a terrible interface </h4><br>  Many of us met with the interfaces of Oracle, SAP, Amdocs, Siebel and other monsters - "grocery companies".  Sincere surprise.  How to use it!?  Poor call center employees, engineers, accountants.  When you accidentally find out that the implementation of this system and the license were totally worth the numbers with seven (!) Zeros, the hair begins to move not only on the head.  ‚ÄúNo, well, at least with six zeros!  Our studio will do an order of magnitude cheaper and everything will gasp as comfortable as possible! ‚ÄùLet's say it does.  Of course gasp.  And after some time they will return to the grocery company.  We tear covers from the riddle of the number on seven zeros. <br><br><h4>  09. From ship to ball: the experience of transition from UX to PM </h4><br>  Asking the question ‚Äúwhere to grow?‚Äù, Many UX-specialists are looking in the direction of product management.  Almost a year ago, I changed the sneakers of a UX-specialist for a productologist's shoes and looked at the processes from two sides. <br><br><h4>  10. What do you really need to learn suckers? </h4><br>  Employee after high school.  Or after the decree.  Or after a long work the devil knows who the devil knows where.  And if at all from the house manager ran away.  How should we prepare our kamikaze, who will do it and where on this path are the sudden underwater rakes?  The report is built on mostly fun, but sometimes tragic experience of involving young and old recruits in their IT projects, who are hungry for re-qualification, professional growth and rabid attendants.  Bonus discuss what actually suck these suckers.  And how to wean them from the tasty. <br><br><h4>  11. About the text and a little bit about the fish </h4><br><ul><li>  What is the text for, not sales people, but people </li><li>  Why writing is always more difficult than talking </li><li>  Differences of correspondence from live communication </li><li>  Why do people read in the subway, and do not read on sites </li><li>  7 rules that will help if you do not write a good text, then at least recognize the bad and not let him go </li><li>  Lorem ipsum or why does it smell foul from interfaces designed using fish </li></ul><br><h4>  12. Think small: microinteraction and how to live with them </h4><br>  Personally, I am one of those people who do not tolerate Facebook and loves Vkontik.  And not because it is a stronghold of free media, in which more of my friends sit.  Details.  VKontakte does not make me switch the tape from unknown ‚Äúpopular‚Äù to the latest updates every time, does not force me to tear off messages from new people under the menu layer, it doesn‚Äôt make us think once again how to put this damn like.  The name of this syndrome is microinteraction.  This is the thing that allows us to love one product and despise another.  This is the very devil, sorry, in detail.  If the product is pumped up in details, then as a whole, no matter how high the problem it solves, it will be bad.  At the same time, good details are what the product itself can embody.  Like Like on Facebook or Start on Windows.  How to design micro-interactions and how to include them in the design process - that's what I want to tell you.  Think small and go change the world. <br><br><h4>  13. And eat fish, and give credit.  What should be able to modern bank? </h4><br>  A modern bank is not enough just to serve the client.  What do banks really need from people, and people from banks?  What desires should be satisfied in the first place, and, most importantly - how to do it?  In the report I will review the main (and not always obvious) tasks and needs of all of us as clients of banking services and interface methods for solving these tasks.  We will discuss where things are going, how future technologies will be able to help financial products and what should be banking services.  The report is based on a large tasty report, on which we worked for a long time, and analyzed very interesting decisions in this field, in Russia and abroad. <br><br>  Author: Platon Dnieper ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hryusha/" class="user_link">hryusha</a> ). <br><br><h4>  We vote! </h4><br>  Hey, hey, no more than 5 points! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191536/</a></p>
