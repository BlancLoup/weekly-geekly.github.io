I saw in a couple of films and commercials, but in the live only in the pictures and there was no particular desire to get something like that. <br>  But as often happens, certain events change the course of further actions.  That's what happened with me.  I saw the video "Kaspars and the flight of the Valkyrie" :) and decided "I want." <br><br>  After reading various articles / forums about quadrocopters and watching dozens of videos with flights and crashes, my choice narrowed down to ready-to-fly models.  I didn‚Äôt want to collect the drone myself, didn‚Äôt want to solder anything, and after assembly I didn‚Äôt want to process the file so that it would fly.  I wanted to get the goods box, charge and fly away.

      Further study of the topic stopped my choice at DJI.  In the assortment were heaped models with multi-megapixel cameras, a large radius of flight, long-playing batteries and other buns.  But the price pushed.  Run more than 1000 euros in the stratosphere - no, thank you.  For the first "bookcase" this is a ball of curl and I lowered the price bar. <br><br>  As a result, I chose the DJI Phantom FC40 model. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The manufacturer's website (dji.com) issued a list of European dealers.  After seeing the sites of dealers and comparing prices, letters were sent to 3 stores - in England, Belgium and Germany.  The Germans and the British communicated very reluctantly (or not very willingly), but the Belgian nimbleness was very pleased - even to my questions at night, I received exhaustive answers for an hour. <br>  After 2-3 days of correspondence, the Belgian store sent me a pro forma invoice for the following details: <br>  1x - DJI Phantom FC40 full set <br>  1x - prop guards <br>  1x - additional battery (3S 2200 mah). <br>  1x - delivery <br>  - Total: exactly 500 EUR <br><br>  And 3 hours after the payment of the invoice, the parcel number was sent to me, so that I could monitor its further movement. <br>  After 7 days of waiting, I received a long-awaited box. <br><br>  1. <b>General view of the parcel</b> . <br>  Large box - quadrocaster.  Package - protection of propellers.  The box on the left is the optional Akum 3S 2200mach.  The box on the box is a mini wifi camera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bb/280/b3e/9bb280b3e05de98582d7757b6eb1f721.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2. <b>Inside the big box</b> . <br>  All parts are neatly arranged in cells, all the small stuff is packaged in bags.  All screws are rubberized, that would eliminate their self-twisting.  3 types of different adapters for sockets.  Smartphone holder.  Remote Control.  LiPO battery at 2200mach.  8 self-locking propellers.  NB!  The console needs 4xAA and they are not provided. <br>  Despite the week-long journey of ~ 2500 kilometers, everything was in its place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/299/3f4/8cd/2993f48cd100717a07d83f663653f07d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3. <b>Camera</b> . <br>  Having opened the box with the camera, at first I thought that they had sent me a reduced sham sample - it‚Äôs too small.  But alas, the camera is the most real and real wi-fay.  The weight of the camera is only 38 grams and it is removable. <br>  Included is a USB cord, a fastening element for a kopter and rubber pads (2 sets) to reduce camera vibration during flight and at least get rid of the ‚Äújelly effect‚Äù when shooting.  NB!  Micro-SD card set is not, but it is written. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de1/71d/d7d/de171dd7d9082e13bf3d9fae737e6569.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4. <b>Charger</b> . <br>  I am not strong in electronics, but the charger has control ports (2S, 3S, 4S), a battery type switch and an amp switch (1, 2, 3). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b34/cad/ef0/b34cadef0bad873dcc58a14a12a95e42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  5. <b>Assembly apparatus</b> . <br>  It was easy to collect, even without previews of auxiliary videos.  In the manual (PDF on the site) everything is in detail painted and drawn that where and how to fasten, it is impossible to make a mistake.  If someone makes a mistake in the assembly, then he does it definitely on purpose. <br>  And so, the assembly is to fasten two legs (chassis) and fasten 4 self-retracting propellers.  That's the whole quadcopter assembly. <br><br>  6. <b>Protection of propellers</b> . <br>  Being a novice in the flight business, I took care of the additional protection of the propellers.  It is better to spend 14 euros on it than to change the propellers after each landing curve. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/507/c6e/e99/507c6ee9980b520e5e08c0dd5b9aafac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  7. <b>Everything in the collection</b> . <br>  Remote with the holder of samartfona.  Copter with propeller protection and camera on the belly (in the photo it is under the copter and is not visible :)) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/594/c28/fa8/594c28fa8ae4f076ac24cc6289a77fa9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  8. <b>Features DJI Phantom FC40:</b> <br>  - 5.8 GHz control panel <br>  - GPS device Naza <br>  - Self-locking screw-propeller system <br>  - 2.4GHz Wifi-Camera (38 grams) <br>  - User Friendly interface of Apple Store and Android applications for FPV (online video on the screen of your phone or tablet) <br>  - The possibility of a 10-fold approximation during the flight (FPV) <br>  - Low delay time of the video signal from the quadcopter board (0.5-1 sec) <br>  - The go-home function, the device returns to the ‚Äúbase‚Äù, if within 3 seconds there was no connection between the quadcopter and the transmitter. <br>  - The range of the equipment: up to 300 m in CE mode.  up to 500 m in FCC mode.  Configured on the transmitter. <br>  - bright LEDs that help to see clearly the front / rear quadcopter and battery status <br><br>  9. <b>Characteristics of wifi cameras:</b> <br>  - 720p camera sensor with 30 fps <br>  - shooting angle of 100 degrees <br>  - diaphragm 2.2 <br>  - 10x digital zoom <br>  - 700 mAh battery <br><br>  10. <b>FPV:</b> <br>  From the App Store is downloaded native program - DJI FC40.  After turning on the camera, the phone is connected to it via wifi and the program is ready to work.  From the phone you can turn on / off video recording, there is also a photo mode.  All videos and photos can be copied to the phone, or by connecting via USB port to copy to computer. <br>  If you start shooting video and the connection with the camera disappears, the video will continue to be recorded. <br>  Digital zoom is not a fountain and therefore I do not use it. <br><br>  11. <b><i>He said: ‚ÄúLet's go!‚Äù He waved his hand.</i></b> <br>  Starting is very simple: <br>  - turn on the remote (be sure to turn it on first) <br>  - turn on the copter <br>  - wait until the copter finds satellites and remembers the take-off location (about 1 minute) <br>  - Get started (both joysticks move down to the center).  If you do not take off within 3 seconds, the engines will automatically shut down. <br>  - we take off (left stick up) <br><br>  To determine approximately the height of the first flight, I decided to fly near the 16-storey building, the approximate height of which is 50 meters. <br>  Here is the actual video of the first full take-off-landing-landing: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B1DB9u4JuIc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjaKLG7auDfoI6kXzeejiCvDrrMMw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For the camera, the size of a matchbox and a resolution of 720, the video quality is very good. <br>  Shaking and pulling pictures is the reason for the strong wind and the inexperience of the manager. <br><br>  My impressions: <br>  - The battery could hold longer.  Securities 8-12 minutes of flight, but it all depends on the wind and control style. <br>  - wifi camera does not broadcast on the declared 100 meters.  FPV picture disappears somewhere at 30-50 meters. <br><br>  Future plans: <br>  - fly, shoot, fly, shoot <br>  - increase the range of the camera <br>  - find out the maximum altitude / range. <br>  - increase flight time <br>  - check the function "go-home" <br><br>  Thanks for attention, </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219253/</a></p>
