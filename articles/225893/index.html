  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EBay chief says Bitcoin integration is inevitable in PayPal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, eBay CEO John Donahue made a statement that Bitcoin needs to be integrated into PayPal.  In an <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/101734293">interview with CNBC,</a> he stressed that the company is seriously considering the introduction of cryptocurrency into the eBay payment system: <br><br><blockquote>  It's no secret that Bitcoin will play an important role in the future.  At PayPal, we are already working on integrating this digital currency into our wallet. <br><br>  I think in a short time, you will see how Bitcoin will be used to solve all sorts of tasks, such as: cross-border remittances, transfers between people, and then sellers will begin to accept it. <br></blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  John Donahoe also added that he acquired Bitcoin himself, because he personally wanted to understand the work of cryptocurrency systems: <br>  ‚ÄúI bought Bitcoin not as an investment.  I buy coins to better understand this technology. ‚Äù

After that, Fred Erzam, one of the creators of Coinbase, made a loud statement.  According to him, in a few months we will see some more giant players (with a turnover of billions of dollars) who will be ready to recognize Bitcoin. <br><br>  Now Bitcoin is going up.  Growth began on May 25 - three days after the end of <a href="http://web-payment.ru/blogitem/168/">Bitcoin Conference 2014</a> in Amsterdam.  At the meeting, almost all participants spoke about the positive prospects for Bitcoin.  Surely, this is what contributed to the growth of prices. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll representatives from 51 countries found something to say about the positive development of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Most likely, this helped investors to understand that Bitcoin territory is much larger than just the USA, China and England, ‚Äùsaid Mickey Malka, general partner of the venture company Ribbit Capital and a member of the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, to CNBC.  Malka also noted that recently he sees interest in Bitcoin from the venture community of Silicon Valley.  Indeed, this year $ 113.2 million has already been invested in Bitcoin, which is 29% more than the total investment of last year, amounting to $ 88 million.  For comparison, in 2012, no more than 2.1 million dollars were invested in all bitcoin startups in the world.  Detailed statistics of venture investments <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-venture-capital/">are on oindesk</a> . <br><br>  Personally, I, as the owner of five and a half coins, which I bought at the very best rate, really like all this news.  Entering the cryptocurrency industry of the giants of the it industry significantly reduces the risks of Bitcoin devaluation, and the course still has room to grow and grow. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225893/</a></p>
