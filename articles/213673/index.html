For almost 5 years, the resource has matured, it has become recognizable on the Internet and rightfully occupied leading positions in search engines for thematic search queries, such as ‚Äúautotravel in Europe‚Äù, ‚Äúcaravanning‚Äù, ‚Äúto Greece by car‚Äù and many others.  Now I want to stay only on the Yandex substation - the main source of high-quality search traffic for Avtoturistu.Ru. <br><br>  So, the screenshot below shows the growth dynamics of search traffic from Yandex over the past 2 years: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/346/e9e/9c3346e9e1c4b98eed508079203357f1.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, as can be seen from statistics, the traffic from Yandex grew dynamically and grows from year to year.  Hooray!  Some, as it turned out, illusory stability is present.  But ... Yes, yes, illusory, because well, I did not think, I didn‚Äôt guess that a high-quality website that is 100% responsive to its subject matter and needs of visitors can be repressed and put under the Yandex filter!  And, as follows from the title of this topic, under ADALT-FILTER, that is, classified as a site for adults.  -) But I understood it not immediately.  So what happened. <br><br>  One <s>fine</s> moment (about two weeks ago) I see such a "black square": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1df/cde/613/1dfcde6134e5c9f02dacc4477d71f193.png"><br><br>  The copious hair on my head stirred in a frenzy: "What is it?"  I am writing to the Yandex webmaster support service, saying what happened?  Plato replied that the same ‚Äúadult filter‚Äù was imposed on my resource due to the presence of ‚Äúadult advertising‚Äù on the site.  ‚ÄúHmm, I think I am!  Here are the times, here zhezh girls dance! ‚Äù.  From an advertisement that is rotated on Avtoturistu.Ru I have: <br><br>  - periodic advertising of direct advertisers; <br>  - advertisements of the Yandex Advertising Network; <br>  - advertising Google EdSens. <br><br>  I also had traffic informers MarketGid, RedTram and Novostimira.  Subjects of spin-off news in the informers: news, tourism, traffic rules, cooking.  I think: "Surely because of teaser"?  Removed them.  Immediately remember one interesting fact.  Some time ago, the site underwent a kind of XSS-attack, when the site was ‚Äúflooded‚Äù with topics advertising intimate services (a la ‚Äúputana.tsz‚Äù).  With the ‚Äúhole‚Äù, which allows massively using the script to fill in the database with this rubbish, they caught and fixed, the topics, respectively, rubbed, but! .. I remember that quite often as search queries that people came to at Autotourist.Ru, there were such as : "Individuals of St. Petersburg", "the best prostitutes of Krasnodar" and others.  What?  Yes tags!  For each topic, a lot of spam tags were ‚Äúborn‚Äù, to which I simply did not pay enough attention.  Tru tags through the database, again I write in the support of Yandex, saying "But isn't it, most likely, the reason for the imposition of an adult filter on the site?".  The answer is about that: ‚ÄúNo, not the content is the reason, but the advertisement‚Äù.  Google until it's blue on the topic ‚Äúwhat is the adult filter and how to get the site out of it‚Äù.  <a href="">I find a</a> <a href="http://sidash.ru/kak-ya-vyvel-svoy-zhenskiy-sayt-iz-adalt-filtra-yandeksa/">bunch of information</a> that this filter is often superimposed because of the very YAN (!!!).  That is, if you are a platform that unscrews the Yandex.Direct blocks and you haven‚Äôt set a setting in the site settings that prohibits unscrewing ‚Äúadvertising for adults‚Äù (here I was surprised that, by default, this setting was turned on, though in my opinion, it would be much more logical if, by default, it was turned off), then your site may fall under the appropriate filter due to its own advertising!  I put a daw in the YAN, in EdSense, the teaser is turned off, the tags are 90% cleaned.  One "an", two "an", three "an" ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aeb/b71/faa/aebb71faaf4d39c21241f896ba22c5da.png"><br><br>  (Google dropped the traffic, most likely when it was played with closing pages with tags in robots.txt). <br><br>  But there are some tags that take a good position in PS and as HF requests, and as LF, for example: " <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/tag/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F/">By car to Greece</a> ".  I think that closing all tags from indexing is not the best solution, because, indeed, you will lose part of the traffic for nothing.  Opinions on the concept of ‚Äúclosing tags‚Äù or ‚Äúnot closing tags‚Äù from indexing, according to my research, differ.  But, nevertheless, "prickly" and do not want to close everything.  And here one person respected on the Russian market of SEO-services is a man, my friend, opens my eyes to the next;  in view of the features of the site engine, tags that are physically cleaned from the database, however, are displayed <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/tag/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%2520%25D1%2582%25D1%258D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%2520%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582/">in this way</a> . <br><br>  But the matter turned out to be simple: the response code of such a page was ‚Äú200‚Äù, and not ‚Äú404‚Äù.  Accordingly, my site ‚Äúpumped up‚Äù very well by intimate requests and, I even delete all the tags from the database, the PS still sees this page as being and indexes it.  Today in the server settings changed the settings, the response code is 404. Temporarily closed all tags from indexing by the Yandex bot in robots.txt to speed up the re-indexing of the site content.  Now I am waiting for the restoration of lost positions. <br><br>  I hope that I did everything right (if not, it would be EXTREMELY happy about the comments, what other actions to take to normalize the situation with the issuance of Yandex), and that, perhaps, my negative experience may be useful to someone.  Well, that is, I ‚Äúate‚Äù myself - I share with a friend-) Good for all the work week! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213673/</a></p>
