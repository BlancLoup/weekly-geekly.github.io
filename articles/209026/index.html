This is quite natural, given the higher conversion rates of landing pages, compared with the usual pages of the site. <br><br>  However, when developing a landing page, you need to resolve two important issues that directly affect the result of the conversion.  First, you need to hold a consultation and prepare a brief, and secondly, to get high-quality content from the client.  And already on this basis to form those.  task to develop the landing page itself. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Why is preparing the brief and landing page content often a difficult task? <br>  To the fact that the development of landing pages is a relatively new service in Russia, let us add a general weak marketing training of clients, especially from companies of medium and small business. <br><br>  If you skip the important stage of the marketing study of the landing page, then the output will be typical one-page pages, with repeated tricks that are unlikely to provide the customer with a large number of applications (if, of course, this is not a unique product).  Also, in practice, customers rarely have high-quality materials (texts, videos, photos, pictures) which show the benefits of products and consumer benefits.  So let's take a closer look at these two issues. <br><br><h4>  Consulting and brief formation </h4><br>  To get a quality landing page, you need to do some serious preparatory work.  In the first place - to form a brief, in which, not only the wishes for the design and structure will be disclosed, but also such basic things as: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ the target audience <br>  ‚Ä¢ customer value of the service or product (customer benefits) <br>  ‚Ä¢ advantages and features of the product or service <br>  ‚Ä¢ main marketing appeal (special offer) <br><br>  Customers rarely have formed and polished answers to the main questions of the brief, because consulting support services and communication with the client are the most important conditions for obtaining a high-quality landing page.  This is especially true for customers who order a landing page for the first time. <br><br>  It is very difficult, for example, to get an answer to the question about the benefits of a service / product for customers.  It is in this key question: ‚ÄúWhy should the customer buy your products?‚Äù Real consumer value is revealed (USP or value proposition).  It is not enough to simply list the characteristics of the product; it is important to understand exactly which important needs of the customers the product / service decides. <br>  During such negotiations with the client, the concept of a landing page is formed, which also takes into account the channels of communication with the target audience. <br><br>  It is a formed concept that forms the basis of the technical assignment for a copywriter and designer. <br>  Studying the market environment and competitors is also a necessary part of brief preparation and the terms of reference. <br>  In general, consulting support is the most important advantage of the individual development of a landing page compared to numerous service generators. <br><br><h4>  Content preparation </h4><br>  The issue of content for the landing page is sharper than when developing a site.  After all, we are developing a "selling" page, which should very quickly begin to "bring" new customers.  Therefore, on the landing page presents a "squeeze" of the benefits and advantages of products or services for customers. <br><br>  What materials are usually required from the customer to design the landing page? <br>  Here is the basic list of these materials: <br>  ‚Ä¢ logo <br>  ‚Ä¢ product / service illustrations <br>  ‚Ä¢ video <br>  ‚Ä¢ booklets, catalogs <br>  ‚Ä¢ customer reviews and logos <br>  ‚Ä¢ phones, email.  post office <br>  ‚Ä¢ domain / hosting access <br><br>  Unfortunately, illustrations are often missing or poor quality photos and pictures are provided.  Sometimes this moment leads to higher cost and increased development time. <br><br>  Often there is some hitch with the provision of customer feedback if the company has not collected them before.  However, this issue is resolved quite easily, loyal customers are sent and agreed in advance prepared thank-you letter. <br><br>  But when LP is prepared, the client receives a good marketing tool not only for increasing sales, but also for further use in various advertising purposes (for example, for a website or a booklet). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209026/</a></p>
