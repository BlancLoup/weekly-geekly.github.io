  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holy Grail of the Bavarian Alps: Ultrasone Jubilee 25 Edition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The sound is different: both Japanese (we saw this with the example of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/289301/">Fostex headphones</a> ), and American (thanks to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/289497/">Campfire Audio</a> ), and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/285614/">Chinese</a> , but if the Germans take the matter, they consider it their duty not only to reach the top of the sound, but also to make the headphones as attractive as possible externally and, preferably, expensive. <br><br>  Today, our guest is not just the Ultrasone headphones, but a limited edition, which is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the manufacturer.  There are not one thousand or even two of such headphones: there are only 250 of them all over the world.  Meet - <a href="http://ultrasoneaudio.ru/product/jubilee-25-edition/">Ultrasone Jubilee 25 Edition</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/289565/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd6/7d9/5e1/cd67d95e113b2d820743f899313fc47a.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ultrasone was founded in 1991 and immediately set its sights on the most demanding audiophiles with fairly roomy wallets.  Of course, for its price, the company offered not just beautiful devices, but many years of research, its innovative technologies and patents, which were embodied in the unique sound characteristics of its headphones.  In addition, Ultrasone produces more affordable models - the same intra-channel PYCO can be bought for 10 thousand rubles, which, however, is 30 (!) Times cheaper than the cost of our today's hero.

      The company itself is a true German: its headquarters is in the city of Vilenbach, which is at the foot of the Bavarian Alps (almost).  Headphones are mainly manufactured in Germany, however, more budget models are still ‚Äúborn‚Äù in Taiwan.  Of course, it is hardly possible to call the production of headphones for 300 thousand rubles a German practicality, but in terms of pricing, these headphones can be compared, for example, with the Mercedes S-class - it also costs a lot compared to budget cars and even business-class cars. while from head to toe all in expensive materials and top-end characteristics, and indeed the car for connoisseurs.  Real buyers take this car not only for the combination of the above factors: they are pleased to own such a car, which coincides with their vision of an ideal car and emphasizes the status.  So, with Ultrasone the same song. <br><br>  No, we will not justify such a high price of Jubilee 25 Edition - it is set by the manufacturer itself, and in this case, the distributor has nothing left to do but to "obey."  It is better to try to figure out why the manufacturer decided that his headphones are worthy of just such a price tag, and you will make the conclusions already. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9eb/7c6/1da/9eb7c61da0e071388af24830e67bd3bb.jpg"><br><br>  First, as we said, this is a limited edition, released in the amount of 250 copies - yes, each data model of headphones is assigned an individual serial number, we have the version number 87. Limited things, as a rule, are much more expensive than publicly available ones, and here wine is not so much the manufacturer as the buyers themselves, ready to lay out a lot of money for the sake of owning an exclusive.  The rich, as they say, have their quirks, including when it comes to headphones.  And so that our conversation about the price looked complete, let's talk first not about the complete set of <a href="http://ultrasoneaudio.ru/product/jubilee-25-edition/">Jubilee 25 Edition</a> , but about their appearance and the materials used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca3/efb/ebf/ca3efbebf5c6b3a2ab286d7f7a61d28e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br>  Headphones look not just cool, but straight premium.  The bowls are made from handcrafted ebony, one of the most expensive wood species in the world.  They are covered with expensive glossy varnish, a similar technology is used in the processing of pianos and pianos by Steinway &amp; Sons.  Finishing - no, not metal, as you might think, looking at the photo, but silver 925, ear pads and headband - the skin of an Ethiopian long-haired sheep.  One can only imagine the total cost of all these materials, and after all, a first-class specialist is still needed to work with them, who can determine the resources used with one touch.  Add to this the fact that each model is assembled by hand in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, and we get a very substantial amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d58/9dc/bc5/d589dcbc52c2e0e29ecc293dd49c974c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ae/253/b11/6ae253b11ec929404e93055b9adfd4d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86d/d14/7a2/86dd147a23cf13a932c756989c121c41.jpg"><br><br>  Jubilee 25 Edition have an adjustable headband, with which you can adjust the perfect fit for yourself.  The cable is removable with a 3.5 mm LEMO connector, also comes with a 6.3 mm adapter, which allows you to use the balanced connection feature, and also to replace the wire, if you suddenly disconnect it, damage (which is unlikely) and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/058/2ae/9e3/0582ae9e345b6a971d0cf8920a72d38d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d6/c2a/4da/8d6c2a4da4720ae211d5261f184bcc88.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the rather massive design, the headphones weigh only 314 grams.  There is no feeling of some bulkiness - you put them on and you appear as if on a silk sheet;  at the same time, first-class insulation is immediately felt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec0/a66/91e/ec0a6691eb86bed25f25b12ef0e28d8c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, you can describe the appearance of Jubilee 25 Edition for a long time, but you are unlikely to look at them while listening to your favorite tracks, here the sound characteristics are much more interesting.  As for the price (well, it is impossible to deviate from this issue), it is gradually becoming clear from the materials and loud marketing slogans what caused it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/765/44c/4b2/76544c4b20e190d609b3ca0930044052.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  And their headphones come to their 87 owner in a stylish black box that hides ... an inconspicuous white box.  At first, you are perplexed, but then you open it, and here it is - a large massive case covered with genuine leather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/767/c69/6ae/767c696ae91e58065170f75ecf4eed3b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/dde/a08/291ddea082a509b6f0b8619388f18065.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b00/027/3c7/b000273c7eceb3b8bc7a011a82932928.jpg"><br><br>  A little vintage adds a suitcase lock with a key in the set: apparently, the manufacturer is confident that for such money you will want to lock your treasure from someone else's ears.  But seriously speaking, this is more an element of style than a precautionary measure.  Well, unless from children who with cups can start to hammer in nails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/828/896/09e/82889609ea8d409f91f20fab0945a658.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/5d6/b21/eb15d6b21bae59310aa9394a70307ee8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f14/51a/b6d/f1451ab6d6d87f8e954964637c3f0bec.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to various documentation, cloths, cable covers and other things that buyers of these headphones hardly pay attention to, they put, perhaps, the most important thing in the box is the printed test results of a specific instance, which is indicated in a separate box.  The manufacturer does not exclude that different from each other models may behave differently on the tests: still the assembly is completely manual, not machine-made. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/9ab/41b/43c9ab41b3032d53bb86aeede9b6780a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab1/936/0cf/ab19360cf3156101e73dd3a3acc6a7c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd9/308/d89/dd9308d89c98ea514e3bc75ac84448b2.jpg"><br><br>  On this with a complete set and you can finish, and go ... yes, to the specifications. <br><br><h2>  Jubilee 25 Edition Features </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Sound Emitter Type <br></td><td>  Dynamic <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headphone Type <br></td><td>  Closed, covering <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Resistance <br></td><td>  32 ohm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  frequency range <br></td><td>  5 - 46 000 Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Plug <br></td><td>  3.5 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sensitivity <br></td><td>  96 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  314 g <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Cable <br></td><td>  Straight Y-shaped, removable <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Material <br></td><td>  Leather, wood, metal <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Headphones have 40 mm drivers with a titanium coating, which provide impressive sound detailing on the frequency range.  In addition, they are equipped with S-Logic's natural three-dimensional sound system: it is responsible for surround sound, as well as powerful neodymium magnets (NdFeB).  Technology Ultra Low Emission (special shielding cups) almost completely eliminates electromagnetic radiation - such is the concern for the health of expensive ears. <br><br>  Characteristics - this, of course, is good, but what with their help will be the sound for 300 thousand rubles?  You yourself have been waiting for this part of the review the most. <br><br><h2>  Sound and Feelings </h2><br>  Before talking about sound, you should try to answer the question: can headphones even sound like that?  Probably not yet, let's face it.  However, you can still evaluate the sound characteristics of Jubilee 25 Edition in ruble terms: the budget sound here, of course, does not smell, it feels like a real premium.  Very (with two exclamation marks) high-quality soundproofing - such that you will not be separated from Frank Sinatra by either the hum of an airplane or the noise of trains in the subway, although the owner of this treasure is unlikely to go down into the subway.  However, we ventured, and arms with legs in place.  Again, because few people are able to distinguish, silver inserts on the cups or metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab0/8a2/651/ab08a2651fedb11e4196b3c86f2c5b60.jpg"><br><br>  Landing such that it seems as if these headphones made universal for any ears of the world.  Nothing shakes and does not press, the headphones themselves are light.  The skin fits nicely, but the ears do not sweat even after several hours of continuous wear.  Moreover, after a while they stop noticing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4f/cb9/6cf/c4fcb96cfee1b7150a6cd65babed262e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4b/c62/4fe/b4bc624fe7c5af89446b1c5f88406f62.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/a44/fa0/c82a44fa011536d11b45382d391b19c9.jpg"><br><br>  As for the sound itself, it is worth noting the incredible focus on each instrument, the optimal balance of mid and high frequencies with a slight bias in the bass.  According to subjective sensations - the sound is as if really hanging out at a concert of your favorite group, right here in the dance area.  What is missing is the one who interferes with watching the bass player with his two-meter selfie stick.  But seriously, to find fault with the sound characteristics of these headphones did not work, as we tried. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/789/867/35a/78986735a5ae90bdbf6b6cf093703a2f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f69/3a0/f8c/f693a0f8c98c09693cdb1ceb433451db.jpg"><br><br>  In total, about 60 songs in the FLAC format were listened to, in which the Cowon Plenue S player, with which we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/280690/">introduced you earlier,</a> helped.  Yes, if you tell Ultrasone engineers that you are listening to Jubilee 25 Edition with your iPhone or budget player, somewhere in the Alps, an avalanche will probably come down.  It is implied that if you bought headphones for such a sum, then you will not save on the Hi-Fi player either.  Probably, it was worthwhile to connect these headphones to some full-sized amplifier, but let's leave it to the sound audiophiles.  We and was good.  Highly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f2/ba2/adc/6f2ba2adc57c0eb315698b31b13a98a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee8/3cc/7f6/ee83cc7f6b75c74b2cd622bc6f9affa2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  What was it all about? </h2><br>  Headphones are not just for those who appreciate good sound and understand it.  They will truly appreciate the lovers of all exclusive, a combination of expensive materials and high-tech "stuffing".  Someone says that they just need to grow up, and with the owner must grow and his wallet.  Connoisseurs are unlikely to make excuses for the purchase of such headphones, and the rest, as a rule, draw conclusions without even holding them in their hands.  But it‚Äôs definitely worth trying just once in their life! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370501/</a></p>
