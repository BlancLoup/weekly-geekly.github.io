But I will try to go beyond discussing the banal downloading of movies and music, and talk about information in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  An ancient hacker slogan reads: Information must be free! <br>  The meaning of this slogan can be partially revealed by the famous statement of Bernard Shaw: <br><blockquote>  If you have an apple and I have an apple, and if we exchange these apples, then you and I have one apple each.  And if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. </blockquote><br>  The information has one remarkable feature - it is non-material. <br>  It can not be stolen, it is impossible to take away, it will not burn or evaporate. <br>  If a person shares information with other people, the society as a whole becomes smarter.

      I am sure that many will call me a utopian, but just imagine for a moment ... <br><br>  How would our world change if every person had access to absolutely any information? <br>  If any programmer could look at the source of absolutely any program and use them as he pleases. <br>  If Intel and AMD had taken and published all their technological developments, which would allow them to borrow the best solutions from each other. <br>  If automotive engineers had discovered their experience in the field of passive safety and efficiency of engines ... <br>  In general, everything is limited only by your imagination. <br><br>  Unfortunately, many do not understand all the beauty and usefulness of open information. <br>  These people are too accustomed to their "traditional" business models and do not want to change them. <br>  They are trying in every way to limit access to information to a variety of DRMs, proprietary standards and entire closed platforms (Apple, ku-ku;)). <br><br>  Here recently ran an article about <a href="https://habr.com/blogs/i_am_clever/41112/">how the Internet will be in 2012</a> . <br>  Someone immediately began to shout "photoshop", without even thinking about the meaning of the article. <br>  But it raises another ‚Äúrelated‚Äù theme with copyright and piracy - the topic of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">net neutrality</a> , which is no less relevant. <br>  This idea was best expressed by the Pope of the Web itself, Tim Berners-Lee: <br><blockquote>  If I am connected to the Internet of a certain quality (speed - <i>approx.</i> ) And you are connected to the Internet of the same or better quality, then we can interact with each other at this level of quality. </blockquote><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnet neutrality is designed to protect the Internet from the fate of the radio: at first, anyone could create their own radio station, but the most cunning uncles spotted the prospect of profit in this matter, lobbied the laws of state regulation of the broadcasting spectrum and successfully divided them among themselves.  If now some radio amateur tries to start broadcasting without a license, ‚Äúpeople in black‚Äù will soon knock on him. <br><br>  Of course, the real threat that the same thing will happen to the Internet is not.  Too much people tasted this matchless chip;) <br>  But for example, such radishes as the American provider Comcast do not disdain to actively intervene in the traffic of their users, effectively blocking their participation in p2p networks.  After a lot of screaming users, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC">FCC</a> did insert a piston to Comcast and forbade it to deal with this outrage, but the unpleasant aftertaste remained. <br><br>  Why am I telling all this? <br>  The Internet has given us a real opportunity to share almost any information with great speed. <br>  He set the direction of movement of our society - movement towards free information. <br>  The one who understands this has already earned (Google, and you ku-ku;)) or else will earn his fortune. <br>  And those who resist and try to impose idiotic restrictions on their users will sooner or later either change, or die, unable to withstand the competition. <br><br>  We <b>already</b> have everything we need in our hands so that the information is free. <br>  The matter remains for the small - to bring the legislative base in line with reality: to legalize piracy, to eliminate the concept of copyright (more precisely, to transform it into a convenient form for society) and to allow the free exchange of any information without any restrictions.  And there is an opinion that Sweden will become the first swallow with their <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">bay</a> - if only the European Union would not crush. <br><br>  What directly can not believe it? <br>  Is it all too chocolate with this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfree information? <br>  Well, then get a spoonful of tar: forget about ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù - in the future it will become public :) <br>  And also a portion of pedophilia and other abominations will be added to this informational soup ... you can think out the rest. <br><br>  PS With <a href="http://dilesoft.habrahabr.ru/">DileSoft</a> (the author of <a href="https://habr.com/blogs/copyright/41416/">this topic</a> ), I fully agree that many offline services will go online, but IMHO it is a natural process that depends little on the phenomenon of piracy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41510/</a></p>
