However, paradoxically, Grafana has so far not had a convenient way to show <b>status in time</b> ! <br><br>  We present our plugin - <a href="https://github.com/flant/grafana-statusmap">Statusmap panel</a> .  It allows you to visually display the status of a set of objects for a selected period of time.  As an example, demonstrating the work of the plug-in, imagine a variety of locations in which coffee is prepared for someone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/is/-v/ghis-vmfpoxwf0pfrgp9uy76qfo.png"><br>  <i>You can see how Nikki saves electricity, Gerry quickly replenishes water supplies, Valera's coffee machine often messes up, and Wi-Fi on Bifrost is clearly better than on the lunar station, where it seems the water is very tight.</i>

      Looks interesting?  But let's start with how we all came to this. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What for? </h2><br>  For better visualization of data, we set ourselves a simple task: to display the status of a set of timeseries over a period of time.  The set of objects means different timeseries: they can differ in the set of labels and the name.  In this case, the timeseries values ‚Äã‚Äãshould be convenient, i.e.  without crutches, displayed in text and color. <br><br>  Examples of the use of such visualization that are relevant to our business are the health of Kubernetes servers or platforms, the results of HTTP services checks.  So in the company "Flant" a plug-in to Grafana was born called Statusmap.  Reflecting on the great variety of possibilities of its use for other tasks, we quickly made a commitment to share the code with the world community.  But really, nobody has solved this problem before us? <br><br><h2>  Why not ready? </h2><br>  The task is really popular, so we did not become pioneers in it.  It all started with the fact that we had several dashboards with cool plugins of the <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/vonage-status-panel">Status Panel</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/btplc-status-dot-panel">Status Dot</a> .  These plug-ins allow you to display the current state of a set of objects, for example, hosts or sweets ... or coffee machines in different parts of the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/qo/tb/vbqotbeezghqnvin2pgw4gqpleq.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lq/b5/zl/lqb5zlkv0lo82uon9c9qnllu4mo.png"><br><br>  Everything went well until we wanted to see the statuses of these objects in time.  The first, simplest solution was to add a regular graph with a check mark <i>stacked</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/ib/mm/bfibmmrpcxlzn2snfzed3mn3_py.png"><br><br>  As planned, the Status Panel + stacked Graph would allow to see the state of the objects ‚Äúfor now‚Äù and the development of the situation over time.  However, the stacked Graph is not very visual: <br><br><ul><li>  the color indicates different timeseries, not the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are displayed in color for the Status Dot or Status Panel.  That is, the colors for the two graphs are not the same and this is confusing; </li><li> if <code>null</code> appears among the values, the graphs fail. </li></ul><br>  We tried to adapt the standard <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/heatmap">Heatmap</a> - it did not work out: the plugin works with the Y axis only at the level of values ‚Äã‚Äãand does not know how to display labels there.  Then we tried the following plugins for Grafana: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/petrslavotinek-carpetplot-panel">Carpet plot</a> - groups values ‚Äã‚Äãby day and by the selected fragment of the day; </li><li>  <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/natel-discrete-panel">Discrete Panel</a> is a good plugin, but we need to discretely show statuses over time; </li><li>  <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/blackmirror1-statusbygroup-panel">Status By Group Panel</a> is a good improvement to the Status panel, which allows you to display many statuses, but still without the features we need. </li></ul><br>  According to the results of all the research we have formulated the following requirements for the plugin: <br><br><ul><li>  selected clear line of graphics for each object; </li><li>  the name of the object is displayed along the Y axis and is set in the legend field; </li><li>  there can be several statuses on one object - in such cases the most significant will be displayed in color, and the rest will be shown in the tooltip; </li><li>  display baskets (buckets) with a width not less than the specified (5 px), since  in single-pixel inconvenient to direct the mouse; </li><li>  manual color management - the ability to set the color of each numeric value from a discrete set. </li></ul><br>  Let me now make a small digression about Heatmap, Prometheus and discrete statuses ... <br><br><h2>  Some theory </h2><br>  Classic heatmap is a 3-D graph: <br><br><ul><li>  X axis is delayed time </li><li>  Y-axis - possible values ‚Äã‚Äãof a certain value, </li><li>  Z axis - the number of observed values ‚Äã‚Äãat a given time. </li></ul><br>  The standard plugin Heatmap displays the Z axis in color - for example, from white to red or over a gradient of green-yellow-red.  This works very well for continuous values: response time, queue length, number of requests to the server ... In the case of discrete statuses for a set of objects, the following is needed: on the Y axis, display the names of the objects that we monitor, and on the Z axis, show the observed values ‚Äã‚Äãfor each object currently statuses ... But stay!  What does a lot of object statuses mean at the moment of time?  I'll try to describe. <br><br>  Those who use Prometheus with Grafana know about <code>step</code> or <code>interval</code> - setting on the <i>Query</i> tab.  If you specify <code>1m</code> , and you collect data at intervals of <code>5s</code> , then when you perform a simple query, the <code>coffee_maker_status</code> Prometheus returns every 12th value, and you can‚Äôt see 11 values ‚Äã‚Äãon the graph.  How to improve the situation? <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is to use aggregation functions ‚Äî for example, <code>*_over_time(coffee_maker_status[1m])</code> .  What exactly is the function to take?  Time to figure out how status is presented in Prometheus metrics.  In most cases, the status is indicated by a certain set of values.  For example, for <code>coffee_maker_status</code> can be such status values: <br><br><ul><li>  0 - ok, </li><li>  1 - off, </li><li>  2 - no beans, </li><li>  3 - no water, </li><li>  4 - fail. </li></ul><br>  Further, it would seem simple: take the number of zeros, ones, twos, etc.  within one minute ... and we have excellent data to display on the chart!  But Prometheus has its own view on this: <code>coffee_maker_status[1m]</code> is a range vector, and therefore expressions like <code>max_over_time(coffee_maker_status[1m]==2)</code> or <code>count_values_over_time(coffee_maker_status[1m], 3)</code> , which would be very suitable, are impossible. <br><br>  Everything works fine if there are two values ‚Äã‚Äãin the metric: <code>0</code> (status was not observed) and <code>1</code> (status was observed) - and the status itself is stored in the label.  Then you can make such requests: <code>(max_over_time(coffee_maker_status{status="3"}[1m]) == 1) *3</code> <br><br>  What to do with a metric that has several values?  The note ‚Äú <a href="https://www.robustperception.io/composing-range-vector-functions-in-promql">Composing range vector functions in PromQL</a> ‚Äù gave the idea to turn a metric with discrete values ‚Äã‚Äãinto metrics with labels.  This can be done using the following recording rule: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">- <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">record</span></span>: coffee_maker_status:discrete expr: | count_values("status", coffee_maker_status)</code> </pre> <br>  This rule transforms the <code>coffee_maker_status</code> metric <code>coffee_maker_status</code> this: if the value is <code>3</code> , then Prometheus creates the metric <code>coffee_maker_status:discrete{status="3"}</code> with value 1. And so for each observed value. <br><br>  Usually the statuses are defined in advance, so you can create a set of queries in order not to skip the necessary values.  The legend of all requests must match so that you can group the values: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/lw/fr/wplwfrej6vn8i9o36vjhkytrzco.png"><br><br>  Now, if for a minute the coffee machine was turned off for 30 seconds (off status - <code>1</code> ), and the rest of the time was working (status ok - <code>0</code> ), then we will have information about shutdown, since  The plugin will receive two values ‚Äã‚Äãwith one legend at a time: <code>0</code> from query A and <code>1</code> from query B. <br><br>  Good: we figured out how to aggregate data on discrete statuses and not lose information.  It remains to figure out how to combine the data based on the legend and draw it on the panel. <br><br><h2>  Statusmap plugin </h2><br>  Of course, we didn‚Äôt immediately come to what was described above, but when it all came together, it became clear that, in fact, there was not enough rendering mechanism.  Now there is such a mechanism - the <a href="https://github.com/flant/grafana-statusmap">Statusmap panel plugin</a> , which can do the following: <br><br><ul><li>  the values ‚Äã‚Äãat each point in time are grouped into baskets by matching the text of the legends specified in <i>Query</i> ; </li><li>  each text of the legend corresponds to its own line on the graph and the text is displayed as a label on the Y axis, and empty values ‚Äã‚Äãare displayed with a space or as <code>0</code> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6w/3q/oc/6w3qoczr5li9fou2rktxb3h58ke.png"></li><li>  for any value you can set the exact color of the basket: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zn/c-/1n/znc-1nrw5teu5-mo7g4w5zhcwne.png"></li><li>  if there are several values ‚Äã‚Äãin the basket, the color will be taken for the value that is defined above on the <i>Colors</i> tab, and when you hover over the basket, all values ‚Äã‚Äãthat fall into it are displayed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/b4/dt/8ob4dtdp_urq5r903oys4wmcwte.png"></li><li>  The plugin is able to form the <code>interval</code> for the request to Prometheus so that the baskets do not turn into pixel lines. </li></ul><br>  The result is a very convenient representation of the <b>status of several objects</b> .  And you can see both the current status (these are the rightmost baskets) and the status of the object in time. <br><br><h2>  Where to get? </h2><br>  The source code of the Grafana Statusmap plugin is distributed under the free MIT license <i>(by analogy with other plugins for Grafana)</i> .  At the moment it is available in <a href="https://github.com/flant/grafana-statusmap">our GitHub</a> .  <s>And we sincerely hope that in the near future it <a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-repository/pull/307">will get</a> into the <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins">repository of the plug-ins of Grafana</a> .</s>  <b>UPDATED (03/10/18):</b> The plugin has been <a href="https://grafana.com/plugins/flant-statusmap-panel">accepted</a> into the official Grafana directory. <br><br>  And finally, an illustration of how a Statusmap helps to visualize data with status stats from the Kubernetes production cluster: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mp/xc/lv/mpxclvizmci-pbwjjqpmy6zvwaw.png"><br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Read also in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/341386/">Introducing loghouse - an open source system for working with logs in Kubernetes</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/333682/">Officially present dapp - a DevOps utility to maintain the CI / CD</a> ." </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423851/</a></p>
