Such in bulk! ‚ÄùAnd remember Google‚Äôs Cholodek, Igloo and a couple more systems ...

      And so, about a year and a half ago, Siora struck the thought that ‚ÄúWe must do something!‚Äù And it was decided to build a MODERN camera! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first question was about iron ... <br><br><h4>  Cameras </h4><br><br><h5>  Option 1 </h5><br>  It was decided to make the most "penny" option, using WEB-cameras that way for a thousand and a half with 2 megapixels of resolution ... <br><br>  Zatyk occurred after the purchase of the first two: from the sale, they abruptly disappeared! <br>  Apparently the New Year was to blame and the people suddenly decided that such a camera was the best gift ?! <br>  HZ. <br><br>  From testing it became clear that this is slightly a bit different from what I would like: <br><ul><li>  slowly - 9 frames per second is absolutely not high!  The cinema uses 25 frames. </li><li>  slowly - USB, albeit 2.0, is still a brake! </li><li>  slowly - The layout was not even 11, but only 6 cameras, by analogy with <a href="http://www.vrhotwires.com/InexpensivePanoramicVideo.html">one man</a> , and still - the brakes!  Especially since he used FireWire in general ... But those same 9 frames per second and at least cry! </li><li>  slowly - I was thinking about writing on a netbook.  Big laptop STRONGLY increases the weight! </li></ul><br><br>  About the quality, I am silent: in spite of all the assurances of the manufacturer, it drives not full-fledged frames, but JPG!  With a creepy picture ... <br><br><h5>  Option 2 </h5><br>  This should have been a misunderstanding from Sony with a cunning lens for shooting a circular picture on one camera. <br><img src="http://www.membrana.ru/images/articles/1072798270-4.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  Looking at THIS, I grunted and immediately decided to score: let the camera give God a 1080 to 1080 resolution (the horizon doesn‚Äôt play a role here - the frame is almost square) and it rolls it out from around the horizon into a circle ... <br>  In such a way - not even 540, but less! <br><br>  As practice has shown, when these cameras appeared on sale a year later: I was completely right - not cool! <br><br><h5>  Option 3 </h5><br>  Actually - the current. <br>  Stupidly take a few cheap recorders and write to them at the same time. <br><br>  A year ago, a cheap Chinese version of 89 bucks with EBay turned out to be a cheap option ... <br>  FullHD 720p, 30 frames per second and support for SDHC memory cards seemed like a decent option. <br><br>  Three pieces were bought for checking: more - I‚Äôll not fit in 10K for customs, less - delivery will be more expensive ... <br>  Cameras were tested, several glitches were found, but in general they were found to be suitable. <br>  It was ordered 5 more pieces in two batches - 3 and 2 (in the second there were also three, but she went to my work colleague, who also liked the device and wanted the same). <br>  Total - became the happy owner already 8 pieces ... <br>  It was supposed to be removed by analogy with that brow on 6 cameras + 1 in reserve and 1 for myself (sometimes you need to remove something from the thread). <br>  After a couple of experiments with cameras, I added 3 more: I decided to shoot right away ‚Äúin the format‚Äù of Krugoramy - on 11 cameras turned 90 degrees (at the domestic cinema the screens are not 3 by 4, but 6 by 4, and 6 is vertical! Due to this We have a better overview than Western counterparts.) <br><br>  Unfortunately, with the attendants, difficulties came after that and I could not order more three in reserve.  After half a year - the cameras were removed from production and sales ... <br><br>  At the moment, I keep in mind the replacement for Kodak Zi6 - it is ideologically VERY close to mine. <br><br><h6>  Option 3.1 </h6><br>  Or "Mini-Krugorama" - on cameras-charms with a resolution of 720 to 480, at 30 frames per second. <br>  Not 1280 by 720, as in the ‚Äúolder‚Äù version, but 11 cameras the size of a key chain have VERY MUCH LESS WEIGHT! <br><br>  Until complete happiness - the price of an E-bay amounts to a dollar-and-a-half apiece - this is possible both in the helicopter and under the water and not particularly regret about her death!  11 bucks?  Pfe!  Compared with how the people with the helicopter drowned the camera for 80 Sput - such garbage! <br><br><h6>  Option 3.2 </h6><br>  ‚ÄúNext Generation‚Äù - using FullHD 1080p cameras.  While in perspective, because  no money for it. <br>  One of the chips will be that the choice is now better than a year and a half ago, so the camera will be taken with the possibility of moving the matrix with an "extender", with the result that the cameras can be placed TIGHTER to each other, which will give a better parallax. <br><br>  The current version of the camera front and rear in the case and without: <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/pN4GP_tRDrRuYql0mr_4Wj-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f28/676/fdd/f28676fddb1f934bd633d1afd6f716ef.jpg"></a> <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/5cDg6lIHMe0KBNViZsn-bj-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/713/fb2/652/713fb2652d29aca7409e641498e83f21.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Such a ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù of the cameras ... <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/Me8BPrzM8BvulY9oI_58sz-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bc/0c6/533/7bc0c6533c6bb9756ab77635be673ba9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  From the "late" - the camera module with a new cord and on the mounting plate: <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/CJkd-Wvq8ocpJT6YrKrRpz-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26a/bbc/a8b/26abbca8bee110901cb767ad37ea1290.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Memory cards </h4><br><h5>  Option 1 </h5><br>  It was bought 3 cards Transcendent 8 gig.  Purchased, damn it, in M-Video, but in the end only 1 piece was used - 2 others turned out to be buggy and the cameras from them went crazy ... <br>  Having estimated the price and ‚Äúquality‚Äù of this option, I refused: 11 cameras with ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù cards - it seemed to be overkill! <br><br><h5>  Option 2 (current) </h5><br>  It was bought at a relatively low price as much as 11 cards per gig. <br>  Why precisely such? <br>  It's simple: the cameras have a small glitch, that after 20 minutes of continuous shooting, they turn on and hang, continuing to shoot, shoot, shoot ... <br>  20 minutes is also about the file size of approximately gig and the length of the session in round-robin cinemas. <br>  So on shooting a few takes - should be enough!  Not 20 minutes for a double ?! <br><br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/NhZUT3UAOKab4NuKhbxjdT-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/357/fd3/6bf/357fd36bfc01933bc441015c27ef051a.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Option 3 (the closest perspective) </h5><br>  Eye-Fi cards. <br>  4 gigabytes per card + automatic discard after shooting in the archive via WiFi-n = happy Sior. <br>  Otherwise, you need to chop the camera via USB to the hubs, then to the laptop and transfer ... <br>  About ‚ÄúExtract all 11 cards in turn and transfer them through a card reader‚Äù - I‚Äôm generally silent, for it‚Äôs so awkward! <br>  After filming from 11 cameras, poor filmmakers had not only to change the film in 11 devices, but also to EXPRESS IT !!! <br><br>  Now 6 cards out of 11 have been ordered - it will be necessary to test with my ‚Äúchinetic‚Äù, otherwise the manufacturer somehow categorically said that they are not compatible, although they worked with the people, like ... <br><br><h4>  "Video Finder" </h4><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sadko/" class="user_link">sadko</a> wrote recently about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/96467/">video</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sadko/" class="user_link">searcher</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/96467/">to his stereo camera</a> , but my task is somewhat more complicated: I have 11 cameras! <br><br>
<h5>  Option 1: "Pierre" </h5><br>  Three "autumn is strong Chinese" mini-LCD TV + switch for 12 positions. <br>  11 positions - switch screens sequentially to three consecutive cameras to adjust the horizon, etc. <br>  The option is in the state of "the switch is almost ready, but the TVs have not been bought so far." <br>  Alternatively, a laptop with a video capture card can be connected to the switch. <br><br><h5>  Option 2: "Multiplex" </h5><br>  2 color "quad" from video surveillance systems.  On 4 and 8 channels. <br>  The ‚Äúfolded‚Äù picture leaves with two video capture cards into the laptop, which tears it into pieces, turns it as it should and ‚Äúglues‚Äù the panorama on the screen with the possibility of scrolling or viewing in video glasses with tracking. <br><br>  When using WiFi, the operator does not even have to sit under the camera while shooting (to hide behind the camera, as in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù movie, it‚Äôs unrealistic - ‚ÄúFOR the camera‚Äù is missing here as a class!). <br><br>  Those same squares without covers.  Not so devil as the size of his body! <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/LQyThMKAX-iVjWU2FumWeD-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/918/1eb/8ca/9181eb8ca6532c96d143d4aa69feadf0.jpg"></a> <br>  Connectors will be vypayan - connecting cameras in both versions is one cord. <br><br><h4>  Nutrition </h4><br>  Powered by batteries - unpromising.  33 batteries, which quickly die - a bit not what is necessary for happiness! <br><br>  Fortunately for a completely different project, a 12-volt UPS from MasterCit and a voltage regulator with adjustable voltage was once purchased. <br>  An additional 12 volt and 7.8 ampere-hour battery was purchased for it, which should be enough for a long time with local expenses! <br><br>  The larger capacity battery turned out to be heavier, so this one is optimum! <br><br>  Measurement in the suitcase ... <br>  No, you need a suitcase obviously more! <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/oYOh95dAtvl2sofEMw_5eT-rpOE6xZBE3Uki__haxkc%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e4/b22/27f/5e4b2227f53b01bc292eb3e4105d030e.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I am waiting for critics and advice (except "Yes, what for", "Nothing will work", "We must be completely different" and "Everything has already happened!" <br><br>  <a href="http://siorinex.habrahabr.ru/blog/97595/">The second part: how it was and has others</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97544/</a></p>
