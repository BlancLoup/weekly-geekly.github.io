The use of top solutions Gartner and NSS Labs will significantly improve the personal level of security.  Free solutions include: Sophos UTM, XG Firewall (NGFW), Antivirus (Sophos Home with web filtering for Win / MAC; for Linux, Android) and malware removal tools.  Next, we look at the high-level functionality and steps to get free versions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, many homes have several laptops, tablets, phones, there are remote sites (at home of parents, relatives), there are children who need to be protected from unwanted content, to protect computers from cryptographers / extortionists.  All this essentially boils down to the tasks of a small company - with a distributed IT infrastructure and high security requirements.  On products that allow you to solve these problems for free at home - we'll talk today. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#1B469F">Lyrical digression about Sophos</font> </h2><br>  Sophos was founded in 1985 as an antivirus company, and remained as such until the early 2000s.  Since then, Sophos has been actively developing in other areas: through its own expertise and laboratories, as well as through the acquisition of other companies.  Today the company has 3,300 employees, 39,000 partners and 300,000 customers.  The company is public - reports for investors are available <a href="https://investors.sophos.com/en-us.aspx%3Fid%3D00130000019KE2V">openly</a> .  The company conducts research in the field of information security (SophosLabs) and tracks the news - you can follow the blog and podcast from Sophos - <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/%3Fid%3D00130000019KE2V">Naked Security</a> . <br><br>  Mission: <br>  To be the best in the world to provide comprehensive IT security for enterprises of various sizes (from small businesses to international corporations).

      Strategy: <br><br><ul><li>  Only safety. </li><li>  Comprehensive security to make simple. </li><li>  Manage both completely locally and through the cloud. </li></ul><br>  The only information security vendor who is a leader in network security and workplace security was the first to come up with their joint work.  The company focuses on the corporate sector, so solutions for home users do not contain advertising, are fully functional.  It should be borne in mind that most of the solutions below are intended for home use.  All Sophos commercial solutions can be tested for 30 days. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#1B469F">Closer to the point or start in order</font> </h2><br>  The main page that lists almost all free solutions is the page: Sophos Free Products. <br><br>  To quickly navigate the decision, I will give a small description.  For convenience, quick links will be provided to obtain the corresponding product. <br><br>  Basic steps that need to be done for almost every product: <br><br><ol><li>  Register - get MySophos ID.  Everything is standard, as elsewhere. </li><li>  Request to download.  Fill in the required fields. </li><li>  Verify export.  A bit unusual step.  Unfortunately, this cannot be done without (requirements of export legislation).  When downloading a product, you must fill in the appropriate fields.  This step may take about a day (depends on the number of requests, since it is checked manually).  Next time will need to be repeated after 90 days. <br></li><li>  Request to download.  Fill in the required fields again.  The main thing to use Email and name from step number 2. </li><li>  Download and install. </li></ol><br><h2>  <font color="#1B469F">Sophos Home for Windows and Mac OS</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u8/ab/vl/u8abvldnzy793tylr0-2hfn9ga4.jpeg" alt="Sophos home dashboard"></div><br>  <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fbuy.home.sophos.com%252F1461%252Fpurl-affpromo%26redirecthash%3DE14786C9503EB13D97D22C98FE89C7D4">Sophos Home</a> - free antivirus and parental control.
