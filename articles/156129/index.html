The text will present the philosophical and numerical speculations about the sub-complete and useless library of everything and everyone.  More precisely images of everything and everything.  If you are not afraid, then I ask in the article.  As shown by calculations, the Earth will have to disassemble.  And not one. <br><br>  These thoughts were inspired by the post of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/155923/">Program as a work of art</a> , which described the book in which there was a quote: ‚Äúany civilization will sooner or later come up with the Pythagorean theorem and the atomic reactor.  But will she draw the same pictures, write the same music and make the same films?  Surely not. ‚Äù  And if it is not? <a name="habracut"></a>

      Here that was thought.  All theorems, studies, pictures, photographs, books can be viewed as subsets of a global set that can be approximated due to the limited feelings and activities of the human brain by some limited and finite set (I know that many will disagree and may be right).  In view of the current technology as such a set can be expressed by a picture of your monitor, because you can see the Pythagorean theorem, the atomic reactor circuit, pictures, films, etc. Here is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa hypothetical library that will contain "all" information that to know.  And we will do this by creating a library of all (!) Drawings of a given size. <br><br>  If we create an array of all such drawings, then in this library of drawings there will be: <br>  1. Various photos that have ever been taken or will be taken, or various fragments of all the panoramas. <br>  2. All photos, with your face, even those that destroyed, so that no one saw them.  Yes, and there will be photos of you in all positions in all sorts of clothes that you can imagine. <br>  2. All books by all authors, with any spellings of various fonts.  And the pages will indicate where in the library and how to search for pages with continuations. <br>  3. It will be painted in the smallest details who killed Kennedy and where Elvis flew.  True, there will be stories about how Elvis stole the cherries from Vasya in the garden with boomerang shovels at the ready. <br>  4. All paintings that were painted and which will be painted ever. <br>  5. Frames of all the films that were shot and shot someday.  And there will be realistic shots of ‚ÄúTerminator‚Äù, where the main role is played by Jim Carrey. <br>  6. All your biography. <br>  7. Accurate data on the death of every person ever living in the world. <br>  8. Description of all scientific discoveries of scientists. <br>  9. All bayans, jokes, jokes. <br>  10. Description of this post and in general all posts on Habrahabr. <br>  11. Photos of Mila Kunis in any fantasy. <br>  12. Descriptions of all the tracks, melodies and songs with a detailed scheme of how to play these songs. <br>  13. Many other sources of useful information, about which we do not even guess and perhaps never guess. <br>  14. All possible images of all our thoughts that can be displayed on monitors. <br>  and so on <br><br>  We proceed to the calculations. <br><br>  We will conduct parallel calculations for two cases.  Imagine a picture of the size of WHUXGA 7680 √ó 4800 px with a depth of 24 bits.  A BMP drawing of this size will weigh somewhere around 105 MB: <br>  P <sub>1</sub> = 2 <sup>log <sub>2</sub> 105</sup> √ó 2 <sup>23</sup> = 2 <sup>29,714</sup> bits. <br>  To save even consider a more standard version: 1366 √ó 768 px depth of 24 bits.  A jpg file of this size with a quality of 80% will weigh somewhere around 1.32 MB: <br>  P <sub>2</sub> = 2 <sup>log <sub>2</sub> 1.32</sup> √ó 2 <sup>23</sup> = 2 <sup>23.401</sup> bits. <br><br>  Now let's calculate how many pictures of each type are possible.  Each pixel is encoded by 24 bits, total pixels are 7680 √ó 4800, which means that the picture contains (metadata should not be considered here): <br>  N <sub>1</sub> = 24 √ó 7680 √ó 4800 = 884 736 000 bits. <br>  For the second option: <br>  N <sub>2</sub> = 24 √ó 1366 √ó 768 = 25 178 112 bits. <br><br>  Then the drawings of each type are possible: <br>  M <sub>1</sub> = <sup>2,884,736,000</sup> pieces. <br>  M <sub>2</sub> = 2 <sup>25178112</sup> pieces. <br><br>  Hence, for storage, the drawing of the first type will require: <br>  I <sub>1</sub> = 2 <sup>884736000</sup> √ó 2 <sup>29.714</sup> / 2 <sup>43</sup> = 2 <sup>884735986.71</sup> = 10 <sup>266332067.40</sup> TB. <br>  For the second you will need <br>  I <sub>2</sub> = 2 <sup>25178112</sup> √ó 2 <sup>23.401</sup> / 2 <sup>43</sup> = 2 <sup>25178092.40</sup> = 10 <sup>7579361.04</sup> TB. <br><br>  That is, for the second case, we will have a number, which takes 7,579,361 characters to write, and 266,332,067 for the first! <br><br>  Further calculations will be a little more free.  Let's take some three-byte screw (we will not consider RAID arrays, we will not consider loops, etc.).  The fact that I watched was a weight of 0.63 kg or 10 <sup>-0.201</sup> kg.  Suppose that we can use any material on earth for the manufacture of a hard drive: water, metals, stones ‚Äî everything goes into business.  Then, with the Earth‚Äôs mass m = 5.9736 √ó 10 <sup>24</sup> kg, we can manufacture: <br>  H = 5.9736 √ó 10 <sup>24/10 -0.201</sup> = 9.489 √ó 10 <sup>24</sup> hard drives. <br>  You can not even imagine how much it is, but how much is not enough for our case. <br><br>  How much will we have to disassemble the Lands to build a base (this is without taking into account the entire infrastructure, peripherals, and so on)? <br>  For the first case: <br>  <i>The number of lands <sub>1</sub></i> = 10 <sup>266332067,40</sup> / (9.489 √ó 10 <sup>24</sup> ) ‚âà1.05 √ó 10 <sup>266 332 042</sup> units. <br>  <i>The number of lands <sub>2</sub></i> = 10 <sup>7579361.04</sup> / (9.489 √ó 10 <sup>24</sup> ) ‚âà1.05 √ó 10 <sup>7 579 336</sup> units. <br><br>  And, there is a suspicion that the whole Universe is not enough for such a library ... <br><br>  Of course, this library is only hypothetical, and it is absolutely useless even in theory, since with all the information listed above, this library has no mechanisms for finding the right information and for every useful information there will be a lot of options with disinformation. <br><br>  Please pay attention to the fact that: <br>  1. This library does not contain all the information that is in the world. <br>  2. Yes, the concept of fragments is a wider larger picture in essentially reduced to a library of one pixel from which any other image can be built.  In my case, simply larger pixels.  In fact, for the "full library" you need to consider images of all sizes, but to display what can be depicted so that our brain understands - these sizes, which are given in the calculations, will suffice. <br>  3. Yes, there are drawings of greater depth than 24 bits.  But again, for the perception of information by our brain this depth is enough for us. <br>  4. Yes, ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù will not fit on one sheet, but in the library there will be such files on which file will be written on which file and how you need to get to read the sequel. <br>  5. Yes, in order for this to be a library of information, a reader and an output device are required. <br>  6. Yes, there are other forms besides images in which works of art are formed: music, smells, etc. But they can be described as symbols or encoded. <br>  7. Yes, this article does not bear practical significance. <br><br>  Here is a library of all knowledge turned out. <br><br>  PS Suddenly somewhere was wrong in the calculations.  And then a bit too much turns out. <br><br>  <i>Update</i> .  Corrected calculations, but the error did not affect the final output. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156129/</a></p>
