We all know the names of the famous cosmonauts Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, who took the first steps on the surface of the moon.  But the Apollo space missions continued for another three years.  Armstrong died in 2012 from complications during coronary artery bypass surgery, and Aldrin, who is 85 years old, is trying to convince Senator Ted Cruz and Congress that NASA needs funding. <br><br>  Most likely, you can not name even a few of those ten American astronauts who flew after the legendary named.  The memory of their accomplishments fades with each new generation.  Of these forgotten heroes, one, fortunately, was able to carry his legacy beyond the usual article in Wikipedia.  This is Edgar Mitchell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After piloting the lunar module Antares during the Apollo 14 expedition and after he became the sixth man to set foot on the moon, Mitchell wrote: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou bring your own orders to the global consciousness, while motivating us with dissatisfaction with your life and the world as a whole, and forcing you to take appropriate actions.  However, from here, from the moon, it seems that interethnic politics means nothing.  My dream is to grab every politician's collar to drag them through a quarter of a million miles and say: "Just look at this, you sons of bitches". " <br></blockquote>

      His controversial views on the question of the existence of aliens are often cited in UFO documentaries and repeated by conspiracy theorists.  After receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Richard Nixon in 1970 and his retirement two years later to retire, Mitchell declared that governments hide information about alien civilizations visiting the planet. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aab/5c7/0b1/aab5c70b16dab24277e51117e68c23a3.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>In his</em> <em>last years,</em> <em>Edgar Mitchell led modestly in West Palm Beach, Florida.</em>  <em>(Photo: Robin Seemangal, 2015)</em> <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Can you describe what it is like to travel to the moon?</strong></em> <br><br>  It was an incredible feeling, and, of course, life changes after that.  Any joint work, such as the Apollo 14 expedition, brings me great pleasure.  I love it when work completes successfully. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Were you concerned about the outcome of the expedition after the failure of the Apollo 13?</strong></em> <br><br>  Concern and caution are always present.  After Apollo 13, we worked on upgrades and corrections.  Added a third oxygen bottle.  We felt pretty confident. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>You are often quoted in the description of the ‚ÄúGeneral Effect‚Äù.</strong></em>  <em><strong>How could you explain this concept to someone who is not interested in space exploration?</strong></em> <br><br>  It is just necessary to appreciate our role and significance on the scale of the Universe.  I consider myself a cosmologist.  Everyone who went beyond the limits of our native planet and saw it from afar, feel an unprecedented feeling.  We are part of a huge reality.  For me it has become an important experience.  I understand now that we are not moving along a single rational path.  After the flight, I rethought a lot and realized that our path is not the only correct one. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Have you admired the view of the Earth from the surface of the moon?</strong></em> <br><br>  Not much, but we were too busy.  The earth was there, right in front of us.  There was no need to make an effort to see her.  Watching her in this format was rather unusual.  When you see the Earth as part of the sky, your personal views change.  My role in the universe has completely changed.  I saw myself as part of a larger space reality. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>You mentioned rationality.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Do you view this phenomenon as an important aspect of today's society?</strong></em> <br><br>  Now we are not moving along such a rational path.  We deal only with consumption.  And often our attitude can be described with the words "I do not want to hear about it." <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>How do you think we turned into such an irrational and indifferent society?</strong></em> <br><br>  Lack of awareness was our mistake.  We shared science and ourselves.  Science is strictly materialistic.  When we turn to a more conscious understanding of another person, there is an opportunity to bring more benefit.  Otherwise it is impossible. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Tell us a little about the current state of science and why do you think it is wrong?</strong></em> <br><br>  Matter and energy were the only issues with which science worked for 400 years.  Reason and consciousness were not part of science and were not considered as it.  Science and experiments are a way to prove laboratory work.  Nothing wrong with that.  It is just a science.  A way to find material evidence of the correctness or erroneousness of various theories.  This Newtonian approach alienated science from our daily life. <br><br>  Love for nature, love for each other - we only talk about it.  Evaluated at the level of personal perception.  Science is cruel and indifferent, and the most important thing in life is to serve the highest good.  Science must go beyond the limits.  It must be used to understand the Universe at the level of personal perception. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Returning to rationality, how should the problem be approached to correct it?</strong></em> <br><br>  It should be self-sufficient and wisely use natural resources to sustain its life.  And regulate the population!  Rationality can be achieved only in the absence of a huge population.  Exponential population growth destroys the planet‚Äôs natural resources. <br><br>  We need to understand what resources may become scarce, and are learning to replace or save them.  This must come from each of us.  There should not be anyone ahead or behind.  We must all participate and try our best to fulfill our task.  In this century as a civilization, we will be in great danger.  The existing problems can be solved only by serving the common good. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Did you start thinking like that after returning from the moon?</strong></em> <br><br>  Mostly yes.  But I grew up in a very loving family.  We lived on a ranch with many animals.  Due to this we understand and appreciate their role in our life.  I took this position from my parents.  The value of life and all that is in it.  Every day, entering the house, I first saw a photo of my pony, which I had at the age of 14.  I appreciated him as a friend, not as a pet.  I learned this attitude from my parents.  Love for nature in all its manifestations. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Do you think the ability to appreciate is what is necessary for the new generation?</strong></em> <br><br>  It's not just about this or that generation.  Speech about all of us.  I try to live that way.  I am comfortable, I have a beautiful house, a lot of trees.  I hope that people will change their point of view.  We have children, and we have pets and nature.  We must learn to treat them as good, because these things make life comfortable. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Earlier you declared the existence of aliens.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Do you still hold this view?</strong></em> <br><br>  Yes.  There is a lot of evidence.  But governments are silent about them. <br><br><br><br>  <em><strong>Why is this done?</strong></em> <br><br>  I dont know.  The only serious reason I think is fear.  Fear and reluctance to admit that we are not the best creatures in this world.  There are many rumors.  But there are many publications and studies on this topic.  I, like many, hold the opinion that alien life forms exist, visited our planet and even now they can be among us. <br><br>  The issue is also in money and information control.  Governments and the powerful are using information and technology only for profit.  And they want to control everything and everyone. <br><br><br><br>  <em>The interview was published on 07.06.15 on the site <a href="http://observer.com/">observer.com</a></em> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368321/</a></p>
