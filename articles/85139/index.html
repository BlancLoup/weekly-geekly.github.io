A lot of technology and many new products were presented at the event, which promise to enter our life in the near future - only the lazy did not write about all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8c/d23/876/d8cd23876c7fa850576cdf7452c0e9b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order not to repeat once again, in one long line: Microsoft showed the world the radically redesigned Windows Mobile 7;  the Finnish startup Aava Mobile, not particularly embarrassed by Nokia, introduced the concept phone on the Intel Moorestown platform (the first device on this platform was the LG GW 990) - MeeGo support promises to be;  Korean craftsmen from SK Telecom managed to embed a processor and a gigabyte of flash memory with a recorded OS into a standard SIM card - now you can fantasize about various designers for mobile phones;  by analogy, Sagem Orga fit a Wi-Fi adapter into a similar SIM card - yes there was a lot of things, from which it became clear that progress was not exactly in place! <br><br>  It was equally interesting to observe the trends themselves - Dmitry Konash, Intel Regional Director for Russia and CIS countries, shared with some observations and impressions:

If earlier we focused on the Moblin operating system based on Linux, and Nokia was working on its version of its OS based on the same Linux, now we are joining forces and will work on this platform, which will fuse the advantages of Moblin OS and Nokia interfaces.  Of course, we are going to make MeeGo an open standard, because we hope for the support of the wider industry and believe that the industry will only benefit from it.  Judging by the interest that the press has shown to this announcement, we believe that this is the right step. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/686/a65/4eb686a65ad2845439202d204b487199.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Intel has experience in the development of processors and operating systems for MIDs, Nokia has experience in the development of a wide variety of mobile devices, but no experience in launching truly innovative products.</b>  <b>Who will initiate innovation in this new alliance?</b> <br><br>  I think it will be an equal partnership, because Nokia has some experience in the field of mobile operating systems, and besides, the company is a world leader in the field of mobile phones and, of course, understands very well what the user needs in the field of interface and in the field of functionality.  Therefore, combining this experience with the expertise of Intel in the field of microprocessors, we hope that the platform will be positively accepted by the industry.  Each of the two companies is a leader in its field, so this will be the interaction of two equal partners. <br><br>  <b>What are the main trends you noticed at the Congress?</b> <br><br>  A large number of exhibition space dedicated to mobile applications - apparently, this can be considered one of the main trends of this year's mobile congress.  If in former times a huge emphasis was placed on hardware, on equipment, then this year is a year of applications.  Without mobile applications, it is now impossible to imagine the life of an ordinary person, a businessman or an employee of an enterprise, so the huge App Planet Pavilion is dedicated to applications.  Returning to MeeGo - I think an alliance with Nokia is a very timely decision, because we have an open door policy, we do not build a kind of closed vertical ecosphere, unlike some other companies, and we want to make MeeGo a maximally open platform for all market participants - such openness will allow a large number of companies to write applications for MeeGo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/379/c62/6a9/379c626a98aee5e7e8edea43da20f117.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second big trend is the fourth generation Internet.  We held a meeting for analysts together with a dozen mobile operators that work worldwide in the WiMAX standard, and I have to say that the hall was overloaded on Monday evening - interest in this area exceeded our expectations.  At this meeting were all the most important analysts of the mobile and computer industry, which could be presented.  The speeches of operators who work with WiMAX around the world - in Asia, in America, in Europe - have certainly aroused great interest.  It is especially pleasant to note that the Russian company, Yota, which is the global leader in WiMAX today, was in the lead for analysts and the press.  Yota representatives were not released from the scene, and after the event they were surrounded by a crowd of journalists and industry experts.  This is great because it raises Russia's prestige in the field of mobile Internet and the latest technologies. <br><br>  <b>The market is now a fairly limited number of devices with built-in WiMAX - will the rapidly spreading WiMAX in Russia in the MeeGo platform be taken into account?</b> <br><br>  There is no doubt that the fourth-generation Internet is the future.  Now there is a discussion about how this direction will continue to develop - WiMAX or <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/3GPP_Long_Term_Evolution">LTE</a> .  Now WiMAX is ahead of LTE by about a year and a half.  Given the fact that both technologies are quite similar to each other in terms of implementation, it can easily be assumed that over time the two standards will merge, a single standard will appear that will be understood by all market participants, and the only deterrent today is that LTE is associated with certain payments for intellectual property that the owners of this technology would like to collect from the market.  The WiMAX standard is much more open, and the payouts there are incomparably lower than in the case of LTE.  It will be very interesting to observe how the dynamics of the relationship between the two standards will continue to develop in the next few years. <br><br>  Why am I talking about this?  Because, perhaps, it is precisely the presence of two competing standards that to some extent restrain the appearance of various terminal devices that would support WiMAX or LTE. <br><br>  If we talk about WiMAX, then today in Russia alone there are more than forty kinds of different devices from about 7-10 manufacturers that support the WiMAX standard.  This figure will only grow, because Intel's new WiMAX modems, which, unlike the old ones, support not only the 2.5 GHz frequency, but also 3.5 GHz, and these are the two most well-established WiMAX frequencies used worldwide, are now qualifying including in Russia and in the CIS countries, including Ukraine.  All major laptop makers today have WiMAX models, and we believe that WiMAX will gradually flow into smartphones and other mobile equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53c/8c0/193/53c8c0193679d3eb64aa97e8eef8e052.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As another trend of this year, I expect the emergence of a number of tablet devices that support WiMAX technology.  By the way, we demonstrated a number of prototypes of such devices - however, behind closed doors, because we are talking about exactly the prototypes.  But the devices are extremely interesting, they work on our new silicon with very low energy consumption, and I am sure that by the end of the year at least some of these devices, which we demonstrated as prototypes, will appear on the Russian market.  It is logical to assume that some of these devices will support WiMAX technology - simply because it is a spirit of the times. <br><br>  In Russia, three mobile operators are currently working with mobile WiMAX technology.  These are Yota, Comstar and <a href="http://freshtel.ua/retail/">FreshTel</a> , which last week was launched in four cities near Moscow.  We met with the management of the Russian office of FreshTel at the exhibition in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand they are extremely pleased with the start of sales.  We are talking about the Moscow region, where access to high-speed Internet is expensive, and, as our colleagues from FreshTel told us, people in some stores lined up almost at night, taking up turn behind modems - this is a very different price range compared to what are offered by fixed-line operators in these four cities.  So I think that FreshTel made the right choice, going to the Moscow region, where competition is less and earnings are higher. <br><br>  We are talking about three operators in Russia, FreshTel, which is present in Ukraine, where he is actually selling his services starting from the fourth quarter, and about Aksoran in Kazakhstan, which is now testing the WiMAX network in Almaty and is going somewhere in third quarter to go into commercial use.  Five operators in three large CIS countries - the coverage is about 215 million people, and this is a very serious market in order to offer a large set of devices with WiMAX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/086/99c/54b/08699c54b5a31c3279df2943f218679f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Barcelona Congress impressed me very well.  His trend number one is mobile Internet, and applications and flexible operating systems are trend number two. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/pix/favicon.ico" alt="image">  Follow the <a href="http://ru.intel.com/galaxy/forum/index.php">news</a> and do not hesitate to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/">connect</a> to the company blog on Habr√©! <br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  And there is <a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a> ! <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85139/</a></p>
