The value of this information is that it is all tested in practice and most of the theoretical developments are implemented in applied projects. <br><br>  Many of you have heard about modern technologies that are associated today with the concept of artificial intelligence, namely: expert systems, neural networks, linguistic algorithms, hybrid systems, cognitive technologies, imitation (chat bots), etc.

      Yes, many companies with the help of the above technologies solve the problems of their clients in information processing.  Some of these companies write that they create or create solutions in the field of artificial intelligence.  But is this intelligence? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The first thing we will do is define what intelligence is. </h4><br>  Imagine that a computer with intelligence exists.  And you have the opportunity to communicate with him by voice or via text message. <br>  Questions: <br><ul><li>  Is it necessary to integrate language features into the computer intelligence program (describe semantics, grammar, morphology), or could he learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãindependently through interaction with a person? </li><li>  If you were given the task of teaching the computer language, what would you do? </li><li>  If only you participated in the training, who would he look like? </li></ul><br>  Now, answer these questions again, with the only difference that you would have to train: <br><ul><li>  Purebred parrot, theoretically capable of communication. </li><li>  Newborn baby. </li></ul><br>  You and I have just done intellectual work, and I hope that many of you have gained new knowledge.  And that's why: <br><ul><li>  First, I asked you to imagine (imagine), "what will happen if ...".  You acted in changed conditions.  Perhaps you lacked information and knowledge, it was difficult for you. </li><li>  Secondly, you were capable of learning, learning, you found a familiar analogy to you or met it in the text, or perhaps you used the Internet or asked a friend‚Äôs advice. </li></ul><br>  There are many approaches to the definition of intelligence.  We will identify its main features ... <br><br><h4>  First of all, <b>intelligence is the ability to learn and imagine</b> . </h4><br>  In order to create an algorithm for modeling intelligence, the first thing to do is <b>to endow it with the ability to learn</b> , no knowledge is needed to invest in it. <br><br>  Let's go back to our example with a child in order to describe the learning process in more detail. <br>  What principles work when a child learns to understand and speak a language? <br><ol><li>  The more often he hears the word in different contexts, the faster he will remember it.  The word that he will utter first will most likely be ‚Äúmother‚Äù. <br>  "Mom loves you" <br>  ‚ÄúMommy will wash your hands‚Äù <br>  "Mom kisses you" <br>  ‚ÄúWhere's mom?‚Äù <br>  Training takes place through data redundancy. </li><li>  The more channels of information flow involved, the more effective the training: <br>  the child hears: "Mom loves you." <br>  the baby sees mom's smile. <br>  the baby feels the warmth emanating from mom. <br>  the baby feels the taste and smell of mother's milk. <br>  the child says "Mom." </li><li>  The child will not be able to reproduce the word right away.  He will try, stay.  "M", "Ma", "Mom", "M" ... "Mom".  Learning takes place in action, each subsequent attempt is adjusted until we get the result.  Trial and error method.  Getting feedback from reality is very important. </li><li>  Do not raise your children, they will still look like you.  A child tends to be like the people around him.  He imitates them and learns from them.  This is one of the mechanisms of personality modeling, which we will discuss in more detail in the following articles. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  <b>What is the role of imagination?</b> </h4><br>  Imagine that you drive a car on an unfamiliar track.  Passing a speed limit sign of 80 km / h.  Drive on and see another speed limit sign, but it is spattered with mud and can hardly be disassembled.  You are traveling at a speed of 95 km / h.  What will you do?  While you were making a decision because of the bushes a police officer looked out and you saw a radiant smile on his face.  In your head, an ‚Äúimage of a sign‚Äù instantly appeared, and you understood why there is a policeman standing there, and that you urgently need to press the brake.  You reset the speed to 55 km / h, the smile from the policeman‚Äôs face instantly disappears, and you continue driving. <br><br>  And another interesting example of the work of the imagination from the animal world is the observation of magpies.  Forty before the eyes of the other forty buried food in the wasteland.  All the magpies flew away, but our forty turned back to the wasteland and hid the food.  What happened?  She imagined (imagined) ‚Äúwhat will happen if‚Äù another forty, who saw where she had hidden the food, would arrive.  She modeled the situation and found a solution to how to avoid it. <br><br>  <b>Imagination is a simulation of a situation under arbitrary conditions.</b> <br><br>  As you have already seen, intelligence is not a knowledge base, it is not a set of programmed reactions or following predetermined rules. <br><br>  Intellect is the ability to learn, learn and adapt to changing conditions in the process of solving difficulties. <br><br>  Do not you think that by defining the intellect we lost sight of some important components or forgot to tell something? <br><br>  Yes, we lost sight of perception, and forgot to tell you about memory. <br><br>  Imagine that you look through the peephole and see part of the letter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/934/281/b20/934281b205e7415381c5d6e0fd91da56.png"><br><br>  What is this letter? <br><br>  Maybe "K"? <br><br>  Of course not, this is the Japanese character "eternity." <br><br>  Before you just set the task (problem).  Most likely you found a similar image of the letter ‚ÄúK‚Äù in your head and calmed down. <br><br>  Your intellect perceives all the images and looks for a similar image in memory, if it does not exist, then the binding (anchor) to the existing images is formed and thanks to this you memorize new information, get skills or experience. <br><br>  An image is a subjective vision of the real world perceived with the help of the senses (information entry channels). <br><br>  Perception is subjective, because it depends on the sequence of learning, the sequence of the appearance of images in a person‚Äôs life and their influence. <br><br>  Perception begins with the recognition of images of light / dark.  Open your eyes - light, close - dark.  Next, a person learns to recognize more and more complex images - ‚Äúmom‚Äù, ‚Äúdad‚Äù, ball, table, dog.  We obtain reference data, and all subsequent images are a superstructure above the previous ones. <br><br>  From this point of view, <b>learning is the process of building new relationships between perceived images and images that are already in memory</b> . <br><br>  <b>Memory is used to store images and their relationships</b> . <br><br>  And the <b>imagination is the ability to complete the unfinished image</b> . <br><br>  To summarize, we present another experiment from the animal world: <br><br>  The chimpanzees were caged, and inside the cage a bunch of bananas was hung rather high from the floor.  At first, the chimpanzee jumped, but quickly got tired, and seemed to lose interest in bananas and sat down, hardly paying attention to them.  But after a while, the monkey took the stick left in the cage and shook the bananas until they fell.  Another time, to get bananas, the chimpanzee managed to connect two sticks, because each stick separately was not enough to reach them.  The animal coped with a more difficult task, unexpectedly placing a box under the bananas and using it as a step. <br><br>  Chimpanzees showed her familiar image of a "bunch of bananas."  But the image for her was incomplete - they can not be reached and eaten.  But since this was the only food source available, the incomplete image increased internal stress and required completion. <br><br>  The means to solve the problem (complete the image) were always available, but the emergence of a solution required the transformation of the existing images (it was necessary to learn using imagination).  Chimpanzees needed to imagine (mentally enumerating all possible options): ‚Äúwhat will happen if I take a stick‚Äù, ‚Äúand what will happen if ...‚Äù and the most likely assumptions are tested in practice, try and get feedback, imagine again, try, get feedback communication and so on until we complete the image (learn). <br><br>  If the recognition of the image of the hieroglyph ‚Äúeternity‚Äù would be a matter of life and death for you, then you would definitely find a way to do it. <br><br><h4>  From a more popular language, we turn to the technical language and formulate the basic concepts that we will use further: </h4><br><ul><li>  The intersection of redundant information from different information channels creates an image. </li><li>  Training is the transformation of information flows into the information field. </li><li>  Information field (memory) - storage of images and their interrelations. </li><li>  Imagination - ... <br>  - "Dear reader, complete the image of the imagination on your own, using redundant information from your life experience and this article." <br></li><li>  Intellect is the ability to learn and imagine. </li></ul><br><br>  At the beginning of the article we listed the technologies associated today with artificial intelligence, now you can independently assess how much they correspond to the concept of intelligence. <br><br>  In the next article we will consider such a task as an intelligent search for information on the Internet.  We define the criteria of intellectuality, develop practical approaches and ‚Äútouch‚Äù the real application, which implements the principles described in this article. <br><br>  The article does not claim to truth, is part of our research and development.  Write comments, supplement the material with your own examples or reflections.  Learn and imagine ... <br><br>  <b>Read the following article on Habr√©:</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/258399/">How to create artificial intelligence?</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/258399/">The second story.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/258399/">Algorithms for intelligent search and storage of information</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366821/</a></p>
