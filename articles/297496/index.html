Many of you are already tired, emotionally exhausted and consider the hours before the New Year.  It is at this time that you are especially acutely aware of the injustice, if your email is ignored;  or your boss runs somewhere and shrugs away from you;  or you were promised, but not called back;  or you were told that your topic is not important, and so on.

      I suggest to look at this situation from which side.  When people from any organization collaborate with you, they show you their culture and the culture of their organization.  And in general, they behave with you in the way they communicate within them.  Therefore, those who provide internal services for the front office - secretaries, lawyers, accountants, HR managers and many others also influence the impression of the organization. <br><br>  Therefore, at the head of this post, I am quoting Shep Heiken, the most famous expert in the field of customer service: <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúEveryone ‚Äî and I mean absolutely everyone ‚Äî in your organization influences the impressions of your customers.‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  And he gives advice: <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúTreat your employees the way you want them to treat your customers - and perhaps even better!‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  I think this is the best of the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/32270130/">52 tips</a> from Shep. <br><br>  Here are some examples of the practical application of this rule. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The first.</b>  When communicating with clients, we always offer to hold an interactive introductory <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D12">seminar.</a>  At the workshop, we discuss building a productive community.  This is some kind of mystery of nature, but every time during the seminar there comes a moment when we are just silent, and the participants form a mini-community and actively discuss the possibilities of the productive community in their organization.  At this point, it is clearly seen - those people who are tasked to implement a corporate portal or a corporate social network - are they ready to work as a network community?  Are you ready to take criticism?  Are you ready to manage discussions and not administer?  Do they trust colleagues?  After all, if you yourself know how to use social communications for the benefit, then you can help your colleagues.  And if you don't want it yourself, how can you force others? <br><br>  <b>Second.</b>  What happens inside the organization is always felt by clients outside.  Therefore, if you want to build a great sales service or create an external <a href="http://supereon.ru/cases/index.php%3Fe%3D24">partner community,</a> build a culture of respect for the internal client and a culture of partnership inside you.  For example, this way <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/success-story-RRC/">is the</a> distributor RRC Russia. <br><br>  <b>Third.</b>  We propose the creation of an intracorporate online community for <a href="http://supereon.ru/cases/%3Fe%3D23">employee engagement.</a>  If we want to achieve results with our clients, then first of all we must succeed in this within ourselves.  Therefore, in our internal corporate social network posted the rules of our team.  Here they are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ We introduce what we offer to our customers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We do not wait for work to find us, we are looking for it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ We talk about what we do.  If we have an idea or a problem, we talk about it right away. <br>  ‚Ä¢ When we criticize, we offer our own solution to the issue. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If we delay our part of teamwork, then let others know about it. <br><br>  These are <i>our</i> rules, and they arose from <i>our</i> experience.  Your rules will be different, but if you keep them before your eyes and follow them, your customers will sooner or later feel the difference.  And they will like it. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  I do not know if I will write to you again this year.  Therefore, from our team we wish you that in the New Year your colleagues treat each other the way you want them to treat your customers - and perhaps even better! <br><br>  Yours sincerely, <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> and Team <b>Supereon</b> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297496/</a></p>
