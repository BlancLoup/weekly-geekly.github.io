  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A new and promising development methodology, which has already been called the ‚ÄúAgile killer‚Äù *</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">*</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  <em>as Friday</em> </p></div></div><br><p>  Today I want to tell you about a new inspirational methodology for developing breakthrough software solutions that will bring product satisfaction to a new height. </p><br><p>  Already, thousands and thousands of men and women around the world use this modern approach, which guarantees tremendous gains in performance and efficiency compared to outdated methods such as Scrum, Agile, Kanban. </p><br><p>  New people involved in challenge, evangelicals and products, leaders and team fells are ready to talk about the most unique advantages involving new teams and start-ups in the promising world of true advanced technology. </p><br><p>  So, <b>welcome</b> - <b>Porozhnyak</b> ! </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The manifesto of the new methodology was published back in 1969, its authors were the programmers of the secret Soviet "boxes" Sergey Mikhalkov and Arkady Khait with the participation of A. Gribov.  We've got the frames of the first mitap dedicated to the breakthrough technology: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23fBoqQxSgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  However, the matter did not go beyond the first alpha experiments, as was totalitarianism and waterfall.  Later, with the departure of advanced scientists and engineers abroad, some edges of research ahead of their time were finally rediscovered in the new free communities of the Valley. </p><br><p>  In brief, I want to talk about the new inspirational elements of which it consists to take some suspense and show people the easy way to master this wonderful tool! </p><br><p>  <u>First of all</u> , as you can immediately understand from the presentation above, the development efficiency is multiplied.  Judge for yourself: the more we expend the effort, the more man-hours we need to make a task!  Something like this looks like if you build computer modulation: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c6/8ac/c64/1c68acc647afd742c85829df02d7c033.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The Porozhnyak methodology allows for the implementation of the principle of <em>Look before you leap</em> on the fly, which guarantees us the rejection of actions leading to an inefficient solution of the problem. </p><br><p>  <u>Secondly</u> , the teams operating in the field of technology of the new century should be smart enough to clearly represent the necessary tools that they need at a given point in time.  The Porozhnyak methodology thus supports the intuitive paradigm of the choice of solutions to a problem, based on the strengths of the team‚Äôs emotional intelligence and each of its members. </p><br><p>  On the example of an encephalogram, it can be seen below that the greatest involvement of various areas of the human brain occurs when he is engaged in a hobby or some other business that he likes: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c01/541/1b7/c015411b767769d1e0d4e6b513699467.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Thus, doing in the workplace what he likes - playing domino, kozel, podkidnoy, etc - each developer develops his neural connections, thereby increasing the team‚Äôs cumulative intelligence, which allows it to act extremely effectively during brainstorming, generating new unusual ideas and solutions! </p><br><p>  <u>Thirdly</u> , in the modern world of development, where more and more distributed groups of distributed type are located in different locations, time zones and on different continents, it is extremely necessary to observe the cultural characteristics of each individual so that the joint development process does not touch its origin privacy , and the team as a whole did not enter the zone of dangerous misunderstanding. </p><br><p>  We all know that different patterns of communication by men and women of different cultures can be perceived differently.  For example, a nod of the head in the North Atlantic is perceived as (y-) confirmation, while in the western part of the Silk Road it can mean different intonations of meaning, even denial.  While practicing Porozhnyak, each of us, on the one hand, can always be in his comfort zone, on the other hand, do not follow the path of escalating conflict with the authorities, when the feedback loop with frequently repeated and time-varying directives only increases the stakes. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e9/18a/5b2/6e918a5b26735656e060e789decea877.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The world-famous Finnish education system <a href="https://mel.fm/finskaya-shkola/7638209-finland">partly follows</a> Porozhnyak principles. </p><br><p>  <u>Fourthly</u> , for team leaders, project and product managers open up truly inspiring prospects for better management of processes and people!  Enough of endless stand-ups, meetings, and conference calls that take up to one-fourth of the total working time!  Down with the endlessly inconclusive correspondence, approvals and visas of neighboring departments!  It's time to stop the endless peer-to-peer chaos, the only visible result of which is the increasing costs of communication and the transfer of data from one type to another! </p><br><p>  Some aspects of the development are already showing us in practice what a stream of pointing instructions is.  If you imagine a company as the main React Component, and its departments as nested components, then it is easy to understand: if each department has its own state, which changes due to the activities within the team, then interaction between departments and within the company as a whole is impossible without cal-baks , binding instructions and other things spaghetti, which over time threatens to grow from the necessary binding of the company's work into its main essence.  Instead, another native of Russia, Dan Abramov, proposed a simple and understandable approach to Redux, based on a unidirectional data flow. </p><br><p>  But the Porozhnyak methodology goes further, offering to close the "Actions-Reducers-Store" chain within one universal developer (my greetings to the guys from Sbertech, who seem to go this way!).  After all, the speed of transmission and processing of information within one head is an order of magnitude faster than speech communication methods, not to mention others.  Moreover, there are no problems with the translation of transactions into a language that is understandable to partners. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ad/06a/56a/5ad06a56a80a46807ffe0e90f53fc8ff.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <u>Fifth</u> , the Porozhnyak methodology allows for a different look at the issue of accumulating competences within teams and communities.  It is not a secret that using outdated approaches to the organization of development, firms and start-ups invest considerable funds in training employees, increasing their team skills, establishing team-team interactions, instilling a particular corporate culture.  However, when an employee leaves, his accumulated knowledge leaves with him, and often the new employee has to tell everything in a new way. </p><br><p>  Using Porozhnyak, each leader will quickly make sure that his principles are originally organic in nature.  They are complementary to almost all human beings.  One or another employee, gaining experience in different companies, himself comes to the necessity of following Porozhnyak, a simple reflection of his experience as a specialist will push him.  Thus, the labor market has already accumulated unconscious competence to follow Porozhnyak, and the transition to new rails promises to be very fast and natural. </p><br><p>  Dear colleagues, friends, readers!  I hope that with this small note I have awakened your interest in getting to know the new universal <strong>Porozhnyak</strong> development <strong>methodology</strong> , based on simple and intuitive principles that everyone understands: </p><br><ul><li>  do the work, having in your head the whole picture of the process as a whole, make the product, not the process; </li><li>  respect the ability of another person to correct his mistake, do not rush to argue and conflict; </li><li>  do your work with dignity, do not change your principles; </li><li>  save company resources, take a careful and reasonable approach to your business; </li><li>  Remember that the most valuable link is the person, his needs, the main client of the company is you yourself. </li></ul><br><p>  As Steve Jobs said in his epochal <a href="https://mdex-nn.ru/page/vzgljad-v-proshloe-znamenitoe-vystuplenie-stiva-dzhobsa-pered-vypusknikami-stenfordskogo-universiteta">Stanford speech</a> , ‚ÄúYour time is limited, so don‚Äôt spend it on living someone else‚Äôs life. Do not fall into the trap of dogma that encourages other people to live by the thoughts of others. own inner voice. " </p><br><p>  Help us push Porozhnyak to the masses!  Share the link with friends, colleagues, loved ones!  Together we can change the future! </p></div>
