  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NASA has conducted interplanetary internet testing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  NASA engineers conducted the first practical testing of a new space communications system based on the Internet model, unofficially the new system has already been called the “interplanetary Internet”.  According to the press service of the space agency, the specialists of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, using special software, conducted a communication session and transmitted more than a dozen photographs from the NASA spacecraft at a distance of about 37 million kilometers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The “interplanetary Internet” is based on the new DTN technology - Disruption-Tolerant Networking, and it was decided to abandon the TCP / IP protocol, which is usual in the terrestrial Internet, for technical reasons. <br><br>  “This is the first step in creating a completely new space communications system, a kind of interplanetary Internet,” says Adrian Hook, a specialist in technical network standards at NASA headquarters in Washington. <br><br>  The space agency said that in collaboration with Google Vice President Vint Cerf, they have been developing a space data transfer protocol for almost 10 years.  Recall that it was Vint Cerf that was at the origin of the usual TCP / IP protocol.  According to Cerf, the space communication protocol is arranged differently than its earthly counterpart.

      The main problem that developers had to deal with was the delays in data transmission, as well as the loss and attenuation of a signal transmitted tens or even hundreds of millions of kilometers.  At the same time, the interplanetary Internet should act even more reliably than the earth one, since the life of astronauts or the existence of a spacecraft can often depend on its reliability. <br><br>  Cerf says that even when a signal is transmitted between the Earth and Mars, the delay in obtaining data depending on the position of the planets relative to each other can be from 20 minutes to 3.5 hours. <br><br>  In order to somehow implement the idea of ​​the interplanetary Internet, in the DTN protocol it was decided to abandon the basic principle of TCP / IP - confirmation of receipt of the signal.  If, in terrestrial conditions, a transmitting node responds to a request from a receiver only after it establishes a connection with it, then in space such technology means extremely long communication sessions and pings, which will be measured in hours. <br><br>  Together, DTN implements the “save and transmit” principle, that is, nodes store information about points that they recently contacted and, if information arrives, the node first looks for information about the source of the destination in its data, and then transmits the information to the desired destination.  Remotely, this technology can be compared with a game of football, when one player passes the ball to another, the next one and so on until the ball hits the goal (that is, at the destination point).  At the same time, the initial player doesn’t care at all what path the ball will move, and he himself doesn’t need to hit the goal to score a goal. <br><br>  “In space, equipment and administrators themselves will have to create connections with nearby nodes and generate commands for relaying,” said Leith Togerson, project manager for the DTN Experiment Operations Center.  He noted that in the future it is planned to standardize DTN, so that the equipment itself takes on most of the work, but some features of the "space Internet" will not work out anyway. <br><br>  In the summer of 2009, DTN equipment is planned to be installed on the ISS in order to begin its use on a non-permanent basis; later, DTN stations are likely to be deployed at permanent bases on the Moon. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/telecommunication/59292.html">http://www.cybersecurity.ru/telecommunication/59292.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44966/</a></p>
