In the template, an example run.cmd is implemented in which you can see a call to another script - util \ whileproc.cmd with the java.exe parameter.

To configure a template for a specific Java server, you need to take the corresponding startup script (they are in the samples folder) and copy the contents of this script into the startup.cmd script (thus completely replacing its contents).  Further, if you need to make any changes to the startup script, it is recommended to immediately make them into startup.cmd <br><br><h3>  Adding the jdk.zip package to approot </h3>  For example, we will consider using JDK v1.6 from <s>Sun</s> Oracle, but in general, as with the Java server, we have the freedom to choose another JDK.  I note that since the Windows Azure platform in terms of computing resources is 64 bit, it is necessary to use the 64 bit version of the JDK and the corresponding version of the Java server.  This means that in order to use a 64-bit JDK and develop / test in a Windows Azure emulator on the computer on which you will be developing, you need 64-bit Windows.  First, install the selected JDK on the computer, then pack the folder with the JDK into the JDK.zip file so that inside the archive there is one folder called JDK and all the contents of the installed JDK (including JRE) are inside this folder (see also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1619662/where-can-i-get-the-latest-jre-jdk-as-a-zip-file-i-mean-no-exe-installer" rel="nofollow">Where can I get the latest JRE / JDK as a zip file</a> ).  After jdk.zip is created it needs to be copied to approot: <br><br><img alt="jdk.zip in the project structure" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91d/73a/75d/91d73a75d56a71ecd1ac72bb27be19d3.png"><br><br><br><h3>  Adding java server package to approot </h3>  The next step is to add the selected Java application server to approot - to minimize changes in the startup script, it is recommended to use the default names.  Depending on the selected server, rename the packaged archive in ZIP with Java server in accordance with the table. <table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong><em>Server</em></strong> </td><td>  <strong><em>File name</em></strong> <strong><em><br></em></strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Apache Tomcat 7.x </td><td>  tomcat7.zip </td></tr><tr><td>  GlassFish Server OSE 3.x </td><td>  glassfish3.zip </td></tr><tr><td>  JBoss Application Server 6.x </td><td>  jboss6.zip </td></tr><tr><td>  JBoss Application Server 7.x </td><td>  jboss7.zip </td></tr><tr><td>  Jetty 7.x </td><td>  jetty7.zip </td></tr></tbody></table>  Then copy this ZIP file into approot (for an example tomcat7.zip is taken here): <br><img alt="tomcat7 in the project structure" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bcc/61a/b05/bcc61ab050868e302beda8af3a8deff9.png"><br><br><br>  The next step is to set the correct value for the SERVER_DIR_NAME variable in the start script - the variable should indicate the directory in which the Java server will be unpacked.  As a rule, it is enough to set it equal to the name of the folder with the Java server inside the ZIP file.  The reason why the name of the folder for unpacking the Java server is best chosen to be equal to the name of the folder inside the ZIP is that, as a rule, different releases of the Java server have a strong connection between the version and the directory name.  The examples in samples contain values ‚Äã‚Äãthat may no longer be relevant and do not correspond to the latest releases of Java servers, so it is recommended to update the SERVER_DIR_NAME value in accordance with the version used.  For example, in the example for Apache Tomcat (file samples / startupApacheTomcat7.txt), the value of this variable is set to SET SERVER_DIR_NAME = apache-tomcat-7.0.22.  It is likely that by the time you read this document, version 7.0.22 will not be the last, and accordingly you will use the new version (for example, 7.0.29), so do not forget to update the value of the SERVER_DIR_NAME variable accordingly (in this case, on SERVER_DIR_NAME = apache -tomcat-7.0.29).  If this is not done, it is highly likely that the application will not even be able to correctly deploy on the running instance.  I would also like to note that a frequent source of errors is the use of extra (and imperceptible) spaces when initializing this variable - please note that the initialization string should look like this (without double quotes) "SET SERVER_DIR_NAME = apache-tomcat-7.0.29" and after = sign, as well as after the end of the initialization string (after the 9 character in this case) there should be no spaces. After this step you can already try building and running this project in the local Windows Azure emulator - you should see that the Java server is  OSCAL and HelloWorld application is set correctly.  The HelloWorld application is included in the default template - you can see it in approot, the value of WAR_NAME in the start script also indicates this application.  After you tried to start the Java server and deploy the "Hello World" application, you can proceed to the next steps - if you do not plan to connect another Java application, you can skip the next section and go straight to building and testing the application. <br><br><h3>  Java Application Preparation </h3>  To begin, I would like to once again draw attention to the fact that projects in Windows Azure are deployment projects, and not Java programming projects (moreover, in the Windows Azure project, there may be no Java code at all).  That is, it is assumed that there is already a Java application that you are developing and it is possible to create a WAR file that contains the application.  Then the steps to incorporate the application into a Windows Azure project will be as follows: <ol><li>  Create a WAR file with the application (for example, MyWebApp.war). </li><li>  Copy this WAR file to approot (this step can be added to the procedure for creating WAR files) </li><li>  In the startup script startup.cmd, modify the variable WAR_NAME accordingly - in our case WAR_NAME = MyWebApp.war </li></ol>  As with SERVER_DIR_NAME, be careful and check that there are no spaces after = and at the end of the line (after .war).  The content of approot should look like this: <br><br><img alt="MyWebApp.war in the project structure" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f97/447/c9b/f97447c9b6a0917ca2c05ef9d2654349.png"><br><br><br><br><h3>  Assembly and testing in the Windows Azure emulator </h3> Open a Windows command prompt, go to the folder where the project is located and run ant: <br> <code>ant -buildfile package.xml <br></code> <br>  This command tells ant to use the information from package.xml to build the application.  The assembly process may take some time and be long enough, depending on the size of the application and the performance of the computer.  If the build is completed successfully, you will see a message in the command line window stating that "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", it may look like this: <br><br><img alt="example of a successful build of a Windows Azure project for ant" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f58/e43/684/f58e4368429c0c578a9398e93dc9b1a6.png"><br><br><br>  By default, the project is configured to be localized to the emulator (the setting is set by the packagetype parameter in the package.xml file ‚Äî by default packagetype = "local").  A folder named "emulatorTools" is created immediately after the "deploy" folder during project building.  The folder "emulatorFolder" contains two scripts (batch files) that allow you to more conveniently work with the Windows Azure emulator - upload the project, restart the service, start it: <ul><li>  RunInEmulator.cmd - this script starts the Windows Azure cloud emulator on the local computer and uploads the project to this environment.  If the project uses storage and you plan to use a Windows Azure storage emulator, you need to run the Azure Storage emulator separately. </li><li>  ResetEmulator.cmd - deletes all running instances of the application in the local Azure Compute Emulator emulator, unlocks the files that the emulator used and turns off the application factory.  This command should be used at the end of testing or debugging the application. </li></ul>  The final step is to start the server in the emulator: <blockquote>  cd emulatorToolsRunInEmulator </blockquote>  If everything went well, the application will be launched on port 8080 - this can be checked by opening the link <a href="http://localhost:8080/MyWebApp" rel="nofollow">http: // localhost: 8080 / MyWebApp</a> in a web browser <br><br><h3>  Changes in the project for laying out in Windows Azure </h3>  In order to make the project available to work in the Windows Azure cloud, we need to make a few changes in the package.xml file.  In this file there is a special windowsazurepackage tag that defines the configuration of putting the project into a local or remote Windows Azure cloud environment. <br> <code>&lt;windowsazurepackage packagefilename="WindowsAzurePackage.cspkg" packagedir="${wapackagedir}" packagetype="local" projectdir="${basedir}" definitionfilename="ServiceDefinition.csdef" configurationfilename="ServiceConfiguration.cscfg" <br> &gt; <br></code> <br>  Pay attention to the packagetype attribute - when the value of this attribute is packagetype = "local", then the structure of the assembled project will be exactly the same as for use in the Windows Azure cloud, but the assembly itself will not be packaged for download, but rather prepared for running in the Windows emulator environment Azure.  If the value of the packagetype = "cloud" attribute is then the assembly will be archived as a .cspkg file ‚Äî you can upload the .cspkg and .cscfg files to the cloud through the Windows Azure web portal and deploy and launch the application in the cloud. <br><br><h3>  Laying out a project in Windows Azure </h3>  Laying out the application in the Windows Azure cloud is quite simple - you enter the Windows Azure portal using your login / password and take two simple steps: <br><ol><li>  Downloading PFX certificates (if this has not been done before).  This step is required to enable remote access to running virtual machines in the Windows Azure cloud via Remote Desktop ‚Äî remote access is useful when developing, debugging, and testing applications in Windows Azure ‚Äî for more details, see <a href="http://java.interoperabilitybridges.com/articles/setting-up-remote-desktop-connectivity-for-your-java-app-in-windows-azure" rel="nofollow">Remote Desktop</a> or <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/isv_team/archive/2011/08/01/3444532.aspx" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Windows Azure.</a>  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/isv_team/archive/2011/08/01/3444532.aspx" rel="nofollow">Fast start.</a>  <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/isv_team/archive/2011/08/01/3444532.aspx" rel="nofollow">Part 4.
