  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New DJI in Moscow: Inspire 2 and Phantom 4 Pro</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day we are getting closer and closer to Pelevenskoy Hennelore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/218/101/f3a/218101f3a2619f3751c3a8f3812b4c46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On Wednesday, December 14, 2 new products were presented to the general public in Moscow at once - <a href="http://coptertime.ru/copters/dji-inspire-2/dji-inspire-2/">DJI Inspire 2</a> and <a href="http://coptertime.ru/copters/dji-phantom-4/dji-phantom-4-pro/">DJI Phantom 4 PRO</a> - both devices are new models designed for professional operators and advanced amateurs.  Everyone who wanted to rate the new models was invited - brand fans, aerial photography fans and just photographers, as well as professionals for whom aerial photography and video filming have become the main way of earning and self-expression over the past few years.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13f/0e5/c91/13f0e5c910c646068aac7135d75d3348.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  DJI Phantom4 PRO </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/485/6fb/c6c/4856fbc6c4784169a1ecbd2a708b244d.jpg"><br><br>  The first, perhaps the most accessible, mass and therefore close to a large number of potential buyers was the <a href="http://coptertime.ru/copters/dji-phantom-4/dji-phantom-4-pro/">DJI Phantom4 PRO</a> , which is generally largely similar to its predecessor, but in reality it has been noticeably reworked. <br><br>  A small copter is convenient for shooting extreme sports and in general for all who need mobility and high quality at the same time.  Kirill Umrikhin told us about new features and changes, as well as about the features of sports shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3d/3b8/b90/e3d3b8b90c4ad27366ce9b3d2ddaadea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the slightly modified hull and powerplant with a new battery, providing up to 30 minutes of flight - there is a significantly expanded collision avoidance system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3d/b7e/23a/c3db7e23a87145d2436028133252c38b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the cameras are located not only at the front and bottom, but also at the back, which makes it possible to make safe departures back and use new intelligent flight modes, and the side IR sensors are designed to further facilitate indoor flights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59f/f46/275/59ff46275a922d8b865c40d8d59eac79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera has undergone serious processing, having received the matrix of an ‚Äúadult‚Äù format - 1 ‚Ä≥, which significantly reduced the noise and allowed shooting at dusk and even at night, which previously was possible only with a DJI X5 camera and a DJI Inspire 1 quadrocopter. <br><br>  The 1 ‚Ä≥ 20mpix CMOS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã4 times larger than the matrices of previous models.  Larger sensors can accept much more information, expanding the dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio, as well as the ability to shoot in low light conditions.  The 1-inch 20 megapixel matrix is ‚Äã‚Äã4 times larger than the standard Phantom 4 matrix with a 1 / 2.3 ‚Ä≥ sensor, using larger pixels it was possible to obtain a sensitivity up to 12800ISO <br><br>  In addition, the camera received a mechanical shutter and aperture, which allows to do without neutral filters. <br><br>  Lens resolution and lens contrast are major factors affecting image quality.  It is the quality of the lenses that affects the sharpness, saturation and resolution of photos at high resolution.  The newest camera Phantom 4 Pro is optimized for aerial photography, has an aperture of F / 2.8 with a focal length of 24mm (at 35mm eq).  The lens includes 9 elements in 7 groups, including 2 aspherical lenses placed in a more compact body.  The image has become more detailed, with less distortion and blur, and the photos and videos are more diverse and saturated.  For the first time ever, DJI uncovers the lens structure to enable people to better understand the quality of the lens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/097/41a/f55/09741af55d95ce8e7f93280b78c969fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4K Optimized Shooting</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6BvN1vzUSI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Optimized 4K shooting and video processing system allows you to shoot video with movie quality in 4K resolution (4096 x 2160 / 60fps) with a bitrate up to 100 Mbps, allowing you to shoot slow-motion video with the highest resolution.  Phantom 4 Pro supports H.265 codec (max resolution 4096X2160 / 30fps).  With such a bitrate, H.265 is able to give a quality 2 times higher compared to H.264.  Recording with a wide dynamic range in the D-log will give the maximum amount of data for subsequent color correction. <br><br><h2>  DJI Inspire 2 </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e05/916/66e/e0591666e26954de825aacb260249ec4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second novelty, long awaited by the professional community, is a completely new <a href="http://coptertime.ru/copters/dji-inspire-2/dji-inspire-2/">DJI Inspire 2</a> , which has so far reached only in the form of a pre-production demo sample.  For the presentation of this professional tool, we invited an operator with great experience (more than 2500 missions to DJI Inspire 1 / Pro) - Ruslan Prokhorov. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5WvcXp2dqU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The official start of sales is scheduled a little later.  But already in the demo version we had the opportunity to evaluate the increased flight time - now it can reach 27 minutes (with the X4S camera), a much more stable real-time video transmission, which makes it suitable for live broadcasts.  No less significant was the emergence of the heating of batteries - a function extremely relevant for our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/b84/adf/091b84adf86248d399cc1d2b5c551532.jpg"><br><br>  Now officially quadrocopter can be operated at temperatures down to -20C.  And at altitudes up to 5000m.  In general, the whole Inspire 2 consists of innovations.  Finally, a long-awaited flight camera for a pilot with 2-axis stabilization appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee5/85d/a47/ee585da4760ea6be1c84c34290055395.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you don‚Äôt need to guess where the copter is still oriented, the ‚Äúsmart modes‚Äù of flight are expanded.  An important new feature was the ability to automatically adjust the entire kopter when the suspension reaches the limiter. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDInmfxFM5s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thus, the frame does not have to be interrupted and make a second take.  The new version has received and new cameras.  Unfortunately, the X5 series is not compatible with this copter, but thanks to this it was possible to completely rework the video processing and recording system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/34f/2ca/2ec/34f2ca2ecab41c9ad885fcdb3f48c88c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now all the electronics are in the "body" of the quadrocopter, without creating unnecessary interference to the matrix.  SSD drive and SD card are also installed in the copter.  The cameras are lighter.  X4s gives the maximum flight time, and X5S gives the maximum resolution of 5.2K. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/242/587/335/24258733512c7890af1719b272a805ed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The new CineCore 2.0 processing system integrated into DJI Inspire 2 supports shooting and recording of 5.2K video in Adobe CinemaDNG, Apple ProRes and others. <br><br>  CineCore 2.0 is built into the front of the copter and works with any camera compatible with the gimbal port (currently X4s and X5S). <br><br>  During the presentation, anyone could ask questions both on the technical side and on new functions, and also to make sure that now you do not need to be a designer or a specialist to control the quadcopter.  The remarkable stability of the flight was demonstrated by DJI Mavic PRO, already known to many (in the last presentation it was not possible to verify this on the street). <br><br>  New - DJI Inspire 2, not only flew and showed itself in action, but also provided a direct uninterrupted broadcast on Youtube via the HDMI output of the pilot's console. <br><br>  Phantom 4 Pro demonstrated the work of rear sensors that prevent collisions - in the place where the flights were conducted there was an opportunity to make sure not only that it stopped in front of a brick wall, but also to try to do the same with glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/0ae/216/ea80ae2169914e26bc13cf05b7edecf4.jpg"><br><br>  To master the technique of control is quite possible in a couple of hours.  Visitors could not only participate in discussions, but also try themselves in management under the guidance of specialists. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos from the presentation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3e/72e/4d0/a3e72e4d0fc6441f9d09bf8f633adcfa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c48/28e/24f/c4828e24faa94655937d9d77b8c7eebf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/047/132/bdd0471323b540da96815f3948bdbd32.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b69/800/a85/b69800a8563f44a1bedaf0cc57278bce.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d19/db7/043/d19db7043f714fe09ec53d12e23ef237.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/592/265/253/592265253b4f463f92738e938d914cb1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/b84/adf/091b84adf86248d399cc1d2b5c551532.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/954/101/0ee9541015824775832d2ccccc992864.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/088/a46/18c/088a4618c7a744f7bdd1aa01561cf35d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bb/52d/2a8/4bb52d2a84c04e2b9fdeabb482c784c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b65/572/bed/b65572bed3684d24a3260236d9da9022.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/671/b61/98e671b613f047d9bc6f41851dd3a226.jpg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400091/</a></p>
