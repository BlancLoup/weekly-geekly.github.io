  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make friends 1C and Office 365</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, we faced a very interesting problem of interaction between Microsoft Office 365 and 1C.  When buying Office 365, each user wants to squeeze the maximum out of him, and this is certainly true, since starting to work with him, we take not only desktop applications, but also begin to work with a more extensive range of services. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the main, postal service is the first and main way of external communication in business.  People are divided into those who know why it is needed, and those who do not know.  In business, the one who knows more than his competitors wins.  That is, we smoothly approached the fact that most organizations, and in particular companies whose main activity is trading via the Internet, somehow use both mail and 1C.  And then a completely natural question arises, how to make 1C and Office 365 make friends. <br><br>  At various forums, questions constantly emerge on how to configure the mail service in 1C.  There are a number of simple mail services, where the main thing is to correctly enter the pop3 / smtp protocols, and everything works without problems.  But in our case, some knowledge is required, which, alas, is not imprinted anywhere, and users have to either come to terms with the non-working function, or seek help with all sorts of technical support and continue to produce topics on forums.

      Now I would like to describe an example that I recently encountered and could not find step-by-step instructions on it.  Imagine an organization that maintains its online store, and like any user when purchasing Office 365, she wanted to set up Exchange for herself. <br><br>  <b>To get started, we need to follow the official Office portal and see the</b> settings for accessing Office 365 for business or Microsoft Exchange accounts using POP and IMAP protocols. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/e92/d4b/f25e92d4bd864ec68af530eecbe9654e.png"><br><br>  Now we have data with which to work.  It should immediately be said that SMTP is sending letters, and POP3 / IMAP4 is receiving. <br><br>  Subsequently, we need to go into the 1C database and go to the "Email Account" section, we will get to it by following the web interface: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHome‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúEmail Folders‚Äù&gt; ‚ÄúEmail Processing Rules‚Äù.</i> <br>  And we exit on this window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/14a/29f/a9c14a29f174490d82b0621648b11c5c.png"><br><br>  If the correct dialog box is in front of you, then very little is left. <ol><li>  In the column "E-mail address" we write our e-mail with which we want to interact. </li><li>  In the "Name of the sender of letters" write the desired display name ... <br>  And then the fun begins. </li><li>  The username is the same our email address and subsequently the password from it ... </li><li>  We begin to enter "Servers", "Protocols" and "Ports" from Figure 1. We find the SMTP line and enter information, there is one active check mark in the "Send Mail" tab - leave copies of letters on the server - and there should be no problems ... </li><li>  In the tab "Receive letters" in the latest versions of 1C and the problems begin: when choosing a server and port of POP3, SSL connection errors are constantly generated ... </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/981/571/86d98157125a4212b9e69155f63224e5.png"><br><br>  As experience shows, to get rid of them by trial and error will not work.  The problem is solved by entering IMAP4 values, be sure to leave a tick in the "Use secure connections (SSL)" and "Leave a copy of letters on the server." <br><br>  As a result, 1C performs a check, and everything works.  I hope this small instructive article will save someone a significant amount of time.  1C, oddly enough, sometimes it takes a very long time to check and call over these ticks, which can leave employees without access to the service for several days. <br><br>  <b>And a few more useful tips before using Exchange as part of Office 365:</b> <br><ul><li>  Delegating a domain name is best done during off-hours, preferably on weekends, the recommended duration of this process is 48 hours; </li><li>  Setting up the mail service in 1C is also better to be carried out after hours, so as not to create downtime, the check can take from 5 minutes to several hours; </li><li>  And the last thing, before entering the data in 1C, clear the Inbox folder, its contents will still remain deleted, but you won‚Äôt spend a lot of time waiting for the letters to be scanned (in our example, you tried to start checking with 13 thousand incoming letters, the process just hanging). </li></ul><br>  I hope this article will be useful and will remove one of the main issues before starting work with Office 365. <br><br>  The author - Anton Kovalenchenko. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/272597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/272597/</a></p>
