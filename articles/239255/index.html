Perhaps someone will benefit from my experience with WinPhone-interface after many years of work on iOS. <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  Before reading the review, please note: the review was written in a narrative form, therefore, it is hidden under a habrakat.  If you want to know the final grade - just look at the advantages and disadvantages that I highlighted below.  It is interesting to hear your point of view on the review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Acquaintance </h5><br>  I admit that the first and the last model from this company I had was the 3310 known to all. Not because it was the only one.  There were others between the first and the last.  However, in the end I returned to the 3310 and did not regret anything until the iPhone came out.  Since then, there have been attempts to work on virtually all updates from the world of smartphones, until the iPhone 4 appeared, putting an end to my searches.  Actually, I have it now.  What motivated the new experiments?  Apple has stopped supporting my Quartet in the new iOS. <br>  With this sorted out.  We return to Nokia. <br><br>  They offered a choice of Nokia XL and Nokia Lumia 1520. The first on android, the second on windows phone.  Hard choice.  He took 1520, as a) ‚Äúbecause ... this is ....  same ...  iPhone 6+! ‚Äù, b) a better camera, and c) an axis that I have never seen seriously before.  In addition, it became interesting to personally try out the phone with a diagonal of iPhone 6+.

    <h5>  First experience </h5><br>  I took it in my hand, turned it around, poked it on the menu - a big, inconvenient, too complicated for the iPhone menu owner‚Äôs intuitive understanding, and pressing all the tile buttons (except the player) lead to an update that you cannot get without the Internet. <br><br><h5>  Yota Sim Card </h5><br>  It turned out that a couple of days before Nokia, I had the first SIM card from Yota, a new mobile operator with honest unlimited Internet.  Of course, he immediately stuck the Yota SIM card into the phone and wondered what to do next.  Yota offers to manage your account only through its applications for the iPhone and Android.  Here we come to the first life hack - for future owners of sim cards from Yota.  If you can not connect for some reason to the Internet, then there is a free SMS number 0999, to which you can write an SMS and you will be told what to do in your case. <br><br>  But I was delighted with the earned connection, as I realized that I did not have the promised LTE.  Got into settings.  In the system settings found the item "data transfer";  3G need pens to change to 4G.  Need to get used to.  This is not Apple.  Nobody will do anything for you here.  What's next?  That's right - the update.  Opened, clicked ... Error.  Again went through the settings.  Tried to log in with your old LiveID - again an error.  I stumbled for half an hour.  Turned off the phone and went to the gym. <br><br><h5>  Revelation settings </h5><br>  Before going to bed, at one o'clock in the morning, I decided to look again what‚Äôs wrong with Nokia.  Ran through the settings again.  Logged into your Nokia account and tried to log in via Facebook, and suddenly a new error.  ‚ÄúYou have the wrong date,‚Äù the device writes me.  I go to the date and time settings, I see that they are set automatically. <br>  In disbelief I turn off the machine and - I see 2013.  Again, I swear that I‚Äôm on Windows.  I manually change the date to the current one (this is the second life hack) and return the automatic date settings.  Updates begin to work, they let me into my Nokia account and live.com.  Adventure continues. <br><br><h5>  Interface </h5><br>  At first, the interface looks incomprehensible.  For example, the ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù button, which at first was not only a replacement for ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, but also access to Cortana, lost its ‚Äúsexy search‚Äù after update 8.1.  And in order to understand that the left (of the three navigation keys) not only switches applications in the "multitasking" mode, but also closes them, you just need to be seven spans in the forehead. <br><br>  In spite of this, in the first two days I practically got used to the ‚Äútiled‚Äù WinPhone interface.  He is very friendly and it is even surprising to know that initially (as far as I know from Microsoft employees) it was created for desktop systems.  Very convenient and simple. <br>  It was thanks to simple and fast functionality that people, even those who are not familiar with Nokia and Windows Phone, admired the smartphone and some even decided to buy it in the near future.  I counted five, but - who knows! <br><br><h5>  Applications and games </h5><br>  On the morning of the 4th day, the axis was updated for the whole sub-version and became 8.1.  For some reason, the ‚Äúsensational‚Äù Cortana refused to work in Russian, but such a native taskbar appeared for the iPhone owners.  Well, about a dozen other minor improvements to the interface and a couple of applications. <br><br>  I spent three hours downloading, updating and setting up apps for Nokia.  I did not immediately understand where to turn off the included push-ups, but I found how to disable the background operation of applications.  I was pleased that in three hours of active work the phone was discharged by only a quarter.  For two days he did everything he could do with a smartphone. <br><br>  Then put a bunch of free apps.  Half deleted immediately.  Worn out with the synchronization of the phone with the macbook.  Spat.  Worn out with uploading files to applications via OneDrive / SkyDrive.  With a huge amount of space (32Gb to score without a video is not as easy as you think) without a flash drive, file sharing is extremely difficult.  In this case, for example, some readers ask you to rename the file format specifically for them, and some comic book readers refuse to work with archives and fly out without warning.  Unaccustomed to all this wildly enrages.  There are no normal default fonts on the readers (the habit of iBooks fonts does not disappear right away).  Of the games so far, I managed to try only Halo specially designed for wine backgrounds from the top view.  Not hooked.  I put a couple of simulators, but ... Aviasima turned out to be a miserable similarity.  Asphalt 8 just flew several times before launch.  But, then still earned.  Later in the review I read that there are no games optimized for such a screen on WinPhone yet.  Hence all the problems with the picture. <br><br>  The office is excellent and fast.  Like OneNote.  There is only one problem - on the keyboard layout, to the right of the space, there is a point to which you will no-no, yes, you will get with speed dialing.  I got to the point in 9 cases out of 10, which irritated me wildly.  For the rest of the functions there are no complaints at all. <br>  Found reviews on the phone.  They write that I have treasure in my hands, which I have so underestimated.  I looked at the screenshots of the articles - I learned something for myself in the settings and made corrections.  Still, sometimes you need to read the instructions.  Probably.  I calm myself by trying to test the phone honestly, but usually people don‚Äôt read the instructions until they break something. <br><br>  Immediately calm those who began to panic in the previous paragraphs.  Everything connected with files for software is completely solved by connecting a memory card.  And I managed to do without her, it is possible.  A normal person is easier to buy a card, of course. <br><br>  Spent an extra hour setting up and login in all applications.  Skype for some reason refused to log in after synchronization with the microsoft account (this is a mandatory requirement when you first connect).  Several programs (for example, the Line messenger) required me to say goodbye to accessing messages and message history on another device.  For the sake of experiment, I logged in - indeed, the service has removed access from my iPhone.  Sadly  Pay attention to this, everyone who uses more than one device. <br><br>  My idea to install instant messengers on two different devices simultaneously failed.  Since you are tied to a number, and there is no possibility to link several numbers to your account - such an attempt either simply throws you out of the system, or destroys your entire correspondence history and contacts, trying to re-find them in the phone book.  Better not experiment. <br><br><h5>  Charging </h5><br>  The battery on the 3400 keeps the phone in working condition for three days.  How the battery works with full load - read below.  Perhaps this can immediately close the topic, except that it is necessary to tell about two small nuances.  First, I noticed that with active use, the last 10% of the battery capacity is practically not charged.  So upon reaching 90% you can safely turn off.  The difference is small.  And secondly, with the upgrade to Window Phone 8.1, the phone began to complain about the insufficient power of the current source, regardless of whether the device was powered from the outlet, from the MacBook or from the power bank.  What is the reason I did not understand.  Charged, worked.  The rest was no problem. <br><br><h5>  Calls and Internet </h5><br>  Here, too, nothing special to tell.  Everything is fine, fast and loud.  Internet on Yota worked in most places where MTS weakened hands. <br><br><h5>  Photo and video shooting </h5><br>  For the first time I tested the photo and video capabilities of Nokia a day before the trip to Kazan: at a lecture by the wonderful Zhenya Timonova, who hosted the show ‚ÄúEverything is like animals‚Äù in journalism.  Unexpectedly, it turned out that after upgrading to version 8.1, the phone became slower and less responsive to the photo mode button.  When I handled this unfortunate misunderstanding, everything went like clockwork.  Photos come out bright, rich and lively.  Manual focus works fast enough.  In the video, despite the specifics of the audience (the room, not the audience) - the picture was clear, and despite my slightly trembling hands, it was stable;  and the most important thing, in my opinion, is that the sound is also smooth and clear. <br><br>  The battery also holds "with a bang," all this furious activity.  I still found one minus - the synchronization of the photo album with the cloud allows you to do not only OneDrive, but also a dozen more services, and the video is sent only to OneDrive - and only through Wi-Fi.  On the connection failure, it reacts instantly and then restarts the download for a long time.  Fortunately, the software from Nokia on backup images helped me.  By the way, judging by the interface, the software for users of Apple products is clearly ported with Windows.  Nevertheless, it works without glitches and departures. <br><br>  A week later I was able to really seriously download Lumiya from photo and video shooting.  More than a hundred photos, with mediocre coverage, 7 gigov of data, of which the largest was a 16-minute performance in one take.  At the same time I checked the application for transferring photo-video materials to the laptop and back.  Everything worked fine.  Only the Internet that day came to me quite weak, so I had to transfer the accumulated by overwork in the evening, through fast Wi-Fi. <br><br>  The most serious test Lumiya passed in the conditions of the 9 hour event.  Almost 1000 photos and 55 video interviews, lasting from 2 to 5 minutes for 8 (!) Hours on one charge.  And the smartphone did it.  Is this not a quality indicator? <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  Nokia Lumia 1520 is really a high-quality and thoughtful device.  I, unfortunately, will not take it myself, but I recommend it to those who want to leave the camp of iOS fans. <br>  I myself will refrain why: out of the obvious flaws for today - the keyboard "point" and an extremely small library of applications and games in the Windows Market.  Perhaps these are two key factors for me personally. <br><br>  But the advantages of the phone are much greater.  This is a popular form factor, high-quality build, nice design, stable and easy to learn multitasking operating system, excellent battery, great camera;  and standard applications cover 99% of the needs of the average user. <br><br>  Tell us about your experience with devices on Windows Phone, if it was / is it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239255/</a></p>
