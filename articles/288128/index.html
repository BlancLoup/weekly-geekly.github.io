  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Managing the online image of the company - a new business for former "SEOs"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the era of blogs and digital media, when news spreads over the Internet at the speed of sound, any business can lose its reputation irrevocably within a few days.  One loud scandal is enough - and the information about it will reach absolutely everyone who uses the Internet and knows how to read.  Precedents have already been.  For example, in September 2004, the manufacturer of the prestigious bicycle locks, <a href="http://www.kryptonitelock.com/">Kryptonite,</a> was made a mockery when it appeared that the "ultra-reliable" locks of this company could be opened <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/09/64987">in a few seconds</a> .  Detailed instructions instantly spread around all specialized forums and blogs. <br><br>  The unsuccessful company had to take emergency measures and change 400,000 locks in 21 countries of the world for free.  Until now, the company has not recovered from the financial crisis, and the uncontrollable blogosphere is to blame. <br><br>  What to do in this situation?  How to prevent the spread of bad rumors and manage your image online?  This problem is solved by specialists of the new profile, and the technology itself resembles SEO optimization, but only in real time and on the material of social media and the blogosphere.  Recently, managing online reputation has become a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DviewArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9060960">very fashionable profession</a> .  But the question arises: how legal and ethical is this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Social media monitoring, consumer opinion research through online content analysis, marketing intelligence and SMO, that is, Social Media Optimization - all these terms are used to describe a new type of business.  While most directors are wary of trusting new-type technologies and turning to similar specialists, but there are also those who are trying to get ahead of their time and gain a competitive advantage.  The most advanced of them are already placing orders.  For example, the world's largest IT corporation, Microsoft, has hired several companies to run pilot projects in the field of online image monitoring.  Among the contractors are <a href="http://www.visibletechnologies.com/">Visible Technologies</a> and others.

      Typical representatives of the new-fangled business - <a href="http://www.reputationhawk.com/">ReputationHawk.com</a> and <a href="http://www.buildtelligence.com/">Buildtelligence</a> - provide their clients with complete and comprehensive reputation management online.  It is quite expensive: a campaign with a duration of 6-12 months will cost from $ 15 thousand to $ 100 thousand. <br><br>  The work of specialists is hard.  They say that it is especially difficult to clear out negative information from Wikipedia.  The problem is that Google values ‚Äã‚ÄãWikipedia content very high, although not as high as before. <br><br>  The companies listed above in this market are joined by a completely different class of firms, the so-called ‚Äúlinguists‚Äù.  They are engaged in the collection and content analysis of messages on forums and blogs.  Serious experts in the field of linguistics, at the level of doctors and candidates of sciences work there.  Together with programmers, they create automatic text analysis programs with an assessment of the emotional level of each commentary on a scale, for example, from +10 (delighted) to -10 (angry). <br><br>  There are also companies that specialize solely in removing unwanted content from online.  In such offices there are usually teams of lawyers who are engaged in sending letters to the authorities.  They quickly achieve the desired result through hosting providers, site owners and forums.  Usually, one competently composed letter with the threat to sue is sufficient. <br><br>  Human rights activists and representatives of consumer rights protection societies can repeat as much as they like that the existence of all the above companies is an attempt to play a dishonest game, manipulate public opinion and deceive consumers, but this will not decrease such companies as long as there is a demand . <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DviewArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9060960">Computerworld</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288128/</a></p>
