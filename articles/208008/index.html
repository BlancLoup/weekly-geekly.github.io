  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Graphene Storage Concept Receives Red Dot Design Awards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The futuristic design of the media of a new type was awarded the prestigious <a href="http://www.red-dot.sg/en/online-exhibition/concept/%3Fcode%3D1039%26y%3D2013%26c%3D17%26a%3D0">Red Dot Design Awards Winner</a> , and a start-up with the strange name <a href="http://asdsdesign.com/">dataSTICKIES</a> , who created a flash-memory concept based on graphene as thick as a film, intends to show a working prototype of the device in the relatively near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d48/25c/eb6/d4825ceb685c6cdb66b0b96e4bc34ae4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The starting point for designers from India, Paraga Anand and Aditi Singh (Parag Anand &amp; Aditi Singh) was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrelieving users of difficulties with flash drives, which are difficult to insert into the computer the right side, especially when the port is located on the back of the device.  To this end, the designers developed the concept of a surface optical data transfer interface (Optical Data Transfer Surface - ODTS), to which, in turn, the drives themselves, which are a thin graphene film coated with an adhesive layer, will be connected, just like on paper stickers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b15/f99/12c/b15f9912c3ebf16f1a2185c0e6c3ea2a.jpg" alt="image">

      ODTS is a transparent panel of a special conductive adhesive, which is attached to the case of the device, for example - a monitor, and is connected wirelessly to a computer, and flash drives that also have a conductive adhesive layer are attached to this panel.  While reading or writing data, the edges of the film will be highlighted to indicate the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c42/436/d17/c42436d177dcc2e766f6915fb4d7de59.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As the marketing images of these drives show, they will consist of at least three layers, where the center will contain a graphene layer several atoms thick, and the outer surfaces will be protective surfaces made of flexible multicolored translucent plastic with adhesive areas for data transmission, and This plastic can be written with a marker, like on sticky notes.  It is understood that several such flash drives can be glued together to increase the total volume, in which case the connected drives will act as a single device, but if you need to transfer one file to someone, you can do this simply by unplugging one of the flash drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab5/0f6/88a/ab50f688a79f4e85bd30941047bf0a81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Graphene was chosen as the information carrier for its outstanding properties not only as a very thin material, but also as the strongest existing - a few years ago, researchers from Rice University <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9123838/Researchers_create_graphite_memory_only_10_atoms_thick">showed the</a> technology to create memory from a graphene film only ten atoms thick, which could potentially provide memory comparable to modern flash drives, but at the same time will be able to withstand a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius and a level of radiation that would destroy any of the modern media  .  At the moment, the developers expect to fit on small graphene stickers from 4 to 32 GB of data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59d/3f8/32f/59d3f832fc176b3b77ba61d2e928be5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The startup of two Indian designers set a goal not only to design a new device for data storage, but also new scenarios for working with such media.  For example, the ODST wireless data transmission system can be connected not only to a computer, but also to a telephone, a TV system and a music center, accessing the drives from any of these devices, and the concept of a flash drive eliminates obstacles between the virtual and physical world. - data becomes easier to associate with physical objects, such as books or magazines, where relevant information can be literally pasted to the page. <br><br>  So far, this is only a concept that won the <a href="http://www.red-dot.sg/en/online-exhibition/concept/%3Fcode%3D1039%26y%3D2013%26c%3D17%26a%3D0">2013 Red Dot Award for</a> design awards, but apparently - we can still catch the times when information carriers will become an inexpensive consumable material, as well as notes, notebooks or stickers, paper for which also once was not cheap.  It is not known whether this will happen soon, but in any case there are prerequisites for this.  For now - happy new year, Habr! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208008/</a></p>
