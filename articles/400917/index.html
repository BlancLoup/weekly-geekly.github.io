  <section class="page js-page"><h1>These things from Xiaomi pump your home in full</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  Most importantly, as they say, the weather in the house.  Therefore, in pursuit of a new smartphone, tablet or camera, you should not forget that modern devices allow not only to have everything you need at hand, but also to change the home beyond recognition, to make it better and more technological.  Still vacuuming and washing windows by hand?  Then we ... no, we will not go to you.  You'd better give - under the cut a lot of interesting! <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/285092/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/561/291/102/5612911029f1531b87e09455d7c55fcb.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Houses, of course, are different.  For some, it is odnushka in Otradny area of ‚Äã‚Äã35 square meters, for others it is a mansion in Barvikha for several hundred square meters plus a house square in a couple of hectares, a gardener and a butler named Alfred (well, the latter is optional).  In the second case, as a rule, special organizations that provide ready-made solutions in the form of systems for half a million rubles are responsible for filling the house with technologies.  But today we will restrain our appetites and we will ‚Äúbudget‚Äù the house using the example of an average studio of 50 square meters. <br><br>  This is one of the typical layouts of a two-room apartment, not only in Moscow, but also in any city in Russia.  Of course, in this case there are other arrangements for arranging furniture - here everything depends on your imagination.  Nevertheless, the options for placing gadgets on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãan apartment from 40 to 70 square meters are about the same, regardless of the layout.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecd/18f/44b/ecd18f44b5add166176104311f7498e4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  It's warm and dry here </h2><br>  Let's start with something simple ‚Äî for example, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344665.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">XIAOMI Mi Smart Temperature and Humidity Sensor</a> .  The capabilities of the device are clear from the name, but there are several subtleties that need to be known before choosing this sensor as a ‚Äúpumping‚Äù tool at home.  For example, the error in measuring humidity with it is 3%, but the sensor gives information about temperature with pleasant accuracy - up to 0.3 ¬∞ C. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/049/15f/3a3/04915f3a369900c6ad988a89fa417944.jpg"><br><br>  If your home is not colder than -20 ¬∞ C and hotter than +60 ¬∞ C, the sensor will work properly.  A small weight of 15 g and a diameter of about 4 cm make its installation easy and convenient in any corner of the apartment - whether it be a kitchen or a bedside table.  It is especially necessary to monitor the humidity if there are small children in the room for a long time, although it is much more pleasant for adults to sleep indoors with the optimum humidity level.  Is the air too dry?  No problem, the sensor will automatically give a signal to start the humidifier (more on that later). <br><br>  In order for the system to work, a device called the XIAOMI Mi Smart Wi-Fi Multifunction Gateway, which sends data to the Mi Home special application, is required to the temperature and humidity sensor.  You can always control the ‚Äúweather‚Äù in your home with your smartphone - this allows you to react in a timely manner to a flood from your neighbors above or a fire in the kitchen. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_344667.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">XIAOMI Multifunction Gateway</a> is essentially the center of the Xiaomi smart home system - it is he who transmits readings to a mobile device.  In combination with a temperature, humidity and movement sensor we get a complete system.  Multifunction Gateway also has a speaker and backlight with 16 million colors.  If a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_257677.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">motion sensor is</a> installed, you can configure, for example, the automatic activation of the backlight or sound signal during any activity near the sensor (use as a technological night light, for example). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83e/b8f/741/83eb8f741de1cfbee2339959203ec0ce.jpg"><br><br>  So where will we put all this?  To use the Multifunction Gateway as a night light, it is best to install it in the hall, somewhere near the bathroom.  We will install three motion sensors: near the entrance door, at the entrance to the bedroom and near the balcony door - who knows where uninvited guests will come from.  As for the temperature and humidity sensor, it is better to place it somewhere near the ventilation box: in the kitchen, due to cooking, there may be false alarms, and in the room we have a fireplace. <br><br>  This is what we get at the output: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a49/b9d/1c3/a49b9d1c306d2b2fee9ba6395c387d66.png"><br><br>  Since we are talking about the climate, it is logical to complete this topic - and the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-smart-improvements/pp_268522.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Smart Mi Air Purifier</a> from Xiaomi will help in this.  This is the second generation of the device, which has already managed to reliably establish itself in many houses and apartments.  Its dimensions have become smaller, but the air cleans everything just as well. <br><br>  Hourly, the purifier conducts up to 330 cubic meters of air through itself, filtering up to 99.7% of particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which represent a potential health hazard.  If the particles are smaller (diameter 0.3 micrometer), the quality of cleaning is reduced, but only by 0.2%.  Large device also filters all without exception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/262/bd4/d3d/262bd4d3d49d37a81484eea331bb3f16.jpg"><br><br>  It looks cool not only outside, but also inside, where two fans are located, filters in the form of activated carbon, HEPA, PET nets. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/044/841/04f/04484104f7854f86cba6b3d1d3f42c38.jpg"></div><br>  The recommended room size for effective cleaning (whether it be smoking and formaldehyde) - from 23 to 39 meters - is excellent, it suits us.  Using the indicator on the front panel, you can find out the state of the air: if it is green, everything is fine, yellow - there is already an excess of the permissible level of harmful particles, red - it is better to leave the room and let the cleaner do its work. <br><br>  The cleaner works automatically when the Smart Mi Air Purifier decides on air cleaning itself, nightly - the device works almost silently, and the user when you set the intensity of the cleaner's work.  Management, as in the previous case, is carried out using the application Mi Home. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e22/ed0/ca4/e22ed0ca41cd5160ce8a1908fdb5ed87.jpg"></div><br>  With our room area (21 square meters), the cleaner can be placed anywhere, but most often it is installed either near the sofa or near the workplace.  So do! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a2/d22/9b5/5a2d229b55c9e12fa71fb683669f1b6f.png"><br><br><h2>  Boil? </h2><br>  About the next representative of our collection dreamed back in the last century.  Wake up in the morning and immediately pour yourself tea or coffee, without waiting for the kettle to boil - well, what could be better?  For this, Xiaomi made <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/kitchen-appliances/pp_366782.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Mi Kettle</a> - a smart kettle that will become just an indispensable assistant in the kitchen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7e/2f7/da6/a7e2f7da6a0333de8bd05e2a828bdac1.jpg"><br><br>  The device (yes, let's call it that) is offered in a universal white color and has a capacity of 1.5 liters.  Inside - stainless steel brand 304, which not only is easy to clean from scale, but does not give the water a metallic smell and "aroma".  There is a short circuit protection, automatic shutdown, but this does not make the kettle ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. <br><br>  Using the Mi Home application, you can set the desired water temperature - the kettle will not just boil water, but will also maintain the desired temperature.  The latter is displayed in real time - you can, for example, wait until the water warms up to 50 degrees, and turn off the kettle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8b/b84/b19/c8bb84b19fc28b6f8fd65ea263104ca7.jpg"><br><br>  The thing is actually very cool - the same Strix temperature sensors come from a British company.  A power of 1800 watts will reduce the time required for boiling water.  You can place such a kettle anywhere (as usual) - in our case, most likely, it is better to place it on one of the work surfaces in the kitchen.  Yet it does not work from the battery, but from the network. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5a/ece/482/d5aece482bdbe0c59fc50c571fe9d985.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Control me completely </h2><br>  What about throwing the remote from the TV, audio system, air conditioner and replace all of them with a smartphone?  The universal <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-home/pp_229556.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">IR Remote Controller</a> will help to realize this ... yes, again from Xiaomi!  It allows you to control devices via infrared channel within sight, while receiving commands via Wi-Fi from an iPhone or Android smartphone.  The Mi Home app is once again the unified ‚Äúflight control center‚Äù. <br><br>  The device itself is a hockey puck on steroids. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c98/48e/cad/c9848ecad54184c55dde6b054de873e2.jpg"></div>  Only 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi networks are supported, the plug-in for Mi Home, through which new devices are added, is constantly updated.  The maximum signal range is 20 meters, for an average room it will fit easily.  Xiaomi claims "incredible" compatibility with most modern technology, which allows minimizing the number of consoles in the house to one.  In the form of your smartphone.  Some elements of the Mi Home application are available only in Chinese, but there are many instructions on the network for localizing the program, including in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cba/e41/11c/cbae4111c594d178361823d66cde7410.jpg"><br><br>  Since the layout of the TV is planned on our scheme, and the soundbar on a special shelf is planned under it, it is possible to provide a place for such a box next to it.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device will be all the equipment in the room - from the TV and air conditioner to the audio system and Blu-Ray player. <br><br><h2>  To be clean </h2><br>  Well, how can a house claim to be technologically advanced, if you still manually wash the floors and walk around the house with a vacuum cleaner under your arm?  Disorder.  If it is, for example, Dyson, the conversation is different, although even an assistant sometimes does not interfere with it.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/robot-vacuum/pp_440546.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum</a> can easily be the last: this robot cleaner will do all the work before you come home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e35/95a/63e/e3595a63e38bbba09b9c4c3a6f6f6a95.jpg"><br><br>  But the trick is not only in this - vacuum cleaning robots, you see, there are plenty of them on the market now.  Round case, base, dust collector with brushes - everything is as usual here.  Separate attention deserves the management of the vacuum cleaner using a mobile application: got a smartphone, entered the days of the week and the time when you need to start cleaning, and the vacuum cleaner will do its job on a schedule.  The robot will perform the task until it removes all available space, or until the battery charge is lower than 20%.  If you have too much space, it will stand on the base, charge the batteries and continue from the same place where you finished last time. <br><br>  When cleaning, the robot automatically creates a map of the room where its trajectories are displayed, this information is available in the mobile application.  You can visually see how the vacuum cleaner coped with the task, which places were suddenly not affected, and if necessary, change the location of the furniture to improve the quality of cleaning.  The plugin displays not only the status of the robot and the map, but also the harvested area, as well as the battery charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afd/2e1/cac/afd2e1cac7928c3c9d143f074443f587.jpg"><br><br>  The robot cleans the declared area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 square meters within an hour, so that it can work when you are at home.  On one charge at maximum power, the robot vacuum cleaner cleans an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 120 square meters. <br><br>  Remember when was the last time you washed the windows?  Probably a year ago, unless you trust this business to professional cleaning companies.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/robot-vacuum/pp_485691.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Cop Rose</a> is essentially the same robot cleaner, but designed for washing windows.  Two turbines of the vacuum cleaner actively suck the air, due to which the robot does not fall and presses against the glass.  It takes about 15 minutes to clean one window, and in order to achieve the best effect, you can additionally apply some kind of wet detergent. <br><br>  Although the work of the robot vacuum cleaner requires a constant connection to the network, the thing is still interesting - there are so few who have it.  In addition, the device is controlled using a mobile application. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4db/281/48a/4db28148a7be6588c140a5d5f9dc962e.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Well, cool "nishtyaki" </h2><br>  All these accessories somehow need to be charged, powered from the network, and so on.  Xiaomi provided a solution for this case by releasing an <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_263628.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">electrical extension</a> with LED indicator.  And so that all devices can connect to Wi-Fi from anywhere in the house, there is a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/network-cards/pp_599142.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Wi-Fi amplifier</a> .  It works not only with Xiaomi routers, but is configured in a couple of minutes using the Mi Home application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c71/5b1/ef5/c715b1ef5c78dc4025318d4d75d7ba93.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/655/24b/269/65524b26992b2918fa421e685bd80691.jpg"><br><br>  But even these are not all devices with the help of which Xiaomi can make a home more technologically - there is also a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/kitchen-appliances/pp_342394.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">rice cooker</a> controlled from a smartphone, a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-light-bulb/pp_278478.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">smart lamp</a> and much more. <br><br><h2>  Even smarter </h2><br>  To summarize, taking into account almost all the above-mentioned accessories, our smart home will look something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a7/5b7/93e/3a75b793e4ba62cb58f0b80b8768862b.png"><br><br>  Of course, this is just an example of how to make your home at least a little bit more technological with small material and labor costs.  The next step, of course, will be the system of opening windows and blinds from a smartphone, as well as lighting control throughout the house.  Maybe you already have this experience?  Share in the comments how to create your smart home. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400917/</a></p>
