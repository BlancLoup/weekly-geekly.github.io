Hope this helps. <br><br><h5>  General rules in one line </h5><br>  <i>Don't panic!</i>  <i>(D.Adams)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do not argue with customs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do everything your accountant requires.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Work, work, work!</i>  <i>Rest, rest, rest!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Start - you know that you are going </h5><br><h6>  Make a date in the calendar! </h6>  As soon as you know that you are driving - right away!  The closer to a business trip, the more points will be in the calendar - meetings, departures, arrivals, lunches, vacations, etc.  It is especially important to work with the calendar, if you are going to a conference, an exhibition and similar events where meetings are possible, seminars can be held. <br><br><h6>  Tickets - what, how much and when. </h6>  After determining the duration of the trip (for example, I always put the day on the way there and the day back - just in case), make sure you get there - in other words, take care of the tickets.  If tickets are ordered, be sure to get all the dates and time of departure / arrival.  This is important, because you still need to get to the hotel and register, and if you get late, then you should know - the night shift in hotels is always free from day time.

    <h6>  Documents in the accounting department. </h6>  An extremely important element of your trip.  Make sure that you are issued a travel order and an order that the dates are correct, that the destination of the trip is exact, that the purpose is correct.  And in any case, do not forget to put stamps in the proper sections - otherwise life will be hard upon returning. <br><br><h5>  Stayed a couple of days </h5><br><h6>  Calendar and weather: </h6>  once again look at the calendar, enter what you forgot;  check the weather for your trip - it happened that when you arrived, you had to walk in the rain, because  There was no time to buy an umbrella.  Or vice versa - you will gather warm things when there is warm weather in the place of business trip. <br><br><h6>  Tickets and documents. </h6>  Try to get all the ‚Äúpermits‚Äù for the trip and keep them at home.  Forget accounting - do not expect travel or cover costs. <br><br><h6>  Money and communication. </h6>  Important components of the trip.  The official financial part of you will find, of course, accounting.  But there are representational expenses.  This is where your filled calendar will help - think about the meetings, where they will be, where the events will be.  So you can more or less determine the amount of representation expenses that you need.  And if you can, take more.  There is no worse situation where at the table with partners you cannot cover the bill. <br>  An important element is credit cards (or a salary card, if you list everything there).  Make sure you do not block it on the trip.  It is better not to take on faith the words of the accountant that everything is in order.  Call the bank and check in person. <br>  The year before last, I was so ‚ÄúAlfa-Bank‚Äù blocked the card in Spain.  And in your pocket 2 euros.  The doooooo call to the support service resulted in a very large amount, which the valiant operator removed from my balance immediately.  Lucky there was enough money in the account. <br>  With operators, too, everything is simple - look for a package for the country / city where you are going.  On Habr√© there are a number of materials to solve the problem.  I use Tele2, because  roaming prices are very acceptable.  The rest - I sympathize with and advise either a package or buy a SIM card on the spot. <br><br><h6>  Working materials. </h6>  All that is needed and all the general presentations / materials / letters / pictures / videos / other carry with you!  Be armed to the teeth.  Some of the materials that do not fall under the confidentiality agreement (if you signed it) can be duplicated and put into any online service. <br><br>  Judging by the amount of text, you should complete this part of the article, and leave the suitcase, the tricks of the flight, check-in, etc. leave the next time, if the habravchan has a desire to continue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124711/</a></p>
