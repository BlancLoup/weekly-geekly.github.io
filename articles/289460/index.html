  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linkedin buys Lynda.com. And who in Russia will decide to lead online education?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  News of the day: the social network Linkedin <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/09/linkedin-to-buy-online-education-site-lynda-com-for-1-5-billion/">buys the</a> educational portal Lynda.com for $ 1.5 billion. Another project that we have noticed less: combining the efforts of Alibaba and Peking University to <a href="http://technode.com/2015/02/28/alibaba-peking-university-establish-chinese-mooc-platform">create a Chinese MEP platform</a> .  How about us?  Who in RuNet will be the first to make a serious bid to lead online education? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The trend that had only been outlined earlier - the merging of large portals and social networks (as well as HR services) with online training, may now take over Russia.  Indeed, according to many, there is no convenient social network that combines the MEP platform - mass online courses, student communication and integration with the professional community of tutors and tutors.  And in the world as a whole, ‚ÄúFacebook for education‚Äù has not yet been created (perhaps Linkedin + Lynda tandem will solve this problem). <br><br>  If the trend of ‚Äúsocial network + HR + MEP‚Äù picks up the pace in the world, then undoubtedly, in Russia, it is also worth waiting for this model to be copied (like after the success of Coursera, like home mushrooms after a rain, new homegrown MEP services appear).  From whom do we expect to apply for leadership in online education?

      First of all, I want to note that I know two relatively successful attempts to combine the HR-service and the MEP.  First, it is the proprietary LMS <a href="http://www.mirapolis.ru/">Mirapolis</a> , which, first made one of the best webinar services "Virtual Room" and a convenient learning management system (LMS), and then managed to grow to an excellent corporate personnel management system (HCM - Human Capital Management).  Mirapolis has one minus (in the sense of a race for primacy in the HR + MEP-race) - closeness.  This is not a social network, but (exclusively) a paid service designed for the corporate sector. <br><br>  Secondly, of course, <a href="http://eduhh.ru/">the ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù project</a> from the leading job search service HeadHunter should be noted.  Despite the fact that this project, which began a couple of years ago, turned out to be unprofitable and was closed, it was reopened some time ago, and, at first glance, in the same form as it started (but under the control of another operator).  Unlike Mirapolis, this is an open project, in fact, a showcase of courses (but not yet a platform where these courses can be taken, and not an LMS).  But you can expect a simplified integration with the services of HeadHunter, and even with mail.ru, if, of course, there will be a solution. <br><br>  Here we come to the charts of giant services, which, in my opinion, should lead the online education.  Expect a list: mail.ru, Yandex, maybe another 1C and Poster-Rambler.  Moreover, the first three have a good experience of building their own educational offline network (sometimes successfully tied to universities, and sometimes a prototype of their own university): this is Technopark and Technosphere mail.ru, Yandex Data Analysis School, Lecturers and network 1C Programmers School. <br><br>  So, the main player is a large Internet service (portal, HR, software maker).  And on the other hand, an analogue of Linda (content holder and / or organizer of the MEP)?  There are a lot of players on this field (from small to medium), it is hardly worth listing them all.  I would mention INTUIT - the oldest and most respected Internet University, the pioneer of online education in Russia <a href="http://teachpro.ru/">teachpro.ru</a> and, perhaps, as the most widely promoted, the LinguaLeo English learning service. <br><br>  I would put a separate line and Habr, who has already done a small miracle, becoming a resource of technical publications No. 1 and for which I see no obstacles to entering the online education market (technical same). <br><br>  Perhaps I have forgotten someone, but this is not on purpose, but from a lack of knowledge. <br><br>  We wait? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289460/</a></p>
