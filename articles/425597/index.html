      Of course, two or even three hundred years ago, we could not talk about any familiar ‚Äúelectronic tools‚Äù.  Nevertheless, many followers of the ideals of the Enlightenment were keenly interested in not only physics and the extremely popular electricity in the 18th century, but also lyrics (more precisely, music) ‚Äîand they tried to combine the two directions. <br><br>  Musical instruments often became a ‚Äúby-product‚Äù of scientific research by their authors in the 19th century (a typical example is the music telegraph of Elisha Gray). <br><br>  So the first instruments appeared, the purpose of which was not more convenient for the performer or not in the new sound.  These were rather experimental tools designed to show the possible practical application of those discoveries made by their creators: physicists, engineers, and inventors. <br><br><h2>  XVIII century: magnetic and electric harpsichords </h2><br>  One of the first tools working on the force of magnetic attraction was a simple acoustic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon">carillon</a> , a mechanical construction with several bells, which is often installed on the belfries of churches and municipal buildings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_f/zi/me/_fzimeywkzgqfyha22zqysnsd8m.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon">Oliver Raupach</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">CC BY SA</a></i></font> <br><br>  The tool appeared in 1785 thanks to research into the possibilities of magnetism and electricity, conducted by Abb√© Pierre Bertholon de Saint-Lazare, a French mathematician and scientist. <br><br>  Despite the name (harpsichord), the instrument of Bertolon was not stringed in the direct sense of the word.  The Clavecin Magnetique device was as simple as possible: metal hammers hit the bells under the influence of magnets, which approached and removed from the hammers by pressing the keys on the keyboard. <br><br>  In his work on magnetism, Bertolon recalled a device developed earlier by the Jesuit Jean-Baptiste de Laborde.  In 1759, he assembled Clavecin √âlectrique, the first instrument documented in history to make sound using electricity.  The static electric charge was developed using the "Leyden jar" - the first electric capacitor invented by the Dutch scientist Peter van Muschenbruck in 1745.  He provided the vibration of metal bells of different sizes and tonalities.  The tool worked on the principle of proto-organ. <br><br>  The name (harpsichord), later used by Bertolon, was deceptive and was intended to ‚Äúenhance the status‚Äù of inventions: the carillons, which in fact were both instruments, did not enjoy a serious reputation in the music world.  Electric "stuffing", in the opinion of de Laborde, was the "soul of the instrument."  Moreover, during a performance in a dark room, the instrument became ‚Äúaudiovisual‚Äù because the extraction of sound was accompanied by sparks from static electricity: ‚ÄúThe listener's eyes,‚Äù <a href="http://120years.net/clavecin-electrique-1759/">said</a> de Laborde, ‚Äúlit up in surprise at the sight of amazing flashes.‚Äù <br><br>  He did not develop the instrument further, although he was popular with the audience.  The model, built by him, is still kept in the National Library in Paris. <br><br>  But while de Labord was looking for a soul in the confluence of music and electricity, his follower, Bertolon, was more inspired by how his discoveries could enrich human history through the interrelation of art and science.  Moreover, he had to defend the reputation of his scientific research, which nourishes the arts and develops them: ‚ÄúThings that arouse curiosity often have practical value.  There are many similar examples in the history of science and art: when the philosopher Thales of Miletus, six hundred years BC, discovered that if you rub a piece of amber, he would begin to attract small objects to himself, everyone believed that his discovery was superficial and useless.  People did not assume that this property, so seemingly insignificant, would one day lead to the fact that the courageous generation of Prometheus would be able to subordinate heavenly fire to his will, to pacify and tame lightning, <a href="http://120years.net/the-clavecin-magnetique-m-labbe-bertholon-france-1785/">‚Äùhe wrote</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe discovery of the magnetic harpsichord is interesting, because it is the result of curiosity, and any open truth is valuable;  and it will have beneficial consequences, even if it is not so soon that our weak eyes cannot see it yet. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h2>  XIX century: electromechanical piano </h2><br>  The German Matthias Hipp was a ‚Äúserial inventor‚Äù: he was engaged in chronoscopes, chronographs, galvanometers, signal equipment for railways, watches and gyros.  He was probably the inventor of the world's first "real" electronic musical instrument. <br><br>  It is curious, moreover, that specific descriptions or sketches of the Gipp device have not survived: we know about its electromechanical piano from fragments of descriptions that have come down to us by contemporaries, later processed by other authors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/os/cy/eyoscyr48temhwdr2dntfc_vbea.jpeg" width="500"></div><br><br>  Andrea Baroni, author <a href="https://ru.scribd.com/document/35803303/Andrea-Baroni-A-Brief-History-of-Synthesizers">of</a> A Brief History of Synthesizers, describes the mechanism as follows: ‚ÄúPressing the keys set in motion electromagnets.  They, in turn, set in motion the dynamos (small DC generators), which produced the sound.  A similar principle will later form the basis of Thaddeus Cahill Telarmonium. ‚Äù <br><br>  Another theory was that the piano became a ‚Äúby-product‚Äù of the development of a much more well-known invention of Gipp - the <a href="http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/documents/schraven_art13.pdf">chronoscope of the</a> same name. <br><br>  He, in particular, was actively used by physiologists and psychologists of the time - to measure the speed of mental reaction.  One of the components of the chronoscope was a thin plate (lamella), vibrating at a frequency of strictly 1000 Hz and producing a characteristic sound (due to this property, the piano tuner could calibrate the chronoscope).  In theory, Gipp could create a musical instrument, using this principle, and combining records into one device, tuned to vibration at different frequencies. <br><br>  The tool, quite possibly, was created by Gipp in the process of designing some other developments.  Nevertheless, his ‚Äúelectromechanical piano‚Äù, described in the 1867 region, remained forever in the history of electronic music. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>What else do we have in the <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU">Telegram channel</a> about audio gadgets and sound in microformat:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/634">Why are we afraid of sounds</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/621">How Star Wars Sounded</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/627">Unusual portable</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/625">Cinema on the plates</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/633">Zen Audiomania</a></i> <i><br></i> <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425597/</a></p>
