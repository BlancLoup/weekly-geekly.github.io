And this opinion will show them in a completely different perspective. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Prehistory </h5><br>  Within a year ago, my colleagues began to go to CDAC courses in India.  First, one person for half a year, for training under a highly saturated program, then the second for three months - already under an easier program.  Upon arrival, they told in detail about their stay in India and their opinion about people in India (I will not retell their opinion, but I took note of it for myself). <br><br>  But just recently the Indians came to us to establish a computer class for remote learning, etc.  I (like all of my colleagues) should have been with them in my duties and provide some help.  These two days will be discussed here.  There were three Hindus, we divided them into chief, administrator and networker.  Well, by caste, we identified them as follows - three castes: on the floor (networker), on the chair (admin), above all (boss).

    <h5>  Story </h5><br>  It all started with the fact that they came the next day from the declared. <br>  All the equipment that they were supposed to put was already brought for a long time, and delivered by us (software engineers-loaders) to the right audience.  By the way, the equipment is all great.  Here are just a projector pumped up, some kind of weak. <br><br>  Upon their arrival, we found out the plan of their work: <br><ul><li>  build a network in the audience </li><li>  install 10 computers </li><li>  install 1 server </li><li>  set 1 router and 1 switch </li><li>  install Windows7, MS Office 2010, Symantec on all computers </li><li>  expand the whiteboard </li><li>  deploy a video conferencing system </li></ul><br>  And what do you think, how much time it all went?  Two full days. <br>  The first day is from 9 am to 9 pm, and then on the condition that we practically kicked them out, as we are already tired of sitting with ourselves, and the girls-translators were of the same opinion.  The second day from 8 am to 8 pm  All the work was done only by two, the head did not do anything, but entertained our translators with photos and music on his note and other conversations.  By the way, translators were still Indians and were accompanied around the city in such a way that they would probably have told more about them. <br><br>  We communicated with them in English, but only their boss spoke normally, but with such an accent that the translators did not help us.  In general, the solution of technical issues was enough for our level of knowledge of English; it was even harder for girls to understand technical terms. <br><br>  The Hindus, in addition to what they brought with them, were provided with everything they needed, since in addition to us other departments helped them there. <br>  The first thing they started with was the laying of twisted pair boxes.  At that moment we were already sitting and communicating with each other, not paying attention to the Indians, because we just had everything they needed for laying the boxes (the boxes themselves, various corners for the joints of the boxes, screws).  And here I can hear a hammer knock, first I missed it, but when it sounded the second time, I became alert - since the wall was covered with plasterboard and they were given screws.  It was decided to check and for good reason, there was no limit to our surprise, the Hindu did hammer the screws into the drywall.  Naturally, I stopped him, and immediately ran to our networkers for a screwdriver, and this time my colleague on the fingers (as only the head of the Hindus, who was walking around at that time, speaks normal English), explained that the screws should be screwed.  When I‚Äôm with our networker (officially ‚ÄúLead Electronic Engineer‚Äù) have already returned with a screwdriver, they noticed another jamb - the box was going to be fixed at 10 cm from the floor, which is below the sockets 220v from which they just go under the floor (well that they might not have known), and even the box would have closed the shield (an iron door, behind which you can get to the wires) by making it inaccessible. <br>  Somehow we explained that it was not necessary to do this, showed how and where it is better to fix the box.  But I still had to walk near the level and help them to secure the box smoothly. <br>  We left them on this, our networker didn‚Äôt stand it at all and with the words ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look at it‚Äù left.  Then we also discovered a clever twisting of the box in the corners of the audience (we had given them a long time ago). <br>  All their work freezes from time to time, they begin to do something their own, incomprehensible, but basically this is a seat on our internet (only their boss then came with a 3G modem) and chatting on their language on Skype.  Moreover, such breaks were at all stages. <br><br>  After they still laid the box, it was the turn of the twisted pair (it was the 6th category).  At this stage, too, had its own shoals, namely, terribly irrational use of a twisted pair.  Of the scraps we still make patchcords, the lengths of scraps rarely have a length of less than a meter, usually it is about 3 meters, although they came across 6 meters each, more than once (they almost laid 305 meters of the bay, 30-50 meters left, although there 180 it was necessary). <br><br>  Next came the turn of the power outlets.  Those that they brought were for indoor installation, no one naturally let them break the walls.  To replace them, they brought our usual sockets which, by the way, are three times smaller than those they brought.  Sockets were placed directly under the boxes.  There are already sticking up pieces of wire (from 20 to 40 cm).  The Hindus did not even think of shortening these pieces, they simply squeezed their edges into the sockets, and the rest of the wire, twisting anyhow, was stuffed under the covers of the sockets and snapped them with force.  Naturally, after they collected the sockets, a third of them did not work, and for a long time the Indians ran something, checked and reworked.  By the way, on mounting 4 sockets again they had a big incomprehensible pause.  At that moment we had already unpacked the TV (46 ', fullHD), intended for the videoconferencing system, and began to watch various video clips on it, so as not to get bored at all.  There was another moment with power outlets - for no reason at all they took and installed 7 more outlets on the wall where no computers were provided and only one outlet for the video conferencing system was needed.  First, no one could get them to why this was done.  It was only later from their head that they managed to find out that they had some kind of incomprehensible TK (it was completely different to be agreed upon) 19 power outlets were written, so they delivered the missing ones anywhere. <br><br>  The time lasted around 5:00 pm and I went to ask their supervisor what plan they were going to do next and what time they planned to finish.  In the plan, he listed everything that was written earlier and said that they would finish at 18:30.  And at that moment, the network was still not completed and the computers were not even unpacked.  Naturally, they again did not have time.  Only the network was finished by that time and they collected RAID on the server and started installing windows. <br><br>  When everything was completed with the network, we returned the tables to their normal position and offered to help them with the arrangement of computers.  Unpacking, arranging, assembling and connecting 10 computers took only 20-30 minutes.  I wonder how much they would do it. <br><br>  Next, the installation of windows7 began on all computers.  Here, too, was not a logical point.  To activate windows, they needed an Internet, naturally we gave them access.  But so far only on one computer, just throwing a long patchcord from our switch (there is an oval table in the center of the audience, under which our networkers have already made a network for a long time, since various meetings were held there).  When a Hindu did everything he needed with one computer, he switched to another and asked him to connect the same patchcord and configure the network in the same way.  At this point, we offered him an option - connect the patchcord directly to their switch and give all the necessary addresses to all computers, to which he objected and said no need so he will in turn switch the patchcord, dragging him along.  Our business was small - they did what he wanted, and this naturally still dragged out the time.  Since it was already at about 9:00 pm we directly told them that it would be enough for today, and you will do the rest tomorrow.  The Indians rummaged a bit more and went to the hotel.  That was the end of the first day. <br><br>  On the second day, they left the system setup and software installation, the video conference system setup, and promised to do it in two hours in the morning, as they wanted to leave for another city at 16.00.  But as always, they did not get out on time, and how much time it took, I already wrote above. <br>  I will not describe the jambs of the second day, as they were related more in the program part and corrected more easily, often with our hints. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  After these two days, I completely believed in the Indian code, since I saw the Indian network. <br>  Indians are ugly not punctual and can not properly assess the time.  Often distracted by the case. <br>  Not careful - we constantly went after them and collected everything scattered.  At the place where they litter, also do not look. <br><br>  Although just like people, they are quite courteous and polite, although we didn‚Äôt communicate with them in a normal (non-working) environment. <br><br>  I was disappointed with what I saw.  And it was also certified employees (although I didn‚Äôt specify who certified them what). <br><br>  PS By the way, having estimated their work plan for us (four software engineers), we would put the first day in 2-3 hours and the second - 2 hours, i.e.  would quietly have done in the evening, as it used to be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114251/</a></p>
