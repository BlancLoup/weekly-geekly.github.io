We exchange opinions and photos, communicate with friends more and more through social networks.  Someone has a Facebook account, someone has VKontakte, and only Odnoklassniki can recognize some of your friends.  At the same time, statuses in social networks can not always provide operational information about where the person you are interested in is at a given time.  And in order to clarify the location, it is necessary to use geolocation services.  As a result, a whole set of icons of various applications is created in your device, the presence of which provides you with the opportunity to communicate with those who are interested in you.  It's time to optimize your mobile space.  And help us in this new application Maptrix. <br>  Geolocation services are not new to the application market; nevertheless, Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe first application in which it was possible to combine the map and the ability to communicate not only with your friends, but also with those who are just interested in you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c41/826/e42/c41826e42a9639243344e4bdaf7544f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Speaking quite simply, Maptrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa mobile application that allows you to see your friends on a city map and chat with them.  You can log in to the application through the social network VKontakte.  Tying all the other networks in the application settings, you will get the opportunity to see all the friends from your friends social network feeds in one program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ed/102/67a/8ed10267aabc1901dd7a5649db427de1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is still a fairly large problem, as with all existing geolocation services, the determination of the exact location.  For a more accurate location, Maptrix developers recommend using GPS, however, android users understand that always-on GPS reduces battery power at the speed of light.  Nevertheless, the user has the opportunity to inform his friends about his location with an accuracy of one meter - having noted in the institution where he is at a given time. <br>  The function ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù opens up the possibility for the user to also chat in the chat room of the institution where he is located right now.  This is quite a convenient function - you can exchange opinions, information with people without even being familiar with them.  Discussing the movie in the cafeteria of the cinema, finding out about the reason for the traffic jams in the city center or the availability of a queue in the student cafeteria became easy thanks to Maptrix. <br><br><img src="http://s018.radikal.ru/i525/1302/27/003ca2b3f181.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ability to communicate with strangers facilitates the establishment of new contacts.  Despite the abundance of various dating services, you could not, sitting, for example, in a cafe, write a girl at the next table.  Now it has become possible.  Before you start communication, you can view information about a person, his name, photos.  And, before you approach a person, chat with him online.  With Maptrix, you can communicate with whoever you want and see where this person is at the moment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/831/66b/7be/83166b7be93f6dd197e88cc104537012.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the main doubts that may arise may be a reluctance to show your location on the map.  Especially for those who want to give out information about their location dosed, there are visibility settings.  Here you can independently adjust to whom you will be visible: to all Maptrix users, only to friends or not visible to anyone.  In addition, you can hide from a specific friend of your choice, which can be very popular among a number of users. <br><br>  In addition to the basic functionality, you are offered bonuses in the form of opportunities to receive badges for leaving marks in places and the opportunity to compete with friends in the number of points given for marks.  But this is a series of especially enthusiastic. <br>  In general, it is worth noting that the Maptrix service is one of the most successful combinations of geolocation service and social network capabilities. <br><br>  You can download the application from GP: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.maptrix">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maptrix</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170911/</a></p>
