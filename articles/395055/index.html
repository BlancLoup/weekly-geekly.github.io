  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ReGen Villages - the eco-settlement of the near future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Local high-yielding production of organic food.  Energetic houses.  Comprehensive and efficient use of renewable energy sources.  Recycling water and waste.  Empowerment and rights of local communities.  These five pillars are based on a new concept of eco-settlement or autonomous urban eco-communities, implemented as part of the project ReGen Villages (Netherlands). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/634/6c9/9d4/6346c99d4f28f3ec3bbf89fb56dfd24d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the forecasts of some optimistic experts, by 2050 the population of the Earth will reach 9 billion people.  Pessimists ignorantly ignore their opinion, upholding the figure of 10 billion. And they and others will certainly agree - the survival of so many people would be unthinkable without the creation of regenerative housing and the development of local communities.  No less relevant will be the issues of access to sources of clean drinking water, healthy food, arable land.  And, over the search for solutions to the complex of these and related problems, profile specialists in many countries of the world are already busy today.  One of such pilot projects is the ReGen Villages eco-settlement, the successful implementation of which will launch the realization of the proposed ideas in many parts of the world. <br><br>  Pilot town - the eco-settlement ReGen Villages in full swing is already under construction in Almere, located in the central part of the Netherlands.  Having its own complete cycle of food production and waste processing, the settlement will be at the same time completely independent of the central power grids.  By the middle of this summer, 100 passive houses will be able to accept tenants who have agreed to participate in the experiment with the prospect of further living.

This will improve the insulation of the house, reduce heating costs in the winter, and in addition, will create the opportunity for year-round cultivation of environmentally friendly fruits and vegetables on their own home land.  According to the construction plan, residential buildings in the settlement will be located along imaginary concentric circles with a single center.  In the free central part there will be greenhouses, parking lots and an electric vehicle charging station, a compact farm, a pond with fish, open gardens and recreation areas for citizens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/917/9bb/60d/9179bb60deae6a2e4cafd5a97919f9a1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Own greenhouse for hydroponic growing of vegetables</sub></i> <br><br>  The project is being implemented by <a href="http://www.regenvillages.com/">ReGen</a> in collaboration with <a href="http://www.effekt.dk/">EFFEKT Architects</a> .  The company does not hide that one of the cornerstones facing the project is the search for a balanced solution to the problem of nutrition, or rather the creation of a full cycle of local ‚Äúproduction‚Äù of food for people living in a modern high-tech settlement.  And in order to concentrate the means of production and consumption within one settlement, in this case there are all possibilities and grounds. <br><br>  As explained in the company, today the problem of territorial distance between the producer and the consumer is acute enough and is global in nature.  According to statistics, 42% of the planet‚Äôs land has already been used for farmland.  The need for their expansion entails a reduction in forest areas, as a result - shallowing of water bodies and disruptions in the work of the entire ecosystem.  At the same time, producers and consumers of the product are often located so far that in order for the vegetable to be on a plate, it has to travel up to 2500 km and more.  And, despite the measures taken, about a third of the production is turned into waste, despite the fact that every seventh person on the planet is starving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de8/b18/cbe/de8b18cbe2822a60d4bdaa067ef0a17a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/f02/995/a1af0299513e526c04986f69481789a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Growing agricultural products in ReGen Villages, in accordance with ReGen plans, will be convenient based on hydroponics: instead of planting plants in the open ground and the usual watering, they can be placed in special containers, where the root system in the right, automatically controlled mode will constantly feed on water, enriched with nutrients.  This principle of cultivation will allow planting various crops on multi-tiered racks in the form of vertical trusses, which will reduce the amount of useful space allocated for solving the ‚Äúfood issue‚Äù 50 times.  The amount of water expended to achieve similar results can be reduced by 90%, increasing the growth rate at least several times.  In this case, there is no need to talk about transport costs at all, since it will be possible to cover the distance to the center of the eco-town, where the greenhouse will be located in a few minutes, and on foot or by car - this is not important here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/408/632/83c/40863283c61c84f5a227e559f9a8647b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9dd/2c2/946/9dd2c2946685859117a61a2b21d0f474.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ReGen has calculated how much land it will take to provide a family of two adults and one child for a year or more.  For this purpose, the ReGen Villages model is allocated 639 m¬≤, while traditional farms will have to provide for 8100 m¬≤ for similar needs.  In these square meters, in this case, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãhousing, garden, vegetable garden, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãagricultural land for animals, which will be used as food for people during the year, and even the area reserved for water storage tanks was taken into account. <br><br>  In ReGen Villages the useful area will be distributed as follows: House - 120 m¬≤, house complex with hydroponics - 300 m¬≤, greenhouses - 40 m¬≤, traditional seasonal garden - 100 m¬≤, farm - 25 m¬≤, solar panels - 34 m¬≤, fresh water storage - 20 m¬≤ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3a/98c/4d9/b3a98c4d9964ae9214f79be51dbdda38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having carried out a settlement for a settlement calculated for 75-100 inhabitants (taking into account the average balance of family and single residents), the company received that this figure, on average, will be 15,450 m¬≤.  In this case, it will be necessary to add a house for the community, public areas (park complexes, playgrounds, benches, tables, etc.), public infrastructure facilities, space reserved for charging electric vehicles to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãprivate farms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a15/f94/d50/a15f94d50854c814dd65423c67bff126.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very soon, the ReGen Villages project will reveal its full potential, and if successfully passing the test period, it is possible, taking into account local realities and scales, it will be taken as a basis in other countries, including Northern Europe and the Middle East. <br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
