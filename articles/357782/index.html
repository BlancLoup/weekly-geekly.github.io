These reptiles install Trojan software like RAT (remote access tool) on computers of young girls solely for the purpose of voyeurism to view the picture from the webcam without the knowledge of the victim. <br><br>  In their forums, the rats share the most interesting videos with the sexiest victims, preferably in the nude.  Something spread on YouTube. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Infected PCs owned by girls are sold on the black market for $ 1, men for $ 0.01.

      Representatives of the Digital Citizens Alliance say they have discovered thousands of videos on YouTube taken by other people's webcams without the knowledge of the owner.  The total number of views of such videos is in the millions. <br><br>  RAT's make a profit from their illegal and immoral actions, through advertising videos and affiliate programs from YouTube, as well as by selling a subscription to paid channels with exclusive content.  According to DCA, some RAT operators track dozens of young girls at the same time and earn thousands of dollars a month. <br><br>  Some hackers even resort to blackmail if they find a worthy victim.  For example, in August 2013, 19-year-old California resident Jared Abrahams hacked into the laptop of the winner of the beauty contest Miss Teen USA.  The hacker demanded that the girl fulfill his requirements, blackmailing her with the publication of nude photos that he took through a webcam.  The injured Cassidy Wolf did not suspect that she was being shot.  The webcam's LED never lights up, she says.  The girl found out about RAT'er when he contacted her directly through an infected laptop.  He instructed the 18-year-old beauty to launch a video chat with him on Skype for five minutes, where he will tell you what to do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1b/85c/ba1/c1b85cba1a764676afc78856f9af7e0b.jpg"><br>  <i>Miss Kessidy Wolf (left)</i> <br><br>  As it turned out, Jared Abrahams had been cracking the computers of pretty girls for several months, forcing them to undress in front of the camera and do other things.  Among the victims were girls from the USA, Canada, Ireland, Moldova and Russia.  The investigation showed that 100-150 computers were under the control of the hacker. <br><br>  The winner of the beauty contest appeared on television and told her story everywhere, warning other girls about the danger, so the capture of Abrahams became a matter of honor for the FBI, and in September 2013 <a href="http://www.kesq.com/news/alleged-hacker-accused-of-threatening-women-girls/22139356">Abrahams was arrested</a> . <br><br>  Adam Benson, DCA‚Äôs deputy director, considers the presence of such videos on YouTube to be a ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù phenomenon and appealed to Google, which owns the YouTube service, to use automatic filtering technology to censor. <br><br>  In addition, a large group of moderators are working on YouTube who identify other inappropriate materials, but the work of RAT's is not in their focus.  It is advisable to fix it.  "Human" censorship will be more effective than automatic. <br><br>  On YouTube, the rules are ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/yt/policyandsafety/communityguidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a> ‚Äù listing inappropriate content that is removed if there are user complaints.  For some reason, video from other webcams is not included in this list. <br><br>  DCA representatives said they sent the results of their research to the YouTube administration, but have not yet received a response. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357782/</a></p>
