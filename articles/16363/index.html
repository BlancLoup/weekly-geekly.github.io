  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Self-spinning blogs. Experience and recommendations from practice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have such a thing.  For several months I have been building a house and implicitly collecting material - well, I take pictures, write down stories with my irresponsible builders.  It‚Äôs almost like TNT in Nasha Rusha show about Ravshan and Jumshut :) <br><br>  And the other day I was going to open a blog in which I would describe all my ordeals, so that people would know about all the pitfalls of this ‚Äúperishing‚Äù self-built business and would not step on my rake.  :) I began to look for a platform - where it is better to open a blog, and in the process I came across an interesting fresh material with a meaning like this: HOW TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL BLOG DEFAULT.  That is, that he was "self-developing."  In order not to have to unwind it later, as a "timber saw in the desert". <br><br>  I really liked the article, so I decided to share it.  So everything is logical and simple!  And how do you agree with the theses?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... Such a system allows you to create successful initiatives in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness.  If you simplify and apply the system to blogs, then it will look like this: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>First</strong> , think about what moves you in reading other blogs? <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>Then answer</strong> your questions! <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>Draw conclusions</strong> by assessing how many people <strong>act like you?</strong> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>And open a blog</strong> that ‚Äúby default‚Äù will be interesting to the Reader.  It's simple.  :) <br><br>  1. Open questions to ask yourself: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Why do I spend a lot of time searching for information?  (not ‚Äúwhat interests me‚Äù, but what interests me so much that it takes my time, money and nerves) <br>  ‚Ä¢ What exactly am I looking for?  Does IT exist in nature?  (do not tear yourself away from reality) <br>  ‚Ä¢ And what do I expect to find?  What is the perfect find for me?  (you need to evaluate the "boundaries of your mind", that is, to understand the height of your own request. <br>  ‚Ä¢ What do I feel and do when I find interesting material?  (what exactly, right in the details should be described!) <br><br>  <strong>2. Answers that must be given.</strong>  <strong>This is how the author answered *:</strong> <br>  ‚Ä¢ I need information that will help me earn more and more in marketing activities. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I'm specifically looking for ways to control the mind of the consumer.  Such methods exist. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I want to find the ‚Äúsecret formula‚Äù and its 100% effective model. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I am embraced by euphoria, and I share with friends new knowledge and discoveries. <br><br>  <strong>3. Well, here are the author's * conclusions:</strong> <br>  ‚Ä¢ People need to be given useful and unusual information written in the reader‚Äôs language, which is difficult to find in a systematic way at one time and in one place.  An example is Davydov‚Äôs blogs ** against the sites Admy *** and marketing.spb.ru ****.  Important language and form of information. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ This information must be realistic or, in some cases, completely unreal.  This year, the consciousness of millions of users of the Runet instantly conquered the financial striptease of web bombs in the form of an Internet reality show.  And what else are people interested in besides money?  I remember reading the ‚ÄúDiary of a Prostitute‚Äù on liveinternet.ru, it was a very popular diary.  :) At the same time, interest in mysticism, esoterica and everything inexplicable will never disappear. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ People want to see examples of use.  The blog "Marketing for which you pay for" describes only real marketing that takes place in our time and is indicated by real numbers.  Only facts and figures are a characteristic feature of a blog, which has become ‚Äúits own‚Äù for many Readers. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Need to help the reader share information with more of his friends.  Obviously, the desire to share information with others is ‚Äúviral in nature‚Äù, especially against the background of the positive state of the recipient.  And if I had been promoting my blog, I would have already set up social bookmarking widgets and a form for sending material to blogs, as well as friends via e-mail. <br><br>  Perhaps this is all that should be considered and done before opening a blog or any other resource or business, so as not to try and then unwind the "timber sawmill in the desert" ... <br><br>  - Well, how are you?  :) <br>  Here are links to the mentioned resources, if anyone is interested: <br>  - * Blog <a href="http://tavly.blogspot.com/">‚ÄúMarketing for which they pay‚Äù</a> <br>  ** D.
