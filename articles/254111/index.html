There is also a reading head, which seems to ‚Äúfloat‚Äù over this disk when it rotates.  The head is set in motion by the combination of an electromagnet and a permanent magnet, by the way, as a rule, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">neodymium magnets</a> , which are very powerful for their size, stand in hard disks.  There is also a ‚Äúlimiter‚Äù of the stroke of the head (the yellow thing behind the magnet) so that it does not go beyond the edge of the working area, so, it will not allow us to remove the disk from the engine, so it needs to either be unscrewed or broken there is another way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a64/0f0/4a5/a640f04a54584196867bc642d97df6f5.JPG"><br><br>  Inside this plastic, the same neodymium magnet is used as the mechanism for parking the head at the initial position, only a small one, the size of a match head, I believe that these are just perfect for projects on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">reed switches</a> or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Hall sensors</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/d28/25a/cf7d2825a1134486acbe275719f89e27.JPG"><br><br>  Unscrew the screws that hold the disc, move the head to the side and remove the "pancake". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/f9c/7ea/897f9c7ea9c34274b0bfaa4ca458f969.JPG"><br><br>  Since the engine must rotate at high frequency and for a long time, it has a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">hydrodynamic bearing</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/517/e39/1d1/517e391d1816420792b2884027bea642.JPG"><br><br>  Here is the reading head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/328/f9e/141/328f9e14131f4a77938d40b8b730200c.JPG"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">By the principle of its work</a> is similar to the principle of the head in a cassette or reel player. <br><br>  Well, we are finishing the reverse engineering of ‚ÄúHard‚Äù, now we need to find the coil contacts on the connector that connects the HDD of the hard drive and the board with the electronics, and now the device that can measure the resistance will not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/8b0/b2b/14f8b0b2b80e4994aff9bfddf634194b.JPG"><br><br>  The coil resistance should be in the range <b>from 4 to 40 ohms</b> , in my case about 11. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/372/83c/6d537283c05e4eb6badc1312f3a75806.JPG"><br><br>  As practice shows, the coil contacts are opposite each other, in my case right above, but with the previous alteration of the old 20 GB hard drive, the coil was left below, so if I have this, then you can have another I have included a multimeter in the list of what is needed.  Next thing technology: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/d4a/3e0/c16d4a3e01aa4872938a1852aad33e63.JPG"><br><br>  And now we need a battery in order to make sure that the wiring is soldered to the right place, take the battery and connect one wire of the coil to the plus of the other to the minus and the head should move to the side, then change the polarity and the coil should move to another time Everything is as I described then everything was done correctly (see the first video at <a href="https://youtu.be/ZM9qD7Cg-HQ%3Ft%3D796">13:16</a> ), if not - most likely, they were not soldered to the coil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/a83/400/31fa83400da6422c9be376bf9a2dc4ab.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A few words about how a normal speaker works</b> - there is a magnet that has a south (denoted by the letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù in the figure above) and a north pole (indicated by the letter ‚ÄúN‚Äù) and there is an electromagnet that also has poles, only unlike the source polarity power supply they can change places, besides changing the current that flows through the coil, we change the power of the electromagnetic field. <br>  Magnets have one interesting property, either attracted or repelled when they interact with each other.  If the pole of one magnet, for example, is south, and the other - north, they will be attracted, if the poles of two magnets coincide - they will repel, if you want to know more about this, then visit the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">magnetism</a> . <br>  By the same principle, an ordinary speaker works in our speakers, as if ‚Äúpushing‚Äù the air, creating sound. <br>  We know that the more a speaker in a subwoofer the more powerful the sound, isn't it?  In order to enhance the sound, there is still a diffuser in the speaker design, which is designed to ‚Äúpush‚Äù as much air as possible, creating as much as possible and, accordingly, louder sound.  Another speaker consists of a lot of things, but in the context of this article I‚Äôll probably finish, so as not to delay this so long article, here is a page in Wikipedia where you can read an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">electrodynamic speaker</a> in more detail about how the speaker is, which we have in the columns. <br><br>  Now, in principle, you can send a signal from the amplifier to the head, but it will sound very quiet, to avoid this, we need to make a simple amplifier, in my case, from A4 sheet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f45/7b3/678/f457b36786ef48f98c7f4ebbfc546347.JPG"><br><br>  So this is a cone, the larger the radius of its base, the louder our ‚Äúspeaker‚Äù will sound.  In order to keep everything I glued together with scotch tape, you can use glue instead of tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9a/93a/63a/a9a93a63af914d7f910b1c9a5a4524c1.JPG"><br><br>  Then we press the top of the cone with a "crocodile" as close as possible to the reading head.  Personally, I did not think of anything better, if you have any ideas - write in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fac/2ab/5e0/fac2ab5e00f7409eb6b738d23535ea22.JPG"><br><br>  Then we need to make here such a holder of clay / gum for the cone, just need to first wait until the clay or gum hardens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/942/e9d/971942e9d6c5473789b14cbe861938ff.JPG"><br><br>  Its function is not only to hold a cone, so that it does not go around, but also it will add some low frequencies, no matter how wild it sounds. <br><br>  Now you can already send a signal from the amplifier to the head and about a miracle, it plays, the sound quality is certainly not the same as that of the Hi-Fi system, but not much different from the sound of inexpensive Chinese speakers. <br>  But this is not all, sometimes it happens that the mechanism for parking the head to its initial position is a little different in my case, it happens that it is not removable or difficult to remove, and it is designed so that the head sticks to it, and then it turns out generally disgusting sound. <br>  I decided for myself it is very simple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e8/8bc/bbe/3e88bcbbe510483c8e8dcc6fc54fd2e8.JPG"><br><br>  Just made such a kind of "side", which does not allow the head to stick to the initial position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d95/d33/4e8/d95d334e81db498385c6159a61732c2f.JPG"><br><br>  By the way, I have a stereo amplifier, 2x3W D-class based on PAM8403, the size of a coin, at the moment it is one of the cheapest D-class stereo amplifiers, a great thing for your money. <br><br>  And here is my homemade stereo system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a4/756/e4f/5a4756e4f1fe43e59df994dadaf83ede.JPG"><br><br>  Sound test near the end of the second part of the video. <br><br>  A couple of words on the topic ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the point?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIsn't it easier to go to the store and buy something normal?‚Äù And so on - I don‚Äôt see much point in this, just a way to keep myself busy, if you have everything you need at hand, but there is nothing to do, <s>for the sake of lulz</s> for fun. <br><br>  References: <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/251941/">If Seagate was dusty ...</a> ; <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/hwman/topics/">All my publications</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254111/</a></p>
