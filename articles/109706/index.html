      In 2000, in Croatia, as well as in Russia, there was the problem of using all the possibilities of popular online stores.  What to conceal, the situation has not changed much since then.  Problems with delivery, customs and payment sometimes negate the main advantages of foreign shops - the uniqueness and price. <br><br>  At that time, the demand for this was enormous, and in Russia, the smart guys created <a href="http://molotok.ru/">molotok.ru</a> , thus occupying a promising empty niche, and the idea of <a href="http://njuskalo.hr/">Njuskalo</a> was born in Croatia. <br>  In the struggle for the consistency of the created project, the guys from Eastern Europe had to solve a difficult task: how to convince people to buy things online, and not in regular stores?  Low price?  - Yes, but this is not enough to overcome the main fears of customers - not to be deceived. <br><br>  Having improved the engine and design, the company working on the site began to conduct an active advertising campaign.  It was decided to focus on Google AdWords and SEO optimization.  They promoted the products sold on <b>Njuskalo by</b> buying keywords in AdWords, thereby providing a decent amount of targeted traffic. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="click tracking"><br><br>  At first it looked like a regular website with ads like <a href="http://irr.ru/">irr.ru</a> or <a href="http://avito.ru/">avito.ru</a> .  People posted information about the product and left the coordinates for feedback, the buyer had to contact the seller personally and resolve all issues outside the service.  But the question of monetization remained open, and programmers attempted to create their own payment system within the service, which would allow them to make money by selling places for ads.  Their hopes were not justified, people did not trust their finances to unfamiliar services.  It was decided to conclude a contract with a popular brand that would not cause suspicion to anyone.  The choice fell on T-com, which at that time enjoyed enormous prestige.  They provided an online payment system, moreover, the card was authorized not on the Internet, but on their own isolated network.  And it worked, people started to believe the service. <br><br>  Company <a href="http://www.escapestudio.net/">Escape Studio</a> , engaged in the promotion of <b>Njuskalo</b> , continued aggressive Adwords-company. <br><br>  In addition, they began a massive promotion of the slogan: ‚Äú <i>Njuskalo is the most effective aggregator of goods,</i> ‚Äù aimed at online shopping.  The advertising campaign worked and very soon a whole line of stores lined up, ready to pay for placing their goods on the site. <br><br>  Now <a href="http://njuskalo.hr/">Njuskalo</a> is the 6th most visited website in Croatia with a well-established monetization process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f0/860/546/5f086054634120e596fdf25ef1f9c7f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They place ads of stores not only on their website, but also in print media.  For convenience, an interesting ‚Äútrick‚Äù was created - a unique identifier in front of each ad, which you can enter in the ‚Äúquick search‚Äù line and get full information about the product online.  In addition to huge profits for ads, <b>Njuskalo</b> earns through cooperation with various stores and, of course, do not forget about selling banners. <br><br>  The creators failed to replace <a href="http://ebay.com/">ebay</a> or <a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.com</a> in their own country, but it‚Äôs safe to say that they definitely occupied their niche in the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109706/</a></p>
