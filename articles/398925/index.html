But when you have only a hammer in your hands, any problem looks like a nail.  Will we be able to understand the subtleties of the question a little better, or at least slightly shift the angle of perception? <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/4e4/667/8284e46673d84c60b37eb37706e9e892.png" alt="image" align="left"></a> <br><br clear="left">  <i>The X axis is the days since the launch, the Y axis is the price multiplier;</i> <br><br>  Crypto-blogger Willy Wu recently published a <a href="http://woobull.com/data-visualisation-118-coins-plotted-over-time-this-is-why-hodl-alt-coin-indexes-dont-work/">post</a> with a good analysis of 118 different Altcoins (Altcoin is ‚Äúan alternative to Bitcoin,‚Äù any cryptocurrency except Bitcoin) that managed to reach a market capitalization of $ 250,000 or more and compared their growth charts with a Bitcoin growth chart.  The graph on a logarithmic scale shows the change in the value of each cryptocurrency since the start of trading.  Bitcoin first went public on the market in July 2010 on the MtGox exchange (a bright memory to her).  After 1300 days from the start, he was trading at a price 10,000 times higher than the original price.  The bubble burst along with MtGox itself, and only now Bitcoin is approaching the same level again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of all the 188 altcoins, only one currency is located on the graph above Bitcoin - <a href="http://www.gamecredits.com/">gamecredits</a> .  The project, launched three years ago and intended to simplify the input of money into virtual economies and withdrawal.  GAME is actually an appcoin, or <a href="https://medium.com/%40cassiuscrypto/were-entering-an-age-of-cat-money-and-i-love-it-c61e8a712f37">CAT</a> (Later we will write a large detailed article about CATs).  The author considers this funny fact to be nothing more than an accident: ‚ÄúAll my friends ask: is the strip over bitcoin, is it Ethereum?  Sorry, no, this is GAME, I don‚Äôt know how it happened, most likely this is a statistical deviation - someone just got lucky.  If you tilt your head to the side and look at the graph, it will all look like a rocket jet, so let's write everything down on the laws of thermodynamics. ‚Äù <br><br>  All other cryptocurrencies do not reach Bitcoin, and the longer the currency lives, the greater the gap becomes.  What does analysis tell us about the long-term development of altcoins, especially about projects like <a href="http://www.wavesplatform.com/">Waves</a> , to which I have a particular interest.

    <h3>  The secret of success" </h3><br>  First of all, it is worth recalling the maxim often used in the financial world: "Indicators in the past do not say anything about indicators in the future."  The fact that no one has surpassed bitcoin does not mean that this will never happen.  It only means that so far this has not happened.  However, this is unlikely to convince the holders of altcoins, who are looking at the chart and wondering what will happen to their cryptocurrency portfolio in the next few months and years. <br><br>  Fortunately, all is not easy.  As you wish, just not easy. <br><br>  <b>The graph uses only one metric to compare 118 altcoins, which are completely incomparable in nature.</b>  Interestingly, the author puts Ethereum on a par with gamecredit, given that these two projects are ideal for illustrating differences.  And what factors are we talking about: <br><br>  <b>Completely different initial situations.</b>  Bitcoin in 2009 appeared in a completely empty niche, where before him there was nothing like that.  For subsequent cryptocurrency bitcoin has become a model and a kind of reference for investors.  This allowed them to make more operational and informed decisions. <br><br>  <b>Different trade cultures.</b>  Bitcoin went up for auction in July 2010, approximately 18 months after Satoshi launched the protocol.  At the early stage, bitcoin was almost never bought or sold.  The determination of the price has already occurred within the framework of over-the-counter transactions, including payment for several pizzas, which would now be valued at several million dollars.  The first bubble - the first burst of real speculative interest - appeared in April 2011, two months after the launch of Silk Road.  For comparison, for all other alternative cryptocurrencies, the first (and often the only) bubble appears on the launch day, when they are used for the purpose of ‚Äúpumping and dumping‚Äù with manipulators holding a significant part of their stocks.  In other words, here we are dealing with a very different distribution of growth. <br><br>  <b>Bitcoin is traded in Fiat currencies, mainly in USD and CNY, while Alt-Coins are most often traded in Bitcoins.</b>  This sets fundamentally different schemes, because everything that affects bitcoins affects altcoins.  The growth of bitcoin in the market leads to the sale of alternative cryptocurrency, and in the fall of bitcoin, alt-coins often take up positions.  But other things being equal, a change in the Bitcoin rate is reflected in the value of the Altcoins, which are traded in the BTC.  Therefore, ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù can be measured by two different criteria for BTC and altcoins, however, the graph uses only one criterion. <br><br>  And a few more points: <br><br>  <b>The exchange rate on the first day sets the overall potential for further growth.</b>  If the currency starts at the price of 1 satoshi, it has only one development option.  For her to achieve growth of 10,000 times is much easier than for the same Zcash, which started with a course higher than 1 BTC.  Then, on this chart, cryptocurrencies would not start from one position, they would have a spread of several orders of magnitude.  An illustrative example - gamecredits has shown growth of more than 5,000 times, but in terms of market capitalization, it is still three orders of magnitude behind Bitcoin. <br><br>  <b>Produced currencies and entering the market at ICO (with a starting offer) are not the same thing.</b>  It depends on how cryptocurrencies begin their life cycle.  Take, for example, Waves, which received $ 16 million in funding from the ICO.  At the start of trading, the currency was trading around its market capitalization.  Most of the crowdfunding altcoins start in a similar way or with a certain multiplication factor.  The main point is that you have at least a rough idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reasonable starting price of the currency.  This money provided the Waves a great start.  The project did not have to worry about finding money for marketing and development.  On the other hand, this implies a certain limitation in growth prospects.  Bitcoin has managed to increase its value tens of thousands of times since its launch on Gox.  In the same scenario, the Waves would have cost $ 160 billion today, ahead of Bitcoin by an order of magnitude.  This is more than the capitalization of IBM and close to New Zealand's GDP.  The extracted currencies, in turn, such as bitcoin and gamecredits, do not have any objective indicators of the price at the time of the start of trading. <br><br>  <b>Completely different ways to attract interest.</b>  Bitcoin had Silk Road, and then a few more applications, including other black markets.  Some altcoins have quite clearly defined application plans, including real-world clients.  Other Alt-Coins offer nothing but empty promises.  It is hardly worth explaining who is doing better. <br><br>  In other words, dumping all altcoins into one basket, and then measuring them with a single measure, does not make much sense.  This is good for a general review.  And this demonstrates that, all other things being equal, it is not easy to beat bitcoin.  But this graph cannot be used as a real tool for forecasting future growth.  Imagine that you bought Apple shares at the very beginning, in the 70s, and then compared them with a random set of stocks that you purchased shortly before 2000, and you will understand what the problem is.  Ethereum is an admittedly successful project in terms of the trading course.  He collected 31,000 BTC, or about $ 15 million in 2014, and showed 100-fold growth in just one year.  Now it is trading at around 50 times the price from ICO.  Impressive, but it is unlikely in the near future it will grow by an order of magnitude. <br><br><h3>  Growth potential </h3><br>  To sum up, look at the similarities and differences between GAME, which surpassed bitcoin, and Waves. <br><br>  If you look back over the list of criteria that we gave, GAME will be incredibly similar to bitcoin.  It is also a mined currency (Litecoin clone) that you need to mine.  GAME began its zero-financing journey and grew slowly, unlike cryptocurrencies, which collected funding and were launched through the ICO.  The debut was fairly quiet.  Without funds received through ICO, for quite a long time the cryptocurrency was trading in small volumes and at a low price, which again is very similar to the history of Bitcoin.  What is curious, despite the fact that the cryptocurrency is now being traded at BTC, there was a moment in its history when a fairly large amount was traded in fiat currencies, like bitcoin.  With a market capitalization of about $ 10 million, gamecredit had about the same value as bitcoin at the same time, on the graph in the April 2011 area.  Given that a <a href="http://gamecredits.com/2016/11/01/announcing-our-pilot-game-for-the-gamecredits-inc-payment-solution/">working usage scenario is being prepared</a> for this cryptocurrency (integration by a large gaming company, and not the fate of the main currency of the world's first online black market), GAME is potentially ready for development in the mainstream bitcoin market. <br><br>  At the same time, the Waves project did not reach GAME growth rates 5,000 times (due to the fact that the history of Waves has only a few months so far and the market capitalization figure of 80 billion dollars would be really impressive), but it has reached comparable market capitalization , which means all other things being equal (which, of course, will not be such) has a close growth potential.  This cryptocurrency also has serious prospects for use in the mainstream due to different application options, including Incent, ChronoBank, etc. Both currencies have evolved very differently, but currently they are generally in a similar position in terms of market capitalization and attracting attention. <br><br>  One of the conclusions that we can make when comparing GAME and WAVES is as follows: the option when cryptocurrency is traded directly in fiat currency is not only highly desirable, but also necessary for long-term growth, as this opens up access to a larger pool of liquidity, and at the same time, it solves the problem associated with the bitcoin volatility.  Here, discussions about the exchange of altcoins come onto the scene: without an exchange for fiat currency, the possibilities for cryptocurrency growth are limited. <br><br>  What conclusion can we draw from all this?  We are at a rather interesting stage in the development of cryptocurrency history.  The first options for large-scale use of cryptocurrency will be implemented very soon.  Time cannot be reversed, and today it is no longer possible to invest in Bitcoin under the same conditions and with the same prospects as in 2011.  But if you need a similar alternative in terms of quality and quality, there are definitely options. <br><br>  Wu summarizes the above as follows: ‚ÄúApparently, the Alt-Coin is the best of the remaining options for trading because of its volatility, but very risky as an option for investing.  The situation may change in the coming years, but today, out of more than 700 cryptocurrencies in my database, no more than 5 are trying to do something interesting.  This all reminds me of the initial stage of investing in startups. ‚Äù <br><br>  And, perhaps, he is right.  The catch is to correctly pick up your top five. <br><br> <a href="http://www.wavesplatform.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e7/48c/593/2e748c59324447e6b1dc02f60019d20e.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398925/</a></p>
