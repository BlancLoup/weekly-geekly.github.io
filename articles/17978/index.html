The list topped the social resource <a href="http://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade.com</a> .  It was launched only in September. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>How much is virtual lemonade?</strong> <br><br>  Service is simple, "like a boot".  The registered user creates their own counter (so in this case it is best to translate the word stand) ‚Äîone or several.  Then, from the proposed list, the items that attracted him / her are selected, which are placed on the counter.  You can provide a selected item with a comment.  Using the widget (widget), the product can additionally be placed in a blog or profile "retailer".  You can also tell about your counters and products placed on them to your virtual friends.

      And where is the money, you ask?  And almost the same, where one habragrazhdanin named <a href="http://slava7.habrahabr.ru/">slava7</a> <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D47076">offered</a> to find them (something similar was in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/27495.html">Habr√©</a> ).  Even when nobody heard about Lemonade.  This is how the monetization in Limonade happens.  Two types of income are generated. <br><br>  The first is ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù.  Depending on the value of the goods, the ‚Äúmerchant‚Äù receives from the ‚Äúwholesaler‚Äù a commission in the amount of 5 to 10% of this value if someone ‚Äúbuys‚Äù it, i.e., exposes this product already on its counter.  Among the wholesalers are well-known companies such as Apple, Wal-Mart, Land's End and others. <br><br>  The second type of income is more traditional for the advertising business: something like ‚Äúpay per click‚Äù for a product displayed on the counter of a ‚Äúretailer‚Äù.  The "wholesaler" pays again. <br><br>  All revenue is divided between the user and the site in relation to 80:20.  Payments are made through PayPal, the appeal to which is ‚Äúembedded‚Äù in the site.  Really, really, everything is very simple? <br><br>  It is easy to guess who the main user of this social and commercial resource is.  Virtual ‚Äúlemonade‚Äù is sold by peers of those who make their <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D67097">small business</a> trading real lemonade.  Well, now ‚Äì‚Äì to the cause ... <br>  <strong>Agents of influence</strong> <br><br>  Lemonade finally got on its feet after the Facebook app of the same name was created (attention: in order to get to the Facebook apps, you may be asked to register on the main site!).  In just one month, the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù partner gave more than 30% of all users of the new e-commerce resource.  And the main increase in users continues to go from here. <br><br>  And the fact that the border is still very far away, these figures say: if about 300,000 Facebook users use the Lemonade application today, then for more ‚Äúold‚Äù applications such as Books iRead and Where I've Been) - these figures are already made up, respectively, 700 thousand and more than 1.5 million. By the way, upon reaching the milestone, approximately 1 million users of the application Where I've Been was sold for $ 3 million to the travel company TripAdvisor. <br><br>  I want to draw your attention to the fact that the Lemonade application, like the other two applications mentioned above, essentially plays the role of agents of influence in a mass resource, which in Open Social terminology is called a container. <br><br>  Due to the fact that both the FaceBook and the Open Social end-front part of the application runs on the customer‚Äôs server, it‚Äôs not too difficult for him to reduce the entire development of the application to the creation of a new client part.  It then, in fact, serves as an agent of an autonomous social resource of the customer.  At the same time, the database and registration of users is unified both in the resource itself and in its agent.  The reader can easily be convinced of what has been said if he works simultaneously with Lemonade.com and his Facebook app. <br><br>  One can only speculate on how much time the same Limonade, Books iRead (Ugenia), and Where I've Been would take to promote their social resources, if they did not use the services of influence agents.  After all, according to Gardner, the main problem facing ‚Äúsocial‚Äù startups today is the unwillingness of users to leave already existing networks, such as Facebook and MySpace. <br><br>  <strong>Once again, questions about the specificity of start-up business and not only Russian.</strong> <br><br>  Risking again to incur the wrath of the apologists for the specificity of the Russian market (see my discussion with them <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/32805.html">here</a> ), I still can not refrain from a few more digits.  Starting from the launch of its site (September of this year) by the beginning of December, Lemonade received an additional investment of $ 3 million from 50 venture angel angels. round.  Interestingly, and what investment would Limonad.ru hope for? <br><br>  And now to a completely <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/31888.html">different discussion</a> : would the founders of this startup get any investments at all if they were not known managers in their circles?  And what business plan would help them?  But here we are talking not only about the Russian business ... <br><br>  <em>I plan to devote the next article of the cycle to boring, but, I think, the necessary issues of classifying social platforms.</em>  <em>ATTENTION: this classification note will be available only to members of the collective blog ‚ÄúIntelligent Social Web‚Äù (already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/33586.html">published</a> !).</em> <em><br></em> <br>  <em>I remind you that the full text of the note (with all the necessary explanations and links) that you have just reviewed is in my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D67097">blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17978/</a></p>
