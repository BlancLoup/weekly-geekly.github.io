  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Gwent: 8 tips for novice players in Gwint</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the closed beta testing of the Gwint collectible card game began, thousands of players immediately rushed into battle.  Over time, their number only increased, the game changed, the ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù of the project increasingly understood its mechanics, which allowed them to gain a certain advantage over the new arrivals. <br><br>  Therefore, I decided to prepare a short list of tips for players who have recently entered the battle, or who are just preparing to do this, since open beta testing of Gwint (and there is release) is not far off.  Some of the tips are fairly obvious, and in principle applicable to all CCs, the other part, so to speak, of the Gwent Specific.  I hope they all help you improve your game. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/288290/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/785/fa1/247/785fa124713e4bce9a9c09385e5f2fbe.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  1) Our cards are all </h3><br>  ‚ÄúGuint‚Äù is strikingly different from the classic collectible card games, because it lacks one of the main components - mana.  Therefore, the only and key player resource remains cards.  People who use it thoughtlessly very quickly find that they have been thrown to the mercy of His Majesty Topdek.  This does not lead to anything good. <br><br>  Card advantage is perhaps the most important concept for card games.  Then we will often return to this point, because in the overwhelming majority of cases, the one who ran out of cards first loses the fight - the one who walks last has the opportunity to apply the control effect (weather, <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50033-dimeritium-bomb">two-dimensional bomb</a> , <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/2-scorch">execution</a> ), depriving the opponent of the chance of recovery.  It should be remembered that card advantage manifests itself in a variety of forms, and in any CCM there are several ways to acquire it. <br><br>  The first and most obvious one is drawing out cards from a deck, when playing one card, you immediately get the opportunity to draw another one.  Examples of such cards are <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50056-prince-stennis">Prince Stennis</a> and <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/515-avallach">Avallakh</a> .  Playing them, you actually just pass the move to the enemy, without changing the number of cards in your hand.  Adding resistant units to the board that remain on the field at the end of the round can also be considered an advantage, since the enemy will have to spend the card from his hand to match points. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/524/6dc/b1e/5246dcb1e080443aada65f916b7eeab0.gif"></div><br>  This brings us to another way of gaining card advantage - the so-called Power Plays, where a small number of cards have a serious impact on the board, with which it will be difficult for the opponent to compete.  In the current mete, the ability to quickly record a round into one‚Äôs asset is provided by <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50202-yennefer-the-conjurer">Jennifer: The Exorcist</a> - very often players simply pass the round, not wanting to compete with her damage. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/466/7a1/22d/4667a122d5d443619160fd357b29bcce.gif"></div><br><h3>  2) Do not pass the first round without a fight </h3><br>  Remember that you do not have to win all the rounds - it‚Äôs enough to ‚Äútake‚Äù two of the three.  However, I recommend trying to win the first round - in this case, you get the opportunity to control the further course of the game.  In the second round, the enemy in most cases will have to wait while you pass, otherwise he risks losing the game, and you will be able to acquire or strengthen your card advantage. <br><br>  At the same time, evaluate how appropriate the pursuit of victory will be.  If you invest too many resources to take the first round from the opponent, you risk not regaining the card advantage in subsequent rounds and losing the match. <br><br><h3>  3) Time is money </h3><br>  In Gwint, the punishment for not meeting the time frame is very severe - you discard a random card from your hand.  Most of the time of the game is spent on mathematical calculations.  When a lot of detachments with different levels of force are gathered on the table, sometimes it is difficult to count the final "power indicators".  Therefore, it is good if you think about your actions right during the opponent's turn: even a simple count of the number of units will significantly reduce the time you need to think.  It would also be nice to have a notebook with a pen in hand, in which important notes are made, for example, to record the number of players in the opponent's deck and their strength. <br><br><h3>  4) Distribute buffs competently </h3><br>  Do not put all the buffs in one squad.  Distribute buffs evenly, while ‚Äúnot leveling‚Äù the power of the most valuable creatures on the table, so as not to lose all the advantage, if your opponent finds a simple answer (for example, <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/2-scorch">penalty</a> ).  For the same reason, it sometimes makes sense to do damage to your own units.  In the image below, all the <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50140-clan-tuirseach-axeman">Axes of the Tirshi clan</a> have different power values, therefore <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/501-geralt-igni">Geralt: Igni</a> would not be destructive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/866/b2c/9e7/866b2c9e78804180a0d28a8bd04bca58.jpg"><br><br>  More buffs can be used to interfere with the far-reaching plans of the enemy and spoil his blood.  For example, if he played <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50054-sabrina-glevissig">Sabrina Glevissig</a> or <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50197-iris">Iris</a> , you can spend one <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50038-swallow-potion">Swallow</a> on her to bring the power of the card beyond the removal frame.  Also remember that potions can be used on enemy units to get the opportunity to apply the effect you want, for example, to burn a greater number of units.  Such actions can go sideways, but sometimes this is the only true scenario. <br><br><h3>  5) Reset-tools - finally </h3><br>  Often the one who applied the reset tool first is a loser.  Try to keep the maps of the effects of weather, clear skies and two-bombs and others to the last.  Ideally, play them when the enemy is no longer able to regain the lost advantage (for example, once again throwing a frost or buffing your troops).  It is for this reason that it is so important to get a card advantage over the opponent. <br><br>  I note that there is one exception.  This is a situation where you have reason to believe that the enemy is able to ‚Äú <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50151-lacerate">clean out</a> ‚Äù a weakened row.  Then you need to restore the strength of the troops and hope that your opponent did not draw out the second weather map (hello, <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/40002-dagon">Dagon</a> !). <br><br><h3>  6) Graphics and animations - your friends </h3><br>  Graphic effects and animations can give you a certain idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe contents of the hand of the enemy.  An example of such an animation is a very fast ‚Äúfly-over‚Äù of a card while applying the effect of the <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/50023-johnny">Ivasik</a> card.  After reviewing where the map came from, you can assume that you copied the enemy. <br><br>  These things happen very quickly and they are difficult to notice, and the prediction accuracy is quite low, but sometimes this information turns out to be extremely useful and gives you the opportunity to play around possible dangers (for example, do not put more than 20 forces per line if you assume that the enemy copied <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/501-geralt-igni">Geralt: Igni</a> ). <br><br>  Another example is the <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/4042-giant-toad">Giant Toad</a> or <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/3034-vrihedd-dragoon">the Vrijedd Cavalry</a> - the number of cards that are shown during the selection gives you the opportunity to see how many non-gold creatures are in the opponent‚Äôs hand.  For example, in the image below you can see that your opponent has only two non-gold troops in his hand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5a/11b/318/b5a11b3185664e87a2df8895a213a055.gif"></div><br><h3>  7) Graphics and animations are your enemies </h3><br>  Remember, if the enemy does not know which cards are in your hand, it is harder for him to play around potential threats.  First of all it refers to the effects of control.  Try not to reveal your removal cards to your opponent, so do not point spells at the units if you are not going to use them.  The enemy sees the animation of the arrow and with a rather high degree of probability will be able to assume that you have hidden in your sleeve. <br><br><h3>  8) Mind Your Mulligan </h3><br>  Last week, Reddit users found out how the mulligan system <a href="">works</a> in Gwint, and how it can be used to their advantage.  When a bronze card is discarded, the player can no longer draw this card during the mulligan phase, since it and all its copies are blacklisted.  This allows you to "block" cards that you definitely do not want to see in your starting hand (for example, <a href="http://www.gwentdb.com/cards/4100-foglet">Tumannikov</a> , playing for monsters). <br><br>  Also, without going into details, I will note that the first card that was discarded has a 25% chance to be on top of your deck, the second card is 18.8%, and the third is 12.5%.  This means that if you don‚Äôt need any card now, but you don‚Äôt mind pulling it out later, then it makes sense to replace it first.  Why is this happening you can see in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GyRu8N6kiw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  With this I‚Äôm finishing up and I hope that these small recommendations will help you to win more often and get more pleasure from playing Gwint.  See you again and see you in ladder. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403337/</a></p>
