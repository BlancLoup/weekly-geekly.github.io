  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Asus laptop warranty repair</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  positive emotions post. </h4><br>  No one is immune from mistakes.  Perhaps that is why many owners of various equipment face problems that lead them to service centers for help.  And well, if this assistance is included in the conditions of warranty service and does not lead to unnecessary unforeseen repair costs.  In cases of non-standard breakdowns, not all manufacturers are willing to admit their mistake.  But still massive cases of breakdowns are most often regarded as a marriage of production.  Laptops, for example, also break down and even sometimes have their own ‚Äúdiseases‚Äù.  An example of this is the case when Apple officially recognized the error, which replaced the Macbook case (so-called top case) even after the expiration of the warranty period. <br><br>  Enough words, more specifics. <br><br>  The other day my friend got a crack on an Asus laptop. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The crack was critical, because  It was located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmounting the left hinge cover with a screen, and brought not only aesthetic dissatisfaction, but also inconvenience.  When closing / opening the laptop there was a crash, and the body broke even more.

Sewed the lid and it did not close. <br><br><img title="asus f3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09b/bb8/687/09bbb8687e2c21915a3373447165ecd3.jpg" width="650" height="416"><br><br>  As it turned out, the problem is known and appears in many F3 series laptops.  Branch on the <a title="asus forum" href="http://www.forum.asus.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D30773">official forum</a> proof of that.  A crack in the hinge area, a crack to the right of the keyboard and cracks in other parts of the body were not uncommon.  Even here we have a person <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/75635/">talking</a> about this problem.  However, a clear answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù After reading the forum was not received.  The logic prompted that mechanical damage does not fall under the warranty case, and people on the forum write that the service centers refuse to be repaired. <br><br>  Because  the comrade was sure that he did not drop the laptop, and generally treated him carefully, then we decided to write a letter to the <a href="http://vip.asus.com/eservice/techserv.aspx">service of those.</a>  <a href="http://vip.asus.com/eservice/techserv.aspx">support</a> asus with a detailed description of the problem.  The next day, an answer was received: call the service center.  + Attached is a list of authorized service centers in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Well, we chose a couple of services on Nevsky Prospect (it turned out to be more convenient) and drove off. <br><br>  The first on the way was <a href="http://www.dialectica.ru/pages/service.htm">"Dialectic Service</a> ". <br><br>  Those who were ready to persuade the manager for a long time and persistently that the failure, though mechanical, didn‚Äôt depend on us.  The manager calmly accepted the laptop, even without considering it, just asking for the warranty card (it is worth noting that the two-year warranty ended in a couple of months).  Because  the laptop was needed, did not leave it, but only made a request for repair, and after 2 days the necessary parts arrived at the service. <br><br>  During repair, two parts of the hull (C and D) were replaced: <br><br>  Bottom part <br><br><img title="asus f3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb2/8cc/584/eb28cc584db8a2984d239373b4e4de56.jpg" width="650" height="406"><br><br><img title="asus f3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97a/8d0/15d/97a8d015df8a6bfe6ce158b74f6c2528.jpg" width="650" height="406"><br><br>  and top, around the keyboard (topcase) <br><br><img title="asus f3" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1f/040/213/b1f04021370ca82c30c49b7f11b3329c.jpg" width="650" height="406"><br><br>  Clean new case. <br><br>  I would like to say thank you to Asus for being ready to admit their mistakes, and to Dialectic, for their operational good work. <br><br>  Although no, one ‚Äújoint‚Äù was: the repairmen of the service, while replacing the case, poorly secured the touchpad frame, but this is a trifle, in 5 minutes I glued the frame myself.  :) <br><br>  Conclusion: <br><br>  Do not be afraid to contact the service centers, even in such seemingly non-warranty cases. <br><br>  Good luck to you and your laptops. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76926/</a></p>
