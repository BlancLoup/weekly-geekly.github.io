Sunset era Habra-banana</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <i>Anfangen ist leicht, Beharren eine Kunst (Start - easy, continue - art)</i> <br>  <i><b>German proverb</b></i> </p><br><p>  I think, the topic of a banana respected habr-readers already fed up with order.  It‚Äôs time, on the one hand, to finally finish with this banana, but write about some garlic.  But what to do, the situation is like in that joke about "mice injected, cried, but still ate cactus," because we have not finished with a banana yet.  Therefore, in order to finally close the circle and find out about the connection of banana and Thai boxing, about the adrenaline from the banana, and about why you need to eat banana rather than lemon <del>  and about dolphins from a banana </del>  - follow the cat! </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/ux/zm/nsuxzmhdgceqj0fbk-uofjzjdo8.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <em>They will be among the lotuses, devoid of thorns, <u>under the bananas</u> with hanging rows of fruits, in the spreading shadow, among the spilled waters and numerous fruits that do not run out and are accessible.</em> </p><br><p>  ... says an excerpt from the Koran (56: 27-33) describing the place where devout Muslims will live in the afterlife (literally "ahead of the rest in committing good deeds").  In general, as far as I am aware, in southeastern Christianity (ie, Christians in Southeast Asia), it is believed that the serpent tempted Eve not with an apple, but with a banana, so this fruit is a rather serious contender to the pedestal of "Eve's fruit", on a par with with apple, pomegranate and figs.  And this has a certain meaning, as some researchers believe that it was the bananas that were the first fruits on earth.  Although we have to admit that the wild banana looks quite unpresentable, it has seeds and the taste is not so hot. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/ww/82/ccww823codoz8ob1oki9-4nuzyo.jpeg"></div><br><p>  A similar situation, to be frank, is observed with many other fruits and vegetables, the wild ancestors of which are at least not particularly tasty.  Under the spoiler - a watermelon and a "national" persimmon ( <s>"variety" Caucasian wild</s> ) </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ancestors of modern fruits</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Wild watermelons </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/up/0f/guup0fbsgyaakzyiwvc43c8j4u8.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Wild persimmon </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/ks/kp/lzkskp1odq6eqrcots_sghbqhn4.jpeg"></div></div></div><br><p>  All modern industrial varieties of bananas presumably originated from two or three wild banana species: <em>Musa acuminata</em> and <em>Musa balbisiana</em> (well, a little bit <em>Musa maclayi</em> ) <em>‚Äîhave</em> given a hybrid to <em>Musa paradisiaca</em> ‚Äî whose fruits contain many large black seeds of rounded shape along the whole fruit.  As a result of the further natural development of bananas, in hybrid species, the seeds have significantly decreased - to a size slightly larger than the poppy seed.  With the development of plant breeding, it became possible to grow sterile bananas, in which seeds are absent altogether (well, or if they are present, it is only in the form of faintly visible dark formations - not formed seeds).  This fact does not affect the number of banana plantations, since  Today, the cultivation of banana plants on plantations occurs predominantly by asexual division.  A constantly growing banana tree is either forked off or planted corms.  The result is a full-fledged fruit tree, which is a complete genetic copy of the parent specimen ( <s>and without any seeds there</s> ). </p><br><p>  There is even an assumption that about 95% of the banana bushes, the fruits from which fall on our markets, were originally all derived from the same hybrid plant Musa paradisiaca (the so-called cultigen), grown somewhere in South Asia. </p><br><p>  So, in some ways people are close to bananas.  How not to recall the <a href="https://creation.com/steve-jones-and-the-end-of-human-evolution">words of</a> genetics Stephen Jones " <em>bananas share 50% of our genes, but that doesn't make them half-human</em> " ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/orisvet/" class="user_link">OriSvet means</a> "we have 50% of the common genes with bananas, but this does not make them" half people ‚Äú), which many media outlets disseminated as a sensation like‚Äú a man descended from a banana. ‚ÄùIn fact, it meant that DNA was far from the only thing that the development of the organism depended on. </p><br><p>  So, we continue our historical and ethnographic "introduction to the banana".  Researched suggest that the first bananas appeared 10,000 years ago in Southeast Asia.  From here travelers and colonialists sent them to India, Africa and Polynesia.  Southeast Asia - a rather lengthy concept = extensible.  Moreover, it stretched to as many as 11 countries: this includes both continental Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and insular - Brunei, East Timor, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore. </p><br><p>  It is not known how my further narrative would have happened, I didn‚Äôt read in my time the " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Nebula-</a> Native" novel <a href="http://loveread.ec/read_book.php%3Fid%3D18524%26p%3D1">"Clockwork"</a> or "Spring Woman" (Eng.

But Thailand, Thailand, this holy keeps its traditions.  And what are their main traditions - "Thai boxing" and faith in the ubiquitous spirits.  And all this, oddly enough, is also associated with a banana. </p><br><p>  First - about the banana "tradition of masculinity."  Despite the fact that Thailand is quite a popular destination in our area for tourist mattress tourists, your humble servant, looking at photos of friends in social networks tagged with <i># Phuket</i> <i># beaches of Thailand</i> or <i># streets of Bangkok</i> , didn‚Äôt even see anything interesting I never thought about going there to rest.  And here she is, the motivating force of reading, after reading Windup Girl, I really wanted to visit the legendary Lumphini Stadium, which hosts Muay Thai fights.  For two days I read with delight about the history of the kingdom of Ayutthy and the legendary fighter Nai Kham Tom ( <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%25C3%25AF_Khanom_Tom">Nai Khanom Thom</a> ), in whose honor in modern Thailand, March 17 is held annually.  ‚ÄúBoxing Night‚Äù - National Muay Thai Holiday.  Under the spoiler - a gray-haired legend about Nai Kham Tom </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/nh/dx/wanhdxdq1vqbvs41tbfraxky_4i.png"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Legend of the fighter</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  In 1774, during the war with Burma, several Guardsmen were captured by the Burmese, who, as a rule, were recognized masters of Muay Thai.  The King of Burma, Lord Mangra, wanted to find out which martial art is stronger: Thai boxing or parma - the ancient Burmese martial art - and in 1775, Mangra, on the advice of one of the closest, ordered a fight between fighters from different schools in Rangoon.  Among the captive Thais was Nai Kham Tom (Nai Khanom Thom) - a well-known Thai master at the time.  He was to hold the first match.  Before the start of the fight, Nai Khanom Tom performed a strange (for the Burmese) dance around his opponent (the Ram Muay dance is part of the Muay Thai philosophy, designed to prepare for battle and to show respect for his ancestors, teacher and opponent).  The fight itself was instant, but the judge did not count it, for he decided that the Thai intentionally misled the opponent with his ridiculous movements.  The Burmese put up another fighter and it all happened again.  Ten (or, according to other information, even 11) warriors of Parma alternately went to battle, and all of them were defeated by the Muay Thai master, who was not even able to rest between contractions.  Mangra was so amazed at what had happened that he immediately granted freedom to the prisoner and offered a choice of rewards ‚Äî either money or the love of young slaves.  Nai Kham Tom chose the latter, rightly judging that he could receive a decent salary at any time.  Soon the master of Thai boxing returned home, and glory flew ahead of the hero.  At home, Nai Kham Tom has become a real symbol of the inviolability of Muay Thai, and therefore the invincibility of the Thai spirit and the invincibility of Thailand. </p></div></div><br>  How is a banana associated with such a wonderful person, you ask?  But ... Banana is a very unpretentious plant, in Asian countries it grows on its own, like a weed.  In each Thai house there are several of these annual plants, which bloom and bear fruit one by one all year round.  In many martial arts, the practice of practicing strikes using wooden pillars or trees as a punching bag is well known.  In Thailand, banana shrubs have been used for this purpose since ancient times.  Training related to striking a soft and supple banana ‚Äúwood‚Äù was used by Thai fighters for centuries (from 2-3 centuries AD), the banana was particularly well suited for practicing kicks.  This practice existed until the appearance of various patches and dummies with a ‚Äústuffed‚Äù structure.  And now in Thailand you can meet potential fighters who train strikes on a banana bush (most often, due to the lack of the possibility of acquiring modern sports equipment).  In memory of those ancient times, today the so-called.  ‚ÄúThai punching bag‚Äù is unofficially called a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù because  reminds in its characteristics not so much a fruit as a tree.  The length in human height and weight, reaching up to 100 kg make it an ideal projectile for practicing kicks, the impact energy is evenly distributed throughout the bag and shaking such a projectile is very difficult. <br>  A little bit of oil.  Thai boxing is not only an excellent social elevator for any resident of Thailand, regardless of his status, but also an independent complex and beautiful tradition.  Therefore, to be honest, the promo videos of some fighters with grimacing, incomprehensible music, etc. sometimes hurt the eyes and repel.  Once again, I praise our Belarusian fighters, in particular, my beloved Denis Goncharenka ( <s>even if he is a kickboxer</s> ), whose promo video is the only <u>one I have</u> seen, "went in" under the romance of Muay Thai <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nJyrFKDwhA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  No yang without yin.  We turn to the banana "tradition of femininity."  That in Thailand is also available.  And it is connected neither more nor less, but with <i>Mrs. Tanya</i> .  As I already mentioned, the Thais are very respectful of otherworldly creatures, ghosts, which they sincerely believe, constantly surround all living.  One of the most common and revered fictional creatures are banana fairies, or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">Nang Thani</a> (tai. ‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏á ‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏µ).  Periodically, I saw friends have amulets brought from Thailand, such as these: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/d4/pa/ppd4paeag4ea1uyr82frqqqhhnq.jpeg"></div><br>  This is the banana fairy.  By the way, Thai <a href="https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25E0%25B8%2599%25E0%25B8%25B2%25E0%25B8%2587%25E0%25B8%2595%25E0%25B8%25B2%25E0%25B8%2599%25E0%25B8%25B5">Wikipedia</a> describes these spirits "the <i>spirit appears among the thickets of wild banana and looks like a young girl dressed in traditional Thai clothes, with a beautiful face, with long hair smelling like banana, red feet like a pigeon and lips the color of ripe pumpkin. ..</i> ".  A wild banana is the same <i>Musa balbisiana</i> , if that.  In Thailand, it is also called ‚ÄúKluai Tani‚Äù (Thai. ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏¢ ‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏µ) and try not to plant near houses.  Therefore, thickets of ‚ÄúKluai tani‚Äù (‚ÄúTanya's tree‚Äù) are often found on the outskirts of villages or along the edges of cultivated fields, on roadsides.  And why be afraid, you ask, like there is a "girl with a beautiful face."  And not everything is so simple, it is believed that this ghost harms, and especially those who enter into various discrediting ties.  So,%% username, relaxing in Thailand, forget about Tanya, if you're not a bachelor. <br>  In addition, as is the case with our ‚Äúlocal‚Äù mermaids, it is believed that Tanya can take a physical image and act as a kind of wife, pulling all the energy out of an unhappy man (‚Äúyang‚Äù).  Because ‚ÄúTani is a female ghost who is ruled by the power of Yin, any man is a carrier of the power of Yang.  Since the ghost, unlike a living person, has a very weak energy, in order to achieve balance, it will take away the power from a man, even to death. ‚Äù  To determine the man who is in the power of Tanya can be a sharp cyclical reddening / blanching of the cheeks.  If this happens, experts advise to invite a wandering monk to share the essence.  Here is such an uneasy banana "thing" this Tanya. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/wh/sa/wkwhsaw7dwtzawbt564ahzg_onk.jpeg"></div><br>  Legends and traditions, of course, is an interesting and attractive thing.  But it is impossible to verify them, which means that it can be used in a limited way, ‚Äúfor the sake of joke‚Äù  But biochemistry is a serious thing that has its practical application.  And in this case, most often people who read my epic about a banana, were interested in the question of the content of dopamine and serotonin in this fruit - ‚Äúaccessible sources of happiness and pleasure‚Äù. <br><h3>  Banana adrenaline </h3><br>  How many miraculous substances are not attributed to bananas all sorts of one-day sites and supervising their copywriting master.  And the hormone of happiness, and the hormone of love, and dopamine, and serotonin, and "eat and be happy" and "analogue of the cactus peyote."  In my opinion, in no other fruit are so ‚Äúmixed in a bunch of horses, people ... <s>and volleys of thousands of guns</s> as in this long-suffering banana.  Although if you look into each, even the most confused message, there is a certain amount of truth (and this share is directly dependent on the assessment that the copywriter or content manager received at the school of biology). <br>  But seriously, the banana belongs to a small group of plants that contain biologically active components characteristic of the animal world and man in particular.  Another thing is whether they can be used as intended.  As a rule, this is the main snag.  Banana is no exception.  It really contains such important for human physiology substances as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and adrenaline (ephedrine and mescaline is not, do not even look, but they are well replaced by <a href="https://habr.com/post/434944/">bananadine</a> ).  Before telling how they turned out to be in a banana in general, let me briefly recall their physiological role. <br>  Lyrical digression.  There is an excellent phrase "beauty is functional."  And now, refreshing my knowledge of biology, I look at photos of the brain and marvel at how beautiful its internal structure is.  In the <a href="https://neuroscape.ucsf.edu/technology/">video simulation</a> , the work of the brain (in continuation of my concept of ‚Äúthe universe within us‚Äù, which began with microbiota ...), which would have been impossible without the participation of the neurotransmitters described below. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nF6FFTOKTa0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And now about chemical "gears", thanks to which this beauty is possible.  First we will have serotonin.  In the human body, it acts as a neurotransmitter, i.e.  chemical component responsible for the transmission of impulses between brain cells.  It is good that in the anterior part of the brain, areas responsible for the process of cognitive activity are stimulated under the influence of serotonin.  Serotonin entering the spinal cord has a positive effect on motor activity and muscle tone.  This condition can be characterized by the phrase "I turn mountains."  Finally, the most important thing is that an increase in serotonergic activity creates a feeling of elevated mood in the cerebral cortex.  Lack of serotonin, on the contrary - causes a decrease in mood and depression.  In addition to mood, serotonin is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7522411">responsible</a> for self-control or emotional stability.  Serotonin controls the susceptibility of brain receptors to stress hormones adrenaline and norepinephrine (which will be discussed later).  In people with low serotonin levels, the slightest reason causes a copious stress response.  Some researchers believe that the dominance of individuals in the social hierarchy is due precisely to the high level of serotonin. <br>  Next in line are the three ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù -catecholamine - dopamine (aka dopamine), adrenaline and norepinephrine.  These substances belong to the same class of biogenic amines involved in the transmission of impulses in the nervous system.  The compounds may carry a hormonal load, i.e.  regulate metabolism (for example, changes in the concentration of glycogen by the combination of adrenaline / noradrenaline), as well as transmit impulses in the peripheral nervous system ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">vegetative</a> ) and control all internal organs. <br>  Dopamine is also of interest (besides the pleasure hormone hormone that has gotten the edge of the teeth), which is actively involved in the human decision-making process.  At least among people with impaired dopamine synthesis / transport, many have difficulty making decisions.  This is due to the fact that dopamine is responsible for the "sense of reward", which often allows you to make a decision, considering this or that action even at a subconscious level. <br>  Adrenaline is the most important hormone (no longer a neurotransmitter, like the above-mentioned compounds), which implements ‚Äúhit or run‚Äù reactions.  Its secretion increases dramatically during stressful conditions, borderline situations, the perception of danger, anxiety, fear, injuries, burns and shock.  As it enters the body, it strengthens and speeds up the heartbeat;  causes narrowing of muscle vessels, abdominal cavity, mucous membranes;  relaxes the muscles of the intestines, and dilates the pupils.  So, "fear has eyes <s>(my eyes are pupils)</s> are large."  In addition, adrenaline is actively used as a powerful antiallergic drug (for anaphylactic shock - the drug of choice).  There are even special ‚Äúinsulin syringe-like‚Äù autoinjectors, like the <a href="https://www.epipen.com/en">EpiPen</a> or <a href="https://www.anapen.ie/">AnaPen</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/zm/en/lezmenost_pkm8tclbepmehsvuo.jpeg"></div><br>  Norepinephrine is a hormone and neurotransmitter.  Norepinephrine also increases with stress, shock, trauma, anxiety, fear, and nervous tension.  Unlike adrenaline, the main effect of norepinephrine lies exclusively in the narrowing of blood vessels and high blood pressure.  The vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine is higher, although the duration of its action is shorter.  Immediately after determining the situation as stressful, the hypothalamus secretes corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone) into the blood, which, upon reaching the adrenal glands, induces the synthesis of norepinephrine and adrenaline.  Interestingly, in different animals, the ratio of cells that synthesize adrenaline and norepinephrine varies.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Noradrenocytes are very numerous in the adrenal glands of predators and almost never occur in their potential victims. For example, in rabbits and guinea pigs they are almost completely absent. You can often hear the phrase ‚Äúadrenaline is a hormone of fear, and norepinephrine is a hormone of rage,‚Äù and this makes sense, since it is noradrenaline that causes a person to feel anger, rage, permissiveness. So, given the above about the hypothalamus, you can quite confidently say that the emotions of fear and hatred are related, and are generated by one of the other. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think about the impression of what these substances are and what they are for, it is quite possible from my brief review. Now about where they come from in the body. Basically, everything is synthesized endogenously either inside the brain (like dopamine), or using microbiota (like serotonin).</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">when ingested, potential neurotransmitters and hormones, first, must pass a long digestive path and remain unchanged. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And secondly, even if they succeeded in some incredible way, there is still such a thing as the blood-brain barrier - the main "citadel" of our brain.</font></font><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/0h/m7/ey0hm75mhtiobrfbhp5fathv2zs.jpeg"></div><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The same, but volumetric (3D), pretty ...</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y-/eu/p2/y-eup2wusejm2sbg7kugvt4j0hy.jpeg"></div></div></div><br><blockquote> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%25E2%2580%2593brain_barrier"> </a> (  )    ,              ().     ,        ,       (  ),       . ,   ,   ‚Äû ‚Äú     ( )        ,      ,         (O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> , )    .  ,         ,      . </blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, no hormone or neurotransmitter can normally penetrate this barrier and it will be useless to rush along the bloodstream until it is metabolized. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although the same adrenaline and norepinephrine, in general, do not aspire to the brain, exerting a local effect on the vessels and tissues of the body. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, but these hormones are quickly destroyed in the digestive tract. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means one way - to feed precursors (precursors) into the body, i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">substances from which the potential can produce the required components. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of a living organism, it is most often amino acids. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, in order for serotonin to be produced in our body, two things are needed:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> the dietary intake of the amino acid tryptophan - since it is necessary for the direct synthesis of serotonin in synapses </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> glucose intake with carbohydrate foods =&gt; stimulation of insulin release into the blood =&gt; stimulation of protein catabolism in tissues =&gt; increase in the level of tryptophan in the blood. </font></font></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/do/k-/pudok-ymyujbyju0myfza7n7qcw.jpeg"></div>

In fact, as I reasonably noted in the comments to one of the articles, such ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù (i.e., enriched with microelements, for example) products were actively used in our area, take at least the same iodized or fluorinated salt. Theoretically, commentators are right, since everything was initially developed in order to "... reduce the risk of chronic diseases, be like ordinary food and be consumed as part of a normal diet." But in practice, in order to be considered functional, food must contain not only an increased number of microelements, but at least a few, which are not originally characteristic (or contained in very small quantities) for it, biologically active substances.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> A typical example of such biologically active substances, which for decades have acted as functional additives to food, can be plant sterols (close relatives of cholesterol, see below). </font></font><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Phytosterols (phytosterols; plant sterols / sterols) are compounds that belong to the group of steroid alcohols naturally present in plants. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These compounds are cholesterol-like substances, differing only in the number of carbon side chains and / or the presence or absence of a double bond.</font></font><br></blockquote><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ka/2c/li/ka2cli5ol-gl3ufgxtcixxmg3io.jpeg"></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Practically all phytosterols existing in nature can be adjusted to the given formula. For example, by removing carbon 24 </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and 24 </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , we get cholesterol. Removing carbon 24 </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - we get the compound campesterol. Removing hydrogen from carbon atoms 22 and 23 gives stigmasterol. By hydrogenating a double bond between 5 and 6 carbon atoms, Œ≤-sitostanol (stigmastanol) is obtained, and if hydrogenation of atoms is added to the removal of the carbon atom 24 </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2,</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> we get campestanol.

Well, the ‚Äúcherry on the cake‚Äù can be considered an article in which researchers clearly demonstrated how an immature banana phosphatidylcholine can prevent acute lesions of the gastric mucosa in rats caused by the use of ethyl alcohol.  In addition, the same article shows the protective effect of banana phospholipids in chronic ulcers.  The picture shows the physical model of the protective mucous membrane of the stomach, formed by a monolayer of adsorbed surfactant phospholipids (+ coating of intercalated proteins). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/yh/fv/8byhfvkjyfqdijmypl-yzwgxxuw.jpeg"></div><br>  So think next time, "lemon, or still a banana ...". <br><br>  <b><u>Conclusions</u></b> : this is the end of the phytochemical (and sided) consideration of a banana.  I hope that no one now has any doubts that the banana is not only a valuable food crop, but also a medicine (and even a ready-made ‚Äúfunctional product‚Äù).  Despite the fact that there are indeed serotonin, dopamine, and melanin in the banana, they will not be able to get directly into the brain through the stomach at all desire.  But small amounts of amino acids from which, in the process of maturation, the neurotransmitters mentioned above are formed and hormones may well serve as precursors (precursors) from which the brain synthesizes the necessary components.  The hormone adrenaline, mostly contained in the skin, is quite a can be used externally for allergic reactions (similar to subcutaneous injection).  Well, the most valuable thing in a banana is ‚Äúbanana fat‚Äù, i.e.  a set of lipids and related substances (phytosterols), which, in addition to reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, can also act as excellent anti-acid (anti-heartburn) and anti-ulcer drugs, protecting the gastric mucosa, damaged by alcohol. <br><br>  <u>The most important stages of the "banana era":</u> <br><br>  - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435854/">Notes phytochemist.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435854/">Radio banana</a> <br>  - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434944/">Notes phytochemist.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434944/">Banana skin strikes back</a> <br>  - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434762/">Notes phytochemist.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434762/">Green Banana, or Do not forget to feed the microbiota</a> <br><br>  <b>Sergey Besarab</b> ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steanlab">Siarhei V.
