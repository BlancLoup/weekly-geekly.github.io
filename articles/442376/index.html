Well, survived and everything.  But there have been cases.  Such stories happen in the usual time, but the new year of coincidence is much more due to the greater density of the plot. <br><br>  <b>The most enchanting case was at Mega Belaya Dacha</b> .  We ordered an additional bank terminal there.  And I must say that the last time a bank engineer left us a service flash drive.  This time, the terminal was installed in another store, the Republic of Games.  These are guys who traded in disks, and now they trade in general with all kinds of entertainment.

      The master came, asked if they were trading (and they were trading, moreover, ours), put the terminal.  Then he called the regional coordinator, said that everything is ok.  The terminal worked for two days with Republicans.  Then they noticed that the revenue to them does not fall.  And our sellers have already asked again when there will be a terminal.  The bottom line: all those who paid for them, transferred money to us.  We, of course, then gave it to our dear partners.  Just in case, asking a couple of times what legal entity.  It was harder to keep a serious face expression at the same time.  What they said to the bank is especially interesting to me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Then a guy came and said that he was collecting monopolies.</b>  What put in a logical impasse first shop sellers, and then part of the office.  Of all the things that you can collect, perhaps this is one of the strangest phenomena.  Well, I hardly understand collectors in the age of digital media. <br><br>  <b>December 31, the girl at the closing point asked to tell about the Pandemic.</b>  Two young vendors refused to open the game.  If anything, we open almost any game (there are nontrivial exceptions, but in general - any).  Well, the guys said that the rules for a long time to explain, and we close.  And tomorrow is the New Year and in general.  That is, they refused not only to open the game, but also to explain what it is.  This is not the service we promise.  In general, the standard form of the jamb is still further: nakosorezil himself, correct it yourself.  They took the game to the buyer to show how to play. <br>  - Husband for an hour from Mosigra! <br>  - Two! <br><br>  <b>A shop at the Airport grabbed a week of adventure.</b>  First, the toilet began to work on the supply.  Then they turned off the light for two days.  And then they surrounded the neighbors: there is a point of Beeline and shawarma near.  We did not have time to break in.  As I said, it is important to run no faster than a tiger, but faster than a neighbor: who needs a tabletop when there are much more accessible neighbors nearby?  We even write in presentations that the games almost do not steal: they are voluminous, so you cannot take much away. <br><br>  <b>At the beginning of December, girls of about fifth grade began to come to Taganka, and every day they buy lizuny.</b>  We just brought them in the range of large.  Tellingly, they paid with coins.  They bought every day from 1 to 5 pieces, poured out a kilogram of coins, then they shared lizunov directly at the checkout.  The question was, what do they do in such numbers.  With this money you could buy a lot of nastol, if that.  But if you want a noble donna, then why not?  They do nothing forbidden.  The clue happened in the last days of the month.  A woman came and told me that they were there at school to tear off a small piece of lizun and sell them for 10 rubles to their classmates.  Get a profit and buy more lizunov.  We stayed in a very twofold feelings, but more they did not come. <br><br>  <b>Check the secret buyer.</b>  The implementation scenario is a game for 8 years old girl.  TP asked for something smarter, our salesman Dima began to show sets of experiments.  And then something triggered on a card with experience with a bottle and an egg.  This is the standard theme for the school: we reduce the pressure in the bottle with fire, due to the difference in pressure, an egg is drawn in without a shell.  Unlike the ships in the bottle, it turns out almost every time.  So, she saw this experience and began to really yell at the sellers: ‚ÄúWhat are you selling?  Who does this at all?  What are you crazy about forcing a child to do this! ‚Äù  In general, fell into a rage, then ran away.  It seems to us that this was Stirlitz‚Äôs failure.  This is not the only mistake of mystery shoppers - in Chelyabinsk, for example, they checked not our point, but the neighboring one with games.  There, near our former franchisee partner, with whom we have several years already terminated the contract, so the secret buyer looked to him from the old memory.  Well, the superhit, of course, is the scene in Vladivostok: <br>  - Hello, I am a secret buyer, and now I will check you! <br><br>  <b>Aviapark, the man saw the price of Imaginarium.</b>  He says in giving, and here near here is 750 rubles more expensive.  We explain that it is possible to return the goods there, we have the same then to buy.  Moreover, it is a frequent case.  We give the cards of the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mosigra/blog/430468/">nanotourist</a> (then they were just).  Only 10 minutes later, on the threshold two employees of that point appeared with a threatening question: <br>  - Why do you sell board games cheaper? <br>  They had to explain the rights of the consumer. <br><br>  An elderly couple came to Teplyi Stan, they said they bought the game in another store, they want to return it.  But they came to us, because they are either shy to go there, or they are still somehow afraid.  And we went to consult how best to do everything.  In general, they explained everything to them, prepared them for the dialogue, told them.  Since then, they often go exactly to the seller who explained all this.  Already friends of the store. <br><br>  In general, people often go to the same seller.  Here you go out of vacation and hear something like: <br>  - Oh, you came back, I did not buy anything without you. <br>  And it turns out that the person came, but not seeing a familiar face, just left. <br><br>  <b>Drunk friend really wanted to buy something, but really could not decide on the game.</b>  ‚ÄúI want this one over there.  Both punches.  No, take it away. ‚Äù  And such a circus lasted about 40 minutes. The elder came out, ruined the situation with a confident, commanding voice: <br>  - Listen, and where are you going? <br>  - To the boys hang out! <br>  - Do you have them smart? <br>  - Well, not really. <br>  - Here, take this game. <br>  Bought poker. <br><br>  <b>If you think that only clients can come with booze or vmazan, then you are mistaken.</b>  We had two cases in a year when interns tried to start a working day in altered states of consciousness.  Procedure - urgently removed from the store, find any replacement.  Administrators accompany the body home.  Forever and ever. <br><br>  <b>People regularly try to thank for the good advice in the stores.</b>  Tipping in Russia is not, therefore, who bring some candy, some chocolate, some apple.  This is already from year to year, we were even brought a cake to the point.  Then one day the buyer really wanted to thank the girl.  He took out a pack of pills.  He speaks: <br>  - I'm just a representative of pharma.  Take it.  This is from the throat. <br>  - Mom taught me not to take pills from unfamiliar uncles! <br><br>  <b>Spaniards came to Tverskaya.</b>  Give the phone.  In Russian it is written in the translator's window: "Do you have Far?".  It turned out that multi-faceted dice were needed. <br><br>  <b>Woman on the point: I need a game of 50 years - we play companies.</b>  Seller: here, "Answer in 5 seconds", the simplest patigeymy.  She turns to <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">fantasies</a> (who are 18+): <br>  - This is all played.  These are normal games.  And the rest - baby talk! <br><br>  <b>Parents in the mall</b> .  They came with a child, and then suddenly merged into a neighboring point.  A child left.  This is generally one of the worst situations in the game store and in the store.  All possible shoals are in training at school sellers.  And now the child begins to cry before the heap.  Girl seller neatly fits: <br>  - You do not cry, I'm afraid of you myself! <br>  The child suddenly calmed down. <br><br>  <b>On Taganskaya in December, sellers were pathologically unable to make a bow for packaging.</b>  They need a pretty good manual skill, but it somehow did not develop.  As a result, Elina (the retailer‚Äôs school manager), responsible for training, made 300 bows for them. <br><br>  <b>Children sometimes take the game and bring their parents to show to another store.</b>  It is necessary to intercept and lure back: "And let's open this game, see what's inside, I wonder?".  The problem is that in regional stores we have one person, and if the child runs away, then the store will have to be closed before the search and rescue expedition.  But usually there are two sellers, one goes to the parents and says: ‚ÄúYour child took the game with him a little‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Well, a minute sotsinzhiniringa.</b>  We have the day after the theft of paintings Kuindzhi from the Tretyakov Gallery about the same way carried Jackal in the luxury edition, which is over 15 thousand.  Just came a man, went to the rack, took the game and left.  And this is fabulous because both news (about Kuindzhi and us) I read when they took me out of the Colosseum.  In Rome.  The fact is that I had 4 hours left in this beautiful city, and here some people burned, that even in the nineteenth century when cleaning the Colosseum for restoration, there was a lot of flora.  There were imported plants and animals from different countries.  Plants poured seeds, animals poked with fruit and bones - and that formed the atlas.  So three people at once using approximately the same sotsinzhiniring, touched the beautiful.  I did everything beautifully, just went after the employee in the morning and made the most zadolbannoe face.  It went for ID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/ps/yw/zqpsywqdegnmmtqhgfsjgdirpe0.jpeg"><br>  <sup>I do not advise searching and buying, it is available only in Print-on-demand in bad scans, and there are few pictures.</sup> <br><br>  <b>With Sima was a wonderful case.</b>  On Monday, she replaces the elder one on the Belarusian one, the courier arrives to pick up the goods from the store for delivery.  On Tuesday, she is at the Airport - this is her second store.  The same courier gets there, greets, says, oh, girl, and we saw each other yesterday.  Sima: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember you.‚Äù  What are you talking about?  Similarly, yesterday were there? <br><br>  He was embarrassed, re-introduced himself, took the goods, left.  Wednesday.  She on Paveletskaya helps with the calculation.  And again the same courier.  I went in, said, "Yes, you are kidding me," left.  Then he returned, took the order.  I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone especially and didn‚Äôt look at my eyes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442376/</a></p>
