A second plastic palette came to her, and I was asked to make an additional comparison of two types of material - PLA and Watson. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd4/0c4/63f/fd40c463fe5849e4b68b2f8603fb6896.jpg"><br><br>  A 3D pen is such a hand-made art version of a 3D printer and works with the same consumables - filament.  This is plastic, formed in the form of wire, and it can be of two main types - PLA and Watson.  The company Dadzhet offers both options, conveniently assembled in multi-colored palettes, from where they are conveniently served in the pen itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

(Perhaps in honor of the TV series ‚ÄúSherlock‚Äù with Cumberbatch, the new season of which starts these days). <br><br>  WATSON plastic, in contrast to simple ABS, is transparent, more precisely, translucent.  Its coloring gives a peculiar ‚Äúlollipop‚Äù effect and this determines artistic decisions based on it.  PLA plastic is opaque, but this is not the only difference.  ABS is an ‚Äúoil-based‚Äù plastic, and PLA-plastic is created from agricultural waste - corn, potatoes, sugar beet ... Therefore, it is considered more environmentally friendly, although this is generally not the case for the consumer.  He has a less strong smell when working, although it cannot be said that ABS somehow stinks disgustingly. <br><br>  ABS dissolves in acetone, PLA dissolves in dichloroethane.  This is in case the parts need to be glued together.  PLA is harder and more resilient than ABS and has a lower melting point - this must be taken into account when working with it, as well as during storage and use of products.  For example, a toy made of PLA can ‚Äúflow‚Äù in the summer in the heat if left on the car‚Äôs panel.  Do not make it out of the handle for heating tools. <br><br>  But Christmas toys can be freely made from both types of plastic! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f57/2f3/fd7/f572f3fd76d14bbfbc037aab416dcdff.jpg"><br><br>  3D Pen The djet has a switch between plastic types - this is necessary because they require different temperatures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f3/9dc/109/4f39dc109b8a463d90eb16cb8f62ad68.jpg"><br><br>  Having worked with different types of plastic, I derived for myself some practical features: <br><br>  WATSON plastic is softer and more plastic, it is easier to make small parts out of it, and it lays down more precisely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f1/c1f/0f8/7f1c1f0f8e02496791710136c1f3174b.jpg"><br><br>  Products made of it partly retain plasticity even after cooling, but they are less durable in thin details; more material is needed to create volume.  A handle with ABS is easier to control because it bends more easily - this is important for young children. <br><br>  PLA-plastic is so hard that its elasticity sometimes prevents the pen from working accurately - you need to release an extra coil from the card that hangs in the air and clings to the wire.  I hoped that this quality would make it possible to make spatial frameworks from it without a base - but no, nothing came of it.  Even at the minimum temperature, it does not cool quickly enough so as not to sag.  Therefore, volumetric shapes still have to be done on some suitable basis, although less plastic is required for the framework in the case of PLA.  Another feature is that it sticks worse to surfaces.  For ABS, I used parchment paper to keep it from sticking, PLA can be put right on the table.  This has both advantages and disadvantages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f59/08e/ca9/f5908eca9cf34a9ebd7899f1c43c4afb.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, I made both Christmas tree decorations ‚Äî a WATSON snowman and a PLA bird ‚Äî I used walnuts as a template.  (In the video, this process is well shown).  The snowman is molded with a thinner thread with a tighter styling, and the bird retains its rigidity even as a frame with voids - this is the main difference in working with different plastics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff5/777/250/ff57772508dd4d11acbb8ad81376deca.jpg"><br><br>  Well, yes, I'm certainly not Michelangelo, but this only confirms the fact that you can work with a 3D pen without some artistic talent.  DIY toys made with their own hands delight regardless of their artistic merit! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a99/5dc/fd2/a995dcfd2d2f4d77af0b2470de6b7c87.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e0/061/52c/5e006152c2dd463fa2e9f3540617fa09.jpg"><br><br>  Watch a small video of work with different types of plastic and decide for yourself which one suits you best. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSAf-Bekfdw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I would take both - it is most convenient to make a frame structure from PLA and fill it with ABS. <br><br>  Findings: <br><br>  Palettes are almost a must-have thing for a 3D pen.  Of course, you can buy a kilogram of filament for printers and use it - it will be cheaper - but for art crafts, a variety of colors and ease of presentation is more important. <br><br>  You can buy <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/roditelyam/3dpalitra-pla/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3dpalitra-pla%26utm_content%3D3dpalitra-pla%26utm_campaign%3D3dpalitra-pla_461">the PLA palette</a> and <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/roditelyam/3dpalitra-watson/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3D3dpalitra-watson%26utm_content%3D3dpalitra-watson%26utm_campaign%3D3dpalitra-watson_461">the WATSON palette</a> on the DJET.ru website, and the GEEKT-3DPEN promotional code will give you a small discount. <br><br>  Author Pavel Ievlev (Semiurg), Voronezh <br><br>  <b>Information for bloggers and authors:</b> <br><br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
