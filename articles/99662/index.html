    <h4>  Description </h4><br>  The creators did not become strongly sprayed, and why, if Dot was so popular, and created an improved version of the famous map for Warcraft.  Now there are 2 options for the game - for a team of 3 people and 5. <br><br>  By accessing the client, you will be in control of your account, where you can analyze game statistics, monitor your level and chat with friends.  It is worth mentioning that the game is free, but for money you can buy skins for your favorite characters, that is, the availability of money does not affect the balance of the game, which is very important. <br><br>  Your account can and should be upgraded.  For each game you get experience for each level of skill points and the ability to buy a rune.  About this in more detail: <br><br>  <b>Skills</b> consist of 3 branches and affect the parameters of your future hero.  Depending on the skill leveling, your future hero will receive various advantages to his parameters and additions to abilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c6/f1/c6f1653d5465f8eac9d16f23ad0a3945.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Runes</b> also affect the parameters of your hero.  The more of them, the better you are.  But let's not dwell on it - you can easily figure it out. <br><br><h4>  Character selection </h4><br>  So you decided to play.  You automatically get into the queue for the game, and as soon as 2 teams with similar levels are selected, you will be taken to the hero selection menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/db/4a/db4aa0a6fbc10f6f7dc2e3cb035ab544.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Your team is on the left, there you will see the choice of your party members, and you can choose from the heroes that are in the middle of the screen. <br><br>  After choosing a hero, you need to decide on additional spells that you take with you: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3f/e7/3fe725952b1eaa706f33425b2c1bdf05.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also a chat room where you can discuss tactics with the team and give them your opinion on the chosen heroes. <br><br><h4>  Gameplay </h4><br>  You start at the healing fountain in the best traditions of DotA.  There you spend your first savings on clothes.  The system of things here is much better thought out than in the same DotA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/23/dd/23ddefdcb24d8c7c6c96bb1fb7976021.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After shopping, you choose one of the aisles to the enemy‚Äôs castle and go to war.  As you already understood, your goal is to destroy the castle of the second side.  In case you are killed during the battle, then you will have to wait a certain time and resurrect again at the fountain at your base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/56/28562e1aa72cf9dbe7a48da2f6b08734.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the way to the enemy's castle, you will encounter towers that are very painful and are a serious obstacle to victory.  And to destroy these towers will help you minions (mobs), which after a certain period of time appear at your base and run towards the enemy's castle, destroying everything in its path. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/54/0e/540e1200f6c3cb2c30ca85ff1daab458.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The graphics, in spite of its cartoon character, are very pleasant.  So do not look at the pictures, but go in, download a client for yourself, and try to play this game only once and you are guaranteed pleasure. <br><br><h4>  First season </h4><br>  Right now the first season has begun, where the fight for ratings will go, etc.  I don‚Äôt know much about it, because I cannot get there by my level (they get there from the 20th level, but there are only 30 of them). <br><br>  Best of all, I spend 30 minutes on the game.  What even anyone, even the busiest person, can afford.  And the opportunity to gather a team of your friends and remember the youth while playing is an invaluable feeling!  :) <br><br>  At the moment, the client only supports Windows, but will soon promise a client on a Mac.  (thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/coffee/" class="user_link">coffee</a> for the addition). <br><br>  So join in, for now see the nice first season trailer from Riot Games: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzMnCv_lPxI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiWuXZArFVcVvAlRMCi_KcnGwlEbg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://eu.leagueoflegends.com/">Link to the game site</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99662/</a></p>
