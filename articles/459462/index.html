  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO for Yandex. Search all?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Writing this note inspired me Habro article: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459308/">SEO in 2019 does not work?</a> <br><br>  And if up to this point I had some bad suspicions about SEO optimization at Yandex, but I blamed everything on my inexperience in promoting websites.  However, now the picture seems to have taken shape, and I finally matured to share my <u>brief</u> observations about search engine optimization in Runet. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Subject of promotion </h3><br>  Early last year, my daughter made a website for a small online store.  The product is handmade and made to order individually for each customer.  And the site is only a showcase with examples of work, feedback for placing an order and bolted payment by bank transfer (I will not write about the site itself, this is not about that). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After that, I took up SEO promotion.  I registered the site in search engines, screwed up analytics and looked at the initial results of search traffic.  At the very beginning, as expected, the results were almost zero. <br><br>  Rare visits to low-frequency queries that hit the search results purely by chance.  Therefore, I bought permanent references, ordered normal descriptions of the products, but the results still differed little from zero. <br><br><h3>  Acquaintance and divorce with Yandex Direct </h3><br>  When studying issues of search engine optimization, I stumbled upon a phrase somewhere that ‚Äúif you are not in Direct, then not in Runet‚Äù.  Therefore, something to somehow drive potential buyers to the site, bought advertising in Yandex Direct, and, hurray !, the traffic went.  <b>And not only paid traffic went, but also organic from search queries.</b> <br><br>  It was the first call, but I did not attach much importance to this fact.  After all, my site is new with a zero rating, and TIC has not been updated for a long time (and a little later, Yandex switched to X). <br><br>  But since the advertisement in Direct did not pay for itself, I got involved with it and began to experiment with other promotion channels.  The details about other advertising channels are not important now, but suddenly noticed a strange fact - the traffic from the organic search in Yandex fell sharply, as soon as I ran out of an advertising campaign in Yandex.Direct. <br><br>  And I already paid attention to this! <br><br><h3>  Money is everything? </h3><br>  So what is the result that organic search results are related to the presence of paid advertising campaigns in Direct?  That is, in the absence of an advertising campaign in Direct, the site receives a minus of the ranking in organic search results? <br><br>  Of course, I could be mistaken, but why then organic traffic from Russia from Google search is many times more than from Yandex search, when there is no paid advertising in Yandex.Direct? <br><br>  <s>And if my observations are correct, then the picture emerges not joyful.</s>  <s>But, oddly enough, not joyful just for Yandex.</s> <br><br>  At first I wanted to formulate a conclusion, but after some thought, I decided not to do it.  I am not Nostradamus and I don‚Äôt pretend to make a prophet‚Äôs laurels, and I don‚Äôt offer website promotion services, so draw your own conclusions ;-) <br><br>  I hope that my observations to someone will be useful. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  UPDATE: <br>  Slightly corrected the title of the article, that would be clearer what was going on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459462/</a></p>
