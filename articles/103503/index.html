  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Can hosting be unlimited</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having launched the new <a href="http://cloud.yeaphost.com/">CLOUD</a> tariff, which implies unlimited hosting (traffic, domains, MySQL, disk space, mail, subdomains ...), we are faced with a skeptical attitude towards this tariff, both from potential customers and from competitors.  The main argument of skeptics was that any disk space is limited, and no matter how many servers are in the data center, the total disk space will still be limited to 100, 500 or 1000 terabytes, depending on the size of the data center. <a name="habracut"></a>  The argument is weighty, if you approach the distribution of megabytes as a division of cake between guests, when one ‚ÄúNapoleon‚Äù needs to be divided into 20 people, so that everyone gets and does not offend anyone.  The best solution in this case would be to divide the cake into 20 identical slices and distribute to the guests.  It is noteworthy that after leaving the guests, when cleaning the table, an uneaten cake is found there (someone is on a diet, someone has eaten, someone does not like sweets, someone has fallen asleep face in a salad, etc. .).  At the same time, Anna Vasilyevna (the lush neighbor) several times asked for supplements, but since everything was already distributed, the owner could not help but smile, and shrugged.  Thus, on the one hand, we have a drunken, but hungry Anna Vasilyevna, on the other hand an half-eaten cake.  A similar approach to resource allocation is used by most hosting companies. <br>  In continuation of the metaphor with the cake, let's make an assumption that the high cost of gifts will depend on the satisfaction of guests.  If, having the same cake, we would not invite 20 guests, but only 5, while not restricting their access to the cake.  It is obvious that the cake, originally designed for 20 people, will easily satisfy the five guests, who, being full and satisfied, will leave more expensive gifts.  In addition, the owner will need to wash less dishes, buy less vodka and hire less waiters to serve the festive table. <br>  If you transfer all this to a hosting service, then, having 1000 gigabytes, it‚Äôs more profitable to have 500 clients who will pay $ 20 for unlimited hosting, rather than splitting a disk into parts of 100 MB and selling them at best at $ 1.5.  As a result of simple calculations, in the first case, we get revenue of $ 10,000 / month, in the second case $ 15,000 / month.  At the same time, the costs associated with providing technical support for 500 clients are an order of magnitude or even lower than the support service for 10,000 clients (1000 GB / 100 MB = 10,000).  In addition, marketing efforts to attract five hundred customers, many times less effort spent to attract ten thousand customers.  With proper management, in the first case, it will be possible to afford to rent a new server every month, to support the status of unlimited hosting or to increase resiliency indicators, having only 100 clients.  Now imagine that this is not one, but N servers. <br>  At the same time, there will be brave souls who, having seen the word unlimited hosting, will start uploading backups to the server, create file exchangers, video archives and so on.  Here is an example of this approach <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yeaphost/blog/103136/">habrahabr.ru/company/yeaphost/blog/103136/#comment_3206498</a> .  In a sense, JackRowsen is right, "He called himself a cargo, get into the body."  But we should not forget about the rules for using hosting, which each hosting company determines based on the requirements of the legislation, its own security policy and marketing policy.  This means that the hoster can limit the service of all the above services, writing it in the rules for using hosting. <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, I would like to say "Infinity is not something that cannot be measured, but something we cannot reach." </div>
