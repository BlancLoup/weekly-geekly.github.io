Really be able to become attached to Mr. Darcy with incessant beckoning Twitter? <br><br>  Readers of books on tablets like the iPad are becoming aware of how immediate and fascinating the printed or electronic book is on the black and white reader, while the tablets carry with them a whole bunch of interruptions that crush and interrupt reading.

      E-mail in teasing reach, the ease of finding an unfamiliar word or fact in Google ... and if the book starts to nag, change it to a movie from Netflix, or scroll through tweets - it‚Äôs just a few touches. <br><br>  All this sums up the reading, which has turned from a traditional individual lesson into a cacophony of the 21st century.  And some of the millions of users who bought tablets and book apps from Amazon, Apple, and Barnes &amp; Noble come to the conclusion: just sit down and concentrate on reading is harder today than ever. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like trying to cook food surrounded by small children,‚Äù said 53-year-old David Myers, a system administrator from Atlanta who bought the Kindle Fire in December: ‚ÄúThe child is naughty and you have to stop, get everything in order and go back to cooking .  These applications need attention all the time, ‚Äùhe says, although he remains committed to the device. <br><br>  For publishers who have survived the transition of a large number of consumers from printed books to electronic books, the growing popularity of tablets is fraught with potential danger: book buyers can switch to tablets and find that they have become less susceptible to reading.  Will such readers move away from books, allowing movies and the Internet to capture all the free time? <br><br>  Maya Thomas, senior vice president of the Hachette Digital (a division of the Hachette Book Group), hopes the opposite.  ‚ÄúA tablet buyer who does not have the habit of reading gets this opportunity,‚Äù says Ms. Thomas, indicating that tablets usually come with at least one e-book reader application.  ‚ÄúWe hope that tablets will increase the number of readers.‚Äù <br><br>  According to the Pew Research Center report, sales of reading devices have increased over the last Christmas holidays: from mid-December to early January, the report showed a doubling of the number of adult Americans - tablet owners and readers. <br><br>  But there are also signs of publishers cooling to tablets as terminals for reading.  The latest Forrester Research survey showed that 31% of publishers believe in the ideality of the iPad platform and similar tablets for reading, and a year ago, 46% of publishers thought so.  ‚ÄúThe tablet is like a tempter,‚Äù says James McQuivey, a Forrester Research analyst who did the survey, ‚ÄúHe constantly says: you could be on YouTube now.  Or all the time sends notifications about new mail.  Reading itself is compelled to compete with all this. ‚Äù <br><br>  Indeed, the Kindle Fire main menu offers links to videos, applications, the Internet, music, a kiosk, and books, making books just one of the options.  Even more functionality is embedded in the iPad, which Allison Coots, a 21-year-old student at Elon University in North Carolina, bought in 2010.  She claims that the reading process has changed since then.  Allison constantly drives away thoughts to check other things, and this leads to the problem of reading the books to the end.  For example, in late September 2010, she bought Breaking Night (a memoir of a homeless girl who became a Harvard student).  Allison said that the only time when she was able to really concentrate on the book happened on the plane, because there was no access to the Internet. <br>  ‚ÄúI tried to sit and read at Starbucks or at home, but it all ended up reading Facebook or googling anything said in the book, and the next thing I realized was that I was surfing the Internet for 25 minutes,‚Äù she says. <br><br>  The problems of changing reading habits have been widely discussed by Amazon, Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire.  Russ Gradinetti, vice president of content for Kindle, said that one of the reasons why the original Kindle released the same functionality in 2007, priced at $ 399, was precisely the desire to let people immerse themselves in reading without interference. <br>  At the same time, the new Kindle Fire costs $ 199 and offers a variety of media formats: video, Internet, and all the possible interference with them.  But Mr. Gradinetti said that Fire was conceived not as a replacement for the first Kindle, but as an addition to it.  Different devices for people with different requirements. <br><br>  Many publishers believe that the market for printed books and black-and-white e-readers will not disappear, despite the tablets.  Insatiable book lovers were the first to grab the readers, appreciating their convenience, mobility and the ability to increase the font for a more comfortable reading for people of age.  Now these readers are easier, thinner and cost less than $ 100 (even a cheap tablet costs more than 2 times more expensive), so that people who are not computer-savvy with a desire to read only have no particular incentive to switch to tablets.  As long as readers are much cheaper than tablets, they will remain in demand for a long time. <br><br>  However, Mr. McCuyvi of Forrester Research argues that the tablets will eventually force out black and white readers, referring to the historical precedents of the Palm Pilot, simple digital cameras and portable car GPS navigators, which were gradually replaced by multifunction devices, as the reasons for using them as the only single-function device was getting smaller. <br><br>  For 29-year-old Erin Folk, legal secretary and an insatiable reader from Los Angeles, the era of readers led to one noticeable effect: she amassed a lot more books belonging to the category NZCH (Not Finished Reading).  But according to her, she buys more books and thinks that all the hindrances have made her in some way a more perceptive reader.  ‚ÄúWith so many distracting things, my taste in books has really improved,‚Äù says Mrs. Folk, ‚ÄúRecently I have been aiming for books that make me forget about the entertainment world at my fingertips.‚Äù  If the book is not good enough for this, I think my time could have been better spent. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Late translator afterword</b> .  Gentlemen, pay attention <b>to</b> all the minuses and insults that the article is transferable.  I absolutely do not require the buns for a rather complicated one, considering the ‚Äúhigh calm‚Äù of the New York Times, translation specifically for Habr (believe me, this is not an hour or two works), but I don‚Äôt want the perception of the translation as hitting your favorite tablet or personal concentration when reading.  The problem <b>exists</b> , professionals speak about it, it cares for publishers, even the NY Times already writes about it - not a yellow piece at all.  And I translated the article for informational purposes only.  Thank you for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139516/</a></p>
