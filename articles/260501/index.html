I shot-edited the video, and although I published it last fall, I just now got around to briefly describe the reports themselves.  On Habr√©, there has never been a publication of video and review reports from this conference, I hope it will be interesting.

The developer of quite good (by the way, I used it myself) ‚Äúyet another githab for mercurial / gita / svna‚Äù RhodeCode long sawed the system open-source, and finally wanted to monetize and decided to close the code.  It was not there.  The community forked and renamed the project, and held up a defense against a distressed project starter.  As a result, the source code of the original project remains open, only under a very strange and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://code.rhodecode.com/rhodecode/files/3922ae4587127d03ae53f33c6e1e5cee129415eb/LICENSE">controversial license</a> .  And yes, first-hand history, the developer Kallithea told about all this. </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435846">Commercialization of open source software under the GPL license</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-01">additional materials</a></sup> - Back to the previous story.  Devilish Russian <s>hackers</s> lawyers found a legal (RMS recognized!) Gap in GPLv3, how to hide the source, delivering it only to the customer.  In fact, I have already shot this report three times (+ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140411-43">[1]</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140927-01">[2]</a> ) at different conferences, but it was worth it - the reaction of the audience was very different.  The business audience usually perceived OK, for the most part without even realizing what the problem was (‚Äúthere is no such GPL? Does not have legal force in the Russian Federation ‚Äî the forest‚Äù), and there were more likely developers who strongly attacked the speaker ‚Äî how to close it their code, of course, deprive them of fame and bugfixes from the community ... IMHO, of course there is a niche for this solution - small-scale, almost custom solutions for small businesses, when you open everything - no one will buy at all, but you can ‚Äúshare the costs‚Äù for a couple of dozen customers (for example, adaptation of open ERP under specifically  requirements "Russian pharmacy", etc.). </li></ul><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429921">What prompted Belarusian pirates to create a branch of Creative Commons?</a>  " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-02">Additional materials</a></sup> - Here, in addition to the standard anti- <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-02">piracy</a></sup> rhetoric, a story about how some Belarusian, let's say, activists, organize a branch of" Creative Communities "and attack the Belarusian law on copyright.  It's funny that this activism was not approved by the audience, there was a discussion in which some listeners from Ukraine tried to explain the danger of non-constructive interaction with the authorities. </li></ul><br>  <b>Robots and automation</b> <br><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429914">The use of popular protocols and free software in the management of a mobile robot</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140822-03">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - Namely, a floating robot.  Of course, these are not Ocean Robotics' robots, but relatively simple foam structures, food containers, Rasberri Pi, sensors, and open sources.  But they work - monitoring of lake reservoirs, coastal profiles and depth, and that‚Äôs all.  The story about the experience - how to provide communication (Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS), what hardware and protocols tried, what frameworks ... By the way - plus conferences in nature - there was a live demonstration - this drone was launched into the water and drove there (there is a video). </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429959">Smart GreenHouse</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140822-01">dopmaterials</a></sup> - There is nothing moving, automating the growth of "grass at home", if you know what I mean.  Light-watering-temperature-humidity-monitoring, and even remote photographing (what happens inside and maybe outside).  Interesting - used low-power Rasberry Pi, and ... Java.  Java Embedded is completely drawn by raspberries, and is easy to develop.  The guys obviously need to engage in crowdfunding, so even at Habr√©, a couple of stories about much simpler devices slipped ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/225897/">[3]</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/210814/">[4]</a> - irrigation automation, arduino, smartphones, etc.). </li></ul><br>  <b>Nuclear physics / kernel hacking</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435796">On methods of dynamic embedding into the kernel of the operating system, using Linux as an example</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-08">additional materials</a></sup> - Real hacking - interception of functions in various ways, through interruptions, through the system call manager, wrappers, prolog printing with disassembling, Linux Security Modules hooks, bypass page protection ... All this Of course, not for hacking, not for nothing, but for protection - both for modeling attacks and for implementing GIS. </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/89311690">Bootloader and Linux kernel debugging on ARM board with OpenOCD</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-03">additional materials</a></sup> - how to drag the bootloader and Linux kernel to a new unknown ARM hardware, how to make it all fly and debug, because it has neither a display nor a network - what are the usual connectors and how to work with them. </li></ul><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/86286448">Clsync progress - security and porting to freebsd</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-02">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - Here is a story about spetsutilit for the migration of LXC containers.  It has an open problem - using the inotify interface to track changes, and there is an architectural conflict there, that often root rights are required for proper operation, but all this is not safe.  The speaker told several attempts to untie it, but judging by the discussion, it is still far from a beautiful final decision.  He also ported all this to BSD, although there is no inotify at all, and there had to be a special perversion there. </li></ul><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/105802677">ROOT.</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/105802677">A data analysis framework</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-04">dopmaterials</a></sup> - And this is the real" nuclear physics ", not in the sense of" kernel hacking ", we are talking about the tools of this high-energy physics.  And these physicists are no longer like in the forties, elbowed in radium, beryllium and graphite melts, but mostly at the computer (inventing HTML and all that from boredom, instead of the cheap fusion, which they have been waiting for for a century).  Here they gave birth to Yet Another data analysis framework.  And not some scilearn-kit on python, or R is for the weaklings, but on High Performance C ++ (everything should be High there), for <s>megatons it is</s> petabyte of data.  With simple documentation on one thousand pages, and three thousand C ++ classes.  For the strong in spirit, or who has a real bigdata, who needs to model his Matrix. </li></ul><br>  <b>DEVOPS</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/92203012">Test environment configuration with Ansible</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-05">dopmaterials</a></sup> - Well, you won't surprise anyone <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/92203012">with the Ansible</a> story, another thing is that not only the devops-sysadmin should know this, but a normal tester should automate the deployment of systems for manual or automatic testing. </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/105802674">Text parsing with python and PLY</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-01">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - Configs, configs, endless configs of system administration.  Previously, when automating work with configs, it was customary to write disposable pearl parsers on regexp - crooked, unreliable, but a real parser on Lex-yak is expensive to write.  And there was a small master class on how to quickly and confidently write a real parser of a real grammar on the Python generator of parsers - PLY. </li></ul><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435781">Flume and Morphlines - transformation of data streams without a line of code</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-09">dopmaterials</a></sup> - Another eternal problem of system administrators and analyzers of various bigdats is the log parser-analyzer collectors, which in the case of scaled systems turns into a difficult task.  It was immediately shown how using Apache Flume and Morphlines to solve it all once and for all, reliably and scalable.  And without a line of code.  Software.  But of course you will have to partake of configs and write, without this in any way. </li></ul><br>  <b>Data</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/105802679">Estimating data corruption on a failed medium as applied to Ext3 and NTFS</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140824-08">additional materials</a></sup> are not a recovery workshop, but rather, where and how it is worth watching that when the failures go, assess the scale of the problem: maybe the data is not affected, maybe not all gone, maybe it's not time to make backups, etc. </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/109074659">Guaranteed destruction of information</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-11">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - and vice versa.  If you need to destroy information, quickly and reliably.  But there are no superdevices for exploding-shooting-demagnetizing the hard drives.  Is it necessary to hitrozateti the screw 100,500 times using the ‚ÄúGuntman method‚Äù, or is all this superfluous and invented only to delay you while the door is being broken? </li></ul><br>  <b>Creation</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429985">Creating a 3D cartoon using SPO</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-12">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - How to make a 3D cartoon on an open-source stack (Blender and all that), how much time and effort you need to threaten, even if it‚Äôs just a clip for a couple of minutes.  Make a cartoon alone, on the "diploma", having mastered all the near-animation professions.  The most popular report from the conference, the speaker was given the main prize.  The truth was ‚Äúthey were waiting for a boy‚Äù - the toy robot seemed to be the prize, and the winning speaker was suddenly of the fair sex and appearance. </li></ul><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/109074658">Features of the correction of optical distortions in digital photography</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-10">additional materials</a></sup> - First, ‚Äúmatan‚Äù is a brief introduction of the problem of lenses and their distortions, then how to fix it with different sources, from Blender to OpenCV.  Heuristically, or using global databases for all lenses.  For me, all this was somewhat surprising, because I hardly see any distortions at all, or I don‚Äôt pay attention, and when I edit a video, I often add them to fill the ‚Äúframe more tightly‚Äù.  But for those who are struggling for the perfect photo, you probably need to know. </li></ul><br>  <b>Network</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429885">FlowForwarding Warp - how is the JVM running SDN controller</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140822-02">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - secret development of Epamovsky laboratories in the field of software-configurable networks.  And they gave birth to a Cthulhu-like framework (actually <i>Shub-Niggurath</i> on slides and in a report), which respawn agents, connections, and all this on JVM, Akka-Java actor model + Apache Avro for message passing. </li></ul><ul><li>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106429992">Token-based authorization for sessions of direct connection in the cloud</a> " <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-07">dopmaterialy</a></sup> - the guys saw globally accessible NAS, living somewhere in local networks, but accessible through a special service from everywhere.  And here they had to forward authorization between the global server and NAS.  Randomized one-time tokens running between client, server and NAS, Apache mod_auth_token, which they had to finish a little.  It seems nothing magical, but you can imagine similar tasks if you invent another dropbox or something similar. </li></ul><br>  <b>Distribution kit</b> <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435819">Overview of implementations of multi-</a> <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-06">architecture</a></sup> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435819">support in Linux distributions and their</a> <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-06">build</a></sup> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435819">systems</a> ‚Äù <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140823-06">dop materials</a></sup> - a cool specialist in building various Linux <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vimeo.com/106435819">systems</a> , collecting EPAM-Linux, trying to open everyone's eyes to the abyss of problems in the repository system of various Linux distributions.  This is also a non-integral assembly in Fedor and Debian, when to start up a seemingly sterile and complete assembly system, you need to enclose the ‚Äúcarrying nail‚Äù of bags, manually assembled somewhere on the development machines.  And hacks with incomplete packet meta information to deliver 32bit packages to 64bit systems.  And curves and non-extensible standards, such as FMS, in which the designers did not even provide for architectures other than i32 / i64.  And the inconsistency of attempts to solve these problems with the violation of standards.  In general, quoting the speaker ‚ÄúChaos and horror ...

Rebeys, squash, cherry peaks and that's it, in a lecture from one of the developers of Opera. </li></ul><hr>  Let me remind you that the links to "additional materials" - annotations, extended abstracts, detailed slide infographics, thematic classification and information about the authors.  There was also a dozen different blitz reports, reports in Belarusian, near-advertising ... here is the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/Category:LVEE-2014">full list</a> . <br><br>  But I would like to remind once again that the conference is called Linux <b>Vacation</b> Eastern Europe, and Vacation is one of the key factors.  The conference in the forest, continuously flowing into the afterparty (kebabs, snacks, fireworks) and back, really a lot of time to communicate with experts, both among speakers and participants. <br><br>  Here are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://plus.google.com/photos/107779623120234220422/albums/6050990992797799297">photos from LVEE-2014</a> , look.  And if last year it was all at the end of August, there was rain, which drove part of the reports to the premises, this year the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lvee.org/">LVEE-2015</a> conference will be next week, June 25-28, at the most sunny time, and at that same place. <br><br>  Yes, there is not quite a close path, but a transfer from Minsk and Grodno is organized there; you can go by car or blablacar, and last year two speakers came by bike at all.  From Ryazan.  From Ryazan, Karl. <br><br>  In general, registration of participants is open until the end of the week. <br><br>  By the way, if you have a report on Linux topics, despite the fact that the program has been formed, you can still offer it, plus there is a section for short blitz reports where any participant can speak, plus sometimes ‚Äúwindows‚Äù appear sometimes ... so if there is a theme - welcome. <br><br>  Well, and if you can not come, and reports about open-source interest, look, I <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:Open-source">shot and published a lot of them</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260501/</a></p>
