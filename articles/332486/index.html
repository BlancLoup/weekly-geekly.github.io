  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming and martial art: what is common?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Code writing is a craft that requires constant development - consider the participants of the Coding Dojo initiative in EPAM.</i>  <i>The leader of the movement, Alexander Baglai from Kiev, told how ‚Äúdojo-practices‚Äù raise the mood of engineers and why the game helps to succeed in work.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/6b8/6a8/28b6b86a867416ddf7627c3d6b5b7249.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In Japan, "dojo" is a place where they train in various martial arts.  In a figurative sense, this is a place where we discipline ourselves to become better, share knowledge, help each other and just have a good time.  The engineers, being creative guys, decided to take the term dojo and apply it to programming.  Say, we express ourselves by writing code, and this is also a craft that requires its place to improve skills.

Coding Dojo can have various forms.  One of them - Codenjoy, or coding for the sake of pleasant emotions.  Participants create their own bot, which then competes in real-time in some simple game - for example, Tetris, Battlecity, Snake, Sudoku, Minesweeper, Moebius and others.  The winner is the team or participant whose bot scored the most points. <br><br>  Project Manager Alexander Baglay has been promoting the <b>Codenjoy</b> initiative in EPAM at the global level for about a year: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI started as an ordinary engineer on a project in another company.  Somehow at one of the conferences I learned about a new tool - Coding Dojo, which had recently been an overseas wonder.  At this event, Johannes Brodwall showed the participants one of its implementations.  Then, together with Sergey Zelenin, we decided to write something of our own. <br><br>  So Tetris appeared, and a little later we gave this game our own name - Codenjoy (from Code + Enjoy).  The result was an activity of an interesting format, which we regularly conducted, wherever we were invited.  Later, the community Codenjoy was divided into senseis, or organizers, who added fuel to the fire;  participants - programmers who write code;  and contributors - those who started writing their own games.  Depending on the results of the game, participants receive feedback - why the leader broke into the leaders, and the rear graze the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/219/a52/4f5/219a524f56f91a9d86af8b53fef97eef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, in the past, Codenjoy developed as a weekend initiative until I met with Sergey Sergienko, Engineering Excellence Program Manager at EPAM.  He drew attention to Codenjoy and after a few years invited me to the company to develop this initiative.  In this way, I started working on a weekend project, but already as a main job. <br><br>  <b>First</b> , I collect, analyze all the developments on this topic, and also help to use them in different locations.  As a rule, IT professionals are always full of ideas on how to brighten up their working days with various intellectual meetings. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , I am looking for active guys who are ready to catch the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEPAM Dojo and make their contribution to its development.  For example, we are ready to hold such a meeting in our location, to improve the format, to offer it on our project, including to customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de1/666/398/de1666398ae485fbf98ffed640d057ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , every day I tell and show EPAMs what Coding Dojo is and how it works, I help with materials and the organization of meetings in this format.  I am glad that now they are being conducted more and more - it may be team building for the participants of the production project or training within the framework of an external conference for the Talent Acquisition.  We also work with trainers who want to diversify their training with the help of game elements. <br><br>  Coding Dojo is a gamification tool for various professionals.  We are able to work not only with software engineers, but also with automated testing engineers (for them we have the Coding Automated Testing Dojo program).  In addition, we cooperate with non-technical specialists (on the basis of the game I Can Code we help them to get a basic understanding of programming).  It's nice when, after two hours of such a game under the supervision of a facilitator, the HR specialist says: ‚ÄúGreat!  Everything is not as difficult as it seemed. ‚Äù <br><br>  Another form of our activities is the gamification of the production process itself.  Suppose a team needs to solve a particular task.  And instead of telling the guys ‚ÄúDo this and that‚Äù, you can enter the leaderboard, achivki, other attributes and offer a game with clear visualization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/370/39e/eaa/37039eeaa527237c553b86f5acf0b41c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When they say to you: ‚ÄúHere's a sandbox for you, here is a spatula, let's go do it!‚Äù - the child's excitement to work awakens in you, productivity increases.  Even if the day before you just played in Codenjoy with teammates, and the code went to junk - the mood that you charged, will feed you for a long time on the combat project.  Personally, Coding Dojo helps me get that fan, the magic that I got when I just touched programming.  I am glad that any day of the week you can recharge this drive. <br><br>  Playing Coding Dojo, the guys are on the path of change: they see that their code is not of sufficient quality and they need to grow, because someone defeated them on points 10 or 100 times.  Or they are simply distracted from the main project activities and find inspiration in the game.  It turns out a kind of coding therapy "medicine" for enthusiasm. <br><br>  Join the <b>Coding Dojo</b> initiative as a volunteer.  At <a href="https://github.com/codenjoyme">https://github.com/codenjoyme</a> you can do a fork project and work with it.
