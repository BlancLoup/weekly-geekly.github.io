  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to save the movie "Passengers"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Passengers film, which was released last year, is a rare example of an original, non-comic book, TV series or even a book, high-budget fiction in the movies.  The film paid off at the box office and even got a couple of technical nominations for an Oscar, but average critics' reviews ( <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/movie/passengers-2016">41/100 on Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passengers_2016/">31% on Rotten Tomatoes</a> speak for themselves) and the audience left an impression of not the most successful film.  Is it possible that he was underestimated?  Is it possible that he didn‚Äôt have enough just a little bit - for example, a more intriguing editing, in order to turn from a passing cinema into, at least, crashing into memory?  About this - a fresh video is one of the most intelligent YouTube bloggers Nerdwriter, for which we did Russian subtitles: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://vk.com/video_ext.php" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1/videos%3Fsort%3Dp%26view%3D0%26flow%3Dgrid">Nerdwriter</a> is one of our favorite channels on YouTube, consisting of copyrighted videos on various topics: from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwK7TiA9qmuU">art of portraying Jack Nicholson</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcA2-iMz479o">how Amazon Go will change our lives</a> .  But most often, Evan, the author of the channel, talks about cinema and various aspects of cinema. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How do you, for example, historical and economic analysis of the role of dragons in the "Game of Thrones"?  Six minutes of historical analogies, concluding how the era of dragons leads to progress, a centralized state and taxation.  If this is not geek orgasm, then what?

Screenshots, remakes, restarts - as many as you like.  But so that on level ground and about space - very little.  And let ‚ÄúPassengers‚Äù is not ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù, the film is not so bad as to be completely ignored.  And from its shortcomings it is possible to draw useful lessons for the future. <br><br><h2>  Dollar Buyers Club </h2><br>  The sponsor of this release was the company <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a> .  Too difficult guys, by the way: a year ago, the household goods giant Unilever bought a startup for the delivery of shaving accessories by subscription <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-20/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-with-152m-in-sales">for $ 1 billion</a> .  The company owes its grandiose success to one simple idea: why pay $ 20 a month for new blades of some branded Gillette, $ 19 of which will still go to expensive marketing, telling you why the hell you should spend that money on a sharpened piece of metal every month, if you can get all the same thing for a dollar, and its marketing takes not high cost, but virality: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUG9qYTJMsI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For $ 5, the Dollar Shave Club offers a <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/nerdwriter">starter kit</a> in the form of a machine, four blades, oils (they say it is more beneficial for the skin than a cream) after shaving and the Toilet Minutes magazine.  For those who have already read the air freshener, apparently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c4/ee3/512/9c4ee3512dfd477f83ab7ed9e59164fc.png"><br><br>  However, the DSC range is not limited to the razors at all: <br><br> <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/our-products/fresh"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c5/63a/10c/2c563a10c0f822c13f95f201fbaba47a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Perhaps, in their financial model there is only one flaw: the site can not be ordered immediately annual set of blades to the machine - you know, by analogy with a suitcase of socks for a year.  A great gift would be.  And so, of course, every month from the USA <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">it</a> will be more expensive to carry blades even with the transfer of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy.com</a> than any branded ‚Äúthere is no better for a man‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Send by "Mail" </h2><br>  However, to order and try the starter kit under the link of <a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/nerdwriter">Nerdireter</a> (which in any case would cost five bucks, we just want to support your favorite author) does not interfere with anything - separately or into the load to the existing orders that you deliver via Mail.  We will wait for impressions ordered. <br><br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition, when you first order a transfer Pochtoy.com - <b>$ 5 discount on the promo code <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">supergeek</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you like the Nirdraiter channel, be sure to check back on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting/videos%3Fsort%3Dp%26flow%3Dgrid%26view%3D0">Every Frame a Painting</a> .  This channel is more narrow-topic, specifically devoted to cinema, quite deeply examines the author's style of the most interesting filmmakers from the point of view of various aspects of cinema. <br><br>  Videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3FOzD4Sfgag">Edgar Wright - How To Do Visual Comedy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2THVvshvq0Q">Michael Bay - What is Bayhem?</a>  you can probably already be entered into the golden fund of ‚ÄúYouTube‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403297/</a></p>
