  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most useful mobile development conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>When</strong> designing <strong>AppsConf 2018</strong> we set a high bar for ourselves - to make the most useful conference on mobile development.  Finally, to find out whether our plans have turned out, we invite you to the Infospace <strong>on October 8 and 9</strong> at the conference itself.  But I, as a witness to the preliminary runs and the owner of insider information, I can promise - it will be cool.  In confirmation of these words, below is a story about top reports. <br><br>  But first, let's clarify the concept of utility in the context of a mobile development conference.  Wikipedia says that the usefulness of a good or product is its ability to satisfy a human need.  And also, that utility can be divided into objective and subjective.  We decided subjectively: the participants need three types of reports for maximum benefit. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Applied reports</strong> .  These are the knowledge and skills that you can even <strong>go</strong> tomorrow <strong>and apply in your work</strong> .  Such speeches can be done only by great specialists in this field who thoroughly understand the problem and are ready to share a solution. <br></li><li>  <strong>Hardcore reports</strong> .  Deep knowledge, which can be gleaned from such a report, will not be given to everyone and, at first glance, is not necessary for everyone.  But the speakers will definitely make you <strong>listen with your mouth open</strong> , because, besides them, no one will tell. <br></li><li>  <strong>HYIP reports</strong> .  This is not necessarily a story on the fashionable topic of augmented reality, but rather a speech that <strong>provokes discussion</strong> and a desire to discuss the issue in detail with colleagues later. <br></li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Balancing in such a division into species, plus, of course, by subject, the Program Committee also selected reports.  On topics everything is pretty traditional: <strong>iOS and</strong> <strong>Android development</strong> , <strong>platform-independent</strong> issues (for example, a <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3944">report</a> on business logic in C ++) and <strong>General themes</strong> .  The latter includes everything in the mobile field: how to interview mobile developers, how to become Head of mobile, how to organize a huge team (Maxim Efimov from Uber <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3594">will tell</a> about it) and more.

      Yes, the name General is not so hot, but with the designations of the halls they pokreativili :) It is also a stretch to include the report of <a href="https://habr.com/users/PapaBubaDiop/">Vadim Bashurov</a> , the author of the very game ‚ÄúField of Miracles‚Äù, which was born earlier than many readers.  Vadim will tell <strong>funny and sad stories about the development of computer games</strong> in the evening of the first day.  The <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3791">theses</a> promise answers to any questions, most of them, I think, will be asked already in the afterparty. <br><br>  Let's go over some reports now.  I note that below they are arranged chronologically, and not in order of importance - because everyone will determine it. <br><br><h2>  The evolution of CI in the mobile development team (12:00, October 8) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/3l/wm/yw3lwm-402uwfuz_6cx-vcpbvqy.png" alt="Nikolay Nesterov" align="left" width="200"><br>  <strong>Nikolai Nesterov</strong> promises a <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3987">tour of</a> the history of <strong>continuous integration</strong> development in the Avito mobile development team.  Moreover, in specific performance indicators: how many builds per day, how many errors, etc. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Author, write less.  Kotlin for development in iOS and Android (14:00, October 8) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/wb/ib/towbibf89ihp3xks7chbok5y3ha.png" alt="Nikolai Igotti" align="left" width="200">  Most likely, you have already heard reports about Kotlin / Native at other mobile conferences.  This time there are two differences: Kotlin / Native can already be started to use, the <strong>author Kotlin / Native</strong> will confirm. <br><br>  <strong>Nikolai Igotti</strong> <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3616">will help you understand</a> the principles of the language, tell you how compilation issues, memory management and binders are solved, will show many real examples.  The report focuses more on <strong>development for iOS</strong> and Kotlin / Native, since this side of mobile development using Kotlin is less known to the general public.  In general, this is a great opportunity to elicit from the author his future plans and current life hacking. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Interviewing mobile developers.  Both sides of the barricades (15:00, October 8) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/pi/w4/fapiw48a9bt6tyhrbr3lwwo7ifc.png" alt="Alexander Cherny" align="left" width="200">  The head of mobile development at Pandao, <strong>Alexander Cherny,</strong> wants to <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3831">talk</a> about interviews, and the fact that mobile developers are not so important.  Often after them, the <strong>opinions of the interviewer and the candidate are</strong> very different.  Let's see why this happens, and let's talk how both of them are better prepared for the meeting. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Library development: from API to public release (5:00 pm, October 8) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/kb/kq/ggkbkqvkzwnyesrnyzpvytotrpu.png" alt="Asya Sviridenko" align="left" width="200">  <strong>Asya Sviridenko will</strong> devote us in particular to the development of a mobile library on the example of YandexSpeechKit.  Her <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3839">report</a> will be useful not only for <strong>developers of frameworks</strong> , but also for those who want to separate parts of their project into separate modules or share their best practices with other developers. <br><br>  Following the genuine stories from the life of YandexSpeechKit let's talk about the features and pitfalls when designing <strong>the library API</strong> .  We learn what to look for when writing code and testing, what <strong>post-production</strong> is waiting for a library developer, and much more.  Details in the <a href="https://youtu.be/QBc1MfqFh00">video invitation</a> from Asi, and in the end - a heart :) <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Design by Contract (10:00, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4p/zt/nr/4pztnrtc2t_anoywbw2z-tc0twa.png" alt="Graham lee" align="left" width="200">  <strong>Graham Lee is</strong> widely known in the iOS world, for example, for speeches and books about TDD, but the report on AppsConf will be universal and <strong>suitable for</strong> <strong>Android developers</strong> .  Graham explores how to properly design complex systems, take advantage of OOP, apply design to contracts.  Graham's <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3596">report</a> will be devoted to contracts, that is, descriptions of what this class does.  We learn how <strong>contracts help develop</strong> and be confident in the quality of the system design. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Breaking the Monolith @ Booking.com (10:00 am, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/na/9c/alna9cmvfgdtns3yhuo31bhtzqq.png" alt="Ishan khanna" align="left" width="200">  We all know about the benefits of a modular approach to the application architecture.  But it is necessary to take up the real sawing of the monolith, and everything turns out to be not so simple.  <strong>Ishan Khanna,</strong> in his <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3977">report</a> on AppsConf, tells how 60 Android developers on Booking.com fought with Legacy and eventually got a <strong>ten-fold speedup for the</strong> build. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  When SOLID is unsound (11:00, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/gp/91/bbgp91l6mim5dwz3wonxnxu-lxq.png" alt="Alexander Sychev" align="left" width="200">  <strong>Alexander Sychev</strong> plans to <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3740">discuss the</a> five basic principles of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> and the limits of their applicability.  After all, it is possible to say about each pattern or principle that its compliance does not guarantee the automatic correctness of the code, at the same time, its non-observance is a problem. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  How to write an Android application in one Activity (12:00, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/m-/ev/nlm-evlm5h10hfxkwdrjpdmrtg4.png" alt="Konstantin Tskhovrebov" align="left" width="200">  And, the main thing, why <strong>Konstantin Tskhovrebov</strong> from RedMadRobot <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3823">will tell</a> you to do this.  We find out what single-activity is better than multy-activity, and then we will understand the implementation details: <br><br><ul><li>  how to <strong>build DI scopes</strong> for optimal memory usage; <br></li><li>  how to <strong>build navigation</strong> , not to go crazy; <br></li><li>  how to handle deep-link'i; <br></li><li>  how to make a <strong>common BottomNavigationBar</strong> (and other common elements); <br></li><li>  how to divide the application into modules. <br></li></ul><br>  And other difficult moments. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  How to speed up the Internet or optimization of applications in mobile networks (14:00, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fq/no/gt/fqnogtjkwjhiwcxhnudkrxxp36o.png" alt="Alexander Tobol" align="left" width="200">  The report of <strong>Alexander Tobol</strong> from Odnoklassniki, as the name implies, will be devoted to the problems of applications in mobile networks.  Many developers accept the network as a given and do not optimize applications for a bad channel.  And Alexander‚Äôs <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3942">report</a> will suggest options for optimizing channel utilization, both by simple tuning of the <strong>TCP</strong> stack, and by complex ways of switching to <strong>UDP</strong> . <br>  Let us examine: <strong>Head-of-</strong> <strong>line</strong> <strong>blocking</strong> , forward error correction, <strong>fast</strong> <strong>retransmit</strong> <strong>vs</strong> <strong>negative</strong> <strong>ack</strong> , <strong>MTU</strong> <strong>discovery</strong> , IPMigration, packet pacer ... and many more details on the topic of video or photo transmission in an unstable network. <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Total integration of the application into the Google ecosystem (4 pm, 9 October) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/5m/pc/de5mpcdybpc62awdhgni2obltum.png" alt="Denis Neklyudov" align="left" width="200">  <strong>Denis Neklyudov</strong> (Lyft) <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3776">will tell</a> about the total integration of the application into the Google ecosystem: push-notifications in the application, interactive search <strong>results in the launcher, assistant and ‚ÄúShare‚Äù menu</strong> , actions in the contact book, your own action for the voice assistant, an app for WearOS watches , an <strong>application for Android TV</strong> - that is truly total! <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Mathematical Fundamentals Auto Layout (16:00, October 9) <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s5/ll/uq/s5lluqzwkmupumm0i0xx4gabcms.png" alt="Anton Sergeev" align="left" width="200">  Auto Layout is a <strong>very slow</strong> layout <strong>tool</strong> , while Apple continues to develop it and doesn‚Äôt seem to offer alternatives.  <strong>Anton Sergeyev</strong> from Yandex believes that if the technology seems counterintuitive, then you just need to sort out its internal structure in detail.  In the course of Anton‚Äôs <a href="http://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3695">report,</a> we will <strong>learn to understand Auto Layout</strong> .  We will understand what problem he solves and how he does it.  We will understand when it should not be used.  And most importantly, let's learn how to ‚Äúdesign constraints‚Äù, and not ‚Äúfit constraints to the answer.‚Äù <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h2>  Testing </h2><br>  As a retreat.  <strong>The competition for the reports was unreal</strong> , it took us several weeks to resolve all the contradictions.  It was necessary to make the program balanced, so, for example, I had to reject a lot of really cool testing topics.  It was very unfortunate, but taking one track entirely with testing was not part of our plans.  Maybe next time‚Ä¶ <br><br>  But this year, four speakers will talk about the importance of testing: <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3737">Xavier F. Gouchet</a> , <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3743">Dmitry Gryazin</a> , <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3768">Vladislav Alekseev</a> , and <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/abstracts/3590">Anton Malinsky</a> . <br><br>  In addition to reports, Vladislav and Anton, having enlisted the support of Android architect from Avito <strong>Dmitry Voronin</strong> , will organize a round table on October 9 at 15:00, where they will discuss UI testing and talk about the crutches that are found in their work. <br><br><h2>  Mitapas and activity </h2><br>  By the way, about mitapah!  <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/meetups">Mitap</a> is a cool format, so that in a more informal setting, not only come up with your own vision of the problem, but also immediately <strong>collect feedback</strong> .  Anyone can apply for a mitap, if there is still a free slot and the topic seems interesting to the participants, then for an hour you will have at your disposal an audience with a projector and a blackboard and interesting interlocutors to boot.  Dialog formats, trainings, holivars, workshops are welcome. <br><br>  I hope you could make a general impression, and now go to see the full version of the <a href="https://appsconf.ru/2018/schedule.html">schedule</a> .  There are already four streams, and all about mobile development! <br><br><blockquote>  See you soon! <br><br>  If you do not have tickets, then you will not lose them.  But you won‚Äôt lose tickets to AppsConf, so there‚Äôs nothing to decide here, you just need to <a href="https://conf.ontico.ru/conference/join/ac2018.html">book</a> . <br><br>  Look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MobileChannelRussia">YouTube channel</a> on mobile development to refresh past years in the memory and see what happens this time.  To be aware of everything at once: the program, transcripts, new videos - subscribe to the thematic <a href="http://eepurl.com/bOajmn">newsletter</a> . <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423295/</a></p>
