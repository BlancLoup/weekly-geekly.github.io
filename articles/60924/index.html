I will not give statistics, because statistics are different.  I would not like to talk about ideology, this inevitably leads to holivars.  Not getting into the server segment - people who deploy them are usually pretty good at imagining what they want from the OS.  With your permission, I will not touch on the topic of free of charge - it‚Äôs no secret that most users in Russia do not spend money on licensing.  Anyway, the topic is about people, not about systems.  I myself am a supporter of open source software and I try as much as I can to popularize it and help developers. <br><br>  A topic is an offer to Linux supporters together to think about why our operating systems are not as popular as other systems.

      So, Linux is relatively unpopular among casual users.  So there are objective reasons.  For myself, I broke them into several groups, which I described below.  The description of each cause consists of two points: the actual formulation and the solution visible to me. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  The reasons </h4><br><br><h5>  Historical </h5><br><br>  <b>Well-established view that Linux is very difficult</b> <br><br>  Five years ago, I really wanted to see what Linux is.  I was given a distribution on a CD, I started to install and wiped the entire hard drive.  With English then I was tight, I could not figure out the text installer.  After that, for three years I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the thought that it wasn‚Äôt for me, that I would never understand and there‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äústick my nose‚Äù into the world of open source operating systems.  Now everything is much simpler - and the localization is good, and the interfaces have become very friendly.  But people still believe that Linux is for specialists. <br><br>  For myself, I noticed that these are just fears, nothing more.  When a new person comes to work and it comes to computer skills, after the phrase ‚ÄúWe use Linux everywhere‚Äù, he immediately turns sour.  And then the most interesting.  From a certain moment I came up with such a ‚Äúsnag‚Äù.  Just ask, ‚ÄúDid you work with Windows?‚Äù.  The applicant immediately replies: "Yes, of course!".  If at that moment you smile and very confidently say, ‚ÄúAh, well, then you‚Äôll figure it out in Linux at once!‚Äù And quickly move on to another topic, then a person inevitably loses all fear!  It is interesting that the people to whom I spoke so (over the past year there were about 15 such people, more than half of them are women) really mastered very quickly and never (!) Addressed any problems.  Those who simply announced that they would have to work with Ubuntu, for example, experienced some discomfort in the first two or three days. <br><br>  <b>Under Linux there is not enough software</b> <br><br>  This is also very true in terms of historical retrospectives.  In those days when I easily and naturally wiped my hard drive, there were problems with the Internet - I was not studying in Moscow and I just had nowhere to get software.  Yes, and about the installation of his speech was not - in the dorm just did not have people who would deal with this issue.  But then, blanks with software under Windows were passed from hand to hand.  Now, of course, everything has become much easier. <br><br>  I see the most frightened eyes of people (it‚Äôs not about workstations anymore, but about home machines, of course) who go to forums on the software and see something like ‚ÄúYes, no problem, I updated the compiler and quickly source collected this tulza.  A little bit, of course, I had to correct the code, but everything works. ‚Äù  To get a person out of this stupor is obtained only by the phrase ‚ÄúOh, come on.  This programmers indulge in. "  Softly ask what kind of software is needed and ask ‚Äúover there, in the list‚Äù to tick off the necessary programs. <br><br><blockquote>  - Allocated?  Well, now make a button to apply. <br>  - Clicked. <br>  - Yeah.  Fine! <br>  - And where is the setup now run? <br>  - And all.  Everything is already settled ... <br>  - How so?  On the menu?  Well ka ... Well so ... this ... Ah * hut !!! </blockquote><br><br>  :) <br><br>  After that, the user himself will sit for a few hours and, periodically squeaking with delight, will install different software, which he will most likely never need.  But the myth about the lack of software and the complexity of the installation will be broken. <br><br>  <b>There are no games under Linux at all!</b> <br><br>  Of course there are games.  But not all.  And here, obviously, really weak point. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  User manny21 suggested a site with toys for the benefit of the community: <a href="http://igronomicon.org/top250">igronomicon.org/top250</a> <br><br><h5>  Socio-economic </h5><br><br>  <b>Pre-installed OS</b> <br><br>  It is for this reason that I use Linux only two years out of fifteen.  Indeed, why change something, if everything is so good.  No arguments here will help for the simple reason that Windows users are right!  Indeed, they are all good.  And do not float their technical details about any subjective merits / demerits.  They are happy, it is convenient to use Windows.  They are 100% right! <br><br>  In this issue of popularization (propaganda) one should play exclusively on such feelings as curiosity and ambition.  Thus, the weak side of Linux-systems can be turned into a strong motivator.  As if in the meantime, sitting by the fire with <s>an ax with a</s> guitar, tell a little about alternatives ("Come on, Vasya, are you kidding me or something? Is it true that you never come across? You are an experienced computer programmer - a hundred and five hundred years you go with computers") that without going into details.  On the most interesting moments (it is important to know what a person is interested in in terms of computers, what worries him) it is important to stop and promise to finish the story later (‚ÄúListen, we have started talking about something and running out of firewood. I‚Äôll go and run to the forest‚Äù).  Only in this way can a person be interested, then he himself will return to the conversation.  And already after he is interested, it will be possible to operate with logic, arguments and facts, I do not cause subconscious rejection. <br><br>  <b>Ties on business use of computers in small groups</b> <br><br>  In this case (especially in the regions) fear has a lot of weight.  A couple of examples with a smile about how ‚Äúwe were imprisoned / fined for pirated software in Moscow - they will soon be taken for you‚Äù and that‚Äôs all.  Familiar leader firmly crammed into a head feeling of fear.  He will surely appear on his face thoughtfulness.  At this point, as if to continue the conversation, complain that the licenses are expensive, ‚Äúthe bourgeoisie have completely become brutalized - they fight at exorbitant prices‚Äù.  Well, they say that there is an alternative, ‚Äúotherwise I don‚Äôt know how we would do business‚Äù and quickly turn to another topic.  Oddly enough, this technique works very well so far. <br><br>  <b>Lack of support</b> <br><br>  People do not want to be alone.  Feeling lonely literally kills.  It is important to make it clear to them that there will always be those who, if something happens, will come to them with no help.  And, of course, independently as far as possible to provide support (at least moral) to newcomers.  Show the community, help them not to close on their problems.  Otherwise, left alone, the user will get very sharp experiences subconsciously associated with alternative operating systems. <br><br>  A big role is also played by the feeling of involvement.  Many times already looked through on Habr√© of a battle between supporters of different OS.  But, for some reason, I have never seen any mention of this strongest argument.  I do not mean that everyone can remake the program for themselves.  I say that the need for creativity in varying degrees, is present in all people.  But Linux is the only operating system from the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù in the creation of which the user can take such direct participation!  This should never be forgotten. <br><br>  <b>Positioning</b> <br><br>  The most interesting and "delicious" moment.  I often notice for myself that I‚Äôm talking about Linux as a kind of ‚Äúalternative‚Äù OS (this topic doesn‚Äôt count, it‚Äôs all for the end :)) <br><br>  It is important to stop communicating with people to indicate the "alternativeness" of free software.  A priori set the tone of the discussion in the key of equality.  Follow the speech, mention Windows only as an alternative to other systems.  It will look natural if you are most firmly aware of this.  And for this you need to abandon the holivars once and for all, from the constant need to prove something to someone.  In general, I am not very clear about the recipe, if any of us have experience in creating images, in positioning, this will be a wonderful addition. <br><br><h5>  Technical </h5><br><br>  The group of technical reasons is the most objective.  It makes no sense to list them - just visit the lists of error reports and visit the brainstorming sites.  In part, it is the birth of precisely ‚Äúfree‚Äù open source software.  All people see problem solving in different ways, so unification and standardization become very difficult tasks.  This is one aspect of the problem that I see. <br><br><h4>  For a snack </h4><br><br>  I do not want the topic to be perceived as an attempt to form a guide to action or a statement of one‚Äôs own thoughts.  Opponents on both sides broke the mines already.  But I would be very interested to hear the opinions of people involved in open source software.  It seems that the exchange of opinions would be useful for all of us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60924/</a></p>
