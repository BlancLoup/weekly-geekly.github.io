  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A brief history of Connected Cars: what is considered ‚Äúconnected machines‚Äù and why the near future is not in drones?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cars became widespread at the beginning of the 20th century, but during this short time they managed to change drastically.  We are waiting for unmanned and flying cars, and connected cars equipped with the Internet, drive on the roads today.  This article presents a small series of translations of materials from free sources about the history of the emergence of such a phenomenon as "connected cars", plus some of our data on working in this market for 5 years - what solutions are available on new car models today and what to expect from cars with smart "stuffing" tomorrow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e16/46e/8e4/e1646e8e4605454781125547b6c318ed.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first cars connected can be considered <a href="http://ethw.org/The_Foundations_of_Mobile_and_Cellular_Telephony">cars with telephones</a> , the primitive models of which went to the streets of the USA in 1946.  Weighing more than 35 kilograms, with limited functionality, automobile telephones were originally used mainly by forwarding drivers, journalists and workers in the housing and utilities sector. <br><br>  The next stage in the history of the birth of the Connected Car market is the appearance of cruise control on board the car in 1958.  Cruise control was invented by the blind engineer <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/automobile-history-1991458">Ralph Tiitor</a> .  For the first time, the thought of him came to Tiitor during a trip by car with her lawyer.  The speed of the car changed suspiciously when the driver began to speak or listen to the interlocutor.  This annoyed Ralph, and he decided to create a device that would maintain the same speed to avoid accidents on the road.  In 1945, Ralph received a patent for his invention.  Among the choices of names, by the way, were 'Controlmatic', 'Touchomatic', 'Pressomatic' and 'Speedostat'.  In 1958, the automobile company `Chrysler` became interested in the invention of Ralph and offered it to its customers.

      In 1968, another breakthrough significant for the Connected Car market occurred - Volkswagen introduced the first on-board computer system with scanning capabilities in its fuel-powered models.  By the way, it was only in the late 90s - early 2000s that the installation of onboard systems became a prerequisite for all cars produced in the USA and Europe. <br><br>  A necessary element of the Connected Car is a stable communication channel.  Viewed from this point of view, the first ‚Äúconnected‚Äù car was created by General Motors in collaboration with Motorola Automotive.  The solution was called OnStar, it entered the US market in 1996.  When the OnStar system first became available as an option installed by the dealer, it was a discovery for the whole world.  Thanks to analog cellular, the system offered an unprecedented car connectivity that opened the door to innovations in security and IT. <br><br>  Today it is difficult to imagine, but GM had to develop its own telematics, as cellular networks were not reliable enough.  As a result, Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado cars were able to call emergency services in case of an accident. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e0c/028/570/e0c028570a184459a1122d3e42276f35.jpg"></div><br>  Without thinking twice, after GM, other auto companies began to use similar solutions, offering reliable emergency communications on premium car series. <br><br>  At the beginning of the XXI century began active use of GPS systems.  In principle, they have been available since the 1980s, but only in 2000 did they become more accurate, thanks to a bill that prohibited the military from scrambling satellite signals used by civilians. <br><br>  The next transition in evolution was not long in coming, and already in 2001 <br>  The first mobile phones were <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/about-us/our-history">connected to the car via Bluetooth</a> .  This stage opened the concept of a speakerphone via a mobile phone, and also marked the beginning of voice recognition technology. <br><br>  In 2003, for the first time, GM presented the opportunity to receive remote reports on the condition of the car, as well as access to the global data transmission network and digital navigation using not only GPS (by the way, satellite positioning appeared earlier than a permanent connection ‚Äî back in 1995 on Oldsmobile cars ), but also data downloaded from the Internet. <br><br>  With the development of cellular technologies, since 2007, automakers have begun one after another to build telematics systems into their vehicles that use only data transmission channels of cellular operators. <br><br>  In 2008, wi-fi first appeared on board cars.  Initially, the solution was developed for trucks to support communication with the head office.  And in the summer of 2014, Audi became the first car manufacturer to integrate a 4G LTE module into the car to ensure the operation of automation, while also providing passengers with high-speed Internet access via Wi-Fi. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2c4/537/b12/2c4537b1206149ef8508626e2afacfdf.jpg"></div><br><h2>  What is a connected car? </h2><br>  Given the history of the development of this class of technology, it is not surprising that at different times the phrase "connected car" carried a different semantic load.  Is it possible to consider the connected car in which the telephone is installed to communicate with the rescue service?  Certainly, 20 years ago it was so, but today the situation has changed. <br><br>  Perhaps it can be said that a connected car is a vehicle that communicates with other cars and devices, networks and services covering an extensive infrastructure, including your home and office.  Therefore, many experts believe that a connected car is an element of the Internet of Things ecosystem.  That is, albeit a complex, but another device that independently transmits and receives data. <br><br>  The basis of automotive intelligence is the head module, which collects data on the technical condition and "communicates" with the various components of the vehicle.  This can be a built-in TCU (Telematic Control Unit) or a compact dongle that is connected to the OBD-2 connector. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e5/310/e40/3e5310e40fb0450c80b83804a584bc1f.jpg"></div><br>  Embedded modules do not currently have a single standard, and usually they are part of an embedded computer, while each automaker has its own hardware and software stuffing. <br><br><h2>  Types of connected services </h2><br>  What gives the driver a car connection?  He can receive notifications about traffic congestion, information about accidents on his route, as well as weather reports in real time.  But these are basic things.  In the development stage are now listed warning system for leaving the oncoming lane.  They will warn both the driver himself - if he accidentally left for the "oncoming lane" - and other road users.  The same systems will allow drivers to "look" around the turn. <br><br>  The routing of the routes themselves in the connected cars is carried out according to the user's habits, as well as his schedule.  In the morning on a weekday, the system itself will offer the best route to the office, taking into account traffic, and in the evening it will remind you that you need to stop by the grocery store.  Moreover, if the car is a hybrid, the system will analyze the route and plan the use of battery energy, taking into account the terrain, in order to guarantee thrust on the climbs, saving fuel, and quietly recharge the battery on the slopes. <br><br>  In general, the ‚Äúconnected‚Äù functions can be divided into five large categories - security, navigation, information and entertainment, diagnostics and payments.  And here is a list of those functions that we have not yet mentioned. <br><br><h3>  Navigation services </h3><br>  The possibilities of the connected cars allow, for example, to inform the driver that gasoline is running out and at the same time to suggest the way to the nearest gas station.  Or, at the driver's request, look for the nearest hotel or cafe.  Due to the Internet access in the car, you can stream online or inform the user about a variety of events - talk about the weather or traffic situation. <br><br>  Navigation systems of modern cars is not just a map with satellite positioning.  They are complemented by various traffic information and data from other road users.  For example, if the car owner is visiting, the system will be able to recommend him when it is better to go home so as not to get stuck in traffic jams.  The navigator can also automatically send messages about its arrival to colleagues and friends. <br><br><h3>  Diagnostics </h3><br>  Thanks to the intelligent remote diagnostics functions, the vehicle can inform the driver about the need for maintenance or repair of a particular unit.  Technologies BigData potentially allow to conduct predictive diagnostics, by various parameters determining which nodes can fail in the near future. <br><br><h3>  Payments </h3><br>  Among the potential possibilities of connected cars is automatic payment for parking upon arrival at it.  To do this, in most cases, you only need to install the appropriate application on the onboard computer. <br><br>  The concept continues to evolve, and some vendors are already offering the opportunity to pay for ‚Äúthrough the car‚Äù other products and services, such as gasoline. <br><br>  Of course, services are personified.  The system automatically recognizes the driver by voice or driving style and adjusts to it, including music from your favorite channel or by reading the appropriate selection of news.  The system also monitors the style of movement and can give advice on safety and fuel economy. <br><br><h2>  Future connected cars </h2><br>  This summer we announced a new development - <a href="https://remoto.com/ai-services/">Connected Car services</a> based on Artificial Intelligence.  The main task that the Bright Box team wanted to solve was the prediction of the likelihood of a visit (to MOT) to the dealer.  This information is required for dealers most, as people usually pass only the first MOT and do not return to the official dealer.  We used data that made it possible for each of the cars to predict the likelihood that a driver would call at a dealership on a certain day, as well as determine the likelihood of their arrival at a particular dealership. <br><br>  In addition, the team identified drivers by driving style and vehicle use, in order to recommend the most appropriate accessories, car or next visit, to their drivers.  For example, if a driver aggressively rides at night, it is worth the time to advise him to change tires.  And if the motorist moved out of town, then you can offer him a new crossover car. <br><br>  Thus, we enable dealers to provide a personal consultant for each client in the form of an intelligent application.  At the same time, the auto show will be able to multiply sales and quality of service. <br><br>  PS If you are inspired by the topics of Big Data and AI related to the automotive industry, we will be glad to see you in our team.
