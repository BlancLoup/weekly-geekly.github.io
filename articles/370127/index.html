  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where crayfish winter: what is oncreening</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  People are all different, but if you look globally, we have the same problems and cancer is one of them.  If it is not in your life, you are a very happy person, but the Universe is wider than your perception.  This is not just a disease - it is a phenomenon that today represents one of the main life challenges.  On the other hand, if this problem has affected you or your loved ones, you should not assume that the world is unfair to you personally.  Unfortunately, all this really happens.  Salvation lies in an adequate perception of reality.  Causes of cancer for non-biologists and how to avoid it - in the new material Genotek. <br><br><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7309/9235018153_cd1bab0fff_b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  To live well in Russia </h3><br>  Our population has a rather low life expectancy.  On the WHO website there is an infographics about the oncological situation by countries.  So, in Russia, the average man dies at 63, and the woman at 75 *.  Instead of cynical comments about the retirement age, we compare these figures with statistics in other countries: Canada - 80 and 84, Switzerland - 81 and 85, Belarus - 67 and 78, Japan - 80 and 87, India - 64 and 68, Uzbekistan - 67 and 72 (average life expectancy of men and women, respectively).  In general, the eternal question of Nekrasov can be answered like this: in Russia, on average, it is not good for everyone to live, but not for long (in particular, for cancer patients). <br><br><h3>  Facts and Figures </h3><br>  If you conduct a small study of WHO data, you can find an unpleasant fact: over 2014, over 300 thousand people or 0.23% of the population died of cancer in Russia (as if Cherepovets or Vladikavkaz were destroyed at the same time).  WHO refers Russia to the group of high-income countries, equating it to Canada, Switzerland and Japan.  In its group, our country is not the leader in the number of deaths.  Of the countries considered closer, Japan is ahead of Russia, where this gloomy figure is 0.28%.  In addition, there is another parameter - the number of radiotherapy units per 1 million inhabitants.  In Japan, it is 7.2 against 2.3 - in Russia.  Perhaps a high percentage of cancer deaths in Japan is associated not so much with the possibilities of medicine as with longevity.  The longer people live, the more mutations they accumulate.

    <h3>  Likbez faceless </h3><br>  Looking at other countries, one cannot say that it is much simpler with this.  There is one major difference - in relation to their own health and to the perception of cancer as a diagnosis.  Perhaps it would be healthier to live if we had a program to eradicate onco-illiteracy (as in South Australia *).  Some may notice that there is no hole in the ozone layer over Russia and there is nothing to be popularized with cancer.  Meanwhile, so that everyone knows what cancer is, how it develops and how to diagnose it in its early stages, it is important to explain this in advance in a clear and simple language.  Awareness can save time and nerves, as well as reduce the popularity of phenomena in the spirit of ‚Äútreating cancer with ordinary soda‚Äù *. <br><br><h3>  Conscience </h3><br>  When we talk about a healthy lifestyle, this refers not to some mythical ‚Äúideal self‚Äù, but to how we take care of ourselves in reality.  Awareness of oneself ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù leads to the fact that it is not necessary to look for any arguments in order not to get drunk or drink alcohol regularly until the liver cirrhosis whistles.  The same awareness leads to the fact that you do not need to bargain with yourself for "one more small piece" of sausage - you can simply not eat it.  Let's add to this list the rules in the spirit of "no smoking", "not sunbathe".  However, this should not take on the shade of the game.  It is always important to realize that the regular presence of alcohol or its decay products in the body provokes the production of reactive oxygen species, that products with an unknown composition have an unknown effect on the body, which, by subjecting your skin to excessive UV exposure, can increase the risk of mutations, just as with frequent inhaled hot smoke. <br><br><h3>  New program of action </h3><br>  It is said that rules and attitudes that begin with ‚Äúnot‚Äù are destructive.  For example, in addition to the slogans ‚Äúwe will not allow‚Äù and ‚Äúwe will not allow‚Äù, a political program must contain positive statements.  On the other hand, WHO scientists consider smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity (lack of physical activity), obesity, and the use of solid fuels in the household (for example, firewood) to be the main risk factors for cancer in adulthood.  The basic level of cancer control is limiting risk factors.  The next level is positive affirmations. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Put a vaccine against cancer.</b>  Women need to be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus.  In 2008, Harald zur Hausen was awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering the ‚Äúvirus causing cervical cancer‚Äù.  A cancer vaccine is available in Russia. </li><li>  <b>Know what to eat.</b>  The dietary guidelines are very simple: eat 8 servings (about 800 grams) of fruits and vegetables per day and calculate the daily fluid intake (35 ml of water per kilogram of body weight).  The point is not what form you want to maintain, but that it makes you feel better.  Balanced nutrition and maintaining a body mass index in the normal range makes life much easier. </li><li>  <b>Understand the body from the inside.</b>  Everyone is responsible for himself.  It doesn't matter where you live and who you work, your health is your responsibility.  It is necessary to undergo regular examinations and screenings - this information should always be relevant.  You can also recall the genetic test for susceptibility to cancer.  Since DNA is stable and does not change during life, it is enough to pass such an analysis only once. </li></ul><br><h3>  Looking for tumor markers </h3><br>  And although in developed countries, cancer treatment is attempted to be made available to the public, preventive diagnostics are much cheaper.  Good examples of early cancer detection programs exist in the UK and the USA.  The first is the detection of tumor markers in the analysis of biological samples.  Blood, urine and feces are regularly checked in laboratories to ensure that when a protein, which is usually present in the environment of cancerous tumors, is found, it is immediately turned to screening diagnostics. <br><br><h3>  Cancer screening: what and how </h3><br>  The main cancer screening methods, the availability of which is monitored by WHO, are aimed at detecting cervical cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer.  For the diagnosis of each proposed two methods.  Cervical cancer can be diagnosed in two ways, but only one so-called Pap test is available in Russia - analysis of cervical epithelium cells (it can be combined for human papillomavirus analysis using the protocol).  The second type of analysis recommended by WHO, but not available in Russia, is the primary screening for cervical cancer with acetic acid.  If when applying acetic acid spots of a different color appear, this indicates neoplasms.  Diagnosis of breast cancer involves breast palpation for seals and annual mammography.  Colorectal cancer is found by the fecal immuno-chemical test (search for blood in the feces) or colonoscopy.  All other screening methods, in accordance with the WHO information, are available under the MHI program.  There are guidelines for the <a href="https://www.guideline.gov/browse/clinical-specialty">frequency of screenings</a> .  This is, of course, a personal matter for everyone, but it is reasonable to follow these valuable directions. <br><br><h3>  Genetic test to the masses </h3><br>  In Switzerland, the mass launch of a genetic diagnosis of cancer has not shown adequate results.  It is important to understand that when it comes to a multifactorial disease like cancer, after analyzing a pair of genes, it is difficult to say for sure about the predisposition to develop the disease.  Mass screening, on the other hand, implies a standardized screening procedure.  The number of test points should be small, and the result should be unambiguous.  Currently, the mass service of this level is not available.  You have to save yourself.  A personal DNA test made in Russia makes it possible to identify a predisposition to certain diseases, and recommendations for specific examinations are available online. <br><br><h3>  20 years of free time </h3><br>  Russia, like the whole world, is in the future, but, unfortunately for its citizens, the risk of the disease is still great, and opportunities are limited.  Attention to the history of diseases of your family, interest in modern research, correction of your lifestyle and awareness of your own genetic features allow you to go beyond 65 years of life, and who knows what awaits then!  However, if up to 65 people live consciously, then, most likely, they will continue to live like this in the future.  Unlike a healthy diet and regular physical exertion, the <a href="https://www.genotek.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3Dcancerdiagn%26utm_medium%3Dgeek">DNA test does not cure, but gives information</a> .  After analyzing the results together with the geneticist and consciously following all the recommendations, you can protect yourself from the disease, and then come up with something to do for another 20 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370127/</a></p>
