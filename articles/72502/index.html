      <b>Instagib</b> is a Teeworlds mod, a feature of which is that, using a laser gun, you can kill the enemy with one hit.  Blaster rays can bounce off walls.  In the new versions you can perform laserjamps - jumps with the help of a laser, which give the player a noticeable acceleration or just a high jump. <br><br>  This is an unofficial game mod (like everyone else), but many people think that it would always be :).  Most often, it is played in the DM and CTF modes.  This is one of the few mods for which people unite into separate clans and completely forget about the classic gameplay.  He is criticized for learning how to play it well is not so difficult, and beginners immediately begin to play the game.  ;) For this and other reasons, some professional players have a negative opinion about instagib.  Despite criticism, instagib is the most popular mod for Teeworlds, it hosts championships and other competitions. <br><br>  Next, consider the <b>Flagball</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f4/8c3/450/4f48c3450198607f5ffbcf6559774a08.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Flagball</b> - modeweeworlds, the main purpose of which is to score a flag (yes, yes, precisely to score) at another gate. <br><br>  For this mod, special symmetrical cards are drawn, each team has its own goal, where the players of the other team are trying to score a ball (aka the flag).  There are two ways to score the ball.  One way is to raise the ball (flag) and hit it with the left mouse button.  Another way is to jump into the gates of the enemy with a flag and sacrifice yourself for the team.  It is also possible to transfer the flag to another player with the right mouse button.  For fun, this mod is also combined with instagib. <br><br>  Also very popular <b>Run</b> mod. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1c/44e/50f/f1c44e50fc4db98aa4be0c7300cd8d87.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Run</b> - Teeworlds mod, the main purpose of which as soon as possible to pass a certain route.  During the game, the players most often have only one type of weapon, the rakenica, and it serves to perform rocket jumps (jumping with grenades).  Players can not kill or even somehow interfere with each other.  There are many cards for this mode.  The very first maps were pretty easy, but now they even came up with maps for pair passing.  When creating maps for this mod, authors often use death tiles and teleportation tiles to prevent players from speeding through the map.  The best results are stored on the server to create competition :) <br><br>  And I want to mention <b>Survival</b> mod, which I really like.  :) <br><br>  <b>Survival</b> is a mod based on TDM mode, but in one round players can die only once and they have a limited number of rounds. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/0910/07/ab369b2bd35ft.jpg"></div><br><br>  Killed players are automatically transferred to the spectators team.  The team that left the surviving players wins the game.  This mod is very interesting to play, since the limited amount of ammunition available shows the player‚Äôs true skills.  When playing this mod, people are accustomed to rely more on their skills and weapons than on card control. <br><br>  Most recently, the <b>Zombie</b> mod appeared, the gameplay of which is like that of the Left4Dead gameplay.  Players need to fight off attacks tee-zombie bots.  With each wave of attack, they are stronger and stronger.  There are several types of zombies: just bots with hammers, hooks with hammers, zombies with pistols, etc. <br><br>  New interesting fashion appear very often, which can not but rejoice the players.  If possible, I will try to acquaint you with them, Tolsi =). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72502/</a></p>
