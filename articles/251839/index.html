Last week came out: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/251179/">As a well-meaning person, you can lose an intelligent person or a little about delegation.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/251431/">How to recognize the manipulation and quickly neutralize them</a> </li></ul><br>  And today it's time to talk about goal setting.  We asked our good friend Philip Guzenyuk, a famous business coach and author of the project ‚ÄúHappiness in Activity‚Äù to write an article.  And this is what came of it: <br><br><h4>  7 ways of ‚Äúimpregnation‚Äù goal: how to set goals to achieve them (Philip Guzeniuk, partner of the Coaching Institute (SPb)) </h4><br>  What is impregnation purpose?  This is the process of transferring a goal from the state of ‚Äúyes, there is a goal‚Äù or ‚Äúa cool idea !!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish I had !!‚Äù to the state ‚ÄúI know it will be‚Äù. <br><br>  As a result of impregnation with the goal, it ‚Äúbecomes a part of me,‚Äù ‚Äúfalls from the head into the body,‚Äù begins to be felt as ‚Äúmine,‚Äù the world begins to ‚Äúlead me to the goal,‚Äù comes the ‚Äúnecessary opportunities‚Äù and an iron confidence arises, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how, but I know EXACTLY - it will be.

      The psychologist would say that the goal goes from the conscious level to the subconscious and turns into a filter of our perception. <br><br>  Every man is like a whale.  As a whale passes plankton through its whiskers, so we pass the world through the filters of our needs, values, beliefs, goals, and select the necessary information from it. <br><br>  Saturated with the goal, we begin subconsciously, naturally and without any effort to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù the world around us in the presence of opportunities to achieve it.  And it seems to us that they come as if by themselves. <br><br>  Any accidents turn into signs that suggest something valuable about how to achieve the goal.  ‚ÄúNecessary people‚Äù, whom we would not have noticed before, begin to ‚Äúappear‚Äù and help us, etc ... <br><br>  Do you understand what I'm talking about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2006, I completed a two-year course at the Coaching Institute in St. Petersburg.  Very serious program.  All grown-up - 24 full two-day training for 2 years.  And, of course, work with goals took one of the leading places in this program. <br><br>  We learned to set goals for ourselves.  Help your customers set goals.  Set goals personal and goals workers.  Set goals for individuals, for project teams and for entire companies.  There was a lot of practice. <br><br>  When I started working with clients, I noticed that a person can formulate an excellent goal, it will inspire him.  He will be delighted.  He will try to do something.  But in the end, this goal "does not take root," will remain in the category of hotelkeepers or unrealized dreams. <br><br>  Each surgeon has his own graveyard.  After a series of unsuccessful experiences, it became very interesting why this is happening, why people give up their goals.  It turned out there are 3 reasons. <br><br>  First, life is like this - some goals simply do not come true. <br><br>  Secondly, some goals were not set correctly, did not take into account the psychology of a person, his capabilities, the context of his life. <br><br>  Thirdly ... (and this was the most important point), people did not organize for themselves the right period for impregnation with a goal.  People set a goal as something immutable, fixed in their business plan (sacred tables), and did not allow themselves to adapt to it, soak up this goal, correct it and modify it according to the reality surrounding them. <br><br>  Then I began to pay more attention to the period that follows the goal setting.  He began to look for ways not only to formulate a goal, but to make it so that it becomes ‚Äúnative‚Äù with the maximum probability.  In practice, I realized that the task is not only to thrust a seedling into the ground, but also to provide the young tree with the proper care: watering, sunlight, heat, and nutrients. <br><br>  As with gardening, there are no 100% ready-made recipes.  It all depends on a large number of factors, but there are a number of technologies and approaches that have shown their effectiveness over the years of further work. <br><br>  Here are seven such approaches that you can do yourself without the help of a personal consultant. <br><br>  <b>How to soak up the goal?</b> <br><br>  There are many ways - here are seven of them that seem most interesting and fit different people. <br><br><h5>  Method 1: "The Effect of the Refrigerator" </h5><br>  A friend of mine from Samara said that for many years he had been writing out all his goals in short formulations, hanging them on a refrigerator, and they magically come true. <br><br>  2 years ago I tried it.  I did it too.  The financial goal of increasing revenues by 3 times has become a reality in six months.  Since then, I always use the "effect of the refrigerator" to work with goals. <br><br>  What should be done? <br><br>  To write down your goal briefly, in a positive (without not), with a specific date, in the present tense - as if it had already become a reality. <br><br>  Hang it on the fridge. <br><br>  Reread the text before each opening and closing of the refrigerator - so you also lose weight - a joke!  Reread the text so often is not necessary :) <br><br>  Why it works, I don‚Äôt know, but the feeling is: when the goal is just written on a piece of paper and lies somewhere in the table, there is insecurity inside - ‚Äúeither there is‚Äù, ‚Äúwhether there is no‚Äù, but when on the refrigerator - it is REINFORCED!  ‚ÄúI know for sure - I have such a goal!‚Äù Some kind of life-affirming clarity and confidence appears - you are soaked with a goal. <br><br>  Frequently asked - "can not the refrigerator?".  It is possible, but the fridge is still safer :)) <br><br><h5>  Method 2: ‚ÄúEnter Image‚Äù </h5><br>  This method is about right now ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù those who have already achieved this goal.  Enter the image as the actors do. <br><br>  What for? <br><br>  From the state of ‚ÄúI am already there,‚Äù you start acting accordingly and get the corresponding results.  You, as it were, tune in to the way of thinking, the course of action of the person who successfully achieved the goal. <br><br>  How to do it? <br><br>  TIME: In detail, in colors, imagine that you have already reached your goal. <br><br>  They have already grown amazing zucchini in the garden of their new home, have already climbed to Everest, have already passed on a black belt for cross-stitch embroidery, etc ... <br><br>  What does this look like?  What does it look like?  How will you behave?  How to dress?  Who to communicate with?  What items will appear in your daily life? <br><br>  TWO: find the little things, small details that will help you get into the image, get into the role.  Choose something that can be easily reproduced for yourself here and now. <br><br>  Inexpressibly beautiful chopper for the garden, a nickel-plated safety hook, a new set of sewing needles ‚Äî anything that will fill you with feeling ‚Äî ‚ÄúI've already done it.‚Äù <br><br>  THREE: Organize for yourself these small attributes now and rehearse your behavior in the state of "I have already achieved the goal."  Play it like a game, try on like a costume. <br><br><h5>  Method 3: Draw your goal </h5><br>  This method is suitable for those who think in images and likes to draw pictures.  You need to create a visual image - a drawing, a picture, a collage of your goal or a bunch of goals for the next year. <br><br>  Use your favorite materials - colored pencils, felt-tip pens, oil, gouache, clippings from your favorite magazines, photo collage in Photoshop.  A small sculptural group of favorite items will also work. <br><br>  Anything that helps you create a bright, meaningful image of the goal.  The task is to make the picture make you happy. <br><br>  And remember !!!  This is just a game - you as a child build your goal from cubes or draw it on a piece of paper. <br><br>  Well, if your art object then takes some prominent place in the house, so that you can periodically return to it and add or change some detail. <br><br><h5>  Method 4: "Team Allies" </h5><br>  This way is for those who like to discuss everything with friends.  For those who understand: we are not separate islands in this world ocean - we are all interconnected. <br><br>  To soak up the goal, you need to tell about it in colors to several acquaintances.  Three to five people - for a start, a very good amount. <br><br>  First you should choose the people who will support you.  If not actively and actively, then at least a kind word or just listen without criticism.  Having communicated with several people, you will feel that your goal is ‚Äústrong‚Äù, overgrown with details and details, filled with different points of view. <br><br>  After that, you can, if you want, go to the second level of the game.  Share your goal with those who will certainly criticize it.  Share with them in a playful way: ‚ÄúWell, find 10 reasons why this is complete nonsense, absolutely not possible and will never work!‚Äù <br><br>  And collect their criticisms and arguments "against."  Moreover, you can actively encourage them, saying: "Well, yes, well, yes, this is certainly a reasonable argument, but something more substantial is needed." <br><br>  Your task is to be silent, breathe and wind all this on a mustache.  Get your food for thought and turn the arguments "against" into a crash test for your goal: dismiss something, take something into account, think about something, somewhere - correct the goal. <br><br><h5>  Method 5: Collect "piggy bank signs" </h5><br>  This game is a bit like a drawing of a goal, but there is a significant difference.  The thing here is not in a beautiful picture, but in a magical search. <br><br>  How to organize it? <br><br>  The coming week is declared a "magic week."  From this point on, everything that happens to you is a hint.  Advice from the "good world" regarding your goal.  Your task is to be attentive and thoughtful student - that is, to collect and decipher all the clues and signs that the world sends you. <br><br>  Someone can do this in the form of a goal diary, fixing all the tips and details in it, someone will collect the same pictures, someone will discuss the signs with friends, colleagues, a loved one. <br><br>  Any ways that are comfortable for you are good.  The essence of the idea is to carefully listen to the world, finding the necessary clues, as in a quest, and thus strengthen and grow your goal. <br><br><h5>  Method 6: "Focus of attention" </h5><br>  The point here is to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù reality through the ‚Äúsieve‚Äù of your goal. <br><br>  What do we have to do? <br><br>  Find calm and relaxed 5 minutes: a morning cup of something hot, daily evening planning, first minutes at the desk, a moment before a morning jog or exercise, time while the car is warming in the yard. <br><br>  And start a tradition in these 5 minutes to re-read your goal and just reflect a little on it.  Maybe some ideas will come to achieve it, the wording may be adjusted, maybe you look at your past or starting day differently. <br><br>  Everything is fine here - in any case, your calm impregnation will be the goal.  You are not in a hurry - you have a whole year ahead. <br><br><h5>  Method 7: "Test Drive" </h5><br>  Another way to impregnate the goal is to start acting. <br><br>  Take the first small steps: write a plan to achieve the goal, collect the necessary information on the Internet, talk to people who can help. <br><br>  There are people who always carry out a test drive of their goal first: ‚Äúset a goal that you like - find a way to start moving towards it within 24 hours, take a few steps, try -‚Äú goes or does not go ‚Äù,‚Äú yours or not yours. " <br><br>  Thus, in just a few hours, you can get that clarity about a goal that you won‚Äôt get in half a year of thinking - ‚Äúis mine not mine?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo it or not?‚Äù. <br><br>  Which of these methods to choose? <br><br>  The one you want!  The one that likes, the one that ‚Äúsmiles‚Äù to you. <br><br>  Seriously, your smile is the best hint for choosing the impregnation method. <br><br>  If any of them makes you have a burning desire to take and make, directly ask for the job, his darling and take it. <br><br>  This should be more likely not another point of the plan: ‚Äúin the market to buy potatoes, carrots, fish, the cat should not be forgotten, after dinner, soak in order‚Äù.  Rather, it should be an interesting game that you don‚Äôt need to remind yourself of, something that ‚Äúwarms‚Äù you. <br><br>  In the impregnation goal, experiments are welcome - create your own unique cocktail, your mix, your vinaigrette from the methods listed in this article and spice it up with your own ingredients. <br><br><h5>  What should I do right now? </h5><br>  You can use the ‚Äúimpregnation goal‚Äù methods described in this article yourself in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife. <br><br>  If you have a previous task - the task to formulate your goals in a qualitative manner - come to the workshop ‚ÄúMy goals 2015: how to set the right goals for the year‚Äù. <br><br>  We will talk about how to correctly formulate your goals.  Right during the presentation, you will be able to carry out an initial elaboration of your goal for the year and draw up a draft version of the ‚Äútarget slide‚Äù for 2015. <br><br>  In the program of the report: <br><br>  1. An integrated approach and 4 main dimensions when setting a goal for the year: how to take into account all the necessary ingredients in order for the goal to be lively, understandable and sustainable. <br><br>  2. Google's OKR approach: how to formulate motivating and at the same time maximally specific goals. <br><br>  3. Examples and case studies from the leading practice: what works and what does not - what mistakes are important to avoid when setting a goal. <br><br>  In the program of the report: 15% of the theory and 85% of examples from life and work with your real situation. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://stratoplan.ru/proskills/">I want to become a member of the workshop ‚ÄúMy goals 2015: how to set the right goals for a year‚Äù (PRO + SKILLS online conference) &gt;&gt;</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251839/</a></p>
