  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell PowerEdge Solutions for Movie Content Provider</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the pages of our blog, we talk about cooperation with a variety of companies and organizations - from local online stores to world-famous universities.  Alas, the majority of such cases describe working with foreign partners, but sometimes there are interesting examples in Russia.  Today is such a case.  The hero of our new story is the <a href="http://www.cinelab.ru/">company CineLAB</a> , which is engaged in the rental of film-making equipment, film processing, digital post-production, satellite delivery of video content and many other interesting tasks in the "cinema" world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c22/35b/d30/c2235bd3002140dea0ba0ba7bdff9bf8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CineLAB delivers digital content to hundreds of cinemas across Russia.  The company sends data via satellite communication to its server located in the client‚Äôs cinema, and only then this data is transferred to the client video server for broadcast.  Needless to say, CineLAB equipment should always be in working condition - otherwise the company runs the risk of permanently spoiling relations with a partner.  Any instability can lead to a breach of contract and huge losses, and in the longer term - damaged reputation and weakening of positions in the market.  The head of CineLAB's IT department, Anton Torkunov, admits that the company has a very balanced approach to the choice of providers of server solutions - too much depends on them. <br><br>  When it was time to upgrade the IT infrastructure to CineLAB, Anton decided to seek help from Dell.  Both companies have previously collaborated and even deployed Dell PowerEdge server solutions in Russian cinemas.  The productivity of the machines and the service support of Dell Anton and his team were completely satisfactory, but it was necessary to get acquainted with the proposals of competitors.  There were not so many of them: the only sensible alternative was the Supermicro solution, but after analyzing the relationship between performance and price, the choice was obvious.  As a result, the IT department of CineLAB stopped at Dell servers.

      The equipment, which was installed in Russian cinemas, included Dell PowerEdge R520 and R580 servers with Intel Xeon processors.  They fully provided all the needs of client cinemas, had sufficient performance and had all the necessary options.  The PowerEdge R520 guaranteed excess input and output bandwidth for demanding applications, and the PowerEdge R580 offered up to 3 TB of scalable memory.  Anton Torkunov notes: ‚ÄúWhen we first started using Dell PowerEdge servers, we were guided only by the recommendations of a company called Smartjog, a supplier of systems for the secure transfer of content via satellite communications.  I have to admit that we are grateful to her: for two years of using Dell PowerEdge solutions, we were able to significantly increase the volume of data transfer. ‚Äù <br><br>  In addition to server performance, CineLAB also appreciates Dell‚Äôs support.  The company provides several package services: ProSupport Plus, which offers server maintenance from the first day of operation, as well as the Next Business Day Onsite Service for repairing and replacing hardware.  CineLAB's IT department communicates directly with Dell‚Äôs technical account manager, whose task is to minimize server downtime and help the client.  Anton Torkunov notes the flexibility of Dell technical support and the willingness to offer the best service package that would meet the specifics of the CineLAB business.  Working with one technical account manager allows you to carefully monitor the time of server prevention: each specialist is ‚Äúattached‚Äù to a specific client and creates a thoughtful schedule of maintenance and other work as part of technical support. <br><br>  Today, CineLAB continues to expand data transfer services - and not without the help of Dell technology.  The company managed to establish strong relationships with customers and sign several new agreements with other Russian cinemas.  The market is aware of the high quality of CineLAB services and the performance of their servers that store the data transmitted via satellite.  Thanks to Dell, the company provides customers with reliable equipment and high-quality service.  Not surprisingly, CineLAB partners are pleased with the cooperation. <br><br>  Regardless of the location of the client, the company can promptly provide technical support.  This is a very important condition, especially for Russian cinemas - do not forget about the size of the country.  When customers see that the location does not matter to obtain the proper level of service, it becomes almost the decisive factor in concluding a partnership agreement.  The Dell Next Business Day Onsite Service program is ready to provide timely server maintenance at any cinema in the country. <br><br>  Another important advantage of the Dell service is a convenient system for monitoring all repair and maintenance activities - the account manager of the support service prepares a monthly report and sends it to the IT department of CineLAB.  The report provides information on all incidents that occurred with Dell servers in a month, analyzes their consequences and time spent on resolving.  In addition, the support service keeps records of the equipment and promptly provides information on the duration of its guarantee.  This allows you to make the work of the IT department more efficient. <br><br>  In the near future, CineLAB plans to expand cooperation with Dell and deploy storage facilities to support other areas - post-production and color correction.  One of these solutions should be a hybrid platform Dell Compellent SC4020 with the option of storing data in flash memory.  Without false modesty, we want to state that a wide range of Dell solutions will easily help the company to hold positions in the market and gain the trust of partners.  And the case of CineLAB confirms this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251949/</a></p>
