      <b>Obama's shoe</b> <br>  Are you able to make Barack Obama come up with a boot on his head?  This was demanded by the hacker group <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec">LulzSec</a> , which consistently hacked the servers of the CIA, Sony, the police of Arizona and the British Organized Crime Control Department - SOCA.  After the 50-day experiment, the guys from LulzSec ‚Äî a few teenagers ‚Äî declared self-dissolution.  They did it for the sake of laughter.  Whether it is fashionable for presidents to wear shoes on their heads, if more serious people take up such attacks, Jerry Gamblin will tell in his report ‚ÄúWhat We Can (and Should) Learn from LulzSec‚Äù.  Jerry is an information security officer at the Missouri House of Representatives. <br><br>  <b>"Key" speaker of the forum</b> <br>  We remind you that David Blaine of cryptography and Mick Jagger of information security <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/137030/">Bruce Schneier</a></b> will speak at PHDays-2012 for the first time in Russia.

Bruce Schneier is the founder of Counterpane Internet Security, the head of the information security service at <a href="http://www.bt.com/">British Telecom</a> , the author of dozens of ciphers and six books, including the bestseller ‚ÄúApplied Cryptography‚Äù translated into Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ea/efc/73b/6eaefc73bf7a9989669bb8c39b733cb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Not all printers are equally useful.</b> <br>  While blondes drag the printer from corner to corner when their computer "does not see the printer," hackers use printers to see your network from a completely new angle.  In recent years, PostScript penetration has become quite a popular way of hacking among Internet cybercriminals.  In some cases, the PostScript file injects a Trojan program or a virus into the system, in others, it sends secret data through TCP port 80. <b>Andrei Kostin</b> will tell about these and other non-standard printing device capabilities in the report ‚ÄúPostScript: Danger ahead! / Hacking MFPs, PCs and beyond ...
