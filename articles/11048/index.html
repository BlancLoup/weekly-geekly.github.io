      <br>
      In 2003, the company was closed, despite the fact that there were customers and a startup began to "earn." <br><br>  The year 2003 was hard, and it was difficult for an un-specialized professional to find a job. <br>  And then the thought occurred to me ... my house is located near the highway, and I decided that it would not be bad to post an advertisement so that anyone passing through could be seen. <br>  Thus, I got into the district newspaper and on the district television program.  Later, I was approached by one little-known office, offering a job that allowed us to survive a difficult period and study in parallel. <br><br>  Working in this office, I met a businessman who, 2 years later, invited me to open a startup.  Startup today is called <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi</a> . <br><br>  At the time when I was invited to <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi</a> , I no longer worked in that office, because I decided to devote myself to study.  But the money ran out and had to re-think about the work. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi</a> was still in diapers at that time, it was not an official company and did not pay salaries. <br>  I had a dilemma in front of me, to look for a monetary job, or to climb into an adventure from which nothing could come out, or even go-go. <br><br>  Frankly, I fell in love with the idea of <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi</a> almost immediately and therefore decided to take a chance.  I wrote a demo program, smoke came out of my ears, but in the end we found sponsors for our idea, I really didn‚Äôt become a big boss, but oh well.  And now, after a year you can experience our <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">creativity</a> . <br><br>  Why I believe in <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi</a> . <br>  Technically: cellular providers will never be able to give the speed of the Internet that WiFi can give, for this reason they ask for it so expensive (just if it is cheap, everyone will want it and they can do it). <br>  Socially: If we can fumble files through a donkey and others like him, then why can't we fumble the air (radio waves through which WiFi is transmitted)? <br>  Realistically, the world strives for continuous connection to the Internet and no one yet knows how it will end (good things are good, just where human imagination will lead us "is certainly an interesting question‚Äù), but for implementation we need a quality connection - what <a href="http://www.wefi.com/">WeFi is</a> trying to offer the whole world ( there is a quick find the best connection point). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11048/</a></p>
