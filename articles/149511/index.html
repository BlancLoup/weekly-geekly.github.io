  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google unveiled plans for Motorola Mobility</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In May of this year, all regulatory agencies gave the go-ahead to the merger of Google and Motorola Mobility.  The merger itself caused a lot of questions.  There were rumors that Google only buys the company so that Microsoft does not tidy it up, that the company only needs patents for the search giant, and Huawei or ZTE will sell the production facilities, in a word, the most incredible assumptions have been put forward.  After the takeover, it became known only that there will be no close relationship between the Android development department and Motorola Mobility, and Dennis Woodside will be the head of the subsidiary.  But today, many points above i have been set. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, massive staff reductions will be carried out: about 4,000 people will be laid off.  Nearly half of the former leadership, including Sanjaya Jha, left the company.  However, several top managers were transferred from Google to Motorola, and several new ones were hired. <br><br>  Others may interest and at the same time disappoint Russian fans of Motorola products.  The fact is that the company left the Russian market back in October 2010, after which many were expecting a return after Google‚Äôs takeover.  But in Mountain View they believe that it is necessary not to return to different sales markets, but, on the contrary, leave others.  So far, there is no exact solution, but, apparently, the Chinese and Indian markets will fall under the ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù. <br><br>  Many journalists noted the importance of the company's research and development departments for Google, but again, Google believes otherwise: the R &amp; D departments in Beijing, Chicago and Sunnyvale will be closed.  In addition, one-third of Motorola's offices around the world will be closed (there are a total of 94).

      However, a separate R &amp; D department operated by Regina Dugen was opened in return.  Before moving to Google Inc.  Regina was in charge of information security at the Pentagon‚Äôs Advanced Defense Research Agency (DARPA).  The new department is a set of specialists in artificial intelligence, acoustics and other areas. <br><br>  Dennis Woodside also revealed the direction of the release of smartphones: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Refusal of the budget segment</i> .  The development will be devices exclusively mid-end / hi-end segments </li><li>  <i>A significant reduction in the number of devices</i> .  Last year, Motorola Mobility introduced 27 devices to the market, now significantly less </li><li>  <i>Optimization of the cost of components</i> .  For this purpose, Google lured Mark Randall from Amazon to design components for Amazon Kindle Fire. </li><li>  <i>Harnessing Motorola's strengths</i> - telecommunications development and the use of high-capacity batteries. </li></ul><br><br>  Dennis also confirmed that Motorola will not receive preferences in relation to Google's key partners in the Open Handset Alliance.  That is, to get the source code of the new versions of Android and the Motorola Platform Development Kit will be under the same conditions as Samsung, HTC or Verizon. <br>  Sources close to the company talked about the possible creation of a separate operating system for Motorola (Android fork?), Although it may be that Motorola will continue to be equipped with the MotoBlur shell, rather than the standard Holo design used in Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly bean. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149511/</a></p>
