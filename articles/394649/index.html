      Let's look at the bones of these and other popular myths and facts about hypoxia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Introduction: ATP, glycolysis, hypoxia</font> </h2><br>  The fuel on which each cell of the body works is adenosine triphosphate, or simply ATP.  When the ATP molecule is broken down, energy is released.  It goes on muscle contraction, metabolism and all other reactions and processes. <br><br>  In order for the organism to continue to live, it must constantly replenish its energy supply.  ATP molecules are formed during a special reaction - glycolysis.  This is the conversion of glucose to ATP. <br><br>  Glycolysis is of two types: <br><br>  <b>With oxygen</b> <br>  Glucose + oxygen = <b>36 ATP molecules</b> + carbon dioxide + water <br><br>  <b>Without oxygen</b> <br>  Glucose = <b>2 ATP molecules</b> + carbon dioxide + water + <i>lactic acid</i> <br><br>  Without oxygen, energy becomes several times less.  Glycolysis is most active in muscles and nerve cells.  Muscles lose their tone, inattention, drowsiness appear, the head "badly cooks."  In addition, lactic acid is released, because of which the muscles ache. <br><br>  We must compensate for the lack of energy.  There is no oxygen, which means more glucose is needed.  The body begins to demand carbohydrates, I want something sweet. <br><br>  The end of the introduction.  Go to the main thing.  First - the myths about oxygen starvation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Myth number 1: little oxygen, and therefore hypoxia</font> </h2><br>  Everyone is used to thinking that the amount of oxygen in the air in a stuffy room decreases and hypoxia occurs as a result.  Oxygen in the stifling air is indeed becoming less.  But the body reacts not to oxygen, but to carbon dioxide. <br><br>  Carbon dioxide in fresh air is 0.05%, or 500 ppm.  Fatigue and other unpleasant symptoms appear when carbon dioxide becomes 4 times more, 2000 ppm and more.  The difference is 1500 ppm, only 0.15%, but we feel it.  The condition of the body with a high concentration of CO2 in the blood is called <b>hypercapnia</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f71/814/37c/f7181437c0c84431a8da41931bd41a3a.jpg"><br><br>  Oxygen in fresh air 20%.  Unpleasant sensations appear when the level of O2 drops to 15%.  But before this happens, the concentration of CO2 will have time to grow to critical values.  So in the stuffy room first there will be no hypoxia, but hypercapnia. <br><br><blockquote>  The task of any <a href="https://tion.ru/product/breezer/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dreferal%26utm_campaign%3Dhypoxia">ventilation</a> is to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, and not to enrich it with oxygen. </blockquote><br>  When carbon dioxide poisoning hemoglobin in the blood is worse associated with oxygen.  As a result, the blood transports less oxygen throughout the body.  And here already occurs tissue hypoxia. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Myth</b> </td><td>  <b>true</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  In the stuffiness there is nothing to breathe, there is little oxygen. <br>  Hypoxia appears. </td><td>  In the stuffiness there is nothing to breathe, a lot of carbon dioxide. <br>  Hypercapnia appears, and then hypoxia. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Myth number 2: oxygen products will help</font> </h2><br>  A course of special oxygen therapy in the United States costs more than $ 1,000.  Oxygen bars and shops offer a lot of hypoxia products: oxygen cocktails, oxygen-enriched water, oxygen cosmetics, even oxygen baths for feet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/be6/88b/1ddbe688b7d949aca370eeb76a9544c1.jpg"><br><br>  There is a stir around all these oxygen products.  But clinical evidence and medical evidence in their favor - no. <br><br>  Moreover, there are anti-hypoxia products that have no relation to oxygen at all.  For example, the oxygenated water from the Rose Creek Company: laboratory tests did not detect oxygen in it.  And there are suspicions that this is not the only company that speculates on the topic of oxygen starvation. <br><br>  Why not proven the benefits of oxygen products?  The reason is elementary: oxygen is absorbed in the lungs, and only in the lungs.  Neither through the skin nor through the stomach and intestines can the body receive oxygen for glycolysis. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Myth</b> </td><td>  <b>true</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Oxygen products help with hypoxia. </td><td>  Oxygen products are useless during hypoxia. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Myth number 3: you need to sleep longer</font> </h2><br>  It is believed that a long sleep will help get rid of oxygen starvation.  Bad news for sleep lovers: this is not true. <br><br>  Another bad news, this time for those who snore: snoring increases oxygen starvation.  The sound of snoring is made by a vibrating larynx.  Vibration of the larynx indicates an unstable state of the respiratory tract.  There is a risk that in a dream it will shrink and breathing will be intermittently interrupted.  Retention of breath increases hypoxia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d5/fd7/a83/7d5fd7a83bd24037af39b37f9c861294.jpg"><br><br>  Even without snoring, the muscles of the tongue and larynx relax in a dream.  Because of this, the airway narrows, breathing becomes more frequent and shallow.  And it also increases hypoxia, even if not as much as holding your breath. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Myth</b> </td><td>  <b>true</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  In the dream, the body recovers from hypoxia. </td><td>  In a dream, breathing becomes shallow or intermittent. <br>  The longer you sleep, the stronger the hypoxia. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  With all the myths.  We turn to the facts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Fact number 1: oxygen is absorbed only in the alveoli</font> </h2><br>  It has already been mentioned above that oxygen can enter the blood only through the lungs.  But this fact is as important as it is simple.  Therefore, we pay special attention to it. <br><br>  Air enters the body in this way: <br><br><ul><li>  Nasal cavity </li><li>  Pharynx </li><li>  Larynx </li><li>  Trachea </li><li>  Two main bronchus: in the left and right lung </li><li>  A network of smaller bronchi and bronchioles in each lung </li><li>  <b>Alveolus</b> - the vial that ends each bronchiole </li></ul><br>  Each alveolus is enmeshed in a network of thin capillaries.  Here, oxygen enters the blood from the air, passing through the alveolar-capillary membrane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/951/31f/422/95131f422e374d588b47481c0fbd4ed2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Fact number 2: you need fat for breathing</font> </h2><br>  On the inner side of the wall of the alveoli are covered with a special substance, surfactant.  It supports the alveoli in the form of bubbles and prevents them from collapsing as you exhale.  And most importantly: with a surfactant, oxygen enters the blood from the alveoli much faster. <br><br>  Surfactant is 90% fat, 10% protein and carbohydrates.  Low in fat in the diet - there will be little surfactant in the lungs.  Oxygen will be absorbed poorly, and even the freshest air will not save from hypoxia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ff/98a/90f/2ff98a90f4d94eae8c5075b6d3f81d1c.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  Vegetable and animal fats in the diet should be equally divided. <br>  Valuable sources of vegetable fats are olive, cedar, linseed oil and grape seed oil. <br>  Valuable sources of animal fats are egg yolk, caviar, sour cream, butter, yellow cheese. </blockquote><br>  If you eat something fat, in the body literally in a few hours, surfactant synthesis begins.  This is done by <b>alveolocytes</b> - epithelial cells, which lines the walls of alevol. <br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Fact ‚Ññ3: infections, alcohol, cigarettes and exhaust gases increase hypoxia</font> </h2><br>  For bacteria, surfactant is a real yummy.  Therefore, they tend to get into the alveoli.  In the upper respiratory tract and bronchi, microbes are bad: mucus and ciliated epithelium on the walls of the respiratory tubes prevent movement; the cough reflex tends to ‚Äúspit out‚Äù them from the lungs, everywhere immune killer cells. <br><br>  Another thing - the alveoli.  There is no mucus, ciliated epithelium and cough reflex, but there is a delicious and nutritious surfactant and a lot of oxygen. <br><br>  If the bacteria have settled in the alveoli, pneumonia develops.  With sluggish pneumonia, surfactant slowly eats up bacteria, hypoxia appears. <br><br>  Now it is clear why, in folk medicine, colds, tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases are treated with fatty milk or ghee.  These products do not kill bacteria, but restore the surfactant layer and relieve the symptoms of hypoxia. <br>  What else badly affects the surfactant and causes hypoxia: <br><ul><li>  <b>Alcohol</b> <br>  Alcohol vapors pass through the exhalation surfactant and liquefy it. </li><li>  <b>Cigarettes</b> <br>  When smoking, the alveoli are clogged with tar.  Synthesis of surfactant is blocked.  Therefore, smokers are in a state of permanent hypoxia. </li><li>  <b>Traffic fumes</b> <br>  The functions of the surfactant are violated on about the same principle as when smoking. </li><li>  <b>Acetone</b> <br>  Chemical fumes in beauty salons and dry cleaners also destroy surfactant. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  <font color="063f4e">Conclusion</font> </h2><br><ol><li>  Drowsiness, drowsiness, inattention, always want sweet - all these symptoms can talk about hypoxia. </li><li>  Take care of the air exchange at home.  Not to oxygenate the air, but to remove excess carbon dioxide from it. </li><li>  Do not spend money on oxygen products. </li><li>  Do not force yourself to sleep longer than usual.  This will not help with hypoxia.  Better air the bedroom. </li><li>  Eat eggs, caviar, oily fish, yellow cheese.  Dress the salads with olive oil. </li><li>  About alcohol and smoking tips will not.  Fighting habits and temptations is not easy.  But from the exhaust gas, try to protect yourself, at least at home.
