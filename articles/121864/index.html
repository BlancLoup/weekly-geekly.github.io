And today there is a very unusual news, more precisely, an unusual update, which was born from the need to observe precisely our own vehicles.  We present the video monitoring service for objects with the ability to tie the start or end of observation to various events.  Now not only GPS monitoring is available, but also video monitoring of transport, cargo, workers.  If interested - read on. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Already been </h4>

      No doubt, there is a rather old startup ‚ÄúHouse under supervision‚Äù (even recently it was mentioned somewhere), ‚ÄúTraffic jams out of the window‚Äù, maybe others, but still we are pursuing a different goal, namely combining the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù GPS monitoring with video surveillance and data storage remotely on the server. <br><br><h4>  Details </h4><br><br>  As I wrote above, first of all, the service was conceived for themselves to monitor their transport, because  the windows are facing the opposite side of the parking lot - I had to install a camera that would broadcast via the Internet - what is happening to everyone.  Later they decided to save the archive of photos, just in case, for which ... just save.  At night, respectively, an empty park space was written which was not at all interesting, neither to store nor to look, and we came up to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsaving according to an event.  Because  We have GPS trackers on all vehicles - the idea was as follows: upon arrival to the ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù zone of the first employee, start recording, and after the last car left the zone - stop recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2707c0b4/c08a628e/e32443ac/bbc74f79.jpg"><br><br>  This was done by a separate application that was used inside the enterprise and no one tried to develop it further until they received an order from the manufacturer of plastic windows.  The essence of the TK was reduced precisely to recording the loading of products into certain vehicles, in which most of the broken windows were in transit, because  the driver always claimed that he had already received such from the warehouse. <br><br><h4>  <s>"Said - done"</s> , "paid - done" </h4><br><br>  Here we remembered the ‚Äúpocket‚Äù development, we had to finish a bit and insert everything into a single interface for usability, and ordering data.  The operation algorithm is simple - either we write everything, we save archives with the specified period, or we write according to an event that can be absolutely arbitrary: the arrival of the machine itself or the opening (operation of a discrete sensor) of the machine‚Äôs side. <br>  As you can see from the screen - you can view the archive of images according to the timing and, if necessary, you can download all the saved images in one archive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/527bbf2d/b7ed43f4/edc042dc/4d3170b1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/26647941/6d98226c/9dc6ce66/d68d9c24.jpg"><br><br>  You can also configure the inverse function, for example, when leaving your home (event - leaving the car out of the garage, for example) will begin recording the entire event at home.  Adding a camera is a simple procedure and supports any IP camera with a real address or via <a href="http://www.dyndns.tv/">www.dyndns.tv</a> (the service created specifically for the cameras).  The traffic that the camera consumes depends mainly on the quality of the picture - but at the moment 3G unlimited packages are already appearing, so I think that such a concept as traffic will no longer be relevant soon. <br><br>  Recently an article about a completely autonomous surveillance camera slipped, and dealextreme is happy - the cost of the cheapest IP camera has already reached the price of 49.99, so you can safely say that our decision has the right to life.  Our realities - lead to the fact that control is necessary in different areas of life, and perhaps this function will be useful to you. <br><br>  Regards, <a href="http://www.gps-tracker.com.ua/">www.gps-tracker.com.ua</a> <br>  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121864/</a></p>
