  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uneducated youth: yes, another post from the student‚Äôs point of view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1 id="vozzap">  Vozzaz </h1><br><p>  The topic for me is very relevant.  I am a schoolboy, I study in the 11th grade, I am engaged in programming most of my free time.  First, the background to denote my position in the world of IT, education, work, and the list. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="predystoriya">  Prehistory </h2><br><p>  I started programming at 12 years old.  I went to 3D modeling courses (oh yeah, I wanted to make games), met a guy who taught html, css for video courses.  For me, this was a revelation, because I thought it was very difficult, not clear.  My experience was to create a site on the mouse with a mouse and "oh, horror, I messed up", when I accidentally entered the html block editor. </p><br><p>  The courses were quite suitable, for a couple of weeks I overtook him and promptly studied further.  At the age of 12, it is not so easy to purposefully read something, study a specific topic.  It was much easier for me to come up with an idea (again, I did not even invent them - I was in school and suddenly it dawned on me: wow, how cool would it be to make a website in which ...).  And before the end of the lessons, I thought through everything I could think through, ran home, did the lessons as quickly as possible and sat at the computer.  Next was a difficult stage - how to find out how to do something, if you don‚Äôt have any idea what you need.  The maximum that you can - to describe the problem, succinctly, with keywords, and then, perhaps, you will find the answer.  Maybe even in Russian.  I have to say that with English I was already pretty good at 12 - I went to the courses, all the type is top.  But dearer to read in Russian - a large array of text in Russian is less frightening than in English. </p><br><p>  It was difficult to learn how to write a server - believe me, at the age of 12 it is very difficult to download Denver, install a PHP interpreter even after lessons.  But after a while it worked out. <br>  The plug was on the databases.  I had a lot of queries for a long time to connect to MySQL.  How cool I was when I finally could, this is a class.  But nevertheless, it was like a big dark room where you need to find a flashlight so that from this flashlight you can already go further easier.  Cool association, yes? </p><br><p> After the sites I wanted to learn some serious language.  I downloaded visual studio express, but wrote a function inside a function - this, of course, did not compile, and had a row to this C ++ and downloaded NetBeans.  I was lucky and I wrote my first method not inside <code>public static void main</code> .  So I began to learn java, in which I wrote for a very long time.  Again, the projects were different and they themselves arose - for example, to make a voice assistant, like in Tony Stark (I was baldey and bastard at the iron man).  When you google, google, google, then sooner or later you begin to get used to the fact that practically everything can be googled, learned and studied.  And this is not so difficult.  The main thing to learn is to learn - in the comments under one of the posts on the same subject (in my opinion, on the part of the student) there was this comment, and I completely agree with it.  To be able to learn is very important and, I think, is the key to everything. </p><br><p>  In the 10th grade, an ICT teacher dropped me a post of her friend who needed a project assistant.  The language is Java, which I already knew very well by that time.  By that time, I had already abandoned him in the direction of Scala, but I still did not forget.  I made a test task where I had to write a piece of code to determine the days of programmers, in my opinion, and write tests for it.  He took me pretty soon, because there were not so many willing and, as he said, the level and enthusiasm was lower.  And I really wanted to work: 10th grade, you don‚Äôt do anything at school, there is a lot of time, your projects are less interested in pure interest.  I want to make some real product, useful. </p><br><p>  I worked there for 3 months, after which I left.  They paid 300 rubles per hour - I was quite pleased, and the work was quite interesting, but ... Boring.  Basically, the task was - TK is given, you understand it (subject is Indian astrology), and then you write some code.  I understood more than I wrote and it did not suit me.  Anyway, the person I helped gave me a very strong boost in terms of serious programming and attitude to work.  He also told me about the Baltic Scientific Engineering Competition. </p><br><p>  For a couple of days, I wrote a functional jet ala React, but not the React framework on the Kotlin Javascript SDK, took 3rd place, but it doesn‚Äôt matter - I was approached 3 times by the job offers at the competition.  I chose the most interesting thing - the development of mobile applications for React Native.  It may have coincided that the theme of the project was similar to work, I don‚Äôt know, but I started working there. </p><br><p>  By the way, when we agreed, I did not know about React, React Native is literally ‚Äúsyntax for components as HTML‚Äù. </p><br><p>  For a week I learned the basics, react native, which was enough for me to start working.  I rewrote my first application.  At first he wrote, knowing the "basics", then he rewrote, looking at other projects, having become more experienced in RN itself.  It turned out pretty good, it was cool.  Payment for projects was, and not on time - and it's great, more motivation to do. </p><br><p>  I worked there until the end of the summer, now I am not going to the 11th grade, for the EGE and all that. </p><br><h2 id="tezisy">  Theses </h2><br><p>  Here is a background.  Long, of course, looks a bit like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching and I‚Äôm a schoolboy, yes, yes."  But he wrote only so that now, having his own history before his eyes, write his theses and opinion. </p><br><ul><li>  Learning is easy.  I was always annoyed by phrases from friends, ala "it's so difficult."  It is difficult if you do not want to study, if you are not interested.  If you are interested, then there should be plenty of motivation. </li><li>  Learn where to eat.  Starting point - has always been and will be one of the most difficult stages, especially in IT.  If you are a student, then you usually go to courses - programming is rarely more or less good at school.  However, I am SURE that almost everywhere you can come up and directly ask what is interesting.  An adult, especially a teacher, especially an ICT teacher, who is surely at least familiar with Google, can google you online lessons, if you are too lazy to give additional tasks and work on your own.  If the ICT teacher is not familiar with Google, then the situation is not easy, but he will always advise taking courses.  After that, you need to poke your parents so that they find courses for you)) </li><li>  There is no time to learn.  Common, man?  What are you wasting time then?  If you need to learn programming (or something), then you should have time for it.  Anyone can say that he wants to learn how to make Falcons, but he has no time.  It is not right.  If you want to do the programming first, that is, it is in priority, then you need to spend a lot of time on it.  For any training requires a considerable piece of your time. </li><li>  "Teacher is a sucker, cowards are peas. I am poorly taught !!!".  This, too, can be, I believe.  The teacher may be disinterested in telling the subject to everyone.  Yes, for him it can also become a chore.  So damn it, take it by the shoulders, shake it, show that it is interesting for you.  After all, once he was burning with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking cool programmers.  Chances are good that you will go to a meeting.  Any help will be provided for sure.  And if not, then learn it yourself.  A lot of resources, forums, blah blah.  Seriously, a lot of material.  Do not become yourself "sucker with cowards in the peas."  Be stronger, if you need it - learn. </li><li>  Subjects are outdated, as are teachers.  Here the situation is very realistic - sure, there are so many.  In this case, it seems to me, you need to get the most useful from the lessons, and what YOU need, to learn it yourself.  If of course you are sure that this is exactly what you need.  Maybe the teacher is still more experienced, but to be honest it is doubtful.  In any case - the expansion of horizons is good. </li><li>  Job.  It is not so simple here, in fact.  I am still a schoolboy, but it seems that in high school it will be more difficult to get a job, heh.  There are only a few schoolchildren who are ready to confirm that they can and want to, and there are many students.  In good universities, like ITMO, employers often visit, as far as I know.  If so, not bad.  It is only important to be really strong in your field relative to others - competition is always tight. </li></ul><br><h2 id="nebolshoy-itog">  Small total </h2><br><p>  I do not know why it is needed.  I‚Äôve already said many times that I think the most important skill of a programmer is to adapt, where to adapt = to be able to learn. </p><br><p>  There is an opinion that a lazy programmer is a good programmer.  I do not really agree with him - it is true, when you are already a programmer and solve a specific problem, and your laziness forces you to look for simple ways of implementation.  Often you can be lazy and reduce the code or simplify the architecture of the application.  But if you are a novice programmer, then laziness is the main enemy.  The enemy of opportunity.  Yes, probably so I will finish. <br>  Cheeky Pau, Bingo Bongo and Jimbo Jumbo. </p></div>
