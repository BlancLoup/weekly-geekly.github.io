Which of them in 2015 will break out in the lead?  We chose 14 startups that, in our opinion, made a lot of noise in 2015. Some people are trying to change the way they communicate on the Internet, some are sharing files, and some are becoming major media companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> </h4><br>  Why: Slack is an application that allows work colleagues to chat, send private messages and share files, including in the browser.
