Interruption of business processes due to equipment breakdown in most cases leads to the loss of critical data, the loss of customers and the erosion of trust in the company.  What is most unpleasant is that it is almost impossible to calculate the amount of material and non-material losses.  Cisco offers an additional service package of Cisco SMARTnet, the acquisition of which will allow you to absolutely accurately determine the amount of investment required for the reliable protection of the company's business processes.  And this price will be significantly lower than the losses from a failed network infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/034/97e/c8b/03497ec8bfc498bdb6fe835a3f5b12d1.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The Cisco SMARTnet service</b> is the technical support that Cisco has been providing to customers throughout the world for many years.  This support was awarded with numerous awards, including the STAR award for best practices, and received maximum marks in the annual VARBusiness report for ‚Äúafter sales support‚Äù and ‚Äúquality technical support‚Äù, as well as the award ‚ÄúBest international web support sites‚Äù.  The recognition of professionals and colleagues, the flawless work of service centers around the world, the trust and appreciation of customers is the key to success provided by Cisco SMARTnet technical support.

      <b>Cisco SMARTnet Service and Standard Warranty: Key Differences</b> <br><br>  It is worth noting that Cisco SMARTnet and Cisco Standard Warranty are two completely different services.  The warranty includes only the replacement of equipment from the distributor's warehouse, subject to availability.  In other cases, warranty replacement is carried out on order from 45 days to several months, depending on the time of production and the need to obtain a special license for the importation of products with cryptographic functionality. <br><br>  The differences between the Cisco SMARTnet service and the standard Cisco warranty are clearly presented in the table and graph below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e7/f54/b4d/3e7f54b4d07bbf8722b54bdc20725ab9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8e/5a6/231/d8e5a623166879c785281255fd5149bf.png"><br><br>  <b>What does Cisco SMARTnet consist of?</b> <br><br>  The Cisco SMARTnet service support contract includes the following components: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Possibility of round-the-clock access to Cisco TAC technical support specialists <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interactive access to Cisco.com's extensive knowledge base, communities, resources, and tools <br>  ‚Ä¢ Advance replacement of equipment, incl.  within 4 hours for Kiev, the next working day for other cities of Ukraine (several days added for delivery of goods to points distant from the warehouse).  The advance replacement service when buying a new contract becomes available within 30 days after the start date of the SMARTnet's action - this time is necessary for the delivery of replacement equipment to the service warehouse. <br><br>  Regular updating of the IOS operating system, software updates and upgrades.  Timely update of signatures for devices with IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) functionality.  In addition, a Cisco SMARTnet Onsite service option is proposed, implying an on-site engineer‚Äôs departure to install replacement parts and providing greater network security (available for Kiev). <br><br>  Checking the availability of the On-site service by <a href="https://sso.cisco.com/autho/forms/CDClogin.html">reference</a> <br><br>  <b>The sequence of actions in the event of a technical problem</b> <br><br>  In the event of any problems related to both the hardware and the software of your Cisco equipment, you can use the services of the Cisco Technical Assistance Center TAC, which employs certified Cisco specialists. <br><br>  Cisco TAC operates daily and around the clock around the world, with the ability to receive support in a local language.  Communication with Cisco TAC engineers is carried out in the most convenient way for you - by email, by phone, via the Internet, as well as using modern Cisco WebEx communication system. <br><br>  The Cisco Technical Assistance Center, when opening cases, has a clear prioritization of requests (Severity), which is recommended to be followed in order to maximize and speed up the processing of your request: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Priority 1 (S1) - ‚ÄúFailure‚Äù of the network or problems that have a critical impact on the company's business.  The person who opened the request should stay in touch around the clock. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Priority 2 (S2) - Significant reduction in network performance.  The person who opened the request must stay connected during work hours. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Priority 3 (S3) - Decreased network performance when most business operations <br>  ‚Ä¢ Priority 4 (S4) ‚ÄîThe need for information or assistance regarding the capabilities, installation, or configuration of Cisco products.  The negative impact on business transactions is negligible or absent. <br><br>  The sequence of actions in case of a technical problem can be seen on the graph below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb7/3c1/272/cb73c12720e54a80bf5363bbadf613c3.png"><br><br>  Each service request received by the technical support center will be assigned a number for the following calls.  When opening the case by phone or in writing, the customer has the right to ask the Russian-speaking engineer to communicate to solve the problem, but the first application will have to be done in English.  If there are difficulties with translation, it is recommended to contact the organization that sold the service contract for assistance.  It is also worth noting that in order to request a Russian engineer to request a resolution, it is necessary to call TAC during business hours Moscow time. <br><br>  The Cisco SMARTnet service also includes a personalized software selection wizard, available on Cisco.com.  This consultant tells you what new software versions are available for your Cisco network devices.  New versions can be downloaded via Cisco Connection Online (CCO) Software <a href="http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-dlguide.html">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Acquisition methods and terms of use</b> <br><br>  The process of providing services is built on the coordinated work of three organizations at once: a partner, a distributor of MUKs and a Cisco company.  The first thing you should do as a client who wants to purchase SMARTnet is to choose a partner, providing him with the necessary data for placing an order.  The required information contains the address of the installation of the equipment, its serial number, the desired date of commencement of the service, and contact details of the email and telephone number of persons providing support for the contract.  After that, the partner informs the distributor of the information received and the process of placing the order occurs, as a result of which a letter with the contract number comes to the customer's mail, which is a guarantee that support can be used. <br><br>  The sequence of actions of the customer who wants to purchase Cisco SMARTnet service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5cb/3b9/a48/5cb3b9a485db72a202b48b88f9b14d31.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://tools.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/openBasicSearch.do">Choosing a Cisco Partner in Ukraine</a> <br><br>  <b>What is the maximum benefit, and most importantly, how can a customer get?</b> <br><br>  Cisco SMARTnet service components will help customers with the following: <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93c/d89/187/93cd891874478ae8f5860181e01990f3.png"><br>  1. A maintenance contract reduces total cost of ownership and accelerates your return on investment.  A malfunction or challenge to an IT professional may incur more costs than the entire cost of a service contract. <br><br>  2. Fast advance equipment replacement is provided by the Cisco service warehouse, which is located in the city of Gostomel, near Kiev, which significantly minimizes the risks of network downtime.  Cisco is working with one of the world leaders in the field of express delivery of goods - with the company DHL, which promptly delivers goods throughout the country and takes non-working devices. <br><br>  3. Cisco software is part of Cisco hardware.  Technologies are evolving, and Cisco software functionality is modified every day, new features and functions are added.  Therefore, the network still contributes to the achievement of business goals, the obsolescence of operating systems and software should not be allowed, and the service contract, with the help of software updates, ensures the achievement of this goal and maintains the competitiveness and security of the network at a constant level.  Finally, if you need to update the applications in the future, without the current coverage of the software applications, the cost of acquiring these upgrades may be greater than the cost of updating the service contract as a whole. <br><br>  4. The service contract allows you to receive advice and assistance from Cisco TAC technical support specialists around the clock, which consequently helps to reduce the staff costs of your company's IT department, and also makes sure that in the event of any equipment failure, you will be guaranteed support -qualified Cisco engineers and problems will be fixed. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Detailed information about the CISCO SMARTnet service can be obtained in the MUK sales department at tel.  +38 (044) 492-29-29, as well as when sending a request to the email address cisco@muk.ua. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167633/</a></p>
