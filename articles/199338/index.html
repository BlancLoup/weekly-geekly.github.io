Therefore, we are not afraid to try different funny things.  About some of them, I'll tell you now.  Below are a few stories, among which there are two useful ones that can slightly increase your sales. <br><br><h4>  Free cryptoanalyzer </h4><br>  The coolest thing is when the store creates a positive that you want to tell your friends about.  When the Brigade game was just released, we just bought soldering irons (64 rubles each) and the first fifty customers were given out one by one. <br><br>  It happened this way: the animator in the hall plays with the buyer in our parody game about the dashing ninetieth, then the buyer goes with the box to the checkout.  After payment, the cashier pulls out a soldering iron and puts it in the package for the game with the words: "It will be useful to you."

Yes, no, just a cool story.  More precisely, she conceived such, until some large community wrote about this topic about guerrilla advertising on the Internet - on this day we sold a few dozen more boxes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Minuses?  Well, yes, there was one.  The younger generation nearly returned the game a couple of times, having decided that something needs to be soldered inside. <br><br><h4>  "Yes you are insane" </h4><br>  When we were brought a new "Uno", it turned out that she had a typo in the sticker - a new batch came with a sticker from the beach version, where it was written in small letters about what could be washed in soapy water.  Well, we washed to check, suddenly true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/0bc/52e/83b0bc52e4c26131c2f29d88de63f55d.jpg" width="650" height="491"><br><br>  The cards, of course, are dead.  We returned the box as a marriage to the supplier, but we warned all the sellers in the network about such a funny feature.  And just enjoyed it.  No profits, just a feeling like from the XSS found. <br><br><h4>  Photo stickers </h4><br>  Remember these stickers?  And what was the boom with them? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a17/17e/9b5/a1717e9b596a3fca52a3012379afe59b.jpg" width="600" height="449"><br><br>  We wanted to hang these on stores.  Then we had 10 points in Moscow, so we only needed 10 stickers.  It turned out that it was 200 rubles and hells quest with the following items: <br><ol><li>  Find a typography and throw them layout. </li><li>  To get Mark. </li><li>  Get the contract (and not the fact that they will give a contract for such an amount!) </li><li>  Agree an agreement with lawyers with us. </li><li>  Sign a contract. </li><li>  Sign the bill and pay. </li><li>  Throw off the payment. </li><li>  Write a power of attorney to the person who will receive the stickers. </li><li>  Pick up and deliver. </li><li>  Sign and transfer closing documents. </li></ol><br>  And this is for an order of 200 rubles.  Easier not to print.  I imagined how cool it would be to everyone else in the city, and decided to make not a thousand stickers, but a thousand.  And then we just started giving them away for free in our store on Taganskaya. <br><br>  Nicely?  Yes.  Profit?  What else.  The fact is that You-Know-Who, Ternovsky and Zalt wrote about it.  And the store for three days turned into an anthill.  People came, took a sticker, played one of the games ... and bought something. <br><br>  As it turned out, Lebedev's shop was also going to print and distribute them for free, but our process took 3 days, and they took 2 weeks.  By the end of the week, our method was repeated by two more stores. <br><br><h4>  +1 item in check </h4><br>  Now about the useful.  One simple question can increase the amount of goods in the average check by 0.15 pieces.  This question is very short: ‚ÄúHow many pieces?‚Äù - and it is set to any cheap position. <br><br>  The dialogue may be: <br><blockquote>  - Yeah, me Uno, please. <br>  - How much? <br>  - Moment.  * you can hear the customer contacting someone else in the office * Vasya, do you not need Uno?  Len, and you? .. Yeah, two pieces, please. </blockquote><br><br>  Or this: <br><blockquote>  - Yeah.  How many are you? <br>  - One.  But why are you asking? <br>  - Yes, usually take three.  One myself, one friend. <br>  - And the third? <br>  - I do not know :) </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Implementation of discount cards </h4><br>  When we started, we had no discount cards at all.  We gave discounts on secret words: they could be easily transferred to friends and so on.  And then we just began to record the customer's phone number in the database and make it a card number.  It was very convenient: I forgot the card at home - I just called the phone.  Or gave the number to a friend so that he could buy something for himself.  One of the employees of Yandex simply squeezed the newsletter around the office - and in six months on his cumulative discount card there were purchases in a million. <br><br>  And then the cards themselves appeared.  Like these ones: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bb/5f4/010/0bb5f4010eaab07651ff899ed4f9eae5.jpg" width="69" height="142"><br><br>  There are three life hacking at once.  First, it is a key ring.  It means that it will be attached to the keys, and not put in the wallet - and we carry the keys with us.  Usually.  And more often we see them - at least twice a day.  Secondly, the size of the keychain is 1/3 of the module from a regular card.  This means that a discount card as promotional material costs us 3 times cheaper than usual - because they are still made on the same modules, they are simply cut into 3 parts.  And, thirdly, the back says: "If you find these keys, please take them to the nearest Mosigra store, we will return them to the owner." <br><br><h4>  Habr </h4><br>  About how we were two weeks as the number 1 company in the rating (right before Yandex), it is very fun and pleasant to remember.  But in fact, it was possible to solve one very important task.  Two years ago we were just starting to publish domestic games, and therefore we needed authors.  The original idea was this: write about it, and then wait for the page to rise in the search.  But everything turned out much better: I wrote a very detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/112116/">topic</a> about the development of my game and how much and how you can earn on it.  About 150 people came from it just like that and another 60 to our special game store for authors - and we‚Äôve just a few away, plus about a dozen more - other domestic companies. <br><br><h4>  How one card raised sales </h4><br>  I knew that geeks were geeky, but I didn't know how much.  There is such a game Imaginarium, there it is necessary to invent associations to the pictures.  Warm and lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfb/e2a/234/bfbe2a234361d2772398797a02552279.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  All we did was ask the publisher to print a separate card for us, which is not in the set.  For distribution.  And never print this again.  Here's the thing: if you ask the supplier for a discount, he can refuse.  But if you ask him to do something that will advance his product - he will happily agree. <br><br>  And then we began to issue a new card with each box purchased.  The only way to get this card was to buy a big box.  I just wanted to see what it would give.  So, about one in ten of those who have already bought this game, bought another box from us.  For the sake of the map.  They gave the box to friends, and left the card. <br><br>  A couple of days ago, by the way, an upset resident of one of the regions wrote to us, who kept a letter about this card (almost a year!), Recently bought a game - but did not receive a card.  We took and sent him another two sets of 3 unique cards.  The whole buzz is that he still does not know about it.  I hope he will be happy to receive them. <br><br><h4>  Free rental </h4><br>  One of the funniest selling methods without selling is the free rental of games.  It works like this: you can go to the store at the Park of Culture, choose a game, leave a deposit in its value and take it home for 2 weeks.  Then return and get the money back. <br><br>  What is the profit?  The fact that many simply do not return the game (it is considered to be purchased after 2 weeks), or they come and buy the same in the new packaging.  Because I liked it. <br><br>  What to do with those who take 5 games for their birthday, and then everything returns?  Oh, nothing, rejoice.  The profit is that this person, in fact, will show the goods to a bunch of new people and introduce them to him - that is, he will hold a mini-game store.  And then a couple of people just come to us for your favorite things. <br><br><h4>  Games </h4><br>  With games, we also have fun.  And sometimes we leave nice easter eggs.  For example, like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/054/afa/5d8/054afa5d8844b43b33ea54acaded38c3.jpg" width="550" height="623"><br><br>  Or like this (Startup): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/c19/673/167c196734580fe4cb6472583736ffa2.jpg" width="384" height="524"><br><br>  And on the site - like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44b/119/4bd/44b1194bd3895d0e2b82c0a4f3a236ce.jpg" width="555" height="104"><br><br><h4>  Positive every day </h4><br>  In general, just try to do everything that you do, fun and unusual.  And then you and your customers will enjoy the business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199338/</a></p>
