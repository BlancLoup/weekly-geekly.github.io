      In fact, the final this year turned out really explosive!  Why - read below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Pre-day </h3><br>  In fact, the final of the Imagine Cup for the participants themselves began on April 22, when we collected them on a special preparatory day at the Palace of Pioneers on Sparrow Hills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a0/14e/468/0a014e468d934c12828c5491228ab679.jpg"><br><br>  During the preliminary day, the guys were able to meet a little, rehearse the performances, we told them about how to evaluate the potential audience of the project and its prospects as a startup, conducted a small training of successful performances and told about the technological innovations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/945/60f/9a894560fbac41b59ed9236ec1b36f2b.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Russian final </h3><br>  The Russian final this year was held in Digital October, and gathered at the site a few hundred students - about 80 participants from 11 cities of Russia, and even more spectators from Moscow universities.  During the opening, the hall was full, and in the corridor during the exhibition of projects there was no room to get over. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/243/edd/3fa243edd5cc47779be832f3406c31b8.jpg"><br><br>  The main part of the event is a parallel performance of teams in the category of games, innovations and social projects. <br><br><h3>  Games </h3><br>  The category of ‚Äúgames‚Äù this year turned out to be very popular - it represented 12 teams, more than half of all finalists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/b5f/b2c/ac6b5fb2c4964fbc84b7db881f5b2793.jpg"><br><br>  The jury of the games category included employees of leading gaming companies: CIO Game Insight Andrei Ivashentsev, Oleg Chumakov from Nival VR and GamesJam organizer, Alexander Kudishov from Mail.ru, Grigory Leschenko, in charge of the gaming and multimedia direction in the Skolkovo fund.  Also in this category, the winners of the Imagine Cup 2014 Brainy Studio were judged, and Mikhail <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/mixen/" class="user_link">mixen</a> Chernomordikov, director of the department of strategic technologies of Microsoft (at one time also a participant of the Imagine Cup). <br><br>  The winning game <b>Partycles</b> (from the words party and particles) from the St. Petersburg team Infinite Pizza is a simulator of the life of elementary particles.  The authors of the game managed to make elementary particles really cute, thus causing the players interest in such fundamental physical processes as nuclear fusion or chemical reactions. <br><br>  The second place was taken by the equally beautiful <b>Far Away</b> game from the VOID team, made after and in the spirit of the film ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù.  In this game, you find yourself in an open space on a space station, and only courage and knowledge of engineering can help to survive, save the station and complete the mission. <br><br><h3>  Innovation and social projects </h3><br>  In each of these categories at the final 4 projects were presented, three of which received prizes.  Kirill Leonov, a representative of the Moscow Department of Information Technologies, Andrei Yegorov, director of an open university at Skolkovo, Anna Moiseeva from the Internet Initiatives Development Foundation, MAI professor Valentin Zaitsev, ABBYY group of educational projects and Microsoft - Konstantin <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kichik/" class="user_link">kichik</a> Kichinsky <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kichik/" class="user_link">acted as</a> jury. and I. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/764/d35/391/764d35391c894e0ebf514976172a953c.jpg"><br><br>  In the category of "innovation", the <b>Women's Health</b> solution from the Orange Team from Smolensk won, which allows determining the parameters of a woman's menstrual cycle on the basis of temperature measurements from the Microsoft Band fitness tracker.  This solution will allow solving several problems at once, from birth control to maintaining a woman‚Äôs health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cd/84d/048/9cd84d04839f4a18826b9afaeff7528c.jpg"><br><br>  The second place was taken by the <a href="http://ya-do.ru/">Ya-Do</a> social network, which helps people achieve specific goals at the expense of the social component.  Third place went to the <b>PyraBox</b> project from Novosibirsk, which is a holographic chat based on a special pyramid and Kinect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54e/d31/591/54ed31591e304185a76b4877afb4ef2c.jpg"><br><br>  In social projects, the first place was the <b>KindBrain</b> project from Cherepovets, in which the guys made a smart home control system based on neural interfaces for people with disabilities.  The guys not only adapted the existing EEG removal system, but also developed their helmet with an improved design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/980/7a0/003/9807a000355d446da0481f26124b3eef.jpg"><br><br>  The second place was taken by the project of a <b>virtual planetarium</b> from MAMI, and the third - another project by MAMI from the <b>RIOC</b> team, to create a control device for people with disabilities.  In this project, the first and second year students are already collaborating with Motorica, developing a software and hardware addition to the existing prosthesis. <br><br><h3>  Master of Code </h3><br>  Also within the framework of the final, the final of the <a href="http://masterofcode.ru/">Master of the Code</a> competition was held, in which schoolchildren competed in three categories: games, websites and applications.  As a result, the winner was <b>Timur Mustafin</b> from Kazan, who will accompany the winning team of the Imagine Cup to the international final in Seattle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/5d5/68c/95c5d568c5e34510b4522f5a144ab8fa.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo, Igor Mikhailovich Remorenko, the rector of the Moscow City Pedagogical University, utters parting words to the winners of the master of the code. <br><br><h3>  Project Exhibition </h3><br>  All projects this year could be seen at the exhibition of projects.  For example, there one could see just such a picture, where a person immersed in virtual reality coexists with a wizard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f80/575/1f5/f805751f503b48538751d53507e57168.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Evacuation </h3><br>  But most of all, the final of this year will probably be remembered for the sudden evacuation of all participants, thanks to which we spent a couple of hours on the street, where we were able to communicate and get to know each other in a warm friendly atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/472/903/d33/472903d33d5c47739cd5dfb370c806e2.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the final of the contest "Master of the Code" was held right on the street, which did not prevent to choose a worthy winner! <br><br><h3>  The final </h3><br>  Despite the evacuation, the final of the competition turned out to be beautiful - with a beautiful, rhythmic city dance at the beginning and sparkling presenters (Marina Kravets and Sergey Fomin). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/670/2f7/603/6702f7603ff84319bcf26e4dcd85cff4.jpg"><br><br>  It seemed to me that all the participants had left satisfied, having experienced a very bright and emotional day.  Next year, be sure to join the Imagine Cup, both as spectators and as participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90b/c18/c09/90bc18c099be44a59dd4562af0aad20c.jpg"><br><br>  And this year's recordings can be viewed <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Imagine-Cup/Russian-Final-Imagine-Cup-2016">on Channel 9</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282353/</a></p>
