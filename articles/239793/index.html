The programmer, as an employee of mental labor, must monitor his nutrition and health in order to maintain his brain in a state of high performance.  In addition, the programmer must be in excellent intellectual form, develop high creative activity and think about preventing age-related memory impairments. <br><br>  In early adolescence, when, plunging deeply into a project, I often forgot about food and it happened that my only food for the day was a loaf with kefir.  Now, over the years, I understand how then I traumatized the brain, not giving it the substances and energy necessary for work.

      In this publication, we will look at how to eat properly for the life support of the brain and how to disperse it with nootropics (if necessary, if necessary). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, 26% of the energy of the basal metabolism is spent on maintaining muscle tone, 25% on the functioning of the liver, and about 18% on brain activity. <br><br>  To improve brain activity in several ways: <br><br><ul><li>  improving the conduct of nerve impulses (synaptic transmissions) by providing a sufficient number of neurotransmitters (substances that transmit impulses from the nerve cell); </li><li>  improvement of blood supply to the brain, normalization of blood pressure; </li><li>  brain power support (energy supply, especially glucose); </li><li>  control of hormonal background (especially for the hormones of "happiness"). </li></ul><br><br>  Consider some of the ways to achieve all this. <br><br><h4>  Corrective nutrition </h4><br>  Scientists argue that for the normal functioning of the brain, it is necessary to regularly eat foods high in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and B vitamins. <br><br>  This table, in descending order of effects on the brain, lists the most significant products. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Sea fish (especially salmon, tuna, herring) </td><td>  Contains the greatest amount of omega-3 fatty acids.  Phosphorus is also important for the brain. </td></tr><tr><td>  Spinach, broccoli and beans </td><td>  Sources of folic acid and beta-carotene, which helps to improve cognitive abilities </td></tr><tr><td>  Walnut </td><td>  Omega-3 acids, vitamins B2, B12, E </td></tr><tr><td>  Milk and dairy products </td><td>  Vitamins B, Calcium, Phosphorus </td></tr><tr><td>  Chicken eggs </td><td>  A valuable source of iron, iodine, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12.  Also contains choline (a neurotransmitter that increases the performance of the brain). </td></tr><tr><td>  Cheese </td><td>  Contains lots of tryptophan (produces serotonin) </td></tr><tr><td>  Dark chocolate </td><td>  A set of bioflavonoids, antioxidants, the hormone phenylethylamine, uplifting and enhancing clarity of mind.  Excellent stimulation of the brain and enhancing human cognitive abilities.  Avoid sweetened dark chocolate!  Chocolate norm 50 - 200 gr.  during the day. </td></tr><tr><td>  Carrot </td><td>  Contains luteolin.  Helps reduce age-related memory and inflammation in the brain </td></tr><tr><td>  Oatmeal </td><td>  Zinc and Vitamins E and Group B </td></tr><tr><td>  Bilberries and strawberries </td><td>  Flavonoids - anthocyanidins and polyphenols protect brain cells from aging </td></tr><tr><td>  Green tea </td><td>  It maintains water-salt balance in the body, including in brain cells, increasing metabolism and improving memory. </td></tr><tr><td>  Pumpkin seeds </td><td>  Contains lots of tryptophan (produces serotonin) </td></tr><tr><td>  Tomatoes </td><td>  The source of lycopene is the protection of brain cells from damaging effects. </td></tr><tr><td>  Beet </td><td>  B vitamins </td></tr><tr><td>  Apples </td><td>  They contain catechins - substances that protect brain cells from harmful chemicals. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>  Multivitamins </h4><br>  For those who are not able to fill the desired set of trace elements with a diet, there are combined multivitamin preparations, such as Balansin, Gotu Kola, Doppelgerts Active, Intelamin, Memori Rice, Memostrong, NeuroBright, Secretagog.  Let me remind you that all these drugs are not drugs and are registered as dietary supplements.  Also, almost all of them are Western-made and have a high price. <br><br><h4>  Supplements </h4><br><h5>  DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol) </h5><br>  It stimulates brain function, enhances memory, concentration, creative abilities and improves mood.  Significantly improves the energy status of the body, and therefore universally used by athletes.  Significantly improves blood properties.  DMAE helps remove cellular debris (lipofuscin).  Of the minuses - the high price. <br><br><h5>  Creatine </h5><br>  It is an acid involved in the energy metabolism of nerve cells.  Creatine is a very effective tool for improving memory and attention span.  Norm - from 5000 mg per day. <br><br><h5>  Caffeine + L-Theanine </h5><br>  By itself, caffeine is not able to significantly improve mental abilities.  However, the combination of caffeine and L-Theanine, an amino acid found in green tea leaves, is indeed capable of creating a lasting positive effect, including improving working memory, speeding up the processing of visual information, and especially switching attention.  It is optimal to take 50 mg of caffeine (approximately a cup of coffee) and 100 mg of L-Theanine (a cup of green tea contains only about 5‚Äì8 mg of this substance. <br><br><h4>  Herbal preparations </h4><br><h6>  Small leaf bakopa </h6><br>  It has properties to improve memory and cognitive abilities.  A daily intake of 150 mg supplement is considered optimal. <br><br><h6>  Ginkgo biloba </h6><br>  This supplement is obtained from the leaves of the rarest ginkgo biloba tree.  It causes an improvement in memory and concentration.  Dosage of 240-360 mg per day. <br><br><h6>  Ginseng </h6><br>  Helps to improve working memory, concentration, beneficial effect on mood.  Take 500 mg twice a day. <br><br><h6>  Rhodiola rosea </h6><br>  Promotes the production of dopamine and serotonin, which naturally affects the mood.  It is recommended to take 100-1000 mg, which should be divided into two equal parts. <br><br><h6>  Sage spanish </h6><br>  Contains acetylcholine, which is responsible for the speed of thought processes.  Dosage - 300 mg in dry leaves once a day. <br><br><h4>  Let's go over nutrition again. </h4><br>  <b>Every day we should eat:</b> <br><ul><li>  "Slow" carbohydrates, which are gradually absorbed, without causing a sharp rise in blood glucose levels.  They are best eaten for breakfast.  Then for a long time there is a feeling of fullness, a good mood, the brain is supplied with glucose, which is used to produce energy; </li><li>  sufficient amount of B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12); </li><li>  Vitamin C (the main water-soluble antioxidant and catalyst for many processes); </li><li>  Magnesium - the main anti-stress mineral that protects against insomnia, fatigue, nervousness, mood swings, which is necessary for active mental and physical activity; </li><li>  omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are included in the membranes of neurons and improve the performance of nerve impulses, because they stimulate the synthesis, secretion and activity of neurotransmitters; </li><li>  dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), which enhances the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and exhibits pronounced antioxidant properties; </li><li>  highly absorbable iron.  It is the lack of iron that is often associated with loss of physical strength and endurance, deterioration in the ability to learn, and increased fatigue; </li><li>  organic iodine.  With its shortage, the production of thyroid hormones is suppressed and the brain's ability to produce energy dramatically decreases; </li><li>  proteins rich in amino acids.  Thus, the amino acid tyrosine is a precursor of norepinephrine, adrenaline and dopamine (responsible for energy production);  tryptophan-serotonin (the hormone of happiness) and melatonin (the sleep hormone). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Hormones - the main neurotransmitters </h4><br>  Serotonin is one of the most important neurotransmitters, which, as you know, so strongly affects mood, that sometimes it is even called the ‚Äúpleasure hormone‚Äù.  Serotonin itself is produced by the body from the amino acid tryptophan.  Thus, consuming more products with tryptophan, we will add the pleasure hormone to ourselves.  By decreasing tryptophan, it is necessary to consume cheese, meat, fish and peas. <br><br>  Oxytocin is a complex hormone associated with satisfaction and sex.  It is released in the blood when a person gets pleasure from communication.  Oxytocin causes a feeling of satisfaction, a decrease in anxiety and a sense of calm.  Intimacy, affection, pleasant communication - all this contributes to its development.  Lack of oxytocin leads to sociopathy. <br><br>  Dopamine (dopamine) - the hormone of joy.  It gives confidence, dedication and goodwill, and also helps to adapt.  Indecision and shyness is usually a manifestation of dopamine deficiency.  Dopamine causes a feeling of satisfaction, affects the motivation and learning process.  It is produced during sex, eating delicious food, pleasant bodily sensations, memories of something pleasant.  Dopamine production is affected by drugs, nicotine and alcohol. <br><br>  Endorphin ("the hormone of joy").  The chemical structure is close to opiates.  Developed by the body in the neurons of the brain and affect the emotional state.  The safest and most effective way to make endorphins is to play sports. <br><br>  Thyroxine (‚Äúenergy hormone‚Äù) is produced by the thyroid gland.  Affects metabolism, slimness, appetite, vigor, activity, performance, cheerfulness. For health of the thyroid gland and the production of thyroxine should be used iodine-containing products: walnuts, algae, seaweed. <br><br><h4>  Medicinal methods of brain promotion </h4><br>  Perhaps there is only to talk about nootropics.  Nootropics are used in disorders of cerebral circulation, sleep deprivation, fatigue, asthenic and depressive states after traumatic brain injuries and neuroinfections.  Nootropics are also good because they are suitable for both treatment and prophylaxis with the aim of improving mental performance.  In general, nootropic drugs are characterized by relatively low toxicity and a minimum of side effects. <br><br>  Nootropization is the most effective modern method of ‚Äúbuildup‚Äù of the brain and is recommended for use only in specific periods - exam, deadline, interview. <br><br>  Nootropics enhance the supply of blood to the brain, which means glucose and oxygen, improve the "communication" between each other as individual brain cells, as well as its individual parts and hemispheres.  As a result, memory, concentration, intelligence, etc. are improved. <br><br>  An important feature of nootropics is their ability to improve the activity of the hypothalamus, which is called the conductor of the entire hormonal system. <br><br><h4>  Classification of drugs with nootropic action (Voronin and Seredenin) </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Pyrrolidone derivatives (racetam) </td><td>  Piracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam, oxiracetam, etiracetam, nefiracetam, fenotropil. </td></tr><tr><td>  Drugs that enhance cholinergic processes </td><td>  Ipidacrine, Amiridin, takrin, gliatilin </td></tr><tr><td>  GABA-ergic drugs </td><td>  Gamma-aminobutyric acid, pantogam, picamilon, phenibut, sodium hydroxybutyrate </td></tr><tr><td>  Glutamatergic drugs </td><td>  Glycine, memantine </td></tr><tr><td>  Neuropeptides and their analogues </td><td>  Semax, Cerebrolysin </td></tr><tr><td>  Antioxidants and Membrane Protectors </td><td>  Meklofenoxate, Mexidol, Pyritinol </td></tr><tr><td>  Ginkgo biloba preparations </td><td>  Bilobil, tanakan, memenoplant </td></tr><tr><td>  Calcium channel blockers </td><td>  Nimodipine, cinnarizine </td></tr><tr><td>  Cerebral Vasodilators </td><td>  Vinpocetine, nicergolin, instenon </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>  Racetam </h4><br>  One of the most famous drugs of this group of nootropics is piracetam. <br>  It is one of the very first nootropic drugs.  Shown in the first place, with any irregularities in the brain. <br>  Piracetam preparations - Nootropil, Fenotropil, it is desirable to take in the course with cinarizine (improves blood supply to the brain, thereby enhancing the effect of nootropics). <br><br><h5>  Phenotropil </h5><br>  At the moment, it is considered the most powerful allowed nootropic in Russia.  Phenotropil is a powerful neurometabolic with psychogogic activity.  I personally apply it myself on business trips when active conversations in English are required.  I feel a big difference.  In particular, there is an increase in mental and physical performance, as well as a marked reduction in fatigue and drowsiness.  Naturally, for the best effect with fenotropilom together it is necessary to apply the vitamins of group B and something from the vasodilator.  Of the side effects may be raising the threshold of intoxication. <br><br>  The most unpleasant factor in the use of Phenotropil is its high price of about 900 rubles for 30 tablets. <br><br><h4>  Cholinergic enhancers </h4><br>  Preparations of this group directly stimulate excitation in nerve fibers and synaptic transmission in neuromuscular endings. <br><br><h4>  GABA-ergic drugs </h4><br>  All drugs are derivatives of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).  This acid is one of the most important neurotransmitters in the CNS.  GABA preparations cause an increase in the energy processes in the brain.  Also one of the most popular and cheapest of nootropics.  GABA is very well tolerated and has a minimum of side effects. <br>  The most well-known drugs on the basis of GABA are Aminalon, Gammalon, Picamilon, Pantogam (hopantenic acid), Pantocalcin. <br>  We should also mention a very effective drug - phenibut, developed in the USSR, which was even included in the cosmonaut's first-aid kit. <br><br><h4>  Glutamatergic drugs </h4><br>  The glutamatergic system is the part of the brain that is responsible for learning processes and memory functions.  In this group is the cult glycine.  It is well tolerated and almost devoid of side effects. <br><br><h4>  Neuropeptides </h4><br>  Semax is popular in this group.  This is a serious drug that has a multifactorial neuroprotective effect.  It has no side effects. <br><br>  Cerebrolysin is a complex of neuropeptides and trace elements derived from the brain of young pigs.  For over 20 years, it has been used as a neuroprotector and nootropic.  The drug increases the intensity of energy metabolism, protein synthesis in the brain, improves cerebral blood flow.  Causes a tangible effect on the brain during the day.  Performance dramatically increased.  Priced courses for 10 days.  The disadvantage is a very powerful tool, more often than not every six months. <br><br><h4>  Antioxidants and Membrane Protectors </h4><br>  Mexidol has pronounced nootropic and neuroprotective activity.  Increases the intensity of cerebral blood flow. <br><br>  Pyritinol (pyriditol, encephabol) exhibits pronounced nootropic properties in combination with antidepressant and sedative effects, being a low-toxic drug. <br><br><h4>  Ginkgo biloba preparations </h4><br>  Standardized extracts of the relict plant ginkgo biloba (bilobil, memoplant, tanakan, etc.) contain a composition of flavonoids.  These drugs have a complex of pharmacological properties, providing an antioxidant effect, increasing energy metabolism in the brain, improving blood rheology and microcirculation. <br><br><h4>  Calcium channel blockers </h4><br>  By affecting the intracellular calcium concentration, cerebral blood flow can be significantly improved.  One of the best are nimodipine and cinnarizine. <br>  Cinnarizine (stugeron) is a popular drug that improves cerebral circulation and has nootropic properties. <br><br><h4>  Cerebral Vasodilators </h4><br>  Preparations of this group expand the capillaries of the brain. <br>  The most famous is Cavinton (Vinpocetine). <br>  Cavinton and his analogs have proven to be quite effective in the treatment of thinking disorders associated with defects in the blood circulation of the brain in the elderly, for example, due to atherosclerosis.  It is recommended to take in combination with nootropics.  Vinpocetine (cavinton), obtained from the small periwinkle, has been used for about 30 years.  It almost does not cause side effects. <br>  Instenon, which is a combination of three components - hexobandin, etamivan and etofillin, has recently attracted attention not only as a corrector of cerebral circulation, but also as a drug with actually nootropic properties. <br><br><h4>  Prohibited drugs in Russia </h4><br>  Modafinil is an analeptic.  Banned in Russia.  More used as a psychostimulant to suppress drowsiness.  The action is based on reducing one of the dopamine reuptake mechanisms.  It has no side effects and is not addictive.  It is, along with ritalin, one of the most powerful smart dredgs. <br><br>  Ritalin is a psychostimulant, but it has a powerful nootropic effect.  In the US, children are stuffed with this drug from the age of 12.  Upon termination of the action, as well as any psychostimulant, causes severe fatigue, depression and irritation.  Causes psychological dependence. <br><br><h4>  Energetic for neurons </h4><br>  Another useful addition to true nootropics are compounds that increase the "energy" of neurons. <br>  The human brain is very demanding of energy and absorbs up to 50% of all oxygen consumed by the body, using for its needs about 20% of the total energy production of the body. <br>  Under physiological conditions, without starvation, the brain uses a single type of "fuel" - glucose.  Thus, sugar is not just a source of energy for the functioning of neurons, but also a kind of weak "semi-nootropic". <br><br>  Also increases the energy of neurons L-acetylcarnitine and nicotinamide (vitamin PP). <br><br><h4>  A few simple tips to improve your brain. </h4><br>  1. Solve puzzles and puzzles. <br>  2. Pay attention to ambiguity and ambiguity.  Learn to love paradoxes and optical illusions. <br>  3. Develop creative thinking. <br>  4. Transpose Reality.  Always ask yourself: "What if? .." <br>  5. Learn the logic.  Solve logical problems. <br>  6. Exercise. <br>  7. Observe posture. <br>  8. Listen to classical music. <br>  9. Get rid of procrastination (the eternal postponement of cases for later). <br>  10. Play chess, checkers, backgammon ... <br>  11. Develop a sense of humor.  Make up your jokes. <br>  12. Develop observation. <br>  13. Learn a foreign language. <br>  14. Say long words the other way around. <br>  15. Learn to play a musical instrument. <br>  16. Try to mentally evaluate the passage of time. <br>  17. Perform arithmetic calculations in your mind. <br>  18. Do not watch TV.  It slows down the mind. <br>  19. Put yourself in a strange place.  Imagine how other people would solve your problems. <br>  20. Take time for solitude and relaxation. <br>  21. Make a commitment to constantly learn something new. <br>  22. Take a trip abroad.  Learn about different lifestyles. <br>  23. Communicate with those who are close to your interests. <br>  24. Read the classics. <br>  25. Develop self-awareness. <br>  26. Engage in introspection (analysis of your actions and actions) <br>  26. Do not be nervous <br><br><h4>  Finally, some physiology </h4><br>  <b>Sleep</b>  To fully restore brain function, it is enough to sleep for at least 7 hours.  Do not think that a chronic lack of sleep can be compensated by increased sleep time on weekends.  Human studies have shown that attention concentration and other cognitive functions cannot fully recover even after three days of a full night of sleep, which raises the question of the severity of abnormalities in the brain. <br><br>  <b>Sport</b>  Minimum 30 minutes every day or replace with a walk - from 1 hour or more.  Sport contributes to endorphin production.  Endorphins - the most important component of happiness. <br><br>  <b>Alcohol</b>  The outstanding Soviet theoretical physicist Lev Landau said: "... a drunk New Year's glass of champagne deprives me of creative activity for a whole month."  It has been proven that even insignificant use of alcohol significantly reduces skills and brain activity.  According to Spanish scientists, three beers per week can dull the brain activity by 20%.  However, small doses of alcohol were found to stimulate creative activity (but not mental !!!). <br><br>  I wish you all the highest performance and that nootropics are used only in difficult cases. <br>  And watch the power, gentlemen, programmers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239793/</a></p>
