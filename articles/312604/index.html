We have been reading a resource for a long time and now have made a decision not only to read, but also to start, finally, to write.  Immediately introduce ourselves.  We, the company Crossover, are engaged in the employment of IT professionals around the world.  We employ specialists to our clients in Versata, Aurea, 3seventy, Ignite, Ride Austin.  When they need the best professionals, they turn to us in the areas of software development, user interfaces, web design. <br><br>  We are not a freelance exchange, although we are sometimes compared with such.  Our company offers job seekers only full-time, long-term, with high hourly wage rates.  This is due to the fact that we select and employ the best specialists in each of the areas. <a name="habracut"></a>  If some of the customer‚Äôs subdivisions need ‚Äúcheap (and angry :)‚Äù, we suggest they do not contact us, outsourcers or exchanges.  Mostly, we have vacancies from representatives of large businesses (Fortune 1000). <br><br>  At the same time, we love to say that if you wanted to spend Monday with your family or friends - no problem.  Work on a convenient schedule for yourself.  This is, if briefly.  Now let's try to understand more. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <h2>  Work model </h2><br>  Everything is very simple.  As mentioned above, we work with a number of international IT companies.  If one of them needs an employee, we begin to look for a professional for the vacancy. The assessment of the candidate‚Äôs abilities and knowledge is carried out by the Crossover team, based on tasks that are close to what you will do, taking up ‚Äúcombat duty‚Äù.  Thus, the presence of a vacancy <a href="https://www.crossover.com/available-jobs">on the Crossover website means</a> that there is a specific hiring manager in the client company, with whom you will be interviewed on Skype, passing the Crossover selection.  Some of the popular vacancies have many hiring managers and companies under one ‚Äúsignboard‚Äù.  For example, the number of vacancies of <a href="https://www.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/280%3Futm_source%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dcalanding%2522%2520target%3D%2522_blank">Java Chief Software Architect</a> is three-digit. <br><br>  The partner receives a specialist who can solve the necessary tasks.  The specialist receives an interesting job, and we receive an annual commission of 10% over and above his earnings.  Specify that 10% of the hourly payment Crossover receives from the employer during the entire time of the specialist, and not just once.  That is why Crossover is interested in long-term employment of specialists.  This money is paid by the customer, that is, the company that opened the vacancy. <br><br><blockquote>  The salary of professionals employed by us for senior-level specialists is $ 5-8 thousand per month.  It all depends on the level of the specialist and the vacancy itself.  In this case, applicants from the CIS also receive a salary in dollars. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22d/c5d/4ce/22dc5d4ceea6468d9a57ef3e1b390fdf.jpg"><br>  <em>Our founder, Andy Tribe, meet</em> <br><br>  We have already employed more than 2,000 people who work remotely from 110 countries of the world.  The number of employees from the CIS is more than 200. And this is only in a year, because our company was founded by former top Intel manager Andy Tribe in 2015.  Here you can get acquainted with our entire team! <br><br><h2>  And now - step by step </h2><br>  Let's now take a closer look at how it all works.  Here are examples of several jobs: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/280%3Futm_source%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dcalanding%2522%2520target%3D%2522_blank">Java Chief Software Architect</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/641%3Futm_source%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dcalanding%2522%2520target%3D%2522_blank">C ++ Chief Software Architect</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/896%3Futm_source%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dcalanding%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dcalanding%2522%2520target%3D%2522_blank">Software engineering manager</a> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/277/81d/07b/27781d07bc3740cb95cae66493ba86e5.png"></div><br>  To respond - just download the resume in English and go to the next stage - the test.  It includes several tasks (we will say at once, not the simplest ones) in terms of syntax, algorithms, and mathematical apparatus.  The test duration is short - only an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d4/594/d9b/6d4594d9ba92483f82e95c614137c36e.jpg"><br><br>  If all is well, proceed to the next step - the creation of the project.  In Crossover, all tasks performed by candidates for the position are evaluated by software architects.  You are given a task on any of the topics (banking, aviation, finance, etc.), and you begin to work.  Of course, you can complete the task, or you can‚Äôt cope with it.  Both in the first and in the second case our specialists will analyze the work done and give feedback. <br><br>  If you even didn‚Äôt succeed, you can try again for the same vacancy after 3 months.  During this time, you can correct some kind of knowledge gap or gain additional experience.  You can apply for another job without waiting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/097/739/b61/097739b619754a03888b7d3c63b1710b.png"><br><br>  And one more important step is passing the interview.  The HR-manager, as it usually happens, will not conduct it.  No, questions will be asked by one of our software architects.  The purpose of the interview is to understand how well the applicant is suitable for the current position.  Questions will be both purely technical and "managerial".  We will ask a lot, there is even a chance that you will be asked to perform a small task directly ‚Äúlive‚Äù by writing some piece of code to solve it. <br><br>  <em>Note: for vacancies that do not require development, for example, <a href="https://www.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/444">Technical product owner, there</a> are 5 questions that need to be answered in writing.</em>  <em>Questions are related to what you will do in your daily work, and they give you a significantly greater idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe type of work than a job description.</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b86/f73/8ba/b86f738ba45747ddadb7b4cc3d068dc6.jpg"><br><br>  Well, now - employment!  After the conclusion of the contract, you can already consider yourself a sought-after professional who can work from anywhere in the world where there is internet (of course, the width of the channel plays an important role).  No stuffy offices and standing in a row of tables - you can work even from the coast, even from the top of the mountain, where you climbed for the weekend. <br><br><h2>  Working conditions </h2><br>  Requires fluency in spoken English, the ability to participate in regular calls with an international team.  As already mentioned, the work is completely remote.  Monitoring of completed tasks and communication with direct supervisors is performed using specialized software.  We are not going to ask you to spend 8 hours in a row behind a computer screen.  Not at all.  The main thing is to work 40 hours a week.  And when will you work and where is your own business? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/565/423/074/565423074d9240ab81da2690c927a877.jpg"><br><br>  Already thinking how to report to the native tax? <br><br>  Your cooperation with us and your employer, as is customary to say, lies entirely in the legal field, since a service agreement is officially concluded with you.  The source of income and the method of its transfer - Payoneer - are understandable and acceptable for the fiscal authorities and banks of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Report to the tax service can be on the Internet, without losing time on trips to the office.  We recommend to issue IP, it is more profitable, but you can work as a physical person.  We will provide local lawyers and accountants who will help you arrange the necessary documents. <br><br>  In short, the advantages of working through Crossover look like this: <br><br><ul><li>  High wages; </li><li>  Weekly payments to your account; </li><li>  Official contract; </li><li>  Opening hours - 40 hours per week; </li><li>  Long-term work (2-3 years); </li><li>  You can work remotely - from where you want. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Minuses?  let's get a look </h2><br>  As mentioned above, you enter into a contract with Crossover.  But it cannot be considered fully compliant with the norms of the Labor Code in your country (we recruit specialists from various countries).  However, after signing the contract, the customer, having received a valuable specialist, tries to keep him.  Exactly the same is interested in Crossover itself, which spends a lot of money on the selection of specialists and is financially interested in their constant employment. <br><br>  Another disadvantage is the absence of a social package.  But here it is worth remembering that you do not go to the office, you are not exposed to stress (although, of course, it happens, but rarely), and the wage is more than covering almost any social package from most of the standard offers of ordinary companies. <br><br>  The last one - in most cases, your hiring manager will ask you to work with WorkSmart, a time tracking program that ensures the transparency of the specialist‚Äôs work for his employer, taking screenshots from time to time and the specialist himself during his work.  WorkSmart periodically takes screenshots and takes photos using the installed webcam (the presence of such a camera is one of the conditions of work).  Separately, it should be said that activity that is not related to work is not counted and not paid.  When building trust with the manager, exceptions are possible, for example, do not use a webcam (especially important when working in swimming trunks). <br><br><blockquote>  For some reason, there is a perception that, if you work with such software, you have to sit at the PC for many hours without a break, afraid to take an extra breath.  In fact, time tracking is maintained, but at any time you can break away from work and switch to personal affairs by putting the time tracking program on pause. </blockquote><br>  Another disadvantage is that we do not have vacancies that do not require a sufficiently high level of knowledge of English (intermediate and higher). <br><br><h2>  And last </h2><br>  We offer modern work that does not require you to spend time more than necessary.  No compulsory campaigns for demonstrations ... For our part, we promise to find an adequate employer who can provide interesting work for a long-term period of 2-3 years.  From your side, you need professionalism, knowledge of English and readiness to do your job well. <br><br>  We believe that there are more IT professionals in Habr√© than anywhere else.  Probably you have questions? <br><br>  Ask in the comments or email rp@crossover.com.  And, of course, there is more information about <a href="https://www.crossover.com/russia/">Crossover in the CIS</a> and <a href="http://www.crossover.com/russia/faq/">FAQ</a> . <br><br>  Before communication, Habr! <br><br>  <a href="http://ca.crossover.com/">ca.crossover.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312604/</a></p>
