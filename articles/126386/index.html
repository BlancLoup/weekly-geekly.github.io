  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning to write gadget reviews</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are not professional journalists.  Moreover, we are not journalists at all.  We just use some of the techniques that they invented.  One way or another, journalists won't get enough of everyone, while many good ideas turn out to be killed by the mediocre implementation.  After all, many people have often seen (including on Habr√©) how a very curious gadget is literally ‚Äúdrowned‚Äù by a not very good overview.  After draining the karma, the person who wrote such a review often loses any desire to write at all.  And the only fault is that it is not at all his fault, but due to the lack of practice and due enthusiasm, he loses attention to the details, which, if studied properly, turn an unsuccessful review into an amusing reading.  For some time I studied this problem, and came to some conclusions, which (in my humble opinion) may become a kind of manual for those who decide in the future to write some kind of review.  Of course, there are enough talented people among us who can rivet a masterpiece without any manuals, but many people (like me, for example) are not lucky to be born with such talent. <br><br>  As an example, I took the first thing that caught my eye from recently acquired gadgets.  Real-life device: USB-tee from Masterkit.  Useful thing - without any extra gadgets, it is quite reliable and simple. <br><br><img alt="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/312/9e1/ab8/3129e1ab81ec2773a3a17d25518926b4.png" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/312/9e1/ab8/3129e1ab81ec2773a3a17d25518926b4.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Reaction one: ‚ÄúWell, you give ... And do such things reviews?  0_o <br><br>  Yes, it turns out, they do.  We will now break down into stages some moments of writing reviews, just using the example of this device, very simple, but quite interesting - just what is needed for such a manual.  Our "instruction for writing reviews for beginners" is divided into separate stages, which facilitates the understanding of what is written.  So, let's begin! <br><br><h1>  Text </h1><br><br>  If we give this device to a familiar marketer, then in about 5 minutes it will produce a text similar to the following: <br><br>  <i>USB-tee 220V + 2 USB.</i>  <i>In the package was a plug and instruction in Chinese.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I did not immediately plug the plug into the 220 socket - this is not for real Jedi, instead, first I inserted a wire with an mp3 player into the USB and then put the whole structure into the socket.</i>  <i>The player was charged, which was indicated by a diode light on the plug, which replaced the alarming orange color with a calm green color.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Pros:</i> <ul><li>  charges </li><li>  does not fall out of the socket </li></ul><br><br>  Minuses: <ul><li>  doesn't smell like raspberries </li><li>  when in the outlet - mosquitoes in the room do not die </li></ul><br><br>  Well, then in the same spirit.  And figs with him that the kit did not have a plug and instructions, and the light, in fact, blue.  This is not so important. <br><br>  The important thing is that we can do something better. <br><br><h1>  Pictures </h1><br><br>  You will tell about how to expose color, light and similar things as well as I do.  However, we compare 2 images - one with a frame around, and the other without a frame.  Trifle, but how it changes. <br><br><img width="350" alt="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif" src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif"><img width="350" alt="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif" src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif"><br><br>  How to visually increase the size of the review?  Follow a simple sequence: some text - an image - some more text - another image.  Appears saturation of the article.  Approximately so framed and this article. <br><br>  If the review object is not large, then a photo session with a penny is obligatory, so that readers have the opportunity to estimate the size of this subject. <br><br><img width="350" alt="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c74/3e4/f81/c743e4f8100bcbd4480ffacf63b13c01.jpg" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c74/3e4/f81/c743e4f8100bcbd4480ffacf63b13c01.jpg"><br><br>  If the object is large, you can specify its size in the form of a drawing. <br><br><img width="350" alt="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif" src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif">  Drawn in <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/">nanocada</a> <br><br><h1>  Chip </h1><br><br>  Any device has a chip or even several. <br><br>  Chips of our tee. <br><br>  Chips are serious: <br><br><ul><li>  Combination 2 USB with a regular outlet - the socket is not clogged and can continue to be used as intended </li><li>  Voltage stabilizer - it protects the tender contents of our equipment from sudden surges, thereby prolonging its life </li><li>  220V sockets to be closed.  Now there just will not get anything. </li></ul><br><br>  Chips frivolous <br><ul><li>  Screws - I saw such cogs only once in my life, namely in this device.  But I had the right screwdriver! </li></ul><br><br><img width="350" alt="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif" src="http://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d3/8af/410/0d38af41015fe17dda1f33d1983c1b56.gif"><br><br>  You can see what's inside - suddenly there is also something curious. <br><br><img width="350" alt="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eeb/39e/150/eeb39e1509eac09052c7450b8d3be050.jpg" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eeb/39e/150/eeb39e1509eac09052c7450b8d3be050.jpg"><br><br>  And how it looks at work. <br><br><img width="350" alt="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b4/89e/3e9/6b489e3e9630167637ef6227892f5470.jpg" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b4/89e/3e9/6b489e3e9630167637ef6227892f5470.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Personal sensations </h1><br><br>  This item is optional.  We tell why we chose this device, and not some other one.  About the tee, I would say something like the following. <br><br>  If you compare the tee with adapters from <a href="http://best-kindle.blogspot.com/2009/11/kindle-replacement-power-adapter.html">Kindle</a> or their Chinese counterparts, then in size they, of course, win.  But!  Each adapter takes up a socket in the outlet.  Plus, the vast majority are adapters, that is, the input is 220 V, and the output is USB.  Here, the output connectors 2, plus a socket into which you can plug another device.  I, for example, have 2 sockets near the table.  In one I stick a lamp, in another a soldering iron.  Well, where should I stick the phone to charge?  And so povytykal everything you need, and use.  Plus, for some reason, the adapters get very hot, but this kid, even when fully loaded, remained a bit warm. <br><br><h1>  And also ... </h1><br><br>  And you can also write an article about how to write reviews.  Well, something like this.  Hope you enjoyed it.  By the way, the gadget described in the review, as well as many other devices of MasterKit, can be found on <a href="http://gadgets.masterkit.ru/%3Fhabr%3Dmt4012">this page</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126386/</a></p>
