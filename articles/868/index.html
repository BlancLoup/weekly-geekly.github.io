  <section class="page js-page"><h1>User Escort</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I looked through several of the largest web projects of different countries (and, partly, their statistics) with the aim of conferring on them the honorary title of ‚Äúweb dvanol‚Äù (in my head, naturally).  At the same time, I did not take into account the common obvious aspects of the Internet sites of the new generation (Ajax, human-readable URLs and other Labudeni) and did not take into account thematic web projects, all sections of which are united by one line. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Checked only for attractiveness, coherence and clarity from the point of view of different categories of visitors. <br><br>  Started with Google.  The main page is laconic itself.  It is extremely clear why people work and what are the world leaders.  This is a search.  We get on the main only search, although the company has more than 20 equally large projects. <br>  Google started to work as a search engine.  They continue to be.  The probability that a web user, visiting the site by accident, is lost, is minimized.

      Then again, a positive experience.  Yandex.  The system also from the very beginning to this day is positioned as a search engine.  Everything else is attached, though not less important.  On the main page of Yandex we see the absolute dominance of news information, and certainly not from a series of entertainment.  The home page of the site is happy to accept people working with Yandex.  For people having fun with Yandex, there is ya.ru and other bells and whistles ( <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/white.html">www.yandex.ru/white.html</a> , for example). <br><br>  Then I looked at the site of the once mogul web industry Yahoo.  It immediately became clear why the guys had problems.  No classification and sorting of its users.  On the left are piled links to all sections of the site.  Among them (the sequence is restored) - finances and games.  Made very wrong.  The financier rarely needs a reference to games, and a gamer needs finances.  It's so easy! <br>  With Yahu everything is clear.  Five years ago, when the cost of the company exceeded 150 billion (the current, by the way, the cost of Google), the management and developers relaxed the buns, resting on their laurels.  In the end - what we see. <br><br>  In the footsteps of the eldest (?) American brother, Mail.Ru boldly strides.  The only thing that keeps the site among the industry leaders is an attractive domain name and a popular brand.  Such a large amount of commercial information (advertising, banners, links to ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù projects) cannot be found on any large web-based Runet project.  No observability of the main information on the pages with other sections of the site to which links are indicated  Looking through the mail, you can see the offer to read about Beyonce, which was filmed for gays.  Fucking me Beyonce? <br><br>  Ukrainian web projects have a scheme similar to all the listed projects (mentality, nothing can be done).  In some (Bigmir, Ai. Yua, Waportal ...) - a dump from the sections a la "we advise you to see everything that we have", others (Meta, UkrNet) - a clear focus on certain categories of users. <br><br>  Competently formed ‚Äútype user escort‚Äù (maintenance of certain categories of visitors on the site until they receive the necessary information) in multi-thematic Ukrainian websites does not exist. <br><br>  The user sees the same advertisement (often, regardless of the section), the same page layout, links to other, absolutely irrelevant to his requests, sections of the project.  The result is something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bb5/dae/ee1/bb5daeee191e36017aa81f041e365d9e.gif" width="420" height="390" alt="Unpowered Users Stream"><br><br>  The basic principle of the UE (user escort) is to restrict the user from unnecessary, interfering elements when viewing the most important information for him.  To determine the pertinence (the ratio of the amount of useful information to the total amount received), there are many ways, starting with the questions ‚ÄúDid this information help you?‚Äù, Ending with the analysis of page navigation statistics. <br><br>  Among all the positive aspects of UE, I want to note two: the formation of a positive user experience of the site and the creation of a permanent audience. <br><br>  Of course, the UE involves changing most of the programming.  Many website managers are simply not ready for this.  So we end up with the development of Western projects focused on user convenience, and the dying of domestic convenience-oriented owners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/868/</a></p>
