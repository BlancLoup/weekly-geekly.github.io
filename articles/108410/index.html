The purpose of such meetings is to give, what is called, direct access to the bodies of those who are at the helm of the company, is responsible for the development of certain trends, Opera products or technologies. <br><br>  "Big bosses" - this is certainly very pathetic said.  And Opera - the company is not pretentious at all.  In the sense that they really rule large projects, but they are very accessible for discussions, questions, wishes, they like to joke and laugh in good company.  Well, in order to even more liberate all the participants of such meetings, we spend them over beer / tea / coffee in various cozy cafes and bars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next week there will be several such meetings in different cities and even countries :) And different top managers will participate in them.
