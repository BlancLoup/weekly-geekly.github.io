    <blockquote>  To all of us who use advanced communication tools, those who are used to living and working in the network, those who believe that the latest technologies in the IT field are the engine of progress and the most important component of the country's economy, it is obvious to us that the introduction of unjustified restrictions in the Internet sphere is an obstacle and a brake on the development of society and the state. <br><br>  We do not want to remain cut off from the process of discussing new bills in the field of Internet and information technology.  We care what decisions are made and we want our opinion to be heard.  Because the Internet is our environment, our home and place where we have found application for our talents, business ideas, freedoms and ways of self-expression. <br><br>  We are ready not only to express our comments, but also to make proposals, discuss and come to consensus options for solving these problems. <br><br>  We do not agree that the public opinion is not taken into account.  For all of us, those who are not indifferent to the fate of the Internet in Russia, only real public discussions involving a large number of experts make sense and legitimacy.  We will ensure that our proposals and comments on legislation in the field of Internet and information technology are meaningful and binding on government bodies. </blockquote><br><br>  As a first ball, we propose to hold as wide a public discussion as possible of the new version of the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù law proposed by the Ministry of Culture, already known for offering millions of fines and expanding the list of categories of copyright objects that will be subject to blockages and new burdens for Internet resource owners, hosting providers and telecom operators. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On Habr√© there was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/208652/">news about this legislative act</a> , which the Ministry of Culture recently submitted on the state site <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/project/11306.html%3Fpoint%3Dview_project%26stage%3D1%26stage_id%3D4368">Regulation.gov.ru</a> .  The Ministry of Culture collects suggestions and comments by e-mail until February 9.  There is no live interactive exchange of views.  The further fate of such proposals remains incomprehensible. <br><br>  We do not agree with this principle of public discussion. <br><br>  We have created a special platform where every Internet user can not only evaluate the whole law, but also comment on each of his articles separately and vote for the suggestions of other users.  The new public platform should be an alternative to the state systems of discussion of draft laws that either do not work systematically or only create the appearance of work. <br><br>  At the same time, the new resource ‚Äú <a href="http://talk.rublacklist.net/">Speak Over the Internet</a> ‚Äù will be open for absolutely everyone.  It is planned to involve in the discussion experts from IT business, public and non-profit organizations, political parties, as well as authors of draft laws and representatives of government agencies.  Naturally, the site is open to all Internet users. <br>  To make full use of its capabilities, we offer to log in through your chosen social network.  But at the same time, it remains possible to simply leave your comment without authorization with limited functionality. <br><br>  Of course, this resource will not stand still; we accept all suggestions and comments on its functionality and work: <br>  - to the e-mail address indicated on the portal itself in the basement, <br>  - to me in PM <br>  - in the comments to this post. <br><br>  We also plan to introduce new sections and additions on the site, but in order not to lose a limited time of discussion, we decided to launch this portal right now, otherwise the opportunity to present officials and the consensus opinion of society and IT specialists to the State Duma will be lost to the officials. <br><br>  We propose not only to exchange views, but also we will convey them to the relevant departments and publish information about ‚Äúhow officials act with comments and suggestions on bills received from society.‚Äù <br><br>  From the media: <br><br>  Artem Kozlyuk, Project Manager of <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">RosKomSvoboda</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe decided to organize such a platform because the state did not reach out to make an adequate modern system of public discussion.  Yes, some legislative acts are published on various state-owned Internet resources, but they do not provide for systematic discussions and the organization of the expert community.  At the same time, society has long had a request to state its position on all high-profile issues.  And we provide them with this platform that exactly corresponds to our plans to develop freedom of thought, speech and information. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Pavel Rassudov, member of the Headquarters of the <a href="http://pirate-party.ru/">Pirate Party of Russia</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe problem is that public discussions in our country do not have a legitimate legal status.  Today, our site is illegitimate, as indeed any state.  But it is also much more modern, it is more open and better technically - the most resonant Internet projects will be discussed in detail.  And most importantly, it will not be abandoned a month after launch, as usually happens with the projects of officials, which no one enters.  At the site we intend to gather experts and ordinary users, and we will welcome representatives of the opposite side - for example, to discuss the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù law - the opinion of the authors of the works.  We would like it to be a free and open space for discussion. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  The ‚ÄúAnti-piracy‚Äù law from the Ministry of Culture is only the first law that appeared on the site ‚Äú <a href="http://talk.rublacklist.net/">We speak for the Internet</a> ‚Äù, created for holding public discussions of resonant laws.  Further, on the court of society, bills and other documents relating to the regulation of the Internet sphere, IT-area, e-democracy and related areas that are presented on any state or industry Internet portals or have already been submitted to the State Duma will be proposed. <br><br>  Judge strictly! <br>  And we and those bills that will be proposed for public comment. <br><br>  The time of our common silence and inaction has come to an end. <br>  # We speak for Internet <br><br>  <a href="http://talk.rublacklist.net/">talk.rublacklist.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://digit.ru/internet/20140114/410720053.html">digit.ru/internet/20140114/410720053.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209034/</a></p>
