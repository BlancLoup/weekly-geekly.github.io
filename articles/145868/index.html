      Now, probably, the necessary explanations - hardly everyone knows what MITx is and a little about the process through the eyes of a student. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/138198/">About the course itself</a> <br><br>  Briefly about the training (ask questions if you are interested in some details): It all started with a small set of videos that told about how the course will be conducted, about the schedule, about the honor code.  All lectures were organized in 14 weekly sets, with two tracks in each set.  The track is 10-20 videos for 5-10 minutes, they are abundantly interspersed with tasks that need to be solved and give answers.  Some of the tasks are solved intuitively, the other part (according to my feelings - more) - requires solutions on paper.  Again, some of the tasks ask about the numerical solution, i.e.  You can score an equation in Excel or MatLab and without any problems get an answer or pick a parameter.  Part asks to write the solution in algebraic form.  A couple of examples: <br><br>  (1 / (C * w * j)) * (R + j * w * L) / ((1 / (C * w * j)) + (R + j * w * L)) <br><br>  (1 / K + RS * (vIN-VT) -sqrt (1 / (K ^ 2) + 2 * RS * (vIN-VT) / K)) / (RS ^ 2) <br><br>  I estimate my work for about ten hours per week, of which six hours per lecture (three per track) and four hours at homework (most often from Saturday to Sunday).  The tasks are really difficult (for me), often capture the material of the next lecture, where they tell you how to solve the problem easier. <br><br>  In order to successfully complete the course, I had to ‚Äúremember‚Äù the mathematics, or rather, learn to find the derivative, integrate, solve difures, and work with complex numbers anew.  Not that it was a comprehensive course in mathematics, but rather several techniques for solving equations of a certain type. <br><br>  Each weekly set has a lab where you have to solve a problem, usually a circuit design, i.e.  draw a scheme (unpretentious) and pick up the nominal components to meet the conditions of the problem.  Most of the labs are unpretentious, but when doing one, I barely broke my head on the table. <br><br>  Sets are published every week and you have about three weeks to study the material.  During these three weeks will be published two more sets.  If you postpone for later (as I would only seem to be a student, hands remember :-)), then you will always be under pressure - you will prolong the term and that's it, the answers are not accepted. <br><br>  Of all the households (12) and lab (12), the best 10 (those and those) are counted.  Those.  two theoretically can prodinamit.  But if you don‚Äôt do them, you‚Äôll almost surely fail one or two questions for each homework that was not done on the exam. <br><br>  Examinations are published after the 7th and after the 14th weeks.  Their duration is much less - 4, perhaps, a day.  If, again, you postpone the homework for later, then at some point you need to first spend the time to decide the homework, and then another exam to write - no one will push it back.  Baska explodes. <br><br>  The first (midterm) exam I did for 4 hours, it was quite simple.  I wrote the final, probably, hours 8-9.  And managed to make two mistakes.  As a result, 96% for the final exam and 98% for the entire course.  Certificates issue two - with an assessment and without.  Each certificate is registered with a link, passing on which you can check the validity of the certificate. <br><br>  Feelings are mixed.  Joy, pride, emptiness, etc.  Remember yourself after defending a diploma (I stupidly sat in the Bauman canteen and chewed buckwheat from the basics, completely unaware of what had happened and how I would live on - these were similar feelings after passing the MITx exam).  Yes, and a strange feeling from the fact that it was the first and only course from MITx, they decided to unite with Harvard and do EdX ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143226/">scandals, intrigues, investigations</a> ).  But the main feeling - IT TOGO STANDING, I WANT MORE.  In general, if you think "it is worth it or not it is worth it" - definitely worth it. <br><br>  UPDATE 1. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kibizoidus/" class="user_link">kibizoidus</a> <br>  <i>Oh, it's nice to see another graduate from Russian-speaking countries!</i>  <i>Aloha, in general, heh ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Our small group of 3 people (one Moskvich, 2 Kharkovskin) coordinated to engage mainly in the second half of the week.</i>  <i>We immediately agreed on terminology: A video series is a lecture, tasks and problems in the middle of lectures are practical, and homework / labs need no introduction.</i>  <i>So did.</i>  <i>At the lecture and practical training, it took 2-3 evenings for complete awareness and chewing, and after both weekends 5-6 hours were done at home.</i>  <i>It came out from 15 to 25 hours a week, which was a shock therapy for my wife and child.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What is most interesting, no one gave a banal to write off anyone, although the temptation was ^ _ ^</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There were no special problems with mathematics (Only exclamations of ‚ÄúZOMG !!!‚Äù when you first viewed Annotated PDF), Tutorials and Wikipedia described in great detail the process of solving practically any such task from homework, etc.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Separate joy is Circuit Sandbox.</i>  <i>Later I found similar modeling systems as independent-projects, but nevertheless the use of a sandbox saved me and my friends a great deal of time to recalculate the standard moments of Node analysis.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The final exam for me turned out to be the hardest ... Almost daily run, after which I still sleep.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And, yes, a sense of pride that you are one of almost 5% of survivors - that's cool!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>My certificate now hangs behind my back in the office ^ _ ^</i> <br><br>  UPDATE 2. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/halyavin/" class="user_link">halyavin</a> <br>  <i>My feelings about complexity are in many ways opposite.</i>  <i>The tasks are simple, but I often confused the sign or indicated the answer in the wrong units.</i>  <i>Labor costs - 2-3 hours per week.</i>  <i>Since fast-forwarding leads to hangs, you had to watch videos on youtube without subtitles.</i>  <i>In many commercials, it is enough to see the first and last couple of tens of seconds.</i>  <i>Derivatives, integrals and dif.</i>  <i>Equations in the course are only the simplest.</i>  <i>I can‚Äôt forget how to solve them for good reason.</i>  <i>The main difficulties in solving problems were in the development of correct intuition and the reduction of problems to mathematics.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The final exam is 2-3 hours, an hour break and somewhere else an hour for the last task, in which I tried for a long time to understand what nonsense I am doing, but it turned out that I entered the wrong order in one place and made a mistake in 1000 times.</i>  <i>The result is 100%.</i>  <i>But since only 3 attempts are given, it was not as easy as I thought.</i>  <i>Well, in general, during the course created a forgotten feeling of studying at the university.</i>  <i>Only at the university can you not flush lecturer forward;).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the end, I think the time spent was worth studying how the online courses look and feel.</i>  <i>Well, the knowledge gained of course.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>PS It's easier to protect a diploma, I remember only the exams that they did not allow me to pass, putting the machine gun.</i>  <i>We mathematicians, a lot different.</i> <br><br>  UPDATE 3. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/pavelkrishtalskiy/" class="user_link">PavelKrishtalskiy</a> <br>  <i>I would like to add that the course itself is beautifully illustrated with very detailed, sometimes even meticulous chewing of the material.</i>  <i>I repeatedly rewound the rollers, because I was bored again to watch the output of the formula for charging the capacitor, etc.</i>  <i>:) But, in my opinion, this is the megaflash of this course - a detailed explanation of each action of the lecturer gives an understanding of what is happening.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I do not want to arrange a black PR, but still I will give for comparison a course on Game Theory on coursera.org, which was held in parallel.</i>  <i>Some conclusions were completely incomprehensible and not substantiated in any way, the speech of lecturers is at times illegible.</i>  <i>In the end, I just built for myself an algorithm for solving problems with a poor understanding of why it is necessary to do so.</i>  <i>Those tasks that fit into the algorithm - solved without problems.</i>  <i>Tasks that required understanding were more likely to guess than consciously solve.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Well, I can not pay attention to the lecturer himself: it is felt that he is directly rushing from what he tells.</i>  <i>All these ‚Äúsome fun‚Äù and ‚Äúbig a-ha moment‚Äù are charged with some kind of extra energy.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I really hope that EdX courses will inherit this feature of the course and will be at the same level.</i> <br><br>  UPDATE 4. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/avenat/" class="user_link">AveNat</a> <br>  <i>Circuits &amp; Electronics is great!</i>  <i>These fourteen weeks I received from him not only knowledge, but also a good mood (that same fun ^ _ ^).</i>  <i>Lecturer - cool uncle, charisma is felt even through slideshows.</i>  <i>The only thing I regret is that because of force majeure, it did not really work out to sit over the exam (76% as a result).</i>  <i>But most importantly, I understood the course material.</i>  <i>Really feel smarter :)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Separately, I want to mention the convenient design of MITx - for me it is ahead of Udacity and Cousera by a large margin.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Summary: it was great, I want more!</i> <br><br>  UPDATE 5. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/eldraco/" class="user_link">elDraco</a> <br>  <i>I think I agree with almost all the previous speakers :) Professor Agarwal reads just fine, I can probably remember no more than 2-3 teachers in my university from whose lectures I had similar sensations.</i>  <i>And the most important thing that I didn‚Äôt expect from the recorded lectures was the wisps, inaccuracies and other ordinary trivialities corrected on the go, the lectures greatly benefit from this in terms of their ‚Äúliveliness‚Äù.</i>  <i>I personally had a strong tension, I didn‚Äôt always have enough time, I tried to see the lectures during the week, and on Saturday I slept at my homework and lab.</i>  <i>Considering that at the university my electronics course was very frail and, from the whole course in advance, I, perhaps, remembered only the frequency formula of the oscillating circuit, I gained considerable knowledge.</i>  <i>The only thing that was not mastered was the demonic vacuum triode, and, due to the fault of the ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù Roslecom, I did not count one week in labs and homework due to the lack of Internet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And yes author you are simply obliged to add the tag "big aha moment".</i> <br><br>  UPDATE 6. Adding from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/vertu77/" class="user_link">Vertu77</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145868/">habrahabr.ru/post/145868/#comment_4919590</a> &lt;-read, it is worth.
