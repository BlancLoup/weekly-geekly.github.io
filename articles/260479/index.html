      <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule"><b>Python section</b></a> <br><br>  In the section on the Python language on DevConf-2015 this year will be a lot of interesting things.  The conference will begin with a presentation by Andrei Svetlov, a developer of AsyncIO, who will talk about that library, implementing asynchronous network programming in Python 3. Sergey Lihobabin (head of the internal development department of Mail.Ru Group) will talk about the mechanism for managing rights and access at the object level using the example of Django- protector.  Next, there will be a report by Alexander Emelin on Centrifuge, an open-source server for sending real-time messages for web applications that works with both the Websockets protocol and SockJS.  Ilya Beda will tell about the peculiarities of working with view and DB. After lunch, the section‚Äôs listeners will be given a master class on asynchronous programming from Andrei Svetlov, and Ruslan Askarov‚Äôs report on Django DB Mailer will close the conference. <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule"><b>Ruby section</b></a> <br><br>  Ruby today is one of the most dynamically developing programming languages, and at DevConf-2015 you will hear a lot of interesting things about it.  The section will be opened by Dmitry Galinsky‚Äôs report about scaling up the development, choosing the right tools and approaches to solving problems.  About the operation of RoR projects in the production will tell Egor Baranov.  In addition to the so-called  tactical reports, there will also be speeches related to solving specific practical problems: the correct work with time zones from Andrey Novikov, the creation of fast and fault-tolerant services on EventMachine from Alexey Martynyuk.  A review report about EVentMachine will introduce Nikoaly Norkin, he will tell about its pros and cons as well as a brief overview of features and tools.  Bookmate developers Alexey Nikitin and Eugene Lee will tell about the principles of building distributed databases, collecting and processing statistics on reading books.  In the afternoon there will be reports about Tarantool, Sharding, Nginx and in-depth analytics of the real speed of the site, as well as on working with requirements in a startup. <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule"><b>Javascript section</b></a> <br><br>  JavaScript today is definitely experiencing a rebirth.  There are many new frameworks, technologies and solutions.  The first report from Mikhail Chernobrov will be about the integration of Webpack and RoR applications.  After a short coffee break, DevConf 2015 visitors will hear a report about TypeScript in the eyes of PHP developer Alexander Mayorov.  The report is devoted to the problems of modern JavaScript and ways to solve them using TypeScript.  About HTML5 Web Components, Andrei Rakhmanov will tell us.  He will tell you how it is more convenient to work with web components, taking into account the current state of implementation, and also give advice on where to lay straws at your own start of work with web components.  Next, listeners will have an overview of innovative push notifications based on Google Chrome.  Vasilika Klimova, Artec Group's interface developer, will tell us about interactive 3D graphics using WebGL.  Then in our frontend section there will be a report about the device of the ReactNative framework, what goals it pursues and how it relates to the React project.  After lunch, there will be reports about Scala.js, creating maps of the game world on the Yandex.Maps API, designing the network manager's architecture for iOS.  The section closes the section ‚ÄúYear of Work Standing‚Äù by Anton Kalyaev and ‚ÄúIntellectual Property in IT‚Äù by Oleg Abramenko. <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule"><b>Storage Section</b></a> <br><br>  Vladimir Fedorkov will open a section on the storage of large amounts of information.  He will talk about how to survive the load jump on MySQL, how to prepare for it and what measures to take when everything is ready to explode.  Egor Rogov will tell visitors about transactions and simultaneous access, make a comparison of implementations in PostgreSQL and Oracle.  But about the use of PostgreSQL in practice in a particular project, Mikhail Tyurin will tell - the main system architect of Avito.  Pro monitoring and debugging of MySQL will be a report from Sveta Smirnova, a recognized database wizard and author of the book ‚ÄúMySQL Troubleshooting‚Äù.  Oleg Tsarev tells about asynchronous replication and comparison of this aspect of MySQL and PostgreSQL.  He will discuss with the audience not only asynchronous replication as such, but also errors that may occur during cluster design.  A very important aspect of working with data is backup.  Aleksey Kopytov's report ‚ÄúScaling backups: comparison of backup utilities for MySQL‚Äù will be devoted to this.  After that, there will be reports about the graph database DB Neo4j and the distributed versioned transactional web-based FS Djavur, and Leonid Yurev's report on OpenLDAP and its insides, namely the LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database) engine from Symas Corporation, will close the section. <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule">DevOps Section</a> <br><br>  The first report of the section will be about the technology that is developing today at a truly insane rate - OpenStack.  With the support of vendors and opensource community, the progress in this direction is truly amazing.  Ilya Aleksev will talk about why OpenStack hooked him in 2010 and does not let go until now.  The next report will be about testing infrastructure as a code.  Alexander Chistyakov presents us with two reports in a row: about combining different monitoring systems and about options for using Docker.  But about why the Mail.Ru Group is doing its own monitoring and how they unite the whole zoo of monitoring tools of various projects among themselves will be told by Sergey Likhobabin.  Quite an interesting report about the service of determining the botness (the number of bots in social networks) will be presented to the listeners by Yuri Agapov from SmartCrade.  Well, the section is closed by reports on Domain-driven Design in practice and alternative motivation of developers. <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/schedule"><b>Common Section</b></a> <br><br>  The main section of DevConf 2015 will begin with a report by Sergey Konstantinov about the API, why it is needed, how to design, promote and accompany it.  This report will be of interest to a wide audience: both managers and API developers themselves.  After the coffeebreak, there will be a report about refactoring applications using Go: how to approach the task of refactoring, how to sell it to the customer and also about the pitfalls of developing and supporting a high-loaded project.  Yuriy Nasretdinov‚Äôs reports on the photo storage architecture in Badoo and Gleb Kosolapov on the mobile application API will continue the section, and Aleksey Yaroshevich will tell visitors about templating, its internal problems and approaches to use.  After lunch, Badoo speakers will delight listeners with a report about downloading large amounts of data for business intelligence and the ETLMaster tool created to automate the management of transformation and data loading.  Next will be a report about the reduction of connectivity and refactoring of the old project.  I am sure many have faced such a task, and it will not be superfluous to adopt someone else‚Äôs experience.  The author of the report will tell how in their company pr-cy.ru solved this problem.  Grigory Kochanov was given the honor of closing the Common section with the report ‚ÄúProject Management during the Crisis‚Äù and Alexei Romanchuk, who will tell you about the back-end jet streams, their construction principles, problems and solutions. <br><br>  Conference Partners: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/badoo/">BADOO</a> , TI-ME.RU, REG.RU, IT-SOFT.RU, CENTOS-ADMIN.RU, POSTGRESPRO.RU, TVM.RU <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/"><b>See you at DevConf 2015!</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260479/</a></p>
