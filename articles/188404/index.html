      Today, a year and a half since I started selling on the Internet and developing these same stores. <br><br>  The theme is peculiar: heating and water supply. <br>  The region of action is Ukraine. <br><br>  The firm on the basis of which it all happens is engaged in the sale of this very technology and the production of heating equipment. <br>  A year and a half ago, I had a job question, I left the old company where I worked, dialed the phone of my new boss, and after a day I was sitting in the office and started working. <br><br>  If you are wondering what happened next <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Although the company was at that time already with 15 years of experience in this market on the Internet, it was a complete underdog. <br><br>  There was a question - how to fix it? <br><br>  There were two sensible options for the development of the situation: <br>  1- store development from scratch <br>  2- deployment of activities on the finished site. <br><br>  Taking into account that the boss wanted ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù, the second option was chosen, placement on one of the leading resources in this area was paid, this happiness cost about $ 350 for half a year <br><br>  For the first month of work, with the correct filling of the store, it has fully paid off. <br>  Then went to work on the filling, all positions were made manually, except for the photo. <br>  Retail prices, as the company values ‚Äã‚Äãits image very much. <br><br>  Despite all this, the store began to develop, after half a year there was again a payment of $ 350. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/971/0b3/da99710b3503b7cc827a5d51659f3ffb.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  While the store was filling, he studied the assortment, delved into the nuances of the work, arranged logistical issues. <br><br>  As a result, a fairly good scheme was developed which works now. <br><br>  1 - The most detailed information is available on the site. <br>  2 - when a person calls all calls are sorted into two streams <br>  a - a person clearly knows what he needs - coordinates are written where to send and go to paragraph 4 (only 20-30% but with better quality <br>  filling the more this percentage) <br>  b - a person does not know what he needs and he needs to pick up <br>  3 - we go to the specialist of his direction, he selects, agreed with the customer. <br>  4 - if sending by cash on delivery (90% of orders, we send, the person receives, pays, the carrier returns us money) <br>  ship the same day <br>  5- if the prepayment is on a bank card or by bank transfer, wait for payment and send. <br><br>  According to this scheme, 5 people participate in the work, and 4 of them are specialists in their own fields. <br><br>  At a certain point in time, it was decided that one store is good, but since the company's image is the most expensive thing to do, the second one. <br>  And then began dancing with a tambourine. <br><br>  To create your store you need design and competent content. <br><br>  Since I had experience in e-commerce, I had the formation of a core of requests for promotion and recommendations for the development of a store ordered in a good SEO studio.  (What are many times happy!) <br><br>  <u>If you order SEO in advance, then it saves a lot of time and nerves, and most importantly money.</u> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eed/001/825/eed001825be77b0d2e8664e0e4e3a8de.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  With the design was also not particularly difficult, there were amateur skills with web programming and working with photoshop and for a long 3 months the design was born and laid out.  In the process everything was altered many times, it was specified. <br>  If at this moment the chef and everyone says they say "Do what would have happened, and then we will fix it" - <s>spit in the face of these people</s> do not listen and make it so that it would be practical and for the next year you would have no desire to redo it from scratch. <br><br>  The store engine chose Opencart for several reasons: <br><ul><li>  There is a person who writes modules for this platform. </li><li>  Differs in simplicity of work and good functionality "Out of the box" </li><li>  MVC (greatly simplifies layout issues) </li></ul><br>  Since SEO was ordered in advance and thanks to the first store there was a clear understanding of what was asked, most often, detailed instructions on how to fill the store were quickly formed. <br><br>  The manager who processes orders deals with content, since orders are not a very big wave yet, he is filling it with high quality and <s>physically punished is harshly physically</s> important to strictly control his good faith. <br><br>  April 4th shop was launched. <br><br>  Immediately began to be placed on the price-aggregator. <br>  A very useful thing for new stores, with an average cost of $ 60 per month, there is a good influx of buyers. <br>  At the same time, we started SEO promotion on one of the automatic promotion sites.  I know that this is not the best option, but for now the questions only low-frequency effect is very good. <br><br>  For low key as a brand of equipment, the site is already in the top 5 of Yandex and Google and gives customers. <br>  SEO costs around $ 150 per month. <br><br>  Conversion is 1.5% taking into account that the products are mildly not everyday use.  (Do you often buy pumps for home?) <br>  Plus products exclusively Italian. <br><br>  Thanks to Yandex metrics, and more specifically to Webvisor, the conversion turns out to be slowly raised, initially it was 0.5%. <br><br>  A very strong effect was the placement of unique photos. <br><br>  At the moment, the store is moving forward successfully, <br><br>  In all of this there are for me the following useful thoughts: <br><br>  1 - Do not save on SEO! <br>  2 - Make a good design. <br>  3 - Stay on price aggregators. <br>  4 - Constantly watch what happens with the store and do not be afraid to experiment. <br><br>  In parallel, I would like to add the following information: <br><ol><li>  What would make an online store a lot of mind is not necessary, but if you want to make a good, profitable and enjoyable work - kindly study the theory, examples of other projects, it‚Äôs not for nothing that Amazon having virtually unlimited possibilities does not weigh its store of ryushechek. </li><li>  It is not always better to start working for yourself from the very start.  Two stores bring good profits, and I have a lot of offers and a great temptation to take them away from Uncle. It seems there will be more money but an understanding comes clearly - as long as you don‚Äôt understand anything in business, you need a mentor and a person who will take over dirty work, banks, tax, accounting, purchases - with stupidity you can mess things up like you can't figure out for a year. </li><li>  Always share the fact that you have a new and interesting with others, it will allow you to find people with the same hobbies who will share useful information with you. </li><li>  Placing at the start and in the process of working at third-party sites ala proma or thiur doesn‚Äôt bear harm, it gives a good financial flow to develop your own project that comes from scratch and is unlikely to achieve anything without funding. </li></ol><br>  If anyone has questions about how this all happens or which item is of more interest, I‚Äôm happy to tell you what and how. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188404/</a></p>
