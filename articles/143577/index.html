  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Structuring data: what to do with the Internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Increasingly appear topics that are devoted to the problems of data storage, retrieval and structuring.  And the sources of the topics themselves grow because of the unpleasant fact that sometimes you have no opportunity to find something, even the simplest.  And as a result of searches, people find entertainment portals and things on which they settle.  For example, the latest topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143550/">Ideal personal information manager - what is it?</a>  , in it the author mentions the situation about the search for some specific formula.  And that in some strange way the search for a formula turns into a viewing of commercials. <br><br>  The situation is real.  You are looking for something, and then your eye clings to something extraneous and attractive.  And then ... <br><br>  And each time it is proposed to unify and standardize the way data is stored.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In each company, in one way or another, ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù is structured.  And it is difficult to say that the structuring methods of two different companies will coincide.  Someone uses ‚Äútrees‚Äù, someone ‚Äúgraphs‚Äù, someone ‚Äúnetwork views‚Äù.  Each view has its own data partitioning features.  And when such systems are introduced, there are always shortcomings that are closed by ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù.  There is nothing terrible in this, since there is no fully universal tool, but in reality there are tools that help at times to facilitate this process, even if with its limitations.  That is why there is a huge amount (and it becomes more) of various tools to simplify work with a particular process.  This is communication (how many messengers and communication services do you know?).  This is work with finances (both for people and for companies).  This is data processing (photo, video, etc.).  It‚Ä¶ <br><br>  There are more and more services.  And nothing strange about it.  How many people, so many opinions on the presentation of how this or that service should work. <br><br>  When it comes to companies, there are real solutions, with their own characteristics, but there are.  And one way or another, data structuring tasks are solved.  And everyone is happy and contented. <br><br>  But, all the stumbling blocks are at the moment when certain solutions begin to be tried on the Internet.  And there are wonderful projects, such as Wikipedia, various search engines.  Without them, it is now difficult to imagine a search for information, and at least some work with the Internet, outside sites that you know.  And most likely in 20 years these methods will be completely different. <br><br>  But even current projects on storage and presentation of data do not always cope with the amount of information.  And if you read any entertainment sites (for example, Bash), then you see that people pay attention to how bizarre images some search attempts for information lead to. <br><br>  The growth rate of information is becoming more and more and more.  They come up with standards in order to somehow direct the vector of information.  But, right there on the side come up with other standards.  Developing opportunities.  Now imagine yourself on the Internet - no problem at all.  Moreover, the further, the less you need to know about any technical issues.  The network is developing, becoming more powerful and diverse.  Yes, there is a lot of rubbish, but it is in everything.  You, too, every day throwing garbage. <br><br>  Because of the different ideas on how to structure information, misunderstandings arise. <br><br>  We are used to working according to the scheme ‚ÄúSection 1‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúSubsection 1.2‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúRequired information‚Äù.  Now we are getting used to working according to the graph scheme when there are cross-references and interconnections.  But, nevertheless, this is still not enough. <br><br>  Therefore, one way or another, everyone has been moving in the direction of artificial intelligence for a long time.  Take, for example, a neural network.  It stores information in far from trivial ways.  But when we need, we can always get an answer from her.  This way of presenting and working will obviously be given priority.  When the entire search and analysis of existing information will go on the shoulders of a computer or network.  After all, how we act when we are looking for something.  Open the search engine.  Then follow the links.  From those sites that we see, we are trying to isolate the information we need.  Further questions may arise.  And we open the search engine again.  Then‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Those.  in addition to the filters that the search engine presents to us, we ourselves filter and restructure the data.  And what we do it.  Own head  And this is the neural network. <br><br>  Therefore, it seems to me that you should not blame the network for its depravity and incoherence.  It is worth thinking about how to teach the network how to think.  And to give exactly what we need. <br><br>  I wanted to share my thoughts.  And get your opinion on this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143577/</a></p>
