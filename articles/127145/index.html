      Yeah.  They also share questionnaires that begin with the words: ‚ÄúI, ..., transfer the rights to my movable and immovable property ...‚Äù Anyway, I succumbed to the persuasion of a friend, and decided to see what people find in such sermons and why they spend time to talk about the world's unconscious gnomes instead of taking real steps to change their lives. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Cosmos is an invisible matter, and the stars are our desires!  - the plump balding little man of short stature, dressed in a striped suit not of the first freshness and a mustache a la "eighties traveling salesman" continued to broadcast from an elevation - the Cosmic location of the stars will allow you to fulfill your most cherished dreams! <br><br>  Heck.  It seems that the most opportune moment has come for standing up and shouting: ‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù Although who knows these sectarians: everyone looks so cute and harmless, but what if everyone hides under a hollow ritual knife with the inscription: ‚ÄúIn the name Universe, dwarfs and mass insanity "? .. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the seminar came to an end and people began to slowly disperse.  Incredibly, on the faces of most of them, spirituality, purposefulness, and a bunch of positive nouns ending in ‚Äú-ost‚Äù were read.  If I had met any of them on the street, I would have thought something like: ‚ÄúYes, this dude would know Tao!  He will achieve his goal! ‚ÄùInteresting.  It is interesting, if only because in a couple of days all these positive physiognomies will return to a state of rest, just like the stable system of regulation that we were told at the institute.  The action of the magic Pendel will end, and his energy will be wasted on writing inspired posts in Zhezheshechka and searching for a new positive avatar in VKontaktik. <br><br>  Why is this happening?  Why in 99% of cases, workshops on self-development and motivational articles do not bring any benefit?  Everything is very simple.  (If we were writing a matan textbook, then ten pages of triple integrals in spherical coordinates would follow. However, we have a post in GTD, so everything is really simple.) <br><br>  Articles and seminars are designed for large groups of people.  Their task is to reach as many people as possible and make them believe in the piece that this very seminar or article is promoting.  This is the main problem: everything that is said in such ‚Äúworks‚Äù is a generalization.  Think for yourself.  There are no two people in the world with the same problems.  That guy eats too much;  over there is a wife cheating;  and this dude generally thinks that he is being hunted by 4-dimensional lizards.  How the author of the article can hook on each of them?  Only by applying a generalization.  However, a generalization is always a lie.  Those methods that work for the author of the article solve * his * personal problems, and that is why they are effective.  When the author writes an article, he states the following: ‚ÄúThis thing works for me, it means that it will work for you too!‚Äù Bullshit.  If the author describes a method in which he visualizes purple gnomes who arrive in a striped sneaker and solve his problems, this means that such visualization is dictated by his author of the article - his personal perception of the world.  Nevertheless, a lot of gullible people read the article, and, inspired by the success of the author, they are struggling to call dwarfs in a flying sneaker.  However, the gnomes do not arrive, and the person is disappointed in all this garbage.  Exactly until it reads another article in which aquarium fish will participate this time.  So life passes for these people: in the constant search for a person whose life they were able to pull onto themselves like a suit made by crooked standards. <br><br>  Imagine a scientist with a scientific problem.  Instead of using scientific methods to solve it, a scientist collects a suitcase and sets off to travel the world, calling on other scientists and asking: ‚ÄúDude!  I have a problem with the Higgs bosons!  You, by chance, did not encounter the same garbage in your research of the early Plutarch? ‚ÄùPerhaps this scientist will be lucky and he will find a person who fumbles well in the Higgs bosons.  However, probability theory hints that, most likely, he will spend his whole life on fruitless searches for a ready-made solution, which does not exist until he himself takes up his creation. <br><br>  What to do?  Collect all motivational books and make a big bonfire?  Re-qualify pseudo-psychologists as cooks, mechanics and steelworkers?  Of course not.  The very reason for their existence (very comfortable, I must say) is that there will always be people who are looking for a red pill.  They are looking for a technique that could solve all their problems and at the same time remove all responsibility from them.  It does not happen.  Natural selection is a bitch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127145/</a></p>
