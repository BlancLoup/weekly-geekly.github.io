  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Den of translations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear Habraludi. <br><br>  In winter, I wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/107422/">that</a> boldly naive topic, not suspecting that it would be so <s>hard</s> interesting.  Unfortunately, I did not hear the opinions of the majority and made the most flagrant mistake - I overestimated my strength.  As a result, I am writing this topic.  Let me remind you, I began to translate articles from various popular design magazines: Smashing Magazine, for example.  Over time, we have included many other topics: marketing, PR, life hacking, social networks, stories from the lives of great companies and interesting personalities. <br><br>  This topic, about what changes our journal has undergone.  How I see it in the future and what to do to make the world better. <a name="habracut"></a>

Grouping by source.</b>  Everything is simple - articles can be grouped by source.  For example, I like 99% most of all - a magazine about ‚Äúpractical creativity‚Äù, a subsidiary of Behance.net, where every creative person will find something useful for himself on the topic ‚ÄúHow to realize yourself and your ideas‚Äù is very interesting and surprising for this kind of projects - without water. <br><br>  Many designers will like the Smashing Magazine section with articles on design and typography.  In SM articles, a lot of water is often found, but we chose the most-most interesting ones, and not without reason, some of them got a few thousand views.  Actually articles from SM flooded the entire popular column.  We contacted SM and asked to transfer further their most interesting materials, but for this we found to be necessary (quite deservedly) a rather large amount and conditions that we cannot yet fulfill.  Because SM, we temporarily do not translate.  It's a pity.  Vitali, if you read, and you say you read Habr - allow, we just allow, after all, we ask no special conditions, no partnership, even anywhere we will not write about this joyful fact. <br><br>  I can not keep silent about the section Mashable.  In my opinion, this is the most interesting western resource about social "buns", marketing and various e-novelties, sort of a little bit about everything. <br><br>  <b>2. Opened the forum and the section "Help hall".</b>  Forum, he and Cheboksary forum.  The section ‚ÄúHelp of the hall‚Äù is designed for not indifferent translators.  The collective translation is not as cool as that of notabenoid or translated bypass, but most importantly, it allows you to directly participate in the formation of new materials of our journal.  However, the article can be translated alone using the same system.  It is built on the WP plugin Transposh, the plugin is very convenient for multilingual Wordpress sites.  I advise you to look and touch. <br><br><h5>  Mission of my message </h5><br>  In the past, many people liked the idea and execution, and what‚Äôs too embarrassing, people didn‚Äôt write with Habra how wonderful everything was.  There is one But, weighty is.  Friends, I don‚Äôt cope (. Not because I don‚Äôt want, but because one brain doesn‚Äôt have time to think so much, and in addition to hands, I‚Äôll soon have to connect two legs and an additional keyboard. I suggest to unite, we need your organs, uh ... hands and brains only. You can read more on the page with the eloquent title " <a href="http://justnotes.ru/ishhem-druzey/">we are looking for friends</a> ", and if you are lazy or you are not a fenchstein, then we need not only translators, but also Grammar Nazi, PR and Wordpress programmer. All your merits we will certainly indicate on the project page, and if you are Vitaly Friedman, during  mom to share). <br><br>  <b>Due to the fact that there is no permanent support, we were unable to implement:</b> <br><br>  Twitter translation.  This is not what you thought) I just thought that you would be interested to read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/smashingmag/" class="user_link">smashingmag</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/techcrunch/" class="user_link">techcrunch</a> in your own?  Here, the main efficiency, according to my prikida, the translation of one takes about an hour a day.  I did not have enough.  In an amicable way, we need an investor and we [pompos] will turn over the runet [/ paphos] <br><br>  Increase the efficiency of transfers.  It's sad, damn it, but if 5 people spent 10-15 minutes of their precious time on the ‚Äúhall assistance‚Äù section, they would be able to issue one article per day. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I apologize for the confusion of the presentation, I always worry when I write something "out", and usually do it under the motto "the ideal is not attainable, better than never."  In general, I really want to know your opinion.  How is it all to you?  Habralyudi, waiting for your feedback and suggestions for improvement. <br>  <b>PPS</b> Meaning of the logo: brains - our readers think, multi-colored - think not standard. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116357/</a></p>
