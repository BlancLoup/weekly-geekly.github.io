  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to teach computer science in Germany</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello. <br>  I enjoy reading Habr every day, although I am not a registered user.  I would be grateful for an invite. <br>  An invite has already been presented to me, so I‚Äôm posting on my own behalf. <br>  I noticed several articles in the ‚ÄúEducation 2.0‚Äù section, since I am currently a student in Germany, I decided to write about how I study here.  As I see it. <br><br>  <b>I never wrote articles (this is the first), I did not study Russian (I am from Ukraine), so I ask you not to pay attention to spelling errors, if you don‚Äôt pay much attention.</b> <br>  So in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A few words about yourself.  I will not say where, and so d‚Ä¶ <br>  In Ukraine, graduated from college (4 years), then university (3 more years).  As a result, I received 3 plastic pieces of paper - ‚ÄùJunior Specialist‚Äù, ‚ÄúBachelor‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.  Since, like the majority of students, ‚ÄúStudent life‚Äù was very good and full of Pts, having studied for 7 years specifically, there was no knowledge in any field.  I knew everything a little.  With such knowledge you cannot get a good job. <br>  I decided to study again, but for myself.  To really get great knowledge.  There was an opportunity to go to study in Germany.  What I did. <br>  You can describe a lot of things - I will try to briefly and in essence.  Whoever has any questions, I will answer them with joy. <br>  Now I am studying in the fourth semester in the specialty "Medieninformatik" in "fahg√∂hshul" of the city of Osnabruck, the land of Niederzachsen.

      <b>Finance:</b> I live in a dorm, pretty good.  Own room - 13 sq.m.  (with water, light and so d ... there was never a problem).  Kitchen, shower, toilets are shared on the floor.  All this costs from 140 to 220 euros depending on the furnishing, location, and so on ... The Internet is there, but very weak, which is why I spent a separate line for myself.  Up to 16MB, there really is 10-11MB.  It costs 25 euros (taken with a neighbor for two).  Insurance, - 65 euros.  Telephone - 20 euros.  Total goes 300 euro every month. + Pocket money and food. <br>  Education costs 740 euros per semester.  There are cities where study is completely free.  For example in the nearby city - Bremen. <br>  It is a pity that for Ukraine it is impossible to knock out a thread of scholarship.  You have to pay everything yourself.  As I left Ukraine, I decided that I would keep myself.  Now in two jobs.  It turns out that 3 days a week I work, 4 days remains for study.  About the word "rest" now forgot. <br><br>  <b>Study:</b> I entered here the second time.  No exams passed.  Accepted here by rating.  I had a pretty good rating if you take the university and college, then an average of 4.5 on a 5-point scale.  In Germany, all Pts well done.  That starts me like.  Freebies, bribes and so d ... does not pass in any way.  What a great place in Ukraine.  I will describe only my specialization.  The system is as follows.  The study consists of 6 semesters (here it is commonly believed).  For each item give 5 or 10 credits.  In total, as far as I remember, you need to pass 25-26 subjects and the final (bachelor's) work.  All study 180 credits.  By law, in Germany you can study for 10 years.  According to the law of the university, I can study a maximum of 9 semesters.  Schedule make yourself.  Choose what subjects you want to teach and go ahead.  There is a centralized system in Germany (I don‚Äôt know how to call it correctly).  <a href="http://www.studip.de/">www.studip.de</a> with which <br>  students communicate with teachers, mainly by e-mail, watch their schedule, here the teachers throw out lectures, practical classes, online tests, exam results, advertisements are different and so‚Ä¶ <br>  At the lecture you can not go to the practice necessarily.  As a result, the main thing to pass the exam.  Incidentally, study and everything else of course in German. <br><br>  <b>A little bit about the subjects:</b> Due to the fact that almost half the time goes to work.  I can not do everything as it should, because already significantly behind.  But still, I hope that I can complete my studies here.  Estimates of course the opposite.  The best 1.0 is followed by "1.3", "1.7", "2.0", "2.3", "2.7", "3.0", "3.3", "3 , 7 ‚Äù,‚Äù 4.0 ‚Äù,‚Äù 5.0 - failure ‚Äù.  Basically, 100 points are given at the exam and marks are given as a percentage of the points scored.  From the subjects that I donated I can tell. <br>  <i>"Grundlagen Programmierung"</i> - the basics of programming - They taught "C" here.  The material is taught very good, the teachers are very intelligent.  As a result, everything is arranged on the shelves ... 10 laboratories were commissioned for the semester.  Donating them necessarily on time.  If you do not hand over on the appointed day.  They give you a ‚Äúyellow card (like in football)‚Äù and count the laboratory card.  2 such a card and automatically a ‚Äúred card‚Äù - you fly out of the subject.  And you can re-try it to pass in the next.  semester. <br>  <i>"Grundlagen Mathematik"</i> - the foundations of mathematics.  As the saying goes: "She's a mathematician and a mathematician in Africa."  But still, the approach to teaching is a bit different.  For some reason, the Germans have problems with mathematics - not at all, but at many.  And almost always 50% of it from the first time does not pass. <br>  <i>"Grundlagen Mediengestaltung"</i> - here a little bit of everything.  A little bit of photoshop, a little bit, an illustrator, a little bit of HTML, a little bit of CSS, as a result, several graphic works submitted, and two HomePages - one of them needs to be presented.  This subject is not thrilled, because the teacher got such that she doesn‚Äôt understand anything about it.  Well before that, I had a lot of experience creating home pages and working with raster and vector graphics.  Everything went with a bang. <br>  <i>"OOP"</i> - as is clear from 3 letters - object-oriented programming.  The same system as in the "Grundlagen Programmierung" The truth here is studying "C ++".  The teacher is also great.  8 workshops.  Programs such need to be written that brains turn over.  For me, Pts is hard. <br>  <i>‚ÄúRich Media Applications‚Äù</i> - here they studied ‚ÄùAction Script 3.0‚Äù - the same unknowing teacher.  Well, too, already had the basics, in principle, not easy but little by little.  I try to write code only in packages, I don‚Äôt even touch the workspace.  Everything from the library draw, I arrange.  You must pass 5 laboratory.  Finally, write and present an online game as an exam.  My partner and I started but have not finished yet.  Och long we deal with "Flash Media Server". <br>  <i>"Akustik und Optik"</i> - well, at least 2 sections from physics, otherwise I do not like Pts physics, but maybe like that ... and it will turn out. <br>  <i>"Kommunikationnetze"</i> - computer networks.  From this subject, I absolutely love it.  8 Laboratory.  All laboratories were held in CISCO laboratories.  Level CCNA, more precisely the first part.  Configure routers, static and dynamic routing, network calculation.  and so d ... Finally, I realized what OSI was for and so d ... The labs were conducted in small groups and there were 2 teachers in the laboratory.  What is not clear, explain, draw.  Och available.  At the end of the exam.  Half theory is half practice.  By the way, anyone can study for free and take a certificate of tsisko.  Free seems the first 2 levels. <br>  <i>‚ÄúMathematik f√ºr Informatik‚Äù</i> is a kind of math for informatics.  A bit more complicated than the basics of mathematics ... <br><br>  Here are a few links if anyone is interested. <br>  Link to the page of the faculty: <a href="http://www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de/">www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de</a> <br>  Medieninformatik: <a href="http://www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de/medieninformatikba.html">www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de/medieninformatikba.html</a> <br>  Program and other subjects: <a href="http://www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de/28518.html">www.ecs.fh-osnabrueck.de/28518.html</a> <br>  By clicking on the subject you can see what will be taught on it. <br>  I am just pleased Pts, although Pts hard.  There are still so many beautiful objects ahead ... <br><br>  <b>Equipment and buildings:</b> Equipment and building, everything is very good and beautiful.  Recently built a new building specifically for informatics.  Well, how many audiences with computers did not count.  - not a little.  There is no such, so that someone did not have enough space.  Sit at least a whole night and do it.  Video surveillance system and so on ... Everything is open.  Several audiences with poppies21 '' or 22 '' for working with graphics (teaching poppy 27 '' is just a lovely sight).  Many audiences are on Windows XP.  For programming in several classrooms worth it Solaris.  The domain system, everyone logs in with their username and password.  The whole territory of the university is covered with wi-fi, the speed is very good.  Even more than my dedicated line.  Every classroom has a projector, almost all teachers come with laptops.  So students and read and listen. <br>  Study materials: New books are constantly being purchased at the library.  And very relevant.  Programming especially.  There are many devices for printing.  Which is very convenient.  Charge yourself a card for 5-10 euros and print.  Recently introduced chip - all scripts for 2 euros.  Each teacher gives a script for which he lectures.  It turns out, 200-300 printed pages for 2 euros. <br><br>  <b>Examinations:</b> If a lot of students are not registered for an exam, then the exam is in a large hall where each student is seated through a row and through a desk.  So it‚Äôs almost impossible to ask or peek at someone ...  Basically 2 hours.  For example, on programming it was possible to take any books, notes, and so on ... Although they have little help if you do not know how to write what you need.  Nout phones and so d ... forbidden by itself.  Math was 3 hours.  Many tasks.  It's hard to write everything, you don't have time.  If they see what they are writing off, or something like that - they can immediately exclude them - there are no problems with that.  If you do not pass, you can re-take another 2 times, the test for the exam is given 3 attempts.  If after 3 attempts fail, you are quietly excluded from the university and you have no right to study this specialty in any educational institution in Germany. <br><br>  Once again I apologize for not writing very accurately and literally, I reread what I wrote.  Especially smiled this phrase "A lot of audiences are on Windows XP."  I‚Äôm probably very impressed with my studies here, because I studied in conditions that are much worse ... Therefore, a lot of ‚ÄúPts‚Äù come through. <br>  I would like to write a lot more, but a very good article is not very good, not everyone has the patience to read it through. <br><br>  Sorry that no photos, just they have no time to do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90720/</a></p>
