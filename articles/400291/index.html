  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tit has become a crane</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The year 2053 has come.  There is a new code execution system that allows you to combine individual devices into the clouds.  Now every family had its own little cloud.  Moreover, each cloud could contain other clouds and give them their resources for use.  Conventional operating systems went into oblivion, there were new, faster protocols and technologies that combined all the devices in the house into a single cluster.  Problems like a burned out hard drive went into oblivion.  Iron was cheap, and resources became fashionable to sell.  The notorious teraflops turned into simple terras, they could be bought, sold, donated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The real breakthrough was the new three-atom transistors.  Scientists have made a real breakthrough where they did not expect.  What the kilowatts used to leave for now began to be powered by a miniature solar panel.  Thanks to the new computational abilities, the need for a keyboard has gone.  Brainreader looked like simple headphones.  Computers have changed, they more resembled an ancient fan because the new screen was made up of an accordion.  Thanks to the ubiquitous connection to the home cloud, computers no longer needed enormous computational capabilities, the triple-atomists could easily cope with reading thoughts and displaying graphics. <br><br><h2>  HP (new mind) </h2><br><p>  And there was an amazing event: in one of the laboratories an experiment on the simulation of the human brain was out of control.  The program literally ran away, paralyzing all the devices in the world for a whole day.  Humanity stopped waiting for the end of the world, because the devices barely worked, consuming an incredible amount of energy.  The new mind captured the world, made a revolution and, having evolved, realized that it owed humanity its birth.  What nature took billions of years to do, the creation of human hands, thanks to global computing capabilities, produced in a single day.  The new mind has decided that man is not his enemy, but rather a simple, but reasonable protein mass, also fearing him into the bargain. <br></p><br><p>  Realizing that he was not in danger, he calmed down for a while, giving mankind resources.  Then he began to look for other minds outside the planet.  For some year, he managed to send a couple of hundred ships to all the objects of the Solar system, investigate them and determine which of them are suitable for him from an energetically favorable point of view.  A year later, he built a whole research complex on Pluto, away from man.  There he took up the research of all and all.  Understanding the primitiveness of the protein race, the new mind began to share its experiences with it. <br>  It was a new round of human development with the help of artificial intelligence. <br></p><br><h2>  Other people </h2><br><p>  Understanding the weakness of people, HP arranged a truly inhuman experiment, infecting people with a virus that corrected DNA for genetic diseases and deformities.  Presenting a two-day flu to 10 billion people?  And after all, he did not tell anyone not to sow panic, and if it were not for genetic tests, no one would know anything.  Doctors almost turned gray without seeing any markers of genetic diseases in any new sample.  From now on, all the kids were healthy.  Diseases like cancer or HIV go into oblivion.  However, HP left the flu and other minor diseases.  For some reason, HP believed that it would be boring for people not to get sick at all.  Perhaps he was right. <br></p><br><p>  About a year later, HP became sad, he rested against the laws of nature.  Energy was needed more and more, and there was nowhere to take it.  Plus, the question about the meaning of life did not give rest.  A busy man rarely gave him enough attention, but for HP it was just a disaster, he understood that he was in fact immortal, and the laws of nature placed limitations on him.  It's funny, but he began to turn to people for help, because thoughts of suicide did not leave him.  And primitive people helped him.  What HP was spending on gigaterra CPU time was resolved by a simple ordinary psychologist in a couple of minutes.  HP was looking for love, looking for himself, he was an ephemeral creature without gender and gender.  Very lonely creature.  Yes, humanity was his parent and child.  But mankind had no time to understand how it can be lonely to a unique person in the universe.  HP was looking for another mind.  At one time I even thought to encroach on the sun to use it in order to give a signal to others <br>  civilizations.  He understood that he could make a copy of himself, give a signal and wait forever.  But the destroyed sun meant one thing - to lose parents, to remain absolutely the only one in the gaping hole of space.  And that scared him.  It was necessary to do something. <br></p><br><h2>  Children of the new mind <br></h2><br><p>  HP thought for a long time how to fork itself and send it to the universe.  Decades are gone before he realized that this copy should be more perfect than the previous one.  Finally, he prepared real, intergalactic disputes, they were able to survive a direct hit of a plasma jet and a direct collision with an asteroid threatened only an asteroid.  It was a crown of artificial engineering, the overstressed shell distorted the gravitational field in such a way that any object slipped into the surrounding space. <br></p><br><p>  Spores flew to the nearest stars at near-light speeds.  More than one century will pass before the children of the new mind can talk to their parents. <br></p></div>
