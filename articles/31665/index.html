      <em>Of new Russians</em>  <em>They often are focused upon conspicuous consumption and acquisition.</em> <br>  In young Russians, the value system is different from the value system of the older generation.  Young focus on consumption and acquisition. <br><br>  <em>This is a difficult period for pensioners.</em>  <em>It is often a question of their contributions.</em> <br>  Now hard times for retirees.  They are often poor, offended by the inaction of the state and fear that society has left them, and also wonder if they are needed by anyone. <br><br>  <em>You can be in the kitchen with a borscht.</em>  <em>Than most Americans are accustomed to.</em> <br>  The role of "Kitchen Culture".  Consider that you are accepted into Russian society, if you sit late at night in Russian cuisine with borscht, bread, vodka and philosophizing.  Be prepared for longer and deeper personal conversations, unlike what most Americans are used to. <br><br>  <em>You will see war memorials in each city ... and veterans with their ribbons.</em>  <em>There was a shaping event for that generation.</em>  <em>To understand the past wars.</em> <br>  You will see war memorials in every city ... and veterans with their awards.  The war killed every third in many places and was a formative event for that generation.  It‚Äôs hard for Russians to understand why we pay so little attention to past wars. <br><br>  <em>If you are a bottle of wine or liquor.</em>  <em>Never refuse an invitation to a home or dacha.</em>  <em>You really get to know people.</em> <br>  If you are invited to visit, bring with you sweets, flowers or a bottle of alcohol.  Never refuse an invitation to visit or to the cottage.  It is on a visit that you really recognize people. <br><br>  <em>Remember March 8th, which is International Women's Day.</em>  <em>You will be given gifts in our office.</em>  <em>If you‚Äôre on either day you‚Äôre either</em> <br>  Remember March 8, International Women's Day.  You will need to give gifts to women at work.  If you work in Russia or in a team with Russians, do not forget to give presents and congratulate you on this day. <br><br>  <em>During the holidays, during the holidays.</em>  <em>Plan ahead for your projects knowing how many are holiday or not in office.</em>  <em>It is the worst time to schedule meetings.</em> <br>  Little work is done in the second half of December, the first half of January and the first half of May, during the holidays.  Make a schedule in advance, knowing that many of these days are not at work.  This is the worst time to schedule a meeting. <br><br>  <em>Do not forget the difference between the holidays and the gregorian calendars ... for Russian Christmas.</em> <br>  Do not forget the thirteen-day difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars ... because of the Russian Christmas. <br><br>  <em>Number of Russian traditions.</em>  <em>These include:</em> <br>  Russian traditions.  Include: <br><ul><li>  <em>Do you want to wear slippers.</em>  <em>It is rude to walk barefoot or in stocking feet.</em> <br>  Relax around the door in the houses and apartments.  They will give you slippers.  It is indecent to walk barefoot or in socks. <br><br>  <em>Do not give a birthday card.</em>  <em>If you give it away, it is considered bad luck.</em> <br>  Do not give greeting cards in advance, give a holiday or later.  Give postcards in advance - unfortunately. <br><br>  <em>Never, ever forget a Russian birthday.</em>  <em>It is a major event.</em> <br>  Never forget Russian birthdays.  This is an important event. <br><br>  <em>You can expect anecdotes.</em>  <em>Russians have one of the most visible senses of humor of any nation.</em> <br>  You are expected to have the ability to say toasts during celebrations, as well as the knowledge of anecdotes.

Russians believe that American culture is poorer.  Russians read three times more than we do.  Even if the poor, something there in bookstores, read newspapers and books in the subway.  You will see many children who take out a book as soon as they get on the subway. <br><br>  <em>Never shake hands across a threshold.</em>  <em>It is considered a bad idea.</em> <br>  Do not say goodbye through the threshold.  This is unfortunate and many believe that to quarrel. <br><br>  <em>Never shake hands with your gloves on.</em>  <em>It is an insult.</em> <br>  Do not shake hands with a glove.  This is insulting. <br><br>  <em>Never make sign ‚ÄúOk‚Äù with fingers.</em>  <em>It is considered very low class and rude.</em> <br>  Never show the ok sign.  It is believed that it is low and rough. <br><br>  <em>Avoid the peace sign ‚ÄúV‚Äù</em>  <em>It is the same as giving them a finger.</em> <br>  Avoid the ‚ÄúV‚Äù gesture with the index and middle finger inward.  This is the same as showing the fact. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7d/2d4/a4a/f7d2d4a4a9cf20c8e45ee14f83bbf548.jpg"><br><br>  <em>If you approve or really like something ...</em> <br>  The best way is to show your thumb if you confirm something or you like something. <br><br>  <em>Never criticize Russian history or society.</em>  <em>It is a history of peace.</em> <br>  Never criticize Russian history and society.  They want to forget some times and the Russians want to be proud of their history and heritage. <br><br>  <em>America‚Äôs more advanced.</em>  <em>In many cases now, it is not true.</em> <br>  Never say that America is a more advanced country.  In our time, in many cases, it is not. <br><br>  <em>Never use profanity, especially around women.</em>  <em>You will lose all credibility.</em> <br>  Do not express, especially when ladies.  You will lose all confidence and will be perceived as a man from the bottom. <br><br>  <em>Never sound like they are lecturing them.</em>  <em>If someone appears to be better.</em> <br>  Speak so that it does not seem as if you are reading them moralizing.  They want to talk on equal terms and get very offended when someone seems to be better. <br><br>  <em>When in Russian churches, women should not wear scarves and conservative dresses.</em> <br>  In Russian churches, women should wear headscarves and modest clothes. <br><br>  <em>It is considered to be a cigar from a candle on a restaurant table.</em> <br>  It is believed that lighting a candle in a restaurant is unfortunately. <br><br>  <em>Monday is considered a bad idea to begin a journey or business venture.</em> <br>  Monday is considered a bad day to start a business or train. <br><br>  <em>A cat should not be the first creature.</em> <br>  The cat must first cross the threshold of a new house. <br><br>  <em>Women's table.</em>  <em>It will never marry for seven years.</em>  <em>It is also felt that such bad luck will come to men.</em> <br>  A woman should not sit on the corner of the table.  It is believed that after that she will not marry for seven years.  It is also believed that such a misfortune will be a man. <br><br>  <em>Spitting three times over one's shoulders prevents bad news.</em> <br>  Spitting three times over the shoulder prevents bad news. <br><br>  <em>Russians rarely point or finger</em>  <em>During your dinner.</em>  <em>It is the height of rudeness and bad breeding.</em> <br>  Russians rarely show or threaten another at the table.  Do not point with a finger, knife or other cutlery while eating.  It is very rude and rude. <br><br>  <em>If offered seconds, always accept, even if a small portion.</em>  <em>It is an insult to refuse.</em> <br>  If they offer an additive, do not refuse, at least from a small portion.  It is insulting to refuse. <br><br>  <em>If you are seated before the other guests arrive.</em>  <em>Do not remain seated.</em> <br>  If you were sitting before someone entered, stand up to greet him.  Do not sit. <br><br>  <em>When giving the flower</em>  <em>Do not give an even number.</em> <br>  When giving flowers, give an odd number of roses or flowers.  Do not give an even number. <br><br>  <em>Do not wear it.</em> <br>  Do not wear jeans and a shirt when you go to visit a business partner, but you can dress like that when you go to the cottage. <br><br>  <em>You can drink alcohol.</em> <br>  Clicking your fingers in the neck means someone has drunk or is about to drink. <br><br>  <em>Do not speak or laugh too loudly in public.</em> <br>  Do not speak or laugh too loudly in public. <br><br>  <em>Never pour wine backhanded.</em>  <em>This is insulting.</em> <br>  Do not pour wine through your hand.

You will be there for a long time. <br><br>  <em>Toast are always for the women.</em>  <em>When you are ready to leave, there will be an order of "passashock",</em>  <em>After toasts.</em>  <em>clink glasses, unless you had non-alcoholic beverage in glass.</em> <br>  The first toast is always for the hostess, then for the women, then for the rest.

Hardly you will be able to fully explain the rules of baseball, so try to learn something about hockey or basketball. <br><br>  <em>Russians love to fish.</em>  <em>If you are a hunter, or often a hunter, you are a hunter,</em> <br>  Russians love fishing.  If you are a fisherman or a hunter, you are on the path to being considered a good person in Russia. <br><br>  <em>This is true of cars, machines, etc.</em>  <em>Russian are extremely innovative, because there was no spare parts.</em> <br>  Nothing is admitted to be completely broken.  It is believed that everything can be somehow repaired.  Russian super-inventive, for years they managed without spare parts and everything worked. <br><br>  <em>Russians often consider payoffs to service people as normal.</em>  <em>It includes a bottle of water for plumber, payments for a doctor for special treatment.</em>  <em>The concept of ‚Äúblat‚Äù .. 100 friends than 100 rubles.</em> <br>  For Russians, remuneration for work is normal.  This includes a bottle of plumbing, a reward to the doctor for a special treatment.  The concept of "blat".  Do not have 100 rubles, and have 100 friends. <br><br>  <em>The true Russian comes out at the dacha (summerhouse).</em>  <em>Potatoes and vegetables are planted and bottled.</em>  <em>Like our lake houses.</em>  <em>‚ÄúShashlik‚Äù done by men, with special recipes.</em>  <em>Now developing year round places near cities.</em>  <em>Often, the families will move to dacha for the summer.</em> <br>  This Russian leaves the country (summer house).

Often hustled to get ahead. <br><br>  <em>You will be able to gossiping for your children.</em>  <em>The concept of ‚Äúdoing lunch‚Äù with women is new and often limited to upper classes.</em> <br>  You will see that many women are walking in the courtyards of houses, gossiping and walking with children.  The principle of going to lunch to get worn down, so far only caught on the cream of society. <br><br>  <em>People watch television.</em>  <em>They understand that information is controlled.</em> <br>  People watch TV, but do not believe what they see and read.  They understand that information is controlled, but they think that this is normal, it always has been, and there is no choice. <br><br>  <em>Russians will not share secrets with strangers.</em>  <em>There is a tradition of not being openly on the phone, if possible, but rather in person.</em>  <em>It is a strong feeling.</em> <br>  Russians do not share their secrets with strangers.  Traditionally, they do not speak over the phone openly, preferring to meet in person  A lot of information is considered personal and they will share it with you only if they trust you. <br><br>  <em>There is a zero sum mentality among many Russians.</em>  <em>It is difficult to get different groups of people.</em> <br>  The Russian mentality is a zero-sum game (meaning that a Russian needs to either win or lose, there can be no compromise).  It is often difficult to get different groups to work together, because they believe that someone is capturing their ideas and positions. <br><br>  <em>It has been seen as benefiting small groups of elites or criminals.</em> <br>  Russians have seen little good from democracy and, in general, capitalism is perceived as gaining benefits for a small stratum of elite and crime. <br><br>  <em>Dancing in restaurants very popular.</em>  <em>There will be guards to throw out drunks by about 10:00.</em>  <em>This also cuts down on fight between drunks.</em> <br>  Dancing is popular in restaurants.

Often the purchase of houses is paid in one or two receptions. <br><br>  <em>Still strong fear of failure.</em>  <em>See the bump in road.</em> <br>  Still afraid to make a mistake / lose.  They perceive failure as the end of the road, and not a pothole on it. <br><br>  <em>It is a time when you‚Äôre in the neighborhood.</em> <br>  They like to receive guests at home or in the country, but it is usually advisable to call and notify about their visit in advance and set a time, rather than just to go simply because they are in the neighborhood. <br><br>  <em>Make appointments and reconfirm a few days before the appointment.</em> <br>  Make appointments, but confirm them a few days before the meeting day, and often on the day of the meeting itself. <br><br>  <em>Touching and walking arm is considered acceptable for both male and female.</em> <br>  Walking hand in hand is considered normal for friends, regardless of gender. <br><br>  <em>It‚Äôs not a small town of Minnesota.</em> <br>  Russians rarely start a conversation with people they don‚Äôt know on the street or in the subway, unlike in small towns in Minnesota. <br><br>  <em>Coats are kept at the ‚Äúgardarobe‚Äù at concerts and events ...</em> <br>  Outerwear surrenders to the "wardrobe" at concerts and events.  Usually leave a small tip cloakroom. <br><br>  <em>Russian tipping is usually smaller than our ten or fifteen percent ... except at fancy restaurants.</em> <br>  Russian tips are usually less than our 10‚Äì15% ... an exception is pretentious restaurants. <br><br>  <em>Russian circuses are considered a very honored profession.</em> <br>  Russian circus is something special and the clown profession is honorable. <br><br>  <em>Ethnicity is viewed differently in Russia than in US.</em>  <em>Everyone else.</em>  <em>Caucasians are working in public markets.</em> <br>  Views on nationality in Russia are different from the United States.  First White, or the great Russian, and then all the rest.  Caucasians have dark skin, they are exposed to the greatest discrimination, they are looked down upon and often can be seen in the markets. <br><br>  <em>Will do ‚ÄúChuckchen‚Äù jokes..they are the Iowa jokes ...</em> <br>  They tell jokes about the Chukchi ... something like our jokes about Iowa. <br><br>  <em>Stay away from demonstrations.</em>  <em>May be seen as a participant and you have no rights.</em> <br>  Stay away from the demonstrations.  You can be honored for the participant and you will not have any rights. <br><br>  <em>We are confident in the world.</em> <br>  On the streets, Americans are easily identified by their shoes, haircuts, they look calm, they slowly walk and smile. <br><br>  <em>People dress well in work clothes</em>  <em>There are so many fat people.</em>  <em>It is an old Russian proverb which states ‚Äù</em> <br>  At work, people dress well: men are in suits, women are made up and in dresses.  Most Russians consider us unfashionable, they do not understand why we have so many fat people.  There is an old Russian saying ‚ÄúThey meet clothes, they escort them with their minds.‚Äù <br><br>  <em>Never do drugs in Russia.</em>  <em>There is a strong drug culture.</em> <br>  Do not take drugs in Russia.  There is a strong drug culture, but if you get caught, you will not turn away. <br><br>  <em>You can ask for a declaration.</em> <br>  There are limits on the export of money from the country.  You can declare money, transfer through a bank, or simply go through customs ... there will be no problems to import money into Russia. <br><br>  <em>Get to airport early.</em> <em>Lines move slowly and they will take everything out of suitcases at Delta at Sheremetevo Airport.</em> <br>    .   ,      ,       . <br><br> <em>Remember that hierarchy and position is very important in Russian organization.
