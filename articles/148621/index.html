As with all Apple products, the army of fans waited for it with great impatience.  I'm not an exception.  In this, not claiming the ultimate truth, the article, I will try to point out the negative side of the new OSes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A little about me: the first acquaintance with Apple happened in 2007, when I bought iPod nano, which seemed to me to be the pinnacle of engineering and design ideas in the music industry.  As time went on, I gradually transferred the fleet of equipment to Apple.  My experience with Mac OS X is from Leopard, that is, from 10.5. <br><br><h5>  Launchpad </h5><br>  Last year, Launchpad became one of Lev's main "chips" - a menu of icons grid, just like in iOS.  I must say, I immediately fell in love with him, and 99% of the programs run through him.  In Mountain Lion, he did not go anywhere, but changed for the worse.  If everything looks <a href="">neat</a> on a MacBook, then on iMac 27 "before our eyes there is some kind of misery. Apple taught us to have a flawless design, and it‚Äôs at least strange to watch.

Perhaps this is the first time in history when iOS used what was previously in Android, but the Notification Center is really convenient, and as part of the merger of desktop and mobile operating systems, it was decided to add it to OS X Mountain Lion.  As well as the integration with Twitter, added all in the same iOS 5. Let's go back to the notification center: if a new letter arrives, it appears in it, we click on the header, and get into Mail.app.  Is it logical  Is logical.  So why if, for example, a notification about a new reminder on Twitter arrives, on a click, it‚Äôs not Twitter for OS X that opens, but the Twitter website?  It is illogical and very deduces. <br><br><h5>  New dock </h5><br>  Modified dock.  If earlier we clearly saw which applications were running (there was a rather noticeable highlight under them), now we are seeing something shallow and dull. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/659/42a/16a/65942a16a73c2af1efa62d114fcdf5e5.png"><br><br><h5>  Battery charge indicator </h5><br>  Yes, he too has changed.  If earlier it was always possible to observe the approximate remaining battery life, now it is only a click away.  And this, judging by the reaction of the community, has caused some inconvenience to many. <br><br><h5>  Epic fail </h5><br>  And now a question for Apple, who allowed the distribution of broken codes to Mac owners, acquired after June 12th.  From the very beginning, things didn‚Äôt work out when the promotion program suddenly started working on the site a few days before the release, and anyone who came in could fill out a questionnaire and get the cherished key.  But what happened afterwards cannot be described in words.  All codes received on the first day after the release were used.  Someone spat and downloaded from torrents, someone bought (for ridiculous $ 20), and someone, like me, waited.  Of course, there is no need to complain, it is unlikely that anyone can offer this, but involuntarily think that "under Steve, there was no such thing." <br><br><h5>  Little grunts </h5><br>  After Snowball (Mac OS X Snow Leopard), many macophiles began to beat if not alarm, then fear.  What will be and what <u>will not be</u> in OS X 10.9 is not known to anyone yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148621/</a></p>
