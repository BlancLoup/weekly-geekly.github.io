  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the difference between cool networkers and performing in public? 5 qualities that can be envied</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t6/he/jw/t6hejwzuiyeolxbcdzgtwr1qsje.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Speaking to strangers, trying to captivate them with their ideas - for many it is a difficult task.  Scary, horror - "and what they think," "it is indecent", "what I tell them."  But there are Sensei, who are on the move very well find a common language with a variety of people and are interesting to speak to any audience.  One of these artists is Irina Tripapina, head of international development at MyTarget.  Thanks to her talent, very large customers from several countries came to myTarget.  Under the cut - tips and interviews with Irina, in which she talks about the main qualities that help to speak and fascinate people.  Give her the word. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Every two months I speak at international conferences: in China, Spain, USA, Singapore, France, Germany.  My task is to interest the creators of foreign applications in the Russian market and help them win the market through the products of Mail.Ru Group. </p><br><p>  Imagine: 100,000 people come from all over the world to Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress.  100,000 different ideas and tasks, 100,000 new meetings ignite the city in these three days.  Everyone has a chance to get acquainted with Mark Zuckerberg, arrange an interview at Amazon or sell your Google product.  But why is that guy leaving the conference empty-handed, and this one with a job offer, new partners and Satya Nadela as a friend on Facebook?  What is so cool about these cool speakers and networkers? </p><br><h3 id="1-poryadok-v-golove">  1. Order in the head </h3><br><p>  They clearly see their goals and objectives.  They know what they are experts, and where you need to pump.  Understand who can help them achieve their goals and what to offer in return.  This gives everything they talk about structure and clarity.  At a conference in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI witnessed a deal in an elevator: in 60 seconds, unknown startups managed to recognize an eBay employee badge, talk about problems that their product solves, and agree on cooperation. </p><br><p>  It helps me: mind mapping, SMART goal-setting approach, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW</a> prioritization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">method</a> , Eisenhower Matrix </p><br><p>  Book: ‚ÄúNumber 1: How to become the best in what you do,‚Äù Igor Mann. </p><br><h3 id="2-strast">  2. Passion </h3><br><p>  Love for work and product can not be faked.  If real, it is easily transmitted by airborne droplets, instantly reviving everything around.  Have you ever heard Mark Zuckerberg talking about writing code?  This is magic, shine in the eyes, faith in the future.  You can be excited, ignite the audience with the State Standards for software development, or you can put it to sleep with the prospects of artificial intelligence.  The question is what drives the speaker himself. </p><br><p>  It helps me: making lists that I love and know how, inspirational people around, reading, trial and error. </p><br><p>  Book: Your Destination, Robert Stephen Kaplan. </p><br><h3 id="3-smelost">  3. Courage </h3><br><p>  My friend from the Dublin office of Google is a typical introvert.  When he finds himself on stage, he immediately admits: this is his nightmare, and perhaps he will soon faint.  He instantly won the sympathy of the hall: people like to think that someone is more nervous than them and is not afraid to admit it.  Cool speakers and networkers understand that only the first step is scary.  Each exit on the stage or a new acquaintance is like a parachute jump - first a heart on the heels, and then a thrill of new emotions, a bunch of photos on Facebook and the envy of friends.  Only in the first case, the risk of breaking the legs is much less. </p><br><p>  It helps me: training and rehearsals, sports, proper breathing techniques, the idea that the audience is filled with friends (does not work if you have no friends). </p><br><p>  Book: ‚ÄúHow to talk to anyone, anywhere, and about anything,‚Äù Larry King. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z0/zg/rk/z0zgrkljkiocyfg1fwu0ubqf3zg.png"></p><br><h3 id="4-umenie-vyhodit-iz-svoey-golovy">  4. Ability to get out of my head </h3><br><p>  It seems that they are less nervous and are not afraid of anything, because during the distribution of charisma and charm were the first in line.  Perhaps, but not only therefore.  When we worry, we focus on ourselves: how we look, how we speak, how we move.  A good speaker and networker concentrates on the audience, on how to help her.  Excellent tools for this - look in your eyes, questions from the audience in the hall.  But the main thing is the transfer of internal attention.  See the interlocutor, and not just look at him.  Hear, not just listen. </p><br><p>  It helps me: the development of emotional intelligence, acting techniques, meditation, exercises for the development of care. </p><br><p>  Books: ‚ÄúEmotional Intelligence.  Why it can mean more than IQ ‚Äù, Daniel Goleman.  ‚ÄúAwareness.  How to find harmony in our crazy world, ‚ÄùMark Williams and Denny Penman. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/lv/l5/xdlvl5zgok_fbwqtfypd3-o4o0a.png"></p><br><h3 id="5-zhelanie-otdavat">  5. Desire to give </h3><br><p>  There are many ways to be useful: share an insider article, introduce the right person, tell you how to hack Emma Watson's Instagram.  Most often, a good relationship is much more profitable than a one-time deal.  At my first conference in London, I met the evangelist Amazon.  After a short conversation, he asked: ‚ÄúWhat are your tasks at the conference?  How can I help you? ‚ÄùMy mention of any company he said was‚Äú Oh, I can introduce you to them ‚Äùand introduced me to the right person.  When I asked how he knew all these people, he said: ‚ÄúNetworking is like picking up a puzzle.  Each person is a piece of the picture, and most of the people are looking for pieces that fit specifically to them.  Limited to the area around them.  I also like to bring people together, to collect puzzles in different corners of the picture.  So my puzzle is much bigger. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  It helps me: the implementation of the previous 4 points. </p><br><p>  Book: ‚ÄúNever Eat Alone and Other Networking Rules‚Äù, Keith Ferrazzi, Tal Res. </p><br><p>  By the way, these are absolutely international features, which I notice equally in the Chinese, in the Americans, and in the Russians.  It is not necessary to be a good networker or speaker to have these qualities.  But, by developing them, you will inevitably become more confident, happier, and, possibly, richer in the very pictures of Emma Watson. </p><br><p>  Bonus at last: in this video, I tell you what parties are holding Google with Facebook, how to meet people and what you need to do to win a prize from Mail.Ru Group. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/atmGuOzXkvY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
