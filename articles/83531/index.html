I have already talked about some models (I still sometimes think of the UL20A as replacing my netbook), but today the review is the oldest model in the series.

      The eldest is not only the size and diagonal of the screen (15.6 inches), but also according to the installed entrails.  In particular, in the test sample was a "five-star" <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fid%3D3827">processor <b>Intel Core 2 Duo</b></a> <b>SU7300</b> , which is deservedly ultra-low-voltage.  Its D2-cache is 3Mb, and the clock frequency is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1.3 GHz, but <s>with a</s> flick of the wrist, thanks to the <b>ASUS Turbo33</b> technology, it easily <s>turns into elegant shorts</s> accelerates to 2.13 GHz (!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/357/75e/94f/35775e94f5b73d797ee28078d5fb4664.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45e/204/a6a/45e204a6ac7b2ab925f502f3a3c451a1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Additionally, a hybrid graphics system is installed on board, consisting of two video cards - a discrete <b>NVIDIA GeForce G210M</b> and an integrated <b>Intel GMA 4500MHD</b> .  You can switch between them without rebooting, which makes it possible to control the battery life to a certain extent - when high performance is not needed (lyrics, Internet, music), you can switch to the built-in solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/431/151/c6c/431151c6c7a8919ddb5715b68750258b.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4d/582/0bd/a4d5820bd97b11ba21efd5e368f6e8ce.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2 memory slots for DDR3 memory, three hundred gigs, an excellent bright display - all this ... well, let's take a look at the specs, scroll through the pictures, look at the price at the end of the article and write something caustic) <br><br>  The specifications of the laptop are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/631/740/3c9/6317403c90b173af8e6a693ed7cb6034.png" alt="image"><br><br>  * The processor in the model is different - from tselerona, Pentium and Core 2 Solo, to Core 2 Duo series SU9000.  Specify this point when buying. <br>  ** Calling right now, in addition to the laptop, you will receive a leather bag and mouse!  ) <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  A characteristic feature of all notebooks in the series is the cover, the material of which is an aluminum sheet with a fine grinding texture - it looks very ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/940/9ac/13e/9409ac13e5038d859c53cdb260938c05.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All models in this series have a slim case, and the UL50Vt is no exception.  Peeping into the specs, we find that the dimensions are 386x259x16.4-26.4 (in mm) with a weight of 2 kilograms.  This, of course, is more (and, oddly enough, heavier) than a sheet of A4 paper, but despite this, the laptop easily fit in a sports backpack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd1/9e5/b6e/bd19e5b6ef087ed4ec792d0bdd56ddaf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sides are decorated with a scattering of precious stones of the ports - their diversity is not the greatest, but everything you need is (1xHDMI and 3xUSB).  There was a place for the drive. <br>  The glossy screen is framed with a thick glossy frame - I still believe that this large-scale disgrace is about to cease) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/545/7c1/c8c/5457c1c8cb40991bc6f9d8f240a1a84a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73c/d69/c7e/73cd69c7e78bac2e1bb8700b60d699da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/627/abd/355/627abd355a899f3632d0b6c6f4c0c2a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above the display is a webcam, the possibilities of which are enough except for Skype and for authorization using the <b>ASUS SmartLogon</b> program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/656/6d5/460/6566d5460ce5900176e1b088dafe7643.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Keyboard buttons do not have sharp corners - the keys are separated in small intervals, which is convenient when typing.  English letters are white, ours are aqua colors, and Fn-actions are painted blue.  It‚Äôs really very comfortable to type (in the layout, I liked two big shift), but if you accelerate a lot, the noise of ‚Äúclicking‚Äù will become noticeable.  There is a digital block.  Eh, still a highlight) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9c/04e/a75/f9c04ea7517121e759cbff1a16c0fb8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67a/9fb/9be/67a9fb9be0c7ec3ceb771b31182a2b5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad is large and physically stands out from the panel of the case with only a set of depressed "holes".  Such a solution is not the first time and, in my opinion, it is very successful - the touch panel is not depressed, which means that the dust is not clogged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/510/44f/ccf/51044fccf4a4b2f19b823577545b0e71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But at the same time even in the dark it can be found by touch.  Tactile touchpad is very pleasant ... and yes, it is multitouch.  Under it - one big chrome key-rocker.  All the space around the keyboard and touchpad is also made of soiled glossy plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58c/d52/9e4/58cd529e4a628a3303f9148652b88b1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The test involved a model with a black case color, although the laptop should also be on sale in a light gray version.  My opinion - the second option is much more practical.  Firstly, it was initially not so easily soiled, and secondly, it has an inconspicuous texture-ornament, which makes fingerprints almost imperceptible.  Yes, and the gray cap is somehow more associated with metal, or something) <br><br>  Like most other ASUS laptops, the UL50Vt has two power buttons - a regular one and a <b>ASUS ExpressGate</b> mode.  Let me remind you that ExpressGate is a proprietary technology company, in combination - a miniature operating system, located on the disk (in laptops) or on a separate ssd-memory (in motherboards).  Its main advantage is the fast download (6-8 seconds) and the presence of a full-featured Firefox browser, Skype, IM client, file manager and something else.  A very convenient and useful feature will allow to ‚Äúwork‚Äù on a laptop, even if it doesn‚Äôt have a full-featured OS! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c2/659/2ce/8c26592ce7f4bf55c9c289aadc217842.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During operation, the laptop behaves very quietly - you can hear the hard drive and the cooler (apparently, the video card) under load.  The rest is almost silent.  Status LEDs are placed on the front panel, under the touchpad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/494/528/3f0/4945283f09d1efac0902734893a30fdb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Speed </h2><br>  The Windows7 system performance index was rated at 4.9 points (out of a possible 7.9): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/039/3c6/89c/0393c689cf9ed6274371b630927ffffa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Measuring the indicator in parrots, received the following subjective numbers: <br>  <b>SuperPi 1.5, 1M</b> - <a href="">46.270c</a> c <br>  <b>SuperPi 1.5, 2M</b> - <a href="">106.049</a> c <br>  <b>3DMark06</b> - <a href="">3434</a> points <br><br>  One has only to add that these decent results were obtained thanks to the technology of ASUS Turbo33, which increased the processor frequency from 1.3 GHz to 2.13 GHz.  This technology is available only on the UL50Vt model - on the UL50A models, -Ag and -Vg it is not. <br><br>  <b>HDTune 3.50</b> version linear reading speed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96f/bb3/88b/96fbb388b980e48b6b36a7dcb6fa7a2b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, the disc is the most common - it does not give record numbers, but it‚Äôs more than enough for everyday work.  The volume of 320GB allows you to be in the best price forks;) <br><br>  With regard to the tests in the field, the laptop showed itself remarkably well.  It is comfortable to work in Photoshop, but only if the mouse is connected. Movies are great, but video fans can upset the native display resolution.  Games?  That's what I did not try at all, but judging by one foreign test, the Racedriver GRID at maximum detail, but without smoothing, comes with 22fps.  It's not enough, of course, but look again at the thickness of the case;) If the toys are critical, you should pay attention to the RoG series notebooks or at least multimedia ones.  Otherwise, the laptop will help out in almost all situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f95/bd3/0ac/f95bd30acd96384651ce309e52ce5b2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A separate paragraph would like to note the thermal mode of the laptop - alas, but do not fry eggs on it.  Perhaps some Ice Cool technology knows its work;  Maybe I didn't load the device enough - the temperature did not exceed the body temperature.  So you can work with a laptop on your lap, without worrying about the safety ... uh, data) <br><br>  Well, about the time a couple of words.  In the test instance, there was an 8-cell battery (5800 mAh, 84 Wh 14 h, 14.4 V) - with it at minimum brightness and without WiFi, we managed to squeeze neither more nor less - 12.5 hours!  Even the <b>ASUS EeePC 1000HE netbook</b> , which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/68768/">works a</a> little less, but at Atom and with a 10-inch diagonal screen, will envy such cheerfulness. <br>  WiFi operation time is 9 hours, at maximum brightness and load 3.5 hours.  Raising result! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b3/1e7/d5f/7b31e7d5f776183ef8ed98a04a61c6e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Compact size and low weight; <br>  - Metal cover;  overall appearance is very pleasant; <br>  - Discrete and built-in video card with the ability to switch without rebooting; <br>  - The presence of HDMI-connector.  Turbo33 and Express Gate technology; <br>  - Comfortable keyboard;  who needs - there is a digital block; <br>  - Excellent battery life; <br>  - High performance; <br>  - Adequate price. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Glossy case (inside) and screen; <br>  - Small distance between USB ports; <br>  - The keyboard is somewhat "noisy" when typing; <br>  - I really wanted 802.11n and, perhaps, a higher resolution. <br><br>  Speaking about an adequate price, I meant a figure of 30,000 rubles per unit of laptop. <br><br><img src="http://pricechart-gen.yandex.net/1265576400/?id=6006307&amp;reg=3" alt="image"><br>  * Dynamics of prices for a laptop according to Yandex.Market <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  After almost all models of the UL-series have been considered, I will summarize a little.  IMHO, the series definitely succeeded - all 4 devices are very interesting and definitely deserve attention. <br>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/75925/">UL20</a></b> - a laptop with dimensions (screen - 12 ") and the price of a good netbook, is suitable if the modest dimensions are fundamental, but the netbook is not enough. <br>  <b>The UL30</b> is still a marching version, but the screen diagonal is already 13 ‚Äù.  And show a movie and at work will not let you down. <br>  <b>UL80</b> - white crow in marking series) With a diagonal of 14 "has good performance. <br>  <b>UL50</b> is the eldest brother, he is the most.  Despite the screen in 15 '', it still has a compact size / weight and will easily deal with most everyday tasks.  The most expensive of the series, but still affordable. <br>  And, of course, it unites all these models for a long battery life, which has become available thanks to Intel's intelligent ULV processors.  Well, the main feature - the metal cover, under which lies the gloss of gloss)) <br>  With a clear conscience I advise laptops in this series to be familiar - there should be a lot of good laptops.  And those who have already managed to take, while only satisfied.  If it were not for the netbook that suits me completely, I would have taken the UL20A or the UL30Vt for myself - however, dimensions do matter. <br><br>  When buying, be sure to pay attention to the processor installed inside.  I hope you will not regret the rest;) <br><br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  All news about ASUS and Intel first appear on the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a></b> project - welcome!
