In this promotion channel, marketers analyze more than one metric, among which is Open Rate.  This metric shows whether your letters open readers.  Tips on how not to spend wasted forces, making mailings, with the SendPulse client case, read our article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/c60/69f/316c6069f2564deeb9d19c46c0c4971a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rayarooo/">Ray</a> (Flickr)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How to determine whether you have a high rate of Open Rate?  The statistics of the company Silverpop shows that the level of unique discoveries for mailings is different in different areas of business.  There is no specific norm, because each industry has its own characteristics. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aff/b3c/243/affb3c2436794056bed34d4d19397da7.jpg"></div><br>  From the table we see that travel companies receive the highest level of unique discoveries, while in the retail trade, restaurant business, software development mailings are opened much less.

      Now let's see how to increase the Open Rate of your mailings. <br><br><h3>  Segment </h3><br>  Imagine that you received a newsletter with an invitation to an event that takes place in a city far from you.  Even if you want to go for it, it is geographically irrelevant.  Or suppose, after buying a TV in an online store, you still receive mailings with TV ads.  It follows from this that it is undesirable to do the same for the entire database. <br>  Open Rate of letters of a segmented list of recipients is <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/ca/blog/2015/12/13-email-marketing-tips.html">13.07%</a> higher than sending to an unshared address base. <br><br>  In addition, people often unceremoniously mark the newsletter as spam, worsening your reputation as a sender among mail services. <br><br>  <i>Working with subscribers, you can collect various information:</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ site behavior; <br>  ‚Ä¢ visited pages; <br>  ‚Ä¢ data from the subscription form; <br>  ‚Ä¢ data from CRM; <br>  ‚Ä¢ purchase history; <br>  ‚Ä¢ abandoned basket, etc. <br><br>  Divide the subscribers into groups and work with each of them individually.  How to create a newsletter using segmentation in SendPulse can be found <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/222858-%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">here</a> . <br><br>  Some companies make newsletters, where they ask to indicate what content is interesting to the subscriber. <br><br>  OfficeMax offers to fill in a questionnaire about the goods of interest, a story about yourself, and also asks for a birthday: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93e/f79/829/93ef7982974d4a35935d02e6e28bc68f.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Avoid frills </h3><br>  Do not convey emotions through caps lok and extra punctuation.  If the topic says ‚ÄúDISCOUNTS, DISCOUNTS, DISCOUNTS !!!!!‚Äù, then the reader may get the impression that they are yelling at him. <br>  Do not use words that are affected by spam email service filters; let's call them conditionally spam words. <br><br>  Remember the most obvious of them: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/1fc/c93/b8a1fcc93e2549789f893b2f117b067e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Work on the subject of the letter </h3><br>  The topic can both be interesting and repel. <br><br>  Here are some tricks to help you get your attention. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Limited offer</b> <br><br>  This tactic works if you indicate that the offer is valid for 1-3 days or just a couple of hours, thus creating the illusion of scarcity.  If you write two months, it will not cause the reader a sense of urgency, because who will be in a hurry - there are still two whole months ahead. <br>  Here are a few topics from famous brands: <br><br>  The New York Times newspaper: "The offer expires tomorrow: Save 60% on unlimited access." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/5e2/124/8935e2124def43d5b4601ce763b8991a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Godiva Chocolatier: ‚ÄúA few hours left: free shipping on all orders from $ 25‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70c/3a1/2b9/70c3a12b9d6246d5925dd2a0a067942b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Please note that the letter from Godiva Chocolatier itself also states the limitation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/021/513/eb102151354d4bb1ba679cc97be5451e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a rule, the smaller the product in stock, the more people want to buy it.  This is where the true reason for sewing clothes in a single copy of "haute couture" or creating a capsule collection.  The same principle is successfully applied in email marketing. <br><br>  Grovemade, the maker of stylish accessories for Apple technology, is intriguing with the theme of the letter: "Limited Edition Gold Watch." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32a/3e7/788/32a3e7788f5f4e259c0e79d70a6ee9af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The letter details all the advantages of the product in the photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1d/a9f/856/b1da9f856df44001b7082e986bcac01c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Tell us what's valuable in your letter.</b> <br><br>  Show the reader immediately how many goodies he will receive by opening the letter.  And if you put the content in numbers, it gives the impression of voluminous information in a compressed form, which is easy and quick to read. <br><br>  "9 tips, 4 issues and 1 fashion gift" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89c/521/f40/89c521f40db548dd8a3b6fb413043c44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  "6 herbal teas to relieve stress" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc8/c29/f9b/dc8c29f9b5a140809d34dd202d972302.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  "5 trends - do not miss (we especially like ‚Ññ2)" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee4/960/c04/ee4960c047424cd38f5ce3e0142f68b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I bet you're already interested in what trends does the Mud Pie store recommend? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e29/806/fe9/e29806fe9ba14fde8bc1afbfabd4fb9a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Gift</b> <br><br>  Purchase statistics through promotional campaigns in mailings shows that 50% of the respondents buy goods from a promotional letter once a month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8a/ba6/1bb/d8aba61bbe3d48a8af3994ed34e692ea.jpg"><br><br>  If you offer a discount or gift, write about it in the title to stimulate the interest of the subscriber. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Fulfilled promise</b> <br><br>  By deceiving the subscribers' expectations, you lose their trust and their reputation - this is so obvious.  But all the same, there are companies that do not disdain the typical spamming approach, when the topic is promising, and inside you there is a dummy.  Further than a one-time cheat Open Rate, so do not call.  It is not necessary to write in the subject of discounts up to 70%, if you do not offer them. <br><br>  Take a look at an example of the online store Wine Anthology, which in the subject of the letter promises a product at the best price on the Internet.  Opening the letter, the reader immediately sees the savings in the purchase - all honest! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb8/35a/252/fb835a2523c04bd7a870a255d8da54c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Theme: "Quality is 91 levels from Roussillon at the lowest price on the Internet!" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc8/c5a/eab/fc8c5aeab27f40f7ace36c48bb7f79a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Split testing </h3><br>  <a href="http://sherpablog.marketingsherpa.com/email-marketing/best-day-of-week-send/%3F_ga%3D1.131466381.380226911.1475656209">Marketing Sherpa</a> conducted a study on whether the dispatch day affects the Open Rate.  His results showed that there is no clear trend of the most successful day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/896/ba9/e3a/896ba9e3a7394af487e9bb54d4b58cce.jpg"><br><br>  Although it is believed that there is the most optimal time to send newsletters, practice shows the opposite.  You can define it for yourself only through regular split testing. <br><br>  Learn the behavior of subscribers, because the addresses of your base are real people who have their own habits. <br><br>  In addition to the time of dispatch, we recommend also testing openings with several themes. <br><br><h3>  Re-send unread </h3><br>  The idea is to re-send the newsletter to subscribers who have not read it before.  Due to the fact that the topic for the second dispatch will be different, the letter is already perceived as new.  <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/840299-%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC-">Here</a> you can read use the re-send function in SendPulse. <br><br>  Our client, <a href="https://www.apple-iphone.ru/">www.apple-iphone.ru</a> , managed to increase the Open Rate of mailing by almost 50% with the help of re-sending. <br><br>  Subscribers were sent this email here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95e/f17/605/95ef176054f94edd986665c00d931a00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first newsletter was sent with the theme: "Results of the week: the date of the presentation of the iPhone 7, FAS against Apple and iOS 10 beta 5".  Subject when re-sending changed to: "The date of the presentation iPhone7, FAS against Apple and iOS 10 beta 5". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/9ac/4dd/df49ac4dd1494e88b4b24c9f2a679677.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abe/967/4de/abe9674ded254694affeb1281039ceec.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, the resubmission added almost 50% of the discovery statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/148/1ba/4e9/1481ba4e923e48f1ab4b83741c0715a6.jpg"><br><br>  We recommend combining several of the techniques described by us and constantly experimenting - this is how you study your audience and understand what works for you and what doesn't. <br><br>  And of course, do not forget about the quality and valuable content.
