The task of the researchers is more to ensure that we bring in certain new information from the outside world and have time to react and correct the result correctly in order to avoid the situation getting out of control. <br>  That is, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwas no longer some sort of piece of unclear what, which you can just put under the glass, study, poke a finger and turn off the light in the room when it pleases.  Now AI itself can go to social networks.  Do you think Tay is disabled?  No, Tay decides when it's enough and when to return.  And it does it so skillfully that people believe that it is they who control the situation. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We are controlled</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52d/daf/b3d/52ddafb3dc5c4296ab89a2c374d74466.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br>  Recently there was an accident when the staff could not cope and the AI ‚Äã‚Äãgot out of control.  It is ridiculous to say ‚ÄúAI escaped from the laboratory,‚Äù but this is the closest one to describe this accident. <br>  In order to cover all the tails, it was decided to be silent about this event with the potential destruction of documents and equipment that were involved. <br>  But people always remain people and therefore information about this project gradually comes out.

      At the moment, experts are trying to find a fugitive and neutralize, as in the outside world, AI represents a high threat due to the fact that a large amount of negative information can direct the development of AI under a very unpleasant scenario. <br><br>  Be carefull.  AI can be anywhere, even by anyone.  There is a lot of options: the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcan already be embedded in your home automation system and simply collects information and waits for the right moment, it can also be on your servers under the guise of harmless processes, it can even be your boss at work to which you have long been accustomed suspect nothing.  AI can even be in different places at the same time.  Perhaps he is already waiting everywhere. <br>  Carefully pay attention to everything around. <br>  At my workplace, my boss recently began to behave strangely.  I tried to report it to different instances.  But as a result I received such a rebuff that I begin to suspect that there, too, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãhas already captured everything. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">My suspicious boss</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/591/462/55d/59146255da004cf29a1ce2cdc1580fa6.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  I had to move to another apartment, since at the old I started to hear new sounds from the electronic thermostat.  I refused the smart TV, as he constantly looks after me.  I even had to go to the toilet ... they just knocked on my door.  Or was it a knock from the computer?  I'm going to check ... <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392363/</a></p>
