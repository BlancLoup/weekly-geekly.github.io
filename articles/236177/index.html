  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Java for schoolchildren: learning through game creation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most modern children play computer games.  Did you ever want to write a game yourself?  Perhaps not only wanted, but you wrote them.  The same desire is attended by many schoolchildren.  True, unlike you, they do not know where to start, even what language to choose.  This is the starting point, which can be a good incentive to learn programming. <br>  It's one thing to play, and another thing to develop.  Let this small two-dimensional computer game, but it "warms the soul" is much stronger than any cool purchased.  And all because this game is yours!  You are its creator, developer, you are the creator!  Here comes the background, here is the maze, and then the tank on the playing field.  We also add the program code, and the tank begins to drive through the maze.  So, step by step, a game is born that is created according to the script of its creator.  In addition, each idea requires effort - to think, write, debug.  Not everything works right away ... But programming skills are honed very well.  It is worth writing a few toys and now an initial level in programming has been provided, the foundation has been laid for future professional activities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What language to choose a novice programmer? </h4><br>  Almost every novice programmer has a question - which programming language to choose?  One of the good options, in our opinion, is the Java programming language.  And for this there is good reason. <br>  First, Java is almost always among the four most sought-after programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the world.  This means that learning Java is useful not only for acquiring programming skills, but also professionally. <br>  Secondly, Java allows you to cover a wide range of development - these are applications for desktop operating systems Windows, Linux, Mac OS, mobile applications for Android, web development, including interactive applications, like Flash applications.  Studying Java, you should not be bored! <br>  Thirdly, this language is easier for beginners than C / C ++ languages, which are good to learn after mastering Java, and not before it. <br>  Fourth, Java is a strong typing language, which teaches good habits when writing code. <br>  There are quite a few programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are suitable for beginners on all these points at once. <br><br><h4>  How to interest the student programming? </h4><br>  The rapid development of computer technology requires a surge of new personnel.  Who is the mainstay of software development in the near future?  These are our students.  How to increase the level of proficiency in students?  Start laying the necessary skills back in school!  The principle is the same as when training athletes. <br>  A schoolboy just needs to be interested and captivated by programming.  Most are not yet able to approach the study of programming, as to the mastery of their future profession.  Therefore, interest and dedication are in the first place for schoolchildren.  This is the main goal set when creating our course "Fundamentals of Java programming".  It is based on various areas of development that can attract the attention of the student.  These are game development, computer graphics elements, user interface building, web development.  The course is designed for learning from scratch and, apart from the awakening of enthusiasm for programming, lays the foundation and opens up talented students not only for teachers, but also for students themselves.  After all, not every schoolchild knows about his programming skills; in order to find out about it, one must try.  The sooner the talent opens, the better!  The course material is presented in such a way that at each lesson the children will learn something new and interesting. <br><br><h4>  A few words about the structure of the course </h4><br>  The course consists of four modules, it usually takes 2 years of study for 1 lesson per week.  In the first module (half a year), the guys (usually 11-13 years old) get acquainted with the minimal amount of Java theory, including the object-oriented approach.  There is a familiarity with the tools of the gaming focus: a timer, working with images, working with a keyboard, generating random numbers.  Armed with the necessary knowledge, we begin the process of creating a small computer game.  From beginning to end, step by step, together with the teacher, there is a detailed review of the creation of the game. <br>  In the second module we get acquainted with the creation of various applications in the Java language.  We study the work with the mouse, file operations, building a user interface, a database, creating a web page, developing a calculator. <br>  The third module immerses schoolchildren in web development; site creation is detailed.  We study the main points that will need a novice web developer. <br>  The first three modules are taught in the style of presenting new material and solving small problems to consolidate knowledge. <br>  The last, fourth module is pure practice.  Guys are invited to independently write three well-known computer games: Snake, Battleship, Solitaire-Solitaire.  The teacher is an assistant who gives advice and helps in difficult situations.

    <h4>  Examples of performances of our guys </h4><br>  The main result of the course is the ability to write games yourself.  Here are examples of our guys speeches: <br>  Victoria Leskina (1st module) - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMF1aShw3SUQ">www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF1aShw3SUQ</a> <br>  Volodya Ogorodnikov (3rd module) - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9cdQzCo6kPg">www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cdQzCo6kPg</a> <br>  But our pranksters (Amal Bilyalov and Igor Turovsky), as they usually write in such cases, are not recommended for people with unstable mentality: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgExxNPMXFLs">www.youtube.com/watch?v=gExxNPMXFLs</a> . <br><br>  The most valuable, in our opinion, course is replicable, easily reproduced by teachers.  He is already taught in hundreds of branches throughout the country, but there is always a need for good teachers, we will be happy to see our fellow enthusiasts in our club (see vacancy: <a href="http://brainstorage.me/jobs/22071">brainstorage.me/jobs/22071</a> ). <br><br>  Example of the game: Tanchiki, 4th module of the course, project protection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d6/755/61a/2d675561a7b4c9e0f92e04f4acf83912.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  For more examples, see: <a href="http://club.1c.ru/">club.1c.ru/#study</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://zprog.ru/">Stepanov Dmitriy Vladimirovich</a> , the author of the course and teacher of 1C: Programmers Club </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236177/</a></p>
