(good question, I'm still looking for an answer) I lived in a small town, regular schools, a couple of vocational schools and a branch of a simple university.  He graduated from music school, played throughout school life in the theater, but after the 11th grade, he jerked to embark on the technical path.  I didn‚Äôt want to become a programmer, although I didn‚Äôt study in a class with a focus on computer science, I looked at specialties related to engineering or robotics.  I applied to where I could, went to a military school, I realized that it was not mine.  Stayed at the choice of 2 universities, was not, I will go to Peter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In St. Petersburg, the choice is huge, but something convinced me to go and study for a pilot ‚Äî this is prestigious, monetary, status in society.  Upon admission it was proposed to choose 3 directions, without hesitation, indicated the pilot (2 directions: specialist and bachelor).  But the guys in the admissions committee persuaded to choose the third one, he said that I don‚Äôt care about programming, I can go there (it‚Äôs not for good reason that I‚Äôve been learning how to distribute the skills of an IT specialist (also for money) ).  August is nearing the end, monitoring the lists every day, I understand that I don‚Äôt pass the pilot because of the number of points, I was slowly going to the army, to replant the trees, to clean the snow, but suddenly, the call from my parents: ‚ÄúSon, congratulations! Amazedly waiting for the continuation.  ‚ÄúYou entered the IADSU, we do not know what it is, but on the budget!  We are very pleased! ‚Äù‚Äú Yes, ‚ÄùI think,‚Äú the main thing is the budget! ‚ÄùWhile scratching my head, I thought about what this mysterious ORASUDD means, but whatever it is, I'm going to St. Petersburg, and this is already a huge reason to rejoice. <br><br><h2>  Start studying </h2><br>  Decoding is as follows: the organization of automated air traffic control systems.  It is a lot of letters, as well as sense.  For a note, I did not study the first course in St. Petersburg, we were sent to Vyborg, not from a good life, of course, but on the whole it was even better than one would expect.

      Our group was very small, only 11 people (at the moment there are already 5 of us), and everyone, absolutely everyone, did not understand what they were doing here. <br><br>  The first course was simple, as with any specialty, nothing unusual, a typewriter, mathematics and a couple of humanitarian subjects.  Half a year has passed, and I still don‚Äôt understand what the IADS means, and even more so than they do.  At the end of the first semester, a teacher comes to us from St. Petersburg and reads to us the ‚ÄúIntroduction to the profession‚Äù discipline. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll right, finally I will hear the answers to my eternal questions,‚Äù I thought, but it's not that simple. <br>  This specialty was very popular and not so far from programming.  We were even more surprised by the fact that this is generally the only specialty in Russia that has no analogues. <br><br>  The essence of the profession is to understand all the processes occurring in the sky, to collect information from all types of locators and digitally transmit to the monitor of the dispatcher.  Simply put, we do what the dispatcher can work with (aviation software).  Inspiring, isn't it?  We were told that even criminal liability is provided if your code suddenly becomes the cause of the disaster. <br><br>  Remove from the heap of small things and subtleties and talk about the topic of programming. <br><br><h2>  Grain by grain </h2><br>  After we successfully completed the first course and came to study further in St. Petersburg, it became a little more interesting, and with each semester it is becoming clearer what they want from us.  We finally started coding, learning the basics of C ++.  With each semester, our knowledge increased, there were a lot of subjects related to aviation and radio engineering. <br><br>  By the beginning of the 4th year, I already knew a couple of libraries, learned to use the vector and its relatives.  A little practiced OOP, inheritance, classes, in general, all that, without which C ++ programming is generally difficult to imagine.  There were a lot of subjects related to radio engineering, physics, Linux appeared, which seemed very complicated, but generally interesting. <br><br>  Of us did not try to make good programmers, of us they wanted to make people who understand all the processes, probably this is the problem.  We had to be hybrids, something between a programmer, an operator and a manager at the same time (it‚Äôs not for nothing that they say they don‚Äôt kill two birds with one stone).  We knew a lot of different things, but only a little bit of everything.  Every year I became more and more interested in coding, but due to the lack of subjects aimed at this, the desire to learn more remained unfulfilled.  Yes, maybe I could do it myself, at home, but in my student years there are few things when you‚Äôre worried about things that will not be in session.  That is why, being on the threshold of the 5th course, I understand that all the knowledge I have accumulated over 4 years is a small handful, with which no one waits for me anywhere.  No, I do not say that we were poorly taught that knowledge is not the same or not necessary.  I think the whole point is that the realization that I like programming came to me only at the end of the 4th course.  Only now I understand how huge the choice is in the directions of coding, how much can be done if I choose one way out of a thousand and start exploring everything that concerns this topic.  After reviewing a lot of vacancies, I come to the conclusion that there is nowhere to go, there is no experience, knowledge is minimal.  Hands fall and it seems that all the efforts in learning sypyatsya eyes.  I gave it all to 5, I tried so much in writing programs, and then it turns out that what I do at the university, real programmers click like seeds during breaks. <br><br>  ‚ÄúITMO, GUUP, Polytech ... I really could have done there, I would have had enough points, and even if I did not want to go there, probably still better than here!‚Äù, I thought, biting my elbow.  But the choice has been made, time has taken its toll, and I can only pull myself together and do everything in my power. <br><br><h2>  Conclusions and a small farewell for those who have not yet begun their journey </h2><br>  Already this summer I have to do practical work in a very solid company, and take up business directly related to my specialty.  Very scary, because I can not justify not only their hopes, but also the hopes of the leader.  However, if you do something in this life, you need to do it wisely and efficiently.  Although I haven‚Äôt yet created anything supercomplex or ordinary, I‚Äôve just started, I‚Äôve just started to figure out what to do, and I still have to learn the whole taste of programming.  Maybe I started not there, and in the wrong area, and in general I do not what I dreamed of.  But I started with something and realized that I want to connect life with programming, though I haven‚Äôt chosen the road I‚Äôm going to, maybe it will be a database, or industrial programming, maybe I will write mobile applications or software for systems installed on airplanes.  One thing I know for sure, it's time to start, and as soon as possible to understand that of all the software abundance I would like to taste. <br><br>  Young reader, if you still do not know who you want to become, do not worry, most adults do not know that either.  The main thing is to try.  It is through trial and error that you can finally understand what you want.  If you want to become a programmer, then start is always more important than knowing exactly what area to be.  All languages ‚Äã‚Äãare alike, and programming is no exception. <br><br>  PS I would have known that I would swim, I would take swimming trunks.  I would really like to start to understand all this before, but due to lack of interest, the routine of learning and not understanding what will happen next, I missed the time.  But piously believe that it is never too late. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452902/</a></p>
