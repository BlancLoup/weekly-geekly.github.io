      Q &amp; A <br><br><h5>  What is it this time? </h5><br>  Two large consistent theories about the Matrix, each divided into several small ones.  As always, Easter eggs and small theories are hidden in the spoiler so as not to overload the article. <br><br><h5>  Is this about what is the Matrix in the Matrix? </h5><br>  Nah  I do not like this theory, although it is so popular that it is already on the verge of a canon.  As for me, this theory is terrible, because with the help of this trick you can explain anything (it's just a dream).  In addition, do not forget about the Occam's razor, this theory introduces new entities that are optional for an explanation. <br><br><h5>  Why do I need to read this </h5><br>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa dystopian cyberpunk.  Speaking of it, you have to roll into everything that is discussed on the resource: robotics, AI, programming, energy, etc. <br><br><h5>  Spoilers? </h5><br>  Of course, a lot.  All about the trilogy and animatritsy.  Other works like <a href="http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Goliath">‚ÄúGoliath‚Äù</a> or <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online">The Matrix Online</a> in this case are irrelevant.  The first, because it describes very strange events (such as the collision of cars with aliens), the second - because it is a misery from the point of view of the plot, IMHO.  There is also a small spoiler from the game Mass Effect (actually large). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãfull of various symbols and references.  This is very mildly.  There are too many reasons for speculation here and, therefore, I decided to concentrate only on two topics. <br><br><h4>  1. Cypher </h4><br>  The villain in the movie - a rather conventional concept.  <s>Only the Sith think absolutes</s> Good drama does not recognize absolutes.  Much more interesting when the antagonist is motivated by something other than the desire to prevent the main character.  In the Matrix there is such a character.  Cypher.  About him will be the first part of theories. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">by the way, about the villains in the first matrix</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the first film, there is such an amusing separation of characters.  All ‚ÄúGood‚Äù guys wear round or oval glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a62/fca/543/a62fca5433904d7cafb2abf10918f4bf.jpg"><br><br>  While the "villains" prefer rectangular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d6/a65/7e4/9d6a657e43be449fbc9990338381f558.jpg"><br><br>  If you know about it at the beginning - you can notice the spoiler: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/634/e3f/c33634e3fddf4a2395a937a19fadf4cc.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><h4>  1.1.  Cypher was supposed to be elected </h4><br>  Remember how Neo is sitting in his cabin and Morpheus comes to him.  He says that he should apologize to Neo, that there is a rule that it is impossible to release a person who has reached a certain age.  The brain does not accept the truth and Morpheus saw this.  He then tells the story of the chosen one and says that he had no choice.  So, there is a strict rule according to which adults cannot be released, and this rule can only be violated in exceptional cases. <br><br>  From the file that Agent Smith shows Neo, we can find out that Thomas Anderson is either 37 or 28. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/636/654/4ad/6366544ad7334ca795944790b395427a.gif"><br><br>  According to the passport, date of birth September 71st <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61e/931/c05/61e931c0515d46f0a0df8775ec48b191.png"><br><br>  According to database records - March 1962 <br><br>  I, personally, am inclined to the first option (Although if you take the age of an actor, nevertheless, the second is closer).  But, let's say, Neo, yet 37. Then we can say that 35-37 years old is already too late to be awakened. <br><br>  From Cypher‚Äôs conversation with Smith in a restaurant, we‚Äôll find out when Cypher was woken up: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/b95/ae1/a9cb95ae168740e7b78f7adb2a249e4a.jpg"><br>  <sup>‚ÄúYou know what I understood in 9 years?</sup>  <sup>The blessing in ignorance "</sup> <br><br>  9 years.  Actor Joe Pantoliano is older than Keanu Reeves for 13 years.  The film also has the feeling that Cypher is older than Neo. <br><br>  Be that as it may, it is obvious that Cypher was released at a conscious age and it is not clear why, because the rule forbids it. <br><br>  We look further.  Cypher was in love with Trinity and, according to some awkward dialogues, it can be assumed that for a short time, Trinity rendered him signs of attention.  It turns out that according to the forecast of Pythia, Cypher could have been elected. <br><br>  Now imagine a story: Morpheus leads Cypher and tells him how very soon he (Cypher) otkungfuit all agents and will save humanity.  Trinity sympathizes with him, the team looks at him like a hero.  Based on Smith‚Äôs same conversation with Cypher, the latter definitely likes the attention.  He certainly respected Morpheus as a leader and believed him while he said that Cypher would save the world.  But, it soon turned out that there would not be a elected Cypher. <br><br>  Perhaps Morpheus also led him to Pythia, she also told Cypher that he was wrong, and Cypher killed it.  Neo reacted rather calmly to the news that he was not elected, he was even pleased.  But for Cypher, it was a tragedy.  He was disappointed in the leader who lied to him, he lost his beloved, who became interested in this new type, he can not do anything significant, but is forced to live in this cold world and eat the same mess every day.  Not surprisingly, all he can think about is: ‚Äúwhy I didn‚Äôt take another pill!‚Äù <br><br><h4>  1.2.Morpheus knew about the coming betrayal </h4><br>  At the beginning of the first film, we hear Cypher‚Äôs conversation with Trinity: <br>  <i>- you heard?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- heard what?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Are you sure the line is clean?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- of course I'm sure.</i> <br><br>  At this moment police break in.  Immediately after Trinity gets rid of them, she calls Morpheus: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúMorpheus, the line is being tracked, I don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- I know they cut the cable.</i> <br><br>  After that, we hear the conversation of agents who say that the informant did not disappoint and now they know the name of the target. <br><br>  Morpheus is smart enough to at least suspect something amiss after the attack on Trinity, but he doesn‚Äôt investigate the incident and is not surprised by the fact that the agents figured out Neo, just after Trinity‚Äôs conversation with Cypher. <br><br>  It is likely that Pythia told Morpheus about the betrayal of Cypher, and even convinced that it is impossible to intervene, because it is this betrayal that will launch a chain of events by which Neo will become chosen. <br><br>  If you doubt the determination of Morpheus - remember the scene where he tells Neo about the agents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/04c/850/3e104c8500af4c4488b61eb5d723394d.JPG"><br><br>  The whole scene is gorgeous and the music and the woman in red.  But here is what Morphus Neo said: <br><br>  <i>"... The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa system, Neo. The system is our enemy. But when you are inside, look around. What do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The minds of the very people we are trying to save. But until then, these people still a part of the system, and therefore they are our enemies. You must understand that most of these people are not ready to wake up. Many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to defend it.</i> <br><br>  Now imagine that the conversation goes between a recruiter in a terrorist organization and a newcomer.  In fact, Morpheus says: our goal is the highest, and the end justifies the means. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">lazy programmers</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Speaking of this scene.  Wachowski, specifically took on the role of extras of twins, in order that it seemed as if a lazy programmer, in constructing the world, was too lazy to prescribe each person individually and just skipipastil half. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f65/f6a/a23/f65f6aa23b474599af4864a686f0ce95.jpg"><br><br>  I selected a few, you can search for the rest. <br></div></div><br><br>  The Morpheus installations are excellent.  Remember the cult scene when Neo and Trinity break into the building where Morpheus is held.  Now take a look at this scene from the perspective of the usual guards who work in this building.  One of them did not even have time to finish the coffee when Neo discharged the clip into it.  In fact, Neo and Trinity could just cut them down or distract them.  Somehow try to avoid the victims, but instead, they staged a real massacre. <br><br>  And if you still doubt how Wachowski themselves treated Morpheus, here is a clear illustration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/109/5a5/65b/1095a565b704425f9beab60ea3aa51ba.jpg"><br><br>  Morpheus offers Neo fruit from the tree of knowledge.  Having tasted it, Neo will leave ‚ÄúEden‚Äù forever. <br><br><h4>  1.3.  Who helped Cypher to try steak </h4><br>  Let us return to the scene where Cypher is at a table in a restaurant with Agent Smith.  It was at this meeting that Cypher surrenders to Morpheus.  But who connected it to the matrix, and even if he connected, we know for sure that without an operator, it is impossible to get out of the matrix.  Even if it were possible, it was risky, since anyone could see him in the chair and read what was happening on the monitor. <br><br>  Here we must recall two points. <br><br>  1) Mouse offers Neo to have fun with a woman in red, it causes smiles, but not surprise. <br><br>  2) when Neo comes up to Cypher, he gets scared, and then he says, looking at the monitor: I see a blonde, brunette, redhead ... <br><br>  Cypher could ask Mouse to arrange a date with the girl in red and stand on the streamer until he finishes.  Moreover, he could ask Mouse not to look at the screen.  To be faithful, he could do this several times and make sure that Mouse is not looking.  Even if he looked at the screen - only he would have to be killed, and this is better than the entire crew. <br><br>  We can assume that Mouse would not arrange a meeting in the matrix (too dangerous), but could well use the boot program.  Cypher, at the same time, could write his own program that would allow him to go from the designer to the matrix (we know that this is possible in the scene ‚Äúwe need weapons, many weapons‚Äù).  Perhaps it was during the writing of this program that Neo found Cypher.  If you agree that Morpheus knew about the coming betrayal, then we can even assume that he did everything to make Cyfer‚Äôs plan a success. <br><br>  Ironically, but right before death, Mouse looks at a poster with a red woman who killed him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ee/9ad/2de/8ee9ad2de4b0426aaaa3e9b024cdf15a.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And more about Cypher</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  During the meeting with Smith, Cypher makes his demands.  He says: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI don't want to remember anything, do you understand?‚Äù</i>  <i>And I want to be rich, someone <u>important</u> , such as an actor</i> <br><br>  It's funny because the actors, although they can be rich, are hardly ‚Äúimportant.‚Äù  Although there were a few exceptions.  And, for clarity, Smith at the beginning of the dialogue calls Cypher by last name: <br><br>  <i>- We have agreed, Mr. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4">Reagan</a> ?</i> <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  2. We turn to another big topic: cars </h4><br>  From the animatrix we learn how the conflict developed.  AIs are becoming more common in the world, but people treated them like slaves.  All this lasted until one of the robots killed a man.  It spurred hatred of cars and a wave of violence swept the globe.  Then the cars went away and built their city called 0.1 (you can appreciate all the modesty of the machines).  Next - the company's 0.1 shares grew sharply and their economy flourished, strong production destroyed the production of people, caused unemployment, which led to armed conflict.  Machines greatly outnumbered people and then they (people) decided on a desperate step: to hide the sun behind the clouds forever.  Machines captured people and began to use them as a source of energy.  After some time, people began to grow. <br><br><h4>  2.1.  Machines clearly did not hate people at any stage. </h4><br>  1) having created their own city, they continued to deliver goods to people, although there was no need for it <br>  2) the car killing a man caused a whole storm.  It was the first case and that self defense <br>  3) after the final victory, the machines did not just enslave people, they put them in a virtual environment where everyone can be happy (the first iteration of the matrix).  What opponent did that to a defeated enemy?  And not just the enemy, let's call a spade a spade, close the sky - it was an attempt at genocide. <br><br><h4>  2.2.  Power supply? </h4><br>  The human body, whatever Morpheus says, cannot be a source of nourishment.  First, no matter how much energy the body produces, this energy must feed not only the machines, but also the matrix itself (how many servers it is), and if we add to it the energy spent on growing the body and maintaining life in it, then need to figure out who owes to whom.  In fact, this is a violation of the 1st law of thermodynamics, but who cares. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Rendering problems</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Remember this scene? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de6/43f/4a4/de643f4a4d5a49bdb356a5b154794ea1.jpg"><br><br>  Someone hates her, someone loves the opposite.  But as a fact, at some point, it starts to seem like you are watching a pixar cartoon.  On the forums, people explain it this way: the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù of the chosen one must be rather heavy, since he constantly causes glitches in the program (such as waves before take-off), Smith, as the antipode of the chosen one, also has to weigh a lot.  Therefore, the more Smiths, the worse.  At the moment when the agents piled on Neo, we again see a decent picture.  Apparently, due to the fact that the objects stopped moving. <br></div></div><br><br>  We can assume that the machines did find some way to efficiently get energy from the human body, but why?  The first generation was solar-powered, but what's stopping the machines from replacing the power supply?  For example, atomic reactors?  Or wind turbines (with the wind, they have all the rules), or whatever.  With the absence of economic barriers, free labor, high intelligence, and the desire to survive, the cars had to master the closed fuel cycle for a dozen years, maximum. <br><br>  For highly developed AI - the machines behave somehow very much too stupid <br><br>  In addition, we know for sure that people were not used as a power source by the end of the third film; otherwise, the machines would not release them under any circumstances. <br><br><h4>  2.3.  Machines created Zion and all technology for people. </h4><br>  We know that they re-created the matrix at least 6 times and destroyed Zion.  What for?  According to the architect, it was necessary in order to identify people who would not accept the program.  Now imagine these two dozen people with atrophied muscles who somehow got out of the city of cars and got to a safe place, and then built a city, etc.  It's hard to imagine such a thing.  Zion, like the ships and all the technology was not created by the people who escaped from the first matrix. <br><br>  On the ships that we saw in the movie stamping done in the USA.  (Plaque on the ship: MARK III No. 11 / Nebuchadnezzar / Made in the USA / Year 2069. Mark 3:11 - ‚ÄúAnd the unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell before Him and shouted: You are the Son of God.‚Äù) .  The matrix was created six times, each time the Chosen One deduced two dozen people.  By the third film, about 250,000 people live in Zion.  How much growth would it take?  years 100?  Total, about 600 years.  With all due respect to the American industry, like any other, but the technology of this level of complexity can not live for 600 years, not to mention the paint. <br><br>  Next, a little observation.  Zion, in addition to referring to Jerusalem, has a similarity with the name of the city of cars.  The first city of cars was called 0.1 =&gt; zero one =&gt; z-one [zi one] =&gt; zion <br><br>  It turns out that the machines not only allowed the released people to escape from the matrix, but also supplied them with everything they needed (including geothermal energy machines (and what prevented them from using it themselves?)) <br><br>  But if so, then why did they eventually destroy the entire population of people?  What are they afraid of?  Let's look at the people in Zion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8aa/a1a/de8/8aaa1ade8f754ee19a276f7000798e19.jpg"><br><br>  And then take a look at the city of cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/615/692/10d61569241d4e5eb4ddc351b2e9a34f.jpg"><br><br>  What harm could people do to cars ??  At the end of the first matrix, Neo threatens the phone: I follow you, but in the second part we see that the maximum he can do is to kill all the agents.  And to hell with them, the matrix, as it works, and so, but nothing threatens the city. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And more about glamorous people in Zion</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Why are they all dark?  They have not seen the rays of the sun in life, but for some reason they are all dark. <br><br>  Answer: the lack of sunlight, would have caused a lack of vitamin D, which would have serious consequences.  In order to avoid this, apparently, people in Zion had to spend some time in a tanning salon. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  2.4.  Machines follow Zero Law </h4><br>  But the main question: What did the car all this time?  They have no religion, no one to serve them, all they need is a power source, but what's the point?  They did not start space expansion, although they could, did not even spread on the ground.  What do they do in the evenings?  How to spend the weekend?  And the weekend of what?  I mean, what kind of work do they have, besides defense, attack and matrix support? <br><br>  Now my theory.  If you played the mass effect, you remember, the key question that the reapers had to answer (if not played - it doesn't matter, the question was how to resolve the inevitable conflict between the living and the AI) I think the machines worked on the same question, but they found the answer. <br><br>  What are the machines afraid of?  People can do no harm, even if they free everyone who is in the matrix.  And we know that revenge is not inherent in machines.  Note something else.  Suppose all people are released, but the status quo in relations with the machines is preserved.  How will billions of people live without the sun?  What will they eat?  How to develop technology?  This is certain death.  In less than a year, as across the whole earth, people would start destroying each other for the sake of resources.  It seems to me, in this case, the machines perform the same role as the reapers in Mass Effect, they strictly control people in order to avoid their total destruction.  When Zion reaches a certain mark of the population - the city is destroyed in order to avoid painful death from starvation.  In fact, this is all the same idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Zero Law of</a> robotics, which conflicts with the first one. <br><br><h4>  2.5.  The chosen one is really jesus </h4><br>  The fact that the appearance of the elect is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe architect we already know from the second film, but what if he lied about the reasons or did not know them? <br><br>  Machines were created to serve.  They were supposed to save humanity.  It seems to me that it was they who were busy. <br><br>  Suppose the machines initially sought peace, but by their bitter experience they knew that people prone to xenophobia are intolerant of machines, especially after losing the war.  But to keep people in slavery is also unacceptable for cars, because this is no salvation.  It was necessary to figure out how to help people see the possibility of peaceful coexistence.  At the same time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world had to come from people (the machines themselves repeatedly offered peace to people).  Among other things, people are their creators, what kind of child does not want love from a parent.  It would be unbearable to be Tyrants over people for cars.  But how to bring people to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world?  How to make them understand? <br>  Solution: To simulate a world in which machines can instill the right thought to all people.  The first matrix was a utopia in which everyone was happy.  Drawing a world in which people and cars help each other live was a fairly obvious idea, but as we know, people did not accept the simulation.  I had to look for another way out. <br><br>  It was necessary to instill the right thought in the framework of the familiar world of people.  One of the people, the one for whom all of humanity would follow, had to offer them a truce himself.  And who is suitable for this role better than the Prophet Savior?  At the same time, everything must be done so that people do not feel a forgery (and cars already know that people are susceptible to deception) the slightest hint of manipulation and people will hate them even more. <br><br>  Then the cycle was invented (almost the same as in the mass effect), and only those who break this cycle can be considered a carrier of free will.  The one for whom will go, because he did everything in defiance. <br><br>  Further people were needed outside the matrix who were aware of the situation, because people in the matrix would not follow the prophet, simply because they were told so.  In the event that the Chosen One did not break the cycle, all traces of the previous experiment should have been destroyed. <br><br>  Remember when Neo comes to the city of cars and speaks about their main thing about Smith, he argues with Neo. When the latter offers peace, the evil god-machine immediately connects him to the matrix.  Later, if you look at the scene just before all the Smiths are destroyed, you will notice that the impulse (or whatever it is) that triggered the chain reaction went along the wires <u>to Neo</u> , and not from him.  If Neo had somehow destroyed Smith, the signal should have gone from Neo to the server, and not vice versa.  It turns out that the car eventually destroyed Smith and Neo, by and large, was not needed for this. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, about the main car</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the credits you can find out how it is called: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/479/2f2/d964792f2cd242218f520c05176a7fe1.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina">God is out of the car</a> .  This is pretty good self-irony. <br></div></div><br><br>  After the end of the film, centuries will pass and the legend about Neo will be passed on from generation to generation, overgrown with mystical details.  It will take 300 years and it will become a full-fledged religion.  She will very well fall on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe end of the world and the second coming.  And the main precept of this new messiah will be the world with cars! <br><br>  This explains the overcrowding with Christian symbolism.  The name of the ship, the nicknames of the characters, the name of the city, the general plot, all this could be one way or another, inspired by machines, so that people subconsciously feel the similarity. <br><br><h4>  To strengthen the world, cars will help people to restore the earth. </h4><br>  It seems to me that in 600 years they have developed all the technology to disperse the clouds and terraform the earth.  Why haven't they done it before?  Two reasons: <br><br>  1) People will appreciate help, not a given. <br><br>  2) People disconnected from the matrix, should see the result of the actions of their ancestors, for them it should become a reality.  Then, they, like Cypher, realize that all this time the machines protected them from the truth, and did not keep them locked up. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Thus, the machines did exactly what they were created for; they saved humanity from itself.  At the same time, they implemented a brilliant multi-path (for 600 years ahead!) Which, in principle, only supercomputers are capable of. <br><br>  There are many stories about how machines will destroy humanity, moreover, we are already beginning to fear AI.  Constantly flashed the news about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/241810/">Mask</a> , then about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/221933/">Hawking</a> .  But we must bear in mind that these are people and not machines full of chauvinism of ideas about racial superiority, etc. In the 21st century, we still lead religious wars and believe in horoscopes.  So fear is rather <u>for</u> AI. <br><br><h4>  Small bonus </h4><br>  In this <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244780/">article,</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/xmeoff/" class="user_link">xmeoff</a> asks why 1999 is simulated in the Matrix? <br><br>  Here is my version.  First you need to understand that in the matrix, if there is a notion of time - it should be very different from the time in our world, otherwise the machines could not keep everything at the same level for hundreds of years, even with rebutts.  It can also explain the finale of the first part (attack on the ship), when events in the matrix and events in real time are not synchronous.  We know that the action takes place at the end of the sixth cycle and it is 1999 that comes at the end.  It seems to me for two reasons.  At the end of the 20th century, there were two themes that excited the whole world in one form or another. <br><br>  1) general religious sentiment, fear of the apocalypse. <br><br>  2) it was a year, Y2K problems.  Although by that time many experts were sure that the world was not in danger, but the media were fanning the problem.  That year came the real awareness of how much we are dependent on machines and this awareness came to people who also could not have their own PC. <br><br>  Using these moods, the machines achieved two goals: <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1) people who are disconnected from the matrix, for the most part, are ready to accept an apocalyptic reality </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2) these people tend to understand their dependence on machines and will more easily accept new orders</font></font><br><br>  That's all.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suggest new topics in the comments and vote for the next in the poll. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank you for reading to the end!</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367899/</a></p>
