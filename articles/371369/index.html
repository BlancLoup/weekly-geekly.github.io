We are conquering peaks again!  Most recently, AMD presented the 2000 Ryzen processors.  The first models were the hybrid models Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G, in which the computing part, built on the basis of the Zen architecture, is combined with the integrated graphics Radeon Vega.  Armed with <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPredatorDDR4">HyperX Predator</a> fast RAM, we tested one of the new products on modern games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/nn/hr/monnhrgaximejknwzsm7dxvme64.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The regulars of our blog will surely remember last year‚Äôs experiment, in which we tested various hybrid processors (also known as APUs) in modern games.  As it turned out, if there is high-frequency memory in the system, it is quite realistic to play even with an APU. <br><br>  However, the year 2018 has come.  If you do not take into account the Intel Kaby Lake-G SoC system with the Radeon RX Vega M chip, then AMD introduced the APU with the most powerful graphics core.  We got a test of the older model - Ryzen 5 2400G.  And we gladly tested it on modern games.

    <h2>  About New Ryzen </h2><br>  Very soon, the "red" will completely update the line of central processors Ryzen.  Models Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G, as already mentioned earlier, are the first signs of desktop solutions based on Zen architecture, equipped with integrated graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/7g/hx/lo7ghx17weciwu2oz1mv7engxew.jpeg"><br><br>  Last year, we already studied the capabilities of Ryzen chips with high-frequency RAM.  As it turned out, "ryazhenka" (as affectionately AMD products were named by enthusiasts) with a slow and fast "RAM" - these are two completely different in terms of system performance.  It was determined which DDR4 memory is best suited for gaming PCs based on ‚Äúred‚Äù processors.  With the release of Raven Ridge processors (Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G), the situation at low has not changed. <br><br>  As you know, Ryzen processors without integrated graphics all, without exception, consist of two CCX modules (Core Complex), as well as all the necessary strapping in the form of an Infinity Fabric bus, a memory controller and other elements.  Each such module contained four cores.  Depending on the model (Ryzen 3 - quad, Ryzen 5 - quad and six cores, Ryzen 7 - eight cores), the number of cores in the CCX module varied.  In order for Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G to be born, we had to abandon one such module and place it on an iGPU chip.  As a result, the Raven Ridge crystal area remained almost the same - 210 versus 218 mm2, but at the same time the transistor budget increased from 4.8 to 4.94 billion.  It uses the same 14-nanometer process technology.  As you know, Ryzen chips of the second generation will be produced on a thinner 12-nm process technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/5u/oj/vu5uojnwsu2l-y7nfzgz1a2devm.jpeg"><br><br>  In particular, this is why the Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G have a total of 8 MB cache in the third level.  We know that the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 chips are equipped with twice as much memory.  On the other hand, the simplification of the CCX module operation algorithms made it possible to reduce the latency of the L3 cache in the Raven Ridge by about 5 cycles.  In tasks that are sufficient for 8 MB, the chip Ryzen 5 2400G, will manifest itself better than the same Ryzen 5 1500X, for example.  At the same time, the second level memory cache was noticeably accelerated: delays were reduced from 17 to 13 cycles.  As you can see, the integrated graphics in the Raven Ridge hybrid CPU is far from the only innovation.  AMD engineers have done a good job this year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ok/qn/rs/okqnrschcfwopebiasepsntkgjk.png"><br><br>  The above is a screenshot of the main features of the Ryzen 5 2400G and the Ryzen 3 2200G.  The older model not only works at a higher frequency, but also supports SMT technology, that is, the user can rely on data processing in eight streams.  The Ryzen 3 2200G does not support SMT. <br><br>  The Ryzen 5 2400G model is ultimatum, as it uses the Radeon Vega 11 graphics. As the name implies, the iGPU in this chip has all 11 CU computing units (these are 704 stream processors).  In terms of speed in games, this hybrid processor will overtake even the model Ryzen 7 2700U with its 10 computing units.  The Ryzen 3 2200G model is equipped with eight CU-blocks and 512 computing threads, respectively.  The iGPU clock frequency differs in chips.  Thus, the graphics of the older model operates at a frequency of 1.25 GHz, and the youngest - 1.1 GHz. <br><br><h2>  Stick here </h2><br>  Consider the built-in graphics of any processor as a base for games can only be in two cases - from hopelessness or interest for the sake of.  We are sure that it is not necessary for the visitors of Geek to explain what time we live and why game video cards have become so expensive now.  It is the shortage of video cards that causes the demand for similar APUs.  In our understanding, the purchase of processors such as the Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G, will be a worthy option that will allow to wait out these difficult times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/bs/ye/rjbsyexgyzpu-evhxrvvyvtb3cm.jpeg"><br><br>  Judge for yourself - at the moment Ryzen 5 2400G in Moscow retail costs an average of 11,000 rubles.  Approximately for the same money you will be able to purchase a bundle consisting of discrete graphics GeForce GT 1030 and a dual-core Pentium G4560 chip.  The first option is promising, over time, we will buy a GeForce GTX 1060 or Radeon RX 580 video card into the system without any problems and get a cool gaming system unit.  The second option does not possess such dignity.  That's why we decided to test the Ryzen 5 2400G, and at the same time compare its performance with the discrete graphics of the GeForce 1030 GT. <br><br>  Naturally, in the case of the AMD assembly, good and fast HyperX memory is indispensable. <br><br><h2>  Testing </h2><br>  The memory controller of the Raven Ridge processors does not just by default support the operation of the DDR4-2933 RAM.  Just in case, we recall that these chips are supported by any motherboard based on the AM4 platform.  You only need to update the BIOS so that the device recognizes new items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/lg/xh/-glgxhes6epmgl8bqs_o5f2-2ha.png"><br><br>  In general, AMD processors and motherboards support RAM up to an effective frequency of 4000 MHz.  However, DDR4-3000 / 3200 kits are especially popular among users, which is why we will focus on this frequency in today's testing. <br><br>  For testing, we used the Ryzen 5 2400G quad-core, the <a href="https://www.asus.com/ru/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-X370-F-GAMING/">ASUS ROG STRIX X370-F GAMING motherboard</a> and the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPredatorDDR4">HyperX Predator</a> HX436C17PB3K2 / 16 memory kit with a capacity of 16 GB.  Also in the test was the video card MSI GeForce GT1030 2G LP OC.  The RAM Kit operates at a very high effective frequency of 3,600 MHz with delays of 17-18-18-39.  He earned no problems in our test bench. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/5q/js/st5qjsnhmsq1ynel3frdinpupmg.png"><br><br>  The tests were carried out in the environment of Microsoft Windows 10 x64.  For AMD stand, driver 17.40.3701 was used.  For GeForce GT 1030, driver 391.24 was used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1j/wn/xs/1jwnxs3f4xqrd4mbc-plm7oek_e.jpeg"><br><br>  By default, the integrated Ryzen 5 2400G graphics are allocated 1 GB of memory, but in the BIOS settings of the motherboard this parameter can be changed to 2 GB.  For example, on ASUS motherboards, go to Advanced -&gt; NB Configuration and select the 2G option in the UMA Frame Buffer Size menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/_g/ba/an_gba2wm5p_b8s06lh63ob0fxi.png"><br><br>  Testing was conducted in a large number of games.  In the so-called AAA projects, only minimal graphic quality settings were used.  Testing was conducted only in Full HD resolution.  The built-in graphics of the Ryzen 5 2400G (and the GeForce GT 1030 too) will not have a higher resolution; a lower resolution in 2018 is not interesting from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù. <br><br>  However, we suggest starting with studying the dependence of the iGPU speed on the RAM used in the stand.  In our opinion, the results were more than illustrative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_f/ls/oi/_flsoixbuswlwvqf32eskkrb3ia.png"><br><br>  For this experiment, 3DMark Fire Strile benchmark and the cult World of Tanks using the latest 1.0 engine (Full HD, medium graphics settings, without anti-aliasing) were used. <br><br>  We repeat, but not just because AMD recommends using DDR4-2933 or higher RAM together with the Ryzen 5 2400G.  If you compare the results obtained on the stand with DDR4-2133 and DDR4-3200 memory, then a faster solution is immediately ahead by 24% in 3DMark Fire Strike and by 25% in World of Tanks.  Becoming a quarter faster is great. <br><br>  Obviously, in 2018, we are seeing a real dawn of RAM.  It will be even faster! <br><br>  Information is optional: pay attention to the test results of the Ryzen 5 2400G in the benchmark CPU test.  As you can see, there is a slight increase in the number of "parrots" with an increase in the effective memory frequency.  What does this mean?  As you know, the frequency of operation of the built-in north bridge Infinity Fabric is rigidly tied to the frequency of the RAM.  For better synchronization in Ryzen, it always runs at a frequency half the effective memory frequency.  It turns out, if the computer uses a set of RAM DDR4-2133, then Infinity Fabric operates at a frequency of 1066 MHz.  The north bridge is one of the most important components of the Ryzen processor, since it is he who is responsible for the interaction of the CCX.  The lower the frequency of Infinity Fabric, the worse the internuclear interaction in the crystal.  In Raven Ridge, as we have already found out, only one CCX is used, so the performance of the Ryzen 5 2400G in computing tasks is less dependent on the frequency of Infinity Fabric. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/d7/0q/yrd70qya0dijawb9kg02s_rd7gw.png"><br><br>  But for the integrated graphics, the frequency of the RAM is very important.  To compare the Radeon Vega 11 with the GeForce GT 1030, we used the same HyperX Predator HX436C17PB3K2 / 16 package, however, we reduced its frequency to 3200 MHz and timings to 16-15-15-36.  So, in our opinion, it will be clearer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/cm/ib/ebcmib_qxh6gkdtl3k3mbmgagg0.png"><br><br>  We immediately recognize that there is no need to wait for a miracle.  However, for the first time, the integrated graphics are chosen so close to a full-fledged discrete video card.  In fact, between Ryzen 5 2400G, coupled with DDR4-3200 memory and GeForce GT 1030, you can safely put an equal sign, although formally the NVIDIA device is often ahead. <br><br>  AAA projects, even at the minimum quality settings of the graphics, turn out to be a serious task for the Radeon Vega 11. For example, out of ten games, the conditionally playable frame rate with drawdowns of at least 25 FPS is demonstrated by only five programs.  We will be optimistic - it turns out that our glass is half full.  And yet it is a shame that in some games with a good average FPS, however, there are noticeable drop in the frame rate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/53/to/fr53toucpzcck3yfsuqbyhtpun4.png"><br><br>  At the same time, there are games that Ryzen 5 2400G copes with, like a squirrel with hazelnuts.  This is mainly about popular multiplayer projects, such as WoT, Dota 2, as well as undemanding games, in which graphics are not the main thing.  The proof of our words is shown in the graph above. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  The conclusion is very simple: together with the Raven Ridge processors it is very important to use high-frequency RAM, especially if you do not plan to use a discrete graphics card in the system.  This option is suitable for those who initially plan to play undemanding games such as Dota 2, WoT, etc.  This option is also suitable for those who are planning to assemble a new system unit, but do not intend to spend money on an expensive video card.  In both cases, high-frequency memory will be an excellent companion to AMD processors. <br><br>  ___________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  We remind you that for all fans of the products of Kingston and HyperX in our blog, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/298637/">a competition is held</a> before March 28, in which there are: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFuryDDR4">HyperX Fury DDR4 Memory Kit</a> (HX426C16FWK2 / 32) </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireCT">HyperX Pulsefire FPS Mouse</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFurySCT">Rug HyperX Fury S Pro XL</a> </li><li>  HyperX hoodies - 2 pieces. </li><li>  HyperX T-shirts - 5 pcs. </li></ul><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">the company's</a> official <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371369/</a></p>
