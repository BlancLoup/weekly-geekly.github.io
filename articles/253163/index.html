The rise in price of components and service has put many companies, especially Russian integrators, in difficult conditions.  But at the same time, there is no panic on the market: new sites and new sites are being commissioned, new data centers are being commissioned ... Just "we have to work, and everything will be fine," says Olga Ponomareva, CEO of Garant -Park-Internet "and the winner of the DCLady contest. <br><br>  The main thing that business leaders are trying to save today is the cadre of professional specialists.  In an interview with ‚ÄúTime for New Opportunities,‚Äù Anton Platonov, CEO of StoreData, stresses that no one is laid off at his company, the pay is not reduced, and even a bonus fund was laid out for the year.  And such a tactic is not an exception, but rather a rule in the Russian data center industry. <br><br>  The topic of the current issue of TsODY.RF magazine is devoted to preserving calm and stability.  We are talking about testing the engineering infrastructure of data centers - one of the most important stages in creating a high-quality site, which can be compared in importance with tests in the space or aviation industry.  A series of articles reveals this topic from different angles - from factory testing laboratories to the ‚Äúrehearsal of the orchestra‚Äù at the facility itself.  At the same time, the theory is supported by practical recommendations based on the extensive experience of authors' participation in such events. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In the current issue there are new headings.  We maintain a close relationship with the market and pay attention to the fact that the industry often faces conflicts in the legislative field.  This is not surprising, because the data center market is in the process of becoming, and the formation of a legislative framework in such a situation is traditionally late.  We open a new column ‚ÄúLegal consultation‚Äù with a question of the reader.  Commented on Anna Danilochkina, vice president of legal affairs of the group "SUN".  We also invite readers to send their questions to lawyer@mediagrus.ru, which will be commented on in subsequent issues of the journal. <br><br>  Another new rubric - ‚ÄúThe Limits of the Law‚Äù - is devoted to incidents in the field of legislation.  Although in general the high-tech market of data centers behaves in a rather civilized way, other stories happen here.  How legitimate shareholders lost their assets last year is told in an interview with Alexander Panov, the former manager of Hosting Community, which has now been transformed into RU-CENTER. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúEngineering Academy‚Äù heading also appears on our pages for the first time.  In it, we are going to use the language of professionals to talk about new sophisticated breakthrough technologies for building the engineering infrastructure of data centers.  The article is opened by the article by Sergey Abramov, Corr.  RAS, Director of the Institute of Software Systems.  A. K. Aylamazyan of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Alexander Chichkovsky, General Director of STORUS Group of Companies.  It is devoted to immersion cooling technology on the example of the IMMERS 880 family of supercomputers. It is gratifying that domestic developments in this field are on the forefront of world science. <br><br>  And in this issue there are a lot of interesting materials about traveling around the world of data centers.  But let our readers themselves know better about this. <br><br>  The contents of the issue and subscribe to the newsletter can be found on the website of <a href="http://dcjournal.ru/">TsODY.RF</a> magazine </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253163/</a></p>
