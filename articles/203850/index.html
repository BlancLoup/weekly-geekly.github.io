I was attracted by the topic of Cybernetics, bang, and we get lists of articles with 54 pages.  Impressive!  Read. <br><br>  All articles are presented in PDF format, accompanied by annotations, tags, various metadata, for which you are immediately offered similar articles in this category.  Of course, the spirit of the times dictated the need for the option to share the link to the article with friends on social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c7/823/74d/9c782374df7e2a3a4f3c0376db6eba10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Alas, the server power of the project is still lacking, for example, the page with a list of magazines I downloaded unforgivable in the modern networked world 5 seconds, although this mistake is immediately forgiven at the sight of the abundance of magazines dazzling the list with its covers and the number of loaded articles. <br><br>  The layout of all pages is nicely supplemented with RDF-metadata, which undoubtedly contributes to the future development of the project. <br><br>  After a simple registration, we get the opportunity to share comments on the articles, however, we were not lucky enough to stumble upon a single comment. <br><br>  Summarizing, we can say that any shortcomings of the resource pale before the volume of filling the base (and this despite the fact that it is absolutely free), so I confidently attribute this project to the category of must-have in your favorites list. <br><br><h4>  Home Pharmacist </h4><br>  <a href="http://xn--80aaaigjsiyehj6a6ax0bza.xn--p1ai/">http: //mashynfarkit.rf/</a> <br><br><blockquote>  The application "Home Pharmacist" will help you find information about cheap substitutes for known drugs, so-called.  generics.  Allows you to find a medicine by name and become familiar with possible substitutes, annotation, see the possible form factors of a medicine (tablet, gel, granules ...). <br><br>  Features: <br>  - A current, constantly updated database, <br>  - Sort substitutes by price, <br>  - The ability to go to the online purchase of the drug, <br>  - Ability to find and sign up to the doctor directly from the application. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that "Home pharmacist" is available exclusively as a mobile application (applications for iOS and Android are currently available, the official site is silent about plans for other systems). <br><br>  Having opened the application, we immediately see the field for entering the drug of interest to us, having entered, we get its characteristics: ATX, active substance, pharmacological action, etc., but this is not interesting, and the Internet is full of it.  And now we are moving to the main function of the application - the search for ‚Äúsubstitutes‚Äù for the drug, the so-called ‚Äúgenerics‚Äù (from the description of the authors: ‚ÄúGeneric is a drug sold under the international non-proprietary name or under the brand name, which differs from the brand name of the drug developer. As a rule generics do not differ in their effectiveness from ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù drugs, but they are much cheaper ‚Äù).  What is important, the application immediately shows us the range of the cost of each of the "generics" and offers immediately to buy either the desired drug, or one of the "substitutes".  And we can leave our feedback on this or that drug, and live reviews are already available in the database - it was very interesting to read them! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/d2f/0cf/a6ad2f0cf9833f33c658ca0d7a1ec92b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The shopping cart is going straight to the application, but I didn‚Äôt manage to place an order personally - the application read the lengthy wording ‚ÄúError in placing the order‚Äù to me, and I, distressed, went on to further study the application <br><br>  In the main section, we are offered "Special offers", dazzling with promotional offers from various clinics.  Well, you have to earn at least something! <br><br>  The next item is the function "Search for doctors."  Wow!  The application offers us to decide whether we will select a doctor due to illness or simply leave a request to the specialist we are interested in (and we can ask the doctor to come to our home).  Let's look for a doctor for the diagnosis of flatfoot in the metro Tulskaya in Moscow: the application offered us three doctors with photos, ratings, experience and cost of admission to them.  Great, we can immediately make an appointment with them.  And all this in one application! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/858/14a/f9b/85814af9bd65b1a30d69edf0bc17793c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the settings of the application there is just a great function of downloading the database to your phone in order to be able to access it offline!  Thank you, developers, for your care!  True, this base is only for drugs, you still need internet to search for doctors! <br><br>  We hope this application will be a big step in combating the greed of pharmaceutical companies and the struggle of doctors for rating and, as a result, improving the quality of services, and for the end users - the saved ruble in your pocket and treatment at the best doctors not far from home! <br><br><h4>  Where in Moscow live well? </h4><br>  <a href="http://where2live.ru/">http://where2live.ru/</a> <br><br>  Description from the authors: <br>  Based on open data, we want to say in which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow you will live in the most comfortable way. <br>  We have collected in one database information about the infrastructure of the city, analyzing which you can conclude about which of the areas of the city will be the most convenient for you.  To do this, we tried to make the most simple and friendly interface of our service.  Enjoy your study! <br><br>  Yes, having studied the service, it becomes clear - it really is as simple as possible.  Choose from the list of possible infrastructure facilities necessary for you, move the slider on the saturation of these objects (for example, you need a lot of objects to choose from) and ... everything!  We found the place in which district of Moscow is good to live. <br><br>  However, when you study the service more detailed questions arise a lot more. <br>  First, the Kurkino district leads in 70% of requests.  When I read about it in more detail, everything became clear (quoted from Wikipedia: Residential buildings of different heights - from cottages and townhouses to 23-storey apartment buildings, built on individual projects.) <br>  Conclusions are not difficult, you need to add a tick "cost of housing" for 99% of the audience is more important than the presence of fountains. <br><br>  Further more.  I fix the results, where Kurkino clearly loses.  Namely, the following case: <br><br><ol><li>  I need night schools for myself. </li><li>  I need universities for older children. </li><li>  And I need elementary schools for a younger son. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a62/ac9/c36/a62ac9c36415742b0b6d29b5ecbe4ad0.png" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  100 Yakimanka </li><li>  68 Silino </li><li>  65 Rostokino </li><li>  59 Nizhny Novgorod </li><li>  51 Cheryomushki </li><li>  50 Krasnoselsky </li><li>  50 Donskoy </li></ul><br><br>  In this case, the same Kurkino is no longer in sight.  Now I add a couple of pharmacies to the search parameters next to each other (well, there are different situations).  Move the slider literally 1 mm. <br>  And what I see - Kurkino goes to a clean first place.  100%! <br><ul><li>  100 Kurkino </li><li>  14 Kosino-Ukhtomsky </li><li>  13 Yakimanka </li><li>  11 Troparyovo-Nikulino </li><li>  9 Meshchansky </li><li>  9 Zamoskvorechye </li><li>  9 Krasnoselsky </li></ul><br><br>  Very strange case.  Is there no pharmacies in Cheryomushki?  Not.  That is - there is, but they are not at all in the sample.  Conclusion: the service does not have enough data, so it is unlikely to get a reliable estimate. <br><br>  In general, the idea is good if it is developed.  Add new parameters, fill with data, can develop and functionality.  The idea to bind to such things as congestion (how to get to work), population density, and I have already said about the cost of housing, comes to mind. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br><br>  Having studied a number of services based on Open Data and using the ideology of openness, I wanted to continue to dig in this direction, so I‚Äôm waiting for feedback from habravchan whether to review such services and more? <br><br>  The disclosure of data for such services is handled by the State (Government institutions at various levels).  It is known that for them this is now a mandatory requirement, there are even recommendations according to which everyone should publish Open Data.  All information is maintained in the respective communities: <br>  - The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/opendatarekomend">official community of the Ministry</a> ; <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/opendata/">thematic Habra Hub</a> - there you can also find a lot of information on the subject. <br><br>  From the first, I learned that the Ministry of Economic Development is collecting feedback from application developers, the so-called demand assessment.  The following is reported: <br><blockquote>  Business activity in this direction will be determined by the availability of popular open data sets, their quality, relevance, reliability, as well as the degree of compliance with current trends and the needs of society, data sets are more important than their number.  This requires feedback so that government agencies understand what and what information is expected of them. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Profile </h4><br>  We are invited to fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1P3lvvbV-Nlm6XyRvn7Dq5f19cVShq124GRhVXP7TA9s/viewform">questionnaire</a> to assess the relevance of Open Data.  I believe that everyone who is interested in the development of Open Data in Russia should not be too lazy and spend a few minutes filling it out. <br><br>  In my opinion, the premise is correct, if the state really listens to the opinion of the public and opens its data for us, on the basis of which it will be possible to develop more and more new services for my review!  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203850/</a></p>
