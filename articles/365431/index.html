Step forward or harm to the system?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/306/7e8/b0b/3067e8b0b5bf8e49483003171965e6d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's start with the simplest: why is all this necessary?  It would seem, why all these high technologies?  After all, we all studied in ordinary schools, without all these bells and whistles and everything was fine, and seemed to have grown stupid people, and we can distinguish Guadeloupe from the Himalayas.  And how many pleasant memories!  Here and a bun for five kopecks, and broken knees, and the first kiss, and tearing out the pages from the diary, and playing cams at recess.  Why change something?  This is practically paradise, only with a backpack and pereobuvki.  A little reflection on this is under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is all so, I myself remember school days as something happy and serene.  However, for the most part it is related to the social component, and not to the educational one.  Few people remember their school years with the words: ‚Äú <i>I remember how at school we worked logarithmic equations all day long</i> .‚Äù  Approximately the same romanticism in us evoke thoughts about, for example, the Middle Ages with its noble knights and beautiful ladies.  But one of us would hardly have agreed to send his child there - to the place where people poured out the slop onto the street, and killing a person was quite ordinary.  The world does not stand still, but is constantly evolving: what was normal 30‚Äì40 years ago, now, in most cases, is unacceptable. <br><br>  Similarly in education.  ‚Äú <i>Our education system was recognized as the best in the world!</i>  - shouts someone's dad in a brown sweater from the last desk.  So it was, however, 30 years ago.  And it‚Äôs naive to think that if you have an excellent education system, then you just need to change nothing in it and it will remain the best.  This is the same as going hunting with a bow and arrow and boasting that until the 15th century it was the best ranged weapon at the time when your friend was taking a rifle with a telescopic sight.

      Over the past 10-15 years, technology in the field of education has not just taken a step forward - they fled, took a pole and began to conquer all possible heights, like Sergei Bubka.  Electronic textbooks and diaries, online learning, augmented reality, interactive whiteboards and much more - this is not a complete list of what modern schoolchildren are dealing with.  Unfortunately, our schools (and schoolchildren with them) are just beginning to discover the world of new technologies.  This is primarily due to conservatism, and this applies not only to education, but also to most areas of our life.  For example, I tried unsuccessfully at my first job to explain to the 60-year-old boss: to transfer the letter to the accounting department, you don‚Äôt have to go to the next building of 500 meters, but you can simply send it by e-mail.  The same conservatism is often observed among teachers and, more sadly, among parents. <br><br>  Let's take in order exactly what technological solutions can help a child in learning and make life easier for the parent. <br><br>  The main technology, to which in the future will be tied to the rest is the electronic student card.  This is a kind of "passport" in which all the data about the child is entered.  He is also an electronic pass, he is a payment card. <br><br>  The first with which the electronic student card is integrated is the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/enter_parents">system of turnstiles</a> , which are installed at the entrance to the school. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2f/e4f/26a/e2fe4f26a6a41dae57a11b03ef1d92b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When a child comes to school and leaves it, he holds a card on the reader, data about this is entered into the system, and an SMS is sent to the parent on the phone.  In this way, the parent always ensures that the child does not skip lessons.  ‚Äú <i>Concentration camp!</i>  "- I would have cried for twelve, but fortunately, then and now the last word always remains for adults, but not the school would turn into Disneyland with popcorn and candy.  Walking lessons is the main cause of student failure.  Moreover, skipping lessons, the released time, the children use far not to dance classes or embroidery with beads.  Knowing that, having left school earlier, when he comes home, he will get a strong belt (moral of course, because I am categorically against physical measures of influence), the child will think three times and eventually answer his careless friend: ‚ÄúI will stay in class after all ".  And over time, it will simply become a habit and discipline your child. <br><br>  Next with what the card is integrated - <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/pitanie_parents">a cashless payment system</a> in the school canteen or buffet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b3/12f/ab7/1b312fab7eb910285be54ad46fd715c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We all remember what it is school canteen.  The endless running around, crush, children's cries, the smell of borscht and muffins and tea from a huge pot with the inscription "tea."  And, of course, money.  Money for lunch at school is essentially the first money a child receives for uncontrolled use.  No, you certainly give the child money when you send him bread, but you know exactly how much bread costs, and you give him exactly the same amount of money, and he, in turn, brings home bread, because he knows: if he doesn't, that will be punished.  At school, this process is almost not controlled.  I remember how many times I donated a school lunch in order to buy a bottle of Pepsi Cola from the store after school.  Probably, it was then that the fundamentals of my current gastritis were born.  The system of cashless payment through the student card, provides for the complete exclusion from the use of cash in schools.  All products in school canteens are paid for by children using electronic cards.  You can deposit money on the card yourself or through the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù on the Internet, or through the top-up terminals.  By transferring money to the card, you exclude the possibility that the child will spend it on bullshit.  This card will not be accepted for payment either by Aunt Sveta at the nearest stall or by the administrator Anton at the computer club.  Moreover, even purchases of a child in the school canteen can be inspected by you through the same ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù or SMS alert.  There is a difference, he bought the first, second and compote, or took 16 cherry muffins. <br><br>  Plus, this system significantly reduces the problem of queues in canteens.  Usually in school canteens one person takes orders and issues goods, which leads to the formation of queues.  As a result, children who are at the end of the queue may not be able to make an order, get food and take their lunch for a limited time of change.  When introducing a system, an order is formed using a touchscreen monitor.  Employees who are directly at the checkout, you only need to give the child his order.  Thus, the rate at which the student gets food is almost doubled. <br><br>  Well, perhaps the main bonus of such systems is the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_parents">Electronic Journal, also known as the diary</a> .  Like two in one, but in fact very much in one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e51/1c4/2d5/e511c42d59fde78f451366722d909932.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will tell you about the system through the things that I, like most of you, did at school, but would not want my child to do the same.  For example, the legendary tearing of pages with a bad score from the diary or correcting it with a blade and a red pen.  When using the module, all marks set by the teacher are immediately entered into the school‚Äôs electronic database and become available online through your personal account.  But that's not all: after a child receives an assessment, you will receive SMS with text on your phone, for example, ‚ÄúGeometry - 3‚Äù, so that the belt (again, moral) can be prepared already in advance. <br><br>  Following: <br>  - ‚ÄúGo do your homework!‚Äù <br>  - "And we did not ask anything." <br>  Not many have enough spirit, and most importantly, desires, pick up the phone to call the teacher and check this information.  With the help of "Electronic diary" all homework will be available online. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúSon, get up, you'll be late for school!‚Äù <br>  - ‚ÄúOur teacher got sick.  Physics canceled.  To the second lesson ‚Äù(underline). <br>  The timetable is updated online.  And if the teacher is really sick, you will immediately see this and let your child sleep for another hour. <br><br>  Also, such cards can be used as a library card in school libraries or as a child‚Äôs medical card in a school medical room. <br><br>  These bonuses can bring new technologies to schools to help us and our children.  And this is only a small part of them.  After all, there are still technologies of augmented reality, 3D printing and much more.  Perhaps about them in the next post.  Your opinions will be glad to hear in the comments.  Love your children. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365431/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365431/</a></p>
