      Looking back, when I first started designing, I see only one thing that I would like to convey to my past: train design thinking, the ability to criticize and identify good design. <br><br>  Good design thinking often exceeds the practical abilities of the designer, and this is not necessarily bad.  In fact, this means that your eye can help you distinguish design improvements over time.  By developing a sense of taste and the ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a design, you will eventually achieve a high level in your practical work. <br><br>  That's just the question is, how to develop this very design thinking? <br><br>  Simple strategy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Choose a design for inspiration </h3><br>  Create a folder and save there all the layouts that can inspire you every week.  By the end of the week, look at the entire list and ask yourself a few questions.  You do not need to respond to each of them for all the work, but do not answer those not answered in memory. <br><br><ul><li>  What exactly intrigued you in the design?  Are you still impressed like a week ago? </li><li>  What is the purpose of the design?  How did she influence the design? </li><li>  What makes you feel design? </li><li>  How does the font in the design? </li><li>  What could you change in it? </li></ul><br>  For interface design and look at sites like <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribble</a> , <a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a> , <a href="http://www.cssdesignawards.com/">Cssdesignawards</a> , <a href="https://thefwa.com/">FWA</a> and <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards</a> .  I use these sites to see how other designers solve specific problems and keep abreast of popular patterns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/408/050/ee440805020f24124657f0aca4156f6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, following only the design of the interfaces, you find yourself in a limited information space.  You should also look at other products, such as posters, magazines and books.  Often, the best examples of typography and modal grids can be found beyond your professional activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e3/64d/d2c/0e364dd2c4c9edf7c2d6176ffac117b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also take into account the cultural context, and how it affects the design.  This will make you more versatile, allowing you to look at work from other perspectives, in the process of critical design judgment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a15/2b8/a4a/a152b8a4a79277f8976a9f58071e7c69.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  2. A practical look </h3><br>  While there are masses of exercises that can be performed while training design thinking, just take a few extra minutes a day looking and trying to understand the world around you. <br><br>  During the day, instead of hanging up on the phone ‚Äî which I also sin on ‚Äî look at surrounding things, such as buildings, direction signs, nature.  Using the world around you as a tool for developing design thinking, there are a few things to remember. <br><br><ul><li>  Find out what catches your eye.  Design is something that is always in the first impression. </li><li>  What kind of visual hierarchy do you see around you? </li><li>  How do you interact with the design around you? </li><li>  What colors do you see around you, and how do they fit together? <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/1fa/026/2e41fa0262e5262b7efd8b237fab1475.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One thing that I found useful for developing design thinking is photography.  Photography makes you look, activates the meaning of the world.  A good photo contains the same elements that are the basis of a good design.  In particular, it requires a deliberate composition, which includes the creation of visual balance, the use of space and color solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/fe0/96b/d1ffe096bbf5cbed4ee06d66c449805b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  3. Get feedback </h3><br>  Create a chain of reviews to accelerate your growth.  As often as you can, ask other designers to evaluate your work.  Experienced designers, in particular, are able to point out shortcomings in the work that you are missing.  Once they are seen, it is much easier to prevent them in the future. <br><br>  (Here I will add some comments of the author, not contained in the article) <br><br>  There are many clever blogs and communities where people can give you useful comments.  Here are some of them: <a href="https://www.designernews.co/">Designer News</a> , <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/">web_design</a> , <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques">design_critiques</a> . <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  If you want to improve your design, change your thinking first.  Anyone can develop it, and there are many ways to do it, let me know in the comments, if you have any. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.
