  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three rules for data protection in Evernote</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Evernote has grown remarkably fast in recent months.  It seems that we are getting closer and closer to our goal - to become a permanent, reliable and versatile place to store all the memories in the world.  Each of these words is very important for us, so it seems to me that now is a good time to clearly formulate the basic principles that guide us in working with your data. <br><br>  Everything we do in Evernote is subject to the three basic rules: <br><ol><li>  Your data <em>belong</em> only to you </li><li>  Your data is <em>private</em> </li><li>  Your data is <em>portable</em> </li></ol><br>  <strong>1. Your data belong only to you</strong> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We do not claim your data.  Placing notes or other content in Evernote does not change their owner or legal status.  If the data originally belonged to you, they remain yours and after downloading to Evernote. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      By placing information in Evernote, you give us permission to perform with them certain actions for which you use our service.  For example, you give us permission to back them up, send them over the network, index them for searching, show them on your phone, etc. Some of these operations may require us to transfer your data to our partners, such as a telecom operator, so that we can could carry out the work of the service. <br><br>  <strong>2. Your data is private</strong> <br><br>  All information you post to Evernote is confidential by default.  We never read it, do not analyze it, do not share it, do not use it for advertising targeting, research, etc., unless you specifically ask us to carry out one of these actions.  Our business model does not depend on the "monetization" of your data in any way.  Rather, it depends on the growth of confidence in our service and its development, so that more and more people agree to pay for our services. <br><br>  Evernote has features that allow you to post some notes and share them with others, but this is an extremely customizable and optional option.  To use it or not is up to you.  If you decide to link your Evernote account with one of our many partners' applications, then you may need to share your data with the partner.  We will explicitly notify you of what access rights to your account your partner‚Äôs application receives, and you will be able to terminate this access at any time. <br><br>  In addition, we take numerous precautions to protect your data from accidental loss or theft.  Everything that you put into Evernote is synchronized and stored in our secure data center with many backup servers, storage devices and off-site backup systems.  The data transferred between Evernote clients and our servers is encrypted using industry standard SSL.  We do not store your password on our servers, and no one in Evernote will ever ask you for it. <br><br>  <strong>3. Your data is portable</strong> <br><br>  Evernote does not block hosted data.  We give you the opportunity at any time to retrieve data from Evernote as easily and conveniently as you can put it there.  Our Windows and Mac clients allow you to export all your notes and content in human-readable HTML format, as well as in a fully documented machine-readable XML format.  We also have a fully open API that gives you access to all your data.  Our approach is based on the statement that if you are confident that you can leave Evernote, then you will be comfortable to stay. <br><br>  For more information, you can read the English blog <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2008/04/15/evernote-privacy-and-security/">post by</a> our technical director, Dave Engberg, on privacy and security issues in Evernote, as well as our <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/intl/ru/tos/">terms of service</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116182/</a></p>
