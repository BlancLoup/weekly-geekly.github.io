  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get frustrated and NOT go Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The recent embarrassment of Jim Zemlin (Jim Zemlin) at the Open Source Summit with a presentation running on Mac OS does not negate the fact that there are major successes in the desktop direction recently.  I have already told you about some: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/317548/">WiFi acceleration</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336630/">Seamless graphics</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/337102/">New best I / O scheduler</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cb/86/59cb86f92b9bf651629683.png" alt="And by the way ..."><br><br></p><br><p>  However, not everything is still smooth and while there are quite a few who tried to switch to Linux and then, disappointed, returned to the previous OS, most often - Windows.  Previously, there were quite a few reasons for this, but it is already clear that there will be fewer and fewer of them.  If you want to try switching to Linux and get disappointed, do it today, as it may be too late tomorrow.  So, my recipes, for those who want to learn how to <strong>fail the opportunity to</strong> make friends with penguins and <em>leave with nothing</em> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="podstavit-plecho-ili-dat-podnozhku">  Substitute shoulder or footboard? </h2><br><p>  The mantra that will most quickly lead you to <del>  crash </del>  The goal is: <strong>NEVLNR</strong> (nor %%% this is your Linux does not work).  Here the pronoun ‚Äúyour‚Äù is the most important, it is it that sets the desired distance and point of view.  The user who issues this comment subconsciously has the following picture before his eyes. </p><br><ul><li>  If a program with open source does not work as it should, this is a concern of developers and maintainers.  They are required to find all the bugs and fix them. </li><li>  The user of the open source program is not obliged to anyone, he has already spent a lot of time.  It was not enough yet that he himself would repair his software and spoil his eyes, picking at text files and service launch scripts. </li><li>  In the end, what's the difference, open source or paid?  The main thing to work - <em>you checkered or go</em> ? </li></ul><br><p>  Of course, this is not at all the case, and this is the success of open source software.  Along with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/329042/">freedom to</a> use the program, to study and change it for the benefit, there is a certain body of burdensome duties that are not very burdensome, the essence of which is <u>to make a powerful contribution</u> to the common fund.  Who can program, he sends patches, another opens a request for correction of a defect, sends the necessary data, reproduces the error several times and serves as experimental intermediate fixes. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/40b/a97/55e/40ba9755e4c1475c80d72affe7bfab2f.png" alt="Mozilla contribution"><br><p><br></p><br><p>  In addition, you can still do a lot of things to help an open source project: create a knowledge base, localize, answer questions from newbies.  There would be a desire, but there will always be a reason. </p><br><h3 id="use-case-ne-smog-otkryt-fleshku">  Use case: could not open flash drive </h3><br><p>  <a href="http://liberatum.ru/e/windows-10-to-ubuntu">User comment</a> is slightly refined. </p><br><blockquote>  I tried this for your ubuntu.  She couldn't even open the flash drive properly.  And it opened, then no.  Demolished 10 minutes to hell. </blockquote><p>  Most likely <em>dark</em> failed to attach the drive, perhaps not enough rights.  You can mount a USB flash drive using a graphical interface in KDE, Gnome and all more or less full DE.  It is also possible from the command line; this can be found in a search in 5 minutes.  However, if it really was a driver error, you could still find a different solution. </p><br><h2 id="osteregaytes-komandnoy-stroki">  Beware of the command line </h2><br><p> This is the right path to the goal, that is, to failure.  Not once, not twice, have I seen colleagues who go into Applications to find package management instead of learning <code>apt-get / aptitude</code> and managing repositories.  This ended pretty quickly with demolition, OS swapping, since the downloads and updates did not work - for this you need to set up internal ftp servers to bypass the firewall, the GUI often does not have these settings. </p><br><h3 id="use-case-pomenyat-ustroystvo-marshruta-po-umolchaniyu">  Use case: change default route device </h3><br><p>  In one familiar office, an unexpected event somehow happened - the wired network disconnected and it was necessary to change the routing using a wireless network that was still normal.  What started here ... </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d58/ba3/6bd/d58ba36bd7cd41689d0283aa2275de5f.png"><br><p>  It was necessary only to remove the wired connection, change the settings of the wireless network that was not used for a long time, and connect to the wireless network.  This task turned out to be beyond anyone‚Äôs power, due to the fact that they were held hostage to the erratic graphical interface of the Windows network settings.  And against Windows <del>  were playing </del>  IT specialists who are able to solve technical problems, including network ones, fought. </p><br><p>  Fumbling, I realized that Windows does not have a full-fledged end-to-end point for network connection settings.  In particular, it is not possible to change the settings of the wireless network by using standard tools after it is explored and the connection is established.  On its own Gentoo Linux, it all started up after <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315960/">three</a> <code>NetworkManager</code> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315960/">commands</a> . </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs sql">(5:31)$ nmcli <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">delete</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">id</span></span> &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">connection</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">name</span></span>&gt; (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">32</span></span>)$ nmcli <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">connection</span></span> edit &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">connection</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">name</span></span>&gt; (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">33</span></span>)$ nmcli <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">connection</span></span> up <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">id</span></span> &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">connection</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">name</span></span>&gt;</code> </pre> <br><p>  But you can of course from the graphical interface, it allows you to fully manage network connections. </p><br><h2 id="_rtfm">  ! _rtfm </h2><br><p>  Do not delve into it, do not learn materiel, keep the natural color of eyes and silky hair.  <code>  KDE</code> , <code>gedit</code> and the <code>  Ubuntu</code> all ours!  Who really thinks so, very soon will face force majeure and will return to Windows, or Mac OS, repeating the mantra: NEVLNR. </p><br><p>  Do not delve into the init scripts, xml files, do not even open <code>grub.conf</code> , and especially <code>xorg.conf</code> .  Otherwise, you will not be disappointed, because you will understand that almost <strong>all the</strong> problems you encounter <u>have a reasonable solution in an acceptable period</u> , provided that you get into the details and comprehend the principles. </p><br><p>  And yet, if you know how to use the search on the Internet, then you do not need documentation. </p><br><ul><li>  <code>man word</code> , <code>man -K word</code> </li><li>  <code>info word</code> # this is really a file </li><li> <code>apropos word</code> </li> <li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/332502/">log files</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.tldp.org/">Howto</a> </li><li> <code>/usr/src/linux/ , </code> </li> <li>  User guides <code>/usr/share/your_app/docs/</code> </li></ul><br><p>  Is the laptop warming up?  Do not delay, demolish Linux.  GRUB not up to UEFI?  Habr <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/308032/">do not read</a> , OS delete. </p><br><h2 id="vam-shashki-ili-ehat">  Do you checkers or go? </h2><br><p>  For me, checkers matter, if we mean open source software, their <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/">social significance</a> . </p><br><p>  If it is more important to move, no matter on what, then there really is no point in staying on the OS, which does not have the usual programs: 1C, <del>  Civilization </del>  , AutoCAD, <del>  SQL Server </del>  , Unreal Tournament.  But what will you do when the next announcement of the year of accomplishments for Linux at the workstation, Linus Torvalds or Jim Zemlin, finally comes true? </p></div>
