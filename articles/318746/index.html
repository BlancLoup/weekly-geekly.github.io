We participate in the state program for the internetization of small settlements, we establish base stations in the tundra, mountains and even mines. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/318746/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ec/8e9/257/4ec8e925721b4d6a8e3001cd76082a1e.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The other day we announced the installation of a base station in the village of Polovinka, Chebarkulsky District, Chelyabinsk Region, where only 351 people live.  Prior to this, there was a very weak signal of voice mobile communication in this area, sometimes people could not even get through to doctors and rescuers.  What to say about the mobile Internet, it was not at all.  The main problem for the passage of the signal and the installation of base stations was primarily complex terrain and dense forest.  Now, local residents have access to 3G Internet and speeds up to 10 Mbit / s.  The residents of the neighboring village of Kryzhanovka will also feel improvements in communication. <br><br>  This was made possible thanks to the participation of Megafon in the state program for the internetization of small settlements of 250 to 500 people, as well as with the support of the government of the Chelyabinsk region.  Fiber-optic data transmission channel to the base station was provided by Rostelecom, which is also a participant in the program.

    <blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúResidents of the Half received a great gift for the New Year.</i>  <i>Now, on a festive night, fast Internet from MegaFon will make them truly next to their loved ones and friends, no matter how far from them they are.</i>  <i>Improving communication, improving the quality of life of ordinary people - this is in our understanding of a responsible approach to business "</i> , <br>  - noted the director of the Chelyabinsk branch of the company "Megaphone" Igor Ostatyuk. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/026/7dd/0c6/0267dd0c6f1806003151b72ad5b96dbf.jpg"><br><br>  Behind the Arctic Circle on the Kola Peninsula is one of the most unusual base stations of MegaFon.  It is located in the tundra and covers the area where the roads of three directions converge: Murmansk - Teriberka - Misty.  There are no settlements in this area, but communication is needed.  In the tundra are not uncommon cases of complete road covering up in winter.  Stuck in snow drifts and left without the ability to reach the rescue service, a person can easily die.  Therefore, it was decided to install a second generation base station in the area with the planned installation of 3G equipment on it.  The coverage of such a station is about 30 km. <br><br>  When installing the base station, we had a problem.  A power line passes very close by, but for connection it would be necessary to build a step-down substation.  Line voltage is more than 100 thousand volts.  The construction of the substation is an expensive and technologically complex project.  But here came the natural conditions of the Kola Peninsula with its eternal winds.  To power the station, it was decided to use a wind generator. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af9/092/71f/af909271f9063e4e2128e930a84b86b7.jpg"></div><br>  The turbine uses a 5 kW turbine.  To generate enough energy for the base station to work, wind speeds from 10 meters per second are enough.  In this area it is absolutely normal weather.  If a calm happens, the station is additionally equipped with a diesel generator that starts automatically.  Megaphone specialists monitor all technological processes both inside the station and the wind generator, and outside, remotely.  In total in the Murmansk region four MegaFon base stations use wind generators for their work. <br><br>  On the coast of the Barents Sea, mobile access speeds reach an average of 10-12 Mbit / s.  This is enough for comfortable work and the use of most Internet services. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe subject of special pride of MegaFon is communication facilities located everywhere along the coast of the Barents Sea.</i>  <i>Our services are used by the Northern Fleet of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>We provide not only communication in the conventional sense, but also secure communication channels.</i>  <i>The wide coverage area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMegaFon, especially in coastal areas, is already appreciated by the army, fishermen and all those associated with the sea ",</i> <br>  - Director of the Murmansk branch of MegaFon, Vladimir Chuiko. <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac3/52f/04e/ac352f04ee7daeacda6d2e4fbbccf5c7.jpg"><br><br>  There, on the Kola Peninsula, are located Khibiny - the oldest mountain range.  Khibiny are known for their flora, most of which is listed in the Red Books, and for the largest deposits of apatite-nepheline ores and, of course, the mines for their mining.  And also the ‚Äúdeepest‚Äù and ‚Äúhighest‚Äù base stations of MegaFon in the North-West of Russia work here. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúDeep‚Äù station is located inside the Rasvumchorra mine at a depth of 500 meters.  More precisely, on the papers it is at around 440 meters above sea level, but if you count the depth from the top of the mountain, then it will be just 500 meters.  Total Rasvumchorrsky mine for the needs of JSC "Apatite" located two base stations 2G.  They provide a "signal connection", giving employees the opportunity to communicate with each other and with the dispatcher.  Communication with the surface takes place over a copper cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e5/b4f/6fc/6e5b4f6fc7b0c6ac354d24f8d82793ca.jpg"><br><br>  The highest base station of MegaFon in the North-West is located on the Rasvumchorr plateau seven kilometers south-east of the city of Kirovsk.  It is installed at an altitude of 980 meters above sea level on the order of Apatit JSC.  This location helps to increase coverage and provide reliable connectivity to remote sites of our corporate client. <br><br>  Since the enterprise is located 200 km from the Arctic Circle in a mountainous area, and its work is always complicated by climatic conditions and snowstorms, which often make remote objects of the enterprise difficult to reach, reliable communication is crucial for the normal operation of the facility.  Including vehicle traffic monitoring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/295/3c3/7452953c303a0899fed8692ae9f77097.jpg"><br><br>  In order to be able to quickly deploy temporary mobile communications in the Khibiny mountain areas, MegaFon provided the miners with a ‚Äúmobile base station‚Äù.  With its help, you can provide a full range of mobile services of 2G, 3G, 4G standard anywhere, including in remote areas. <br><br>  The whole complex of the station, including 2G, 3G, 4G equipment, radio relay and satellite communications, is located on the basis of the vehicle and is adapted for autonomous work in the field without connecting to external power sources.  The station is able to work up to 7 days without recharging and provide a signal range of up to 30 km.  Its capacity is enough to serve up to 6 thousand subscribers, and the mobile Internet easily holds speeds of up to 300 Mbps. <br><br>  Each year, MegaFon works to expand and improve its network coverage, investing in infrastructure and development.  We are building mobile stations even in places where three or four people live.  But they also need a connection - this is a requirement of time.  And we give them that connection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318746/</a></p>
