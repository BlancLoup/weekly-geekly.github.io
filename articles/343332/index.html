Now the project is going to collect funding through the model of a closed pre-sale, within which the tokens of the HMT project will be implemented. <br><br>  A token is the cornerstone of any cryptographic project.  Without it, the collection of funds is impossible, but very often it is presented solely as a financial-speculative tool that is released "in free floating" up to the stated cost of the authors of the buy-back project.  Most often, it turns out that after the collection the authors ‚Äúhammer‚Äù on the token and concentrate (if they are lucky) on the creation of the product.  A commitment to the people who supported them somewhere out there.  Far and not soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/eg/yq/gxegyqgc-as8zkukpzmpgcdkl1y.jpeg">

      But it is the course of the token in the period between the end of fees and the start of the buy-back that determines how much the crypto community trusts the authors of the project and believes in its successful completion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Traditionally tokens: <br><br><ul><li>  sold during placement; </li><li>  deducted to founders and consultants; </li><li>  paid as part of a bounty program; </li><li>  freely traded on exchanges. </li></ul><br>  It is the last two models of using a token - as a reward for those who want to make money, as well as a speculative tool - and put the main pressure on any project and on the whole sphere.  It is important to understand: a token is primarily an intermediary between the authors and participants of the fees, however, in order to attract the widest possible audience with time, the token was given new and new functions. <br><br>  All tokens of all projects can be divided into two groups based on their security mechanism: <br><br><ul><li>  Token, which is provided with the growth of the project and its profitability; </li><li>  The token that is embedded in the mechanics of the project. </li></ul><br>  Both types of tokens can be traded on stock exchanges, but at the same time they have completely different stability, volatility and physics of interaction with the financial flows of the cryptographic community.  Unfortunately, a significant part of buyers, regardless of the mechanics of the token, consider it as an exclusively speculative tool of a short position.  The essence is simple: bought cheaper - sold more.  Additional pressure is exerted by participants in bounty programs who seek to transfer their coins to Fiat as quickly as possible, thereby derailing the course of tokens at a low trading volume. <br><br>  The free exchange of information between holders often creates an artificially created panic, which lowers the cost of the token even lower.  Thus, the authors become hostages of their own instrument for attracting funding: after the completion of the bidding, the community‚Äôs attitude towards the project becomes sharply negative, the cost of the token falls, as well as the reputation and credibility of the project itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7z/-2/81/7z-281kb_dy6zsde0qjudttkrmq.gif"><br>  <font color="#808080"><em>When authors ‚Äúhammer‚Äù on their own token</em></font> <br><br>  Since the token is also extremely important after the end of the fees - its cost reflects the project‚Äôs ‚Äúhealth‚Äù and the degree of community trust in the authors - measures to protect its course are important and their adoption in the modern realities of the overheated market is a necessity, not a whim.  In this regard, the Hamster Marketplace token can be called unique, because we have done everything to keep the token at a decent level. <br><br><h3>  So what is unique Hamster Marketplace token </h3><br>  The HMT Token is not only a classic mechanism for raising funds through crowdfunding, but also a unique tool that is tightly integrated into the ecosystem of the future project of the innovative marketplace Hamster Marketplace. <br><br>  The first thing to start with is that the Hamster Marketplace is a non-profit platform, that is, all the proceeds from the establishment of the business will be used to fulfill obligations to the participants of fees under a smart contract, as well as to maintain the token rate. <br><br>  Ensuring the safety of the HMT course begins from the moment when we decided to use it not only as a means of raising funds, but also as part of the mechanics of the platform itself. <br><br>  Yes, the HMT partially falls into the second category of tokens, as it is built into the Hamster Marketplace platform.  However, instead of some contrived function ‚Äúto be‚Äù, the HMT organically integrates into the site structure. <br><br><h4>  The entry fees of vendors are sent to buy and burn tokens </h4><br>  Our goal with respect to the token is to keep its course.  Instead of feeding with promises on the theme ‚Äúthe site will grow, the demand for the token will increase‚Äù, we are ready to send all the contributions received from vendors for the purchase and burning of tokens.  Thus, in addition to increasing the demand for it, we use the reverse approach: we reduce the number of HMT in free circulation. <br><br>  This scheme is devoid of signs of a financial pyramid, when obligations to its earlier members are fulfilled at the expense of those who came into the system later.  In our case, the financial flow is organized from the outside, due to the contributions of vendors, and the tokens they bought are excluded from the project economy through combustion. <br><br>  Payment for a number of vendor site services (advertising, promotion inside the Hamster Marketplace) is possible only for HMT <br><br>  Another mechanism that also leads to token burning.  To pay for services to promote their product, sellers will have to use their tokens (and only them).  They will need to purchase tokens on the exchange.  The coins thus obtained will again be burned. <br><br><h4>  Hamster Marketplace is a business for sale. </h4><br>  A few years after launch, control over the site is planned to be transferred to the vendors themselves.  The sale will take place after the withdrawal of the business to specific profit indicators and the completion of active development.  The proceeds will be used to purchase the tokens remaining in free circulation. <br><br><h4>  All participants in the bounty program will be able to get paid by Fiat, not tokens. </h4><br>  The tokens distributed during the bounty program put tremendous pressure on the course ahead.  First of all, bounty tokens are dangerous because their holders most often are not interested in further participation in the project and ‚Äúdrain‚Äù coins at the current price.  This leads to a sharp collapse of the token rate, after which it is very difficult to recover at least to the nominal value. <br><br>  Since most projects do not care what happens on the market with their coins (especially if there is no more token than the money-raising tool), they easily allocate from 0.5 to 10% of the total pool of emitted tokens to the bounty program.  As expected, this leads to a collapse. <br><br>  That is why we are considering the following model: all participants in the bounty program will be able to receive payments for participation in Fiat from the budget of the crowdfunding campaign, if they do not intend to wait for the buy-back and want to immediately receive money.  Otherwise, participants in the bounty program will be able to receive their tokens only after the start of the open beta testing of the site.  This stage is a turning point, and the fact of launching the working version of any project financed through the sale of tokens significantly strengthens their course and increases public confidence. <br><br>  We believe that this approach will significantly reduce the load on the HMT course, which will allow holders to feel comfortable and not worry about the future of their investments. <br><br><h4>  Freeze share of participants </h4><br>  It is no secret that part of the emitted tokens is distributed in certain shares between the founders of the project.  It so happens that it is the members of the team who add fuel to the fire and begin to ‚Äúmerge‚Äù their shares on the exchanges, seeking to gain instant profit and become millionaires. <br><br>  In order to avoid such behavior and once again show the community that we care about the state of the HMT after the crowdfunding campaign ends, the founders share will be frozen for up to 9 months.  This will eliminate a substantial portion of free HMTs outside the operational reserve from turnover and strengthen the token rate.  On such measures are very, very rare projects. <br><br><h4>  Guaranteed buy back </h4><br>  Well, the last thing worth mentioning is the guaranteed buy-back of all HMT tokens after the sale of the site.  The plan is as follows: we create a platform, put it on its feet, support the course of the HMT token.  After the end of active development and the formation of the Hamster Marketplace community, it will be sold in parts to vendors that work on it.  This will ensure further collective management of the platform and respect for the interests of all its participants through decentralization. <br><br>  The proceeds from the sale of money will go to the redemption of tokens (including the shares of the founders).  Thus, all HMT holders will receive a fixed declared redemption income. <br><br>  Skeptics, having read this text, will say <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/xk/oh/skxkoh-lraq11dwnjcydz0eqhc8.jpeg"><br><br>  and they will be wrong. <br><br>  We are not going to ‚Äúshoot ourselves in the foot‚Äù, but simply take a number of adequate steps to maintain the token rate and ensure the demand for it.  It is this, along with a viable business model, the relevance of the site and the experience of the team that sets us apart from typical fraud projects that are trying to quickly ‚Äúcut the dough‚Äù and go to ‚Äúpull off couples‚Äù, for example, in Thailand. <br><br>  Since the Hamster Marketplace is a non-commercial project for sale, our main task is to make it successful.  The HMT Token is the first step, and crowdfunding is a tool, not an end in itself.  It is our attitude to the project and the unprecedented measures to protect the token rate and increase the demand for it that make the HMT a unique coin in the eyes of any experienced member of the crypto community. <br><br><hr><br><h4>  If you want to get more information about Hamster Marketplace first hand, welcome to <a href="https://t.me/hmstrRU">our Russian-language channel in Telegram</a> . </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343332/</a></p>
