      And we are also very pleased that our invited experts are representatives of various IT areas, and their reports cover completely different topics - the cloud, the Internet of things, DevOps, testing, flexible methodologies, virtual reality and much more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/c76/ee9/cadc76ee9d2745e795b4128f6b4a84a6.png" align="right" width="230"><br><br>  <b>Report: Scrum implementation in large projects</b> <br><br>  Scrum is one of the most common approaches when implementing Agile software development methodologies.  He has certain rules and laws that must be respected.  On the other hand, as practice shows, it is not always possible to adhere to all the rules.  This report will explain how and why it is sometimes necessary to modify the SCRUM mechanisms, using as an example the application of this methodology in development and operational teams when creating software for Swiss banks. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cd/cf0/1d9/3cdcf01d9627403fa88a258f4bd4269f.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: How to make your game profitable</b> <br><br>  This report will reveal the secrets of methods that guarantee profit from mobile applications, confirmed by millions of happy players.  The speaker will tell about various nuances and techniques that will significantly increase your income from a mobile application or game.  There are also examples of possible steps for success in the global market. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/0fb/1cc/cf00fb1cc0f3412889f495e7f9d2f761.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: Containers and microservices for the developer</b> <br><br>  What is useful in containers for your product and development team?  Do I need to rewrite everything on microservices?  What technologies to choose?  The report will provide information on current technologies and patterns that will help answer these questions. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/c9a/d82/30dc9ad825b34f89980ed4ed695b2bd3.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: Open Source Benchmarks</b> <br><br>  The speaker has been working on the topic of micro-optimization for a number of years and is the main maintainer of the open source library BenchmarkDotNet.  This library helps people write the ‚Äúright‚Äù benchmarks that measure the running times of specific methods.  Benchmarking is a very difficult, but at the same time a very interesting topic, which, unfortunately, not so many programmers understand (and knowing at least the basics is very useful).  This report will cover the role of the open source community in shaping the culture of modern .NET benchmarking, and the speaker will show a couple of fun examples in which it is not as easy to assess the speed of several lines of code as it might seem at first glance. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ee/c12/043/2eec120436a24210a4ebe3edfd565e5e.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: Simple and scalable backends</b> <br><br>  What is the reason for the complexity of the applications we create?  The answer to this philosophical question is trying to get every day experts of the IT-industry, based on knowledge and experience.  The best engineering practices and design patterns are designed to help with this.  In his speech, the speaker will share the experience of creating backends in complex subject areas and talk about the NuClear River project - opensource-tool for building a Read Model, which can significantly simplify the solution of some business problems. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8e/eaa/62c/a8eeaa62cb4f486f84463b1ede83920e.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: Review of the Azure Active Directory API security model from personal experience</b> <br><br>  What is an ‚Äúapplication‚Äù and what does ‚Äúintegration‚Äù mean?  In this report, the speaker will present various aspects and answer many questions.  This includes the Consent framework, authentication and authorization, an overview of the available authentication protocols, access methods and much more. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aba/c6c/550/abac6c5506a94ba9bde8e8add8efe6d8.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: How to destroy database performance in 30 minutes</b> <br><br>  Database administration, in particular SQL Server, is not the most complicated process.  Relatively small databases require no more than one working day to set up the server for normal, efficient and continuous operation.  However, most of the recommendations on the Internet contain extremely harmful advice, which at the superficial glance look ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù, but in fact lead to a significant performance degradation.  Using real examples, the speaker will tell about "what is good and what is bad" for the effective operation of the database server. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/864/ca9/6a9864ca95944bc8abee9b2e4e140fb9.png" align="left"><br>  <b>Report: How did we raise the farm, or the actual experience of test automation on mobile devices</b> <br><br>  In this report, the speaker will touch on one of the most important and at the same time controversial topics for developers - the topic of testing.  And since the last few years his team has been working on the DevExtreme framework for mobile devices, the story will be devoted to testing on various devices.  A report on the findings and omissions, defeats and victories, and how, stepping on various favorite rakes, the team still managed to do automated dream testing. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bb/d1f/329/4bbd1f32925c4e96ad80f6ecf05e2fb5.jpg" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: Dodo Pizza: Yeast Rising</b> <br><br>  The team had a task to move to Azure and start scaling.  Now the company Dodo Pizza is growing at 10% per month and does not slow down.  In the report, the company's founder will tell you what changes they make to scale with the business, and how Azure helps in this. <br><br>  <i>Speaker: Gleb Lesnikov - System Administrator and Head of Technical Support for Dodo Pizza</i> <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cd/7e3/c00/9cd7e3c001a349a08b760f4d4065f930.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: User interaction in VR / AR: evolution or revolution?</b> <br><br>  The emergence of new technologies brings new milestones in UI / UX, visualization and user interaction.  In this report, the participants, together with the rapporteur, will plunge into all of this and consider the stages of their development.  They find out how they were modified and how exactly what is available now appeared.  Identify what trends brought VR / AR to visualization and UI / UX, and consider the good and bad paths of their development.  You will try to imagine what is waiting in the interfaces of the future and when will it come.  And also try to find out whether virtual reality technology will bring a revolution in the world of user interaction and whether VR / AR goggles will become ‚Äúmust have‚Äù devices. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a2/cea/c78/7a2ceac78d0848368bcf15177e0398c8.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: How to build your brewery with the Internet of Things, cloud and mobile app</b> <br><br>  The report will consider the really useful use of Azure, IoT and analytics - building a cloud brewery management system.  Participants will get acquainted with the correct process of home grain brewing, learn which processes in it can be automated using the Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics and Windows 10 IoT. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/cac/55c/7b8cac55c5444c9c908d58fca1c9ba22.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: Debugging Office Add-Ins for iOS, Mac and Android</b> <br><br>  In 2015, Office Add-Ins became partially available on iOS and OSX.  Despite the unified Java Script API, the emergence of new platforms entailed the need to test and debug solutions for all platforms.  As part of the report, the speaker will talk about the weinre and ngrok tools that allow you to remotely debug web applications, as well as about the features of their use for debugging Add-Ins for Office. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/fdc/a5e/ee8fdca5e2854fc39740324e6362c274.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: Microsoft.ServiceFabris for building the Connected Car platform</b> <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs impossible to surprise anyone with a twitter-driven coffee machine or a refrigerator that buys products from the online store.  With the help of the Connected Car solution, thousands of motorists can remotely control their cars, and automakers and dealerships can diagnose and aggregate signals and data from car sensors for later analysis to take care of their customers in a way that no one else in history has done.  This report is about how Service Fabric is used to build the Connected Car platform, as well as the tools and technologies that the company uses to achieve this goal. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/07d/84e/ca407d84e7a64b769e08812cd611f7c5.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: Azure Functions - software logic, as a service in the cloud</b> <br><br>  Azure Functions offers the ability to perform on-demand calculations in response to events.  The service is built on the leading Azure platform in the PaaS market.  During this report, you will learn how Azure Functions extend the existing WebJobs infrastructure to ensure simple execution of code in response to events originating from both Azure services, SaaS products, and local systems.  You'll also see how to create and deploy Azure Functions code written in JavaScript and C # using an intuitive browser user interface to react to events generated by Blob Storage, Table Storage, Azure Queues, Service Bus, Event Hubs, HTTP requests, or by timer. . <br><br>  <i>Speaker: Marcin Borecki - CloudExpert.pl, Microsoft, Hedgehog Fund</i> <br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d74/3ea/cd4/d743eacd40bc43fdac4a0989b3aa4dd3.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: A practical example of building Continuous Integration in 72 hours - how we built processes within a company.</b> <br><br>  DevOps is good, but you need to go to it in small steps.  If your company has no experience in building effective development processes and quality control, then you need to start small - for example, with the formulation of a process of continuous integration.  In the report, the speaker will show in practice how CI can be implemented within the company as soon as possible. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/709/120/eb1709120a95403b8be662afd91a0851.png" align="left"><br><br>  <b>Report: Embracing the immensity, or how to use multiple MVVM frameworks in one XAML project</b> <br><br>  Some XAML developers use their favorite MVVM framework from project to project.  Others each time choose a new MVVM framework for a new project.  In the report, the speaker will share the fact that you can go even further and use several MVVM frameworks simultaneously on the same project, each of which will solve the problem for which it is best adapted.  Participants will see how to connect good old Prism with hipster ReactiveUI and enjoy the benefits of both frameworks. <br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><img width="230" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/a94/999/d7aa949993f143cbb6383ec5c23f97ef.png" align="right"><br><br>  <b>Report: How to analyze key performance counters and identify system weaknesses</b> <br><br>  Do you know how quickly and reliably your system works?  How effective is it?  How to localize performance problems?  In his report, the speaker will try to answer these questions in the context of the collection and analysis of performance counters for the Azure cloud application. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><h3>  DevCon 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/">DevCon</a> is the largest Microsoft conference for developers in Russia.
