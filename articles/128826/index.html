  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why ideas are not enough - a look from the developers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many companies that develop mobile apps and social networking apps.  Often they come to customers with the idea.  The fact that Ideas alone is not enough has already been written a lot, but I decided to write about this a bit from the other side. <br><br>  Customers are often asked to create an application or service, without having a clear understanding of what they want to see in the end.  This is, in essence, a normal situation.  It is always possible to help such clients to decide, help to compile a description of the project and write a technical task for them.  However, there are cases when this is not possible.  These are the cases when the client does not have a business, and he expects that his project will bring in money.  These are the cases when the client has only an Idea. <br><br>  Why in such cases cooperation is doomed to failure?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Compare, there is a usual situation when a customer comes to a development company and asks, say, an application for an iPhone, which will reflect the functions of his site, but for those who are not near the computer.  In this case, the developers understand well why the client needs this application and how it will be used.  Even if the customer has a vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow his application should look like, the developers will be able to prompt him this, and write the technical task for him, because they understand the final goals. <br><br>  And there is another situation.  The customer asks for a service that he believes will become very popular and will earn millions.  For example, he orders online poker, but not simple, but with "social" elements, the ability to "help friends" and "play clans."  At the same time, the customer has no managerial skills and any experience in the IT field.  He has only an idea and vague ideas about how the product should look.  He is unable to articulate clear product requirements.  In fact, the developer completely falls the task of creating a product from scratch, based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe customer.  But the developers have already seen a lot of things, and understand that online poker has already created a great many, and one more such poker, albeit with slight changes, will not become popular.  Therefore, they do not believe in the excellent idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe customer, and therefore do not see the ways in which his service will earn money.  And consequently, they will not be able to prompt the customer how and what should be done.  They will not be able to draw up a technical task, and as a result a bad project will turn out, and the task of any developer, no matter how pathetic it may sound, is to create good projects.  Well, just at least because in this case their portfolio will consist of good projects :) <br><br>  Therefore, even in cases where, apart from Idea, there is a development team, the Idea bearer needs to clearly and thoroughly understand what he wants to see in the end, and how it will bring him money </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128826/</a></p>
