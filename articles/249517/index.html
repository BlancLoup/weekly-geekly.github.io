      However, we have other global news: <a href="http://www.black-swift.com/">Black Swift</a> did not just come out on Kickstarter, but in the first 6 days it almost collected the necessary amount. <br><br>  This is not a lot and not a little - there were projects that were collected 100% in a day or an hour, there were projects that were dying, barely reaching 50% in the entire term.  We got into an interesting situation - on the one hand, in the professional communities Black Swift caused mostly positive responses, on the other hand, the media didn‚Äôt get interested in more or less general media - some other microcomputer, there are few of them - therefore some massive we did not have a surge in the first day or two. <br><br>  Here, of course, it was worth a little refinement before launching: to create some meaningless, but understandable and giving beautiful pictures and headings an expansion card, which ordinary media would bite.  Well, for example, "the smallest router in the world" or "100% compatibility with Arduino".  Pointless - because if you need a router, it is easier to buy ready-made, and if you really are worried about compatibility with Arduino with a 400-MHz processor and OpenWRT, that is, Yun.  But, as practice shows, all those journalists who traditionally speak disdainfully about marketers are caught very well by such uncomplicated marketing gimmicks. <br><br>  However, I will write more about working with Kickstarter later, when there will be an official ‚Äú100%‚Äù information channel, but for now - about Arduin (actually not). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have already mentioned a couple of times that together with Black Swift it is convenient to use some cheap and simple microcontroller - AVR, PIC, STM32 - to implement hardware PWM, ADC and honest real time on it.  Obviously, one inconvenience arises - the controller needs to be programmed separately, and if we aim at people who are not necessarily seriously knowledgeable about microcontroller topics, then this becomes a problem. <br><br>  Fortunately, under Linux, there is the avrdude package, which can do one very good thing - to program the AVR, which is connected to the usual input / output ports (GPIO) of a Linux device.  OpenWRT - the same Linux, side view, so the assembly under it avrdude is, in general, a matter of technology and one small patch. <br><br>  Test board: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fb/791/c4a/3fb791c4a48e47eabd568db5b91636a7.jpg"><br><br>  It is equipped with ATtiny24A, 8 MHz quartz, power piping, connectors for Black Swift and a pair of IDC 2x5 connectors.  No specific goal of just such a form factor was not pursued. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e26/df1/b0e/e26df1b0e2a34cc1a08dca2b8f7f63fe.jpg"><br><br>  With Black Swift installed.  One of the things for which I like it is the opportunity to put it on the connectors, and all sorts of additional components to place under it;  even above quartz (normal HC-49S) there is a bit of free space. <br><br>  The scheme is extremely simple: the SPI interface of the plugin connects to Black Swift, its RESET is also connected to one of the GPIOs and is simultaneously pulled to the power supply by a resistor.  Eats tinka for simplicity from 3.3 V, issued by the Black Swift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26e/55a/ad7/26e55aad7afc4d1fa40b3f6d068cbfa9.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://files.black-swift.com/data/public/b20928.php">The scheme in PDF</a> , the <a href="http://files.black-swift.com/data/public/18e2bf.php">scheme and the board</a> for Diptrace and in gerberas. <br><br>  This is obviously half the job.  Now we take a fresh avrdude-6.1, slightly rule it so that it meets under OpenWRT, add support for hardware SPI by <a href="http://kevincuzner.com/2013/05/27/raspberry-pi-as-an-avr-programmer/">Kevin Katsner for the future</a> , write a Makefile and <a href="http://kevincuzner.com/2013/05/27/raspberry-pi-as-an-avr-programmer/">compile it</a> into a ready-made package. <br><br>  Patches and Makefile <a href="https://github.com/blackswift/avrdude">can be found here</a> , and the ready package for OpenWRT 14.07 is <a href="http://files.black-swift.com/data/public/5dc0b8.php">here</a> .  It is not designed for Black Swift in any special way (in particular, I did not rewrite the linuxgpio driver from slow sysfs to fast direct access to GPIO), so it will be easy to work on other motherboards. <br><br>  We try (avrdude -p t24 -c linuxgpio -t): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/b11/0f7/705b110f748c4fba8f67e45cd55a079b.png"><br><br>  The chip signature is correct, everything works.  Flash AVR to flash LED: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/2ba/fd8/9672bafd810745e1af279d04bfe20f7e.png"><br><br>  We blink the LED, just like on the Arduino. <br><br>  Obviously, it is easy to organize data exchange with the AVR through the same SPI through which we requested it - in one direction to send commands and parameters, in response to receive some data.  That is, we have fully integrated the AVR with Black Swift, and in such a way that we don‚Äôt even need an external programmer - Black Swift can configure and flash a virgin chip. <br><br>  Of course, Black Swift can be used as a programmer itself - with access via Wi-Fi and the possibility of autonomous power supply.  I even see how to bring it to the finished product: add a [switchable] translator of levels 3.3 / 5 V and make a web interface with a calculator of fusions (there are such on JS) and fill the HEX firmware file.  I even just had a suspicion that I would do it for myself. <br><br>  If you wish, I suspect you can even compile gcc-avr for it, so that the firmware can be assembled directly on it, but somehow I do not see any practical need for this. <br><br>  Well, about Arduino: in principle, nothing prevents you from writing them to AVR HEX files obtained from the Arduino IDE. <br><br>  <b>Upd.</b>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dzhe/" class="user_link">Jae</a> demands to refute dirty slander and report that he has a cat. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249517/</a></p>
