  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interdepartmental electronic document management: the current situation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The e-Russia project is often discussed and criticized, both in its entirety and in parts.  We will tell only about one aspect of this project - about the situation with interdepartmental electronic document circulation - in particular about what has already been done in this direction. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The current state of affairs with MEDO is as follows.  The automation of document management in individual departments is now at a rather high level, since projects have been conducted for a long time in many structures.  But despite this, the originals of the documents and interdepartmental document circulation so far are almost universally paper.  Just the other day, on TV, they showed a stack of folders with only one of the bills sent to a ministry for approval - it looks very impressive.  If we take into account that these documents should not exist in one or even two or three copies, then the issue of protecting forests from cutting down in our country is clearly very acute. <br><br>  Actually, the introduction of the MEDO should solve these problems, and besides, it should affect the speed of documents passing through departments, lead to simplification of all procedures, reduction of staff of officials, and so on.  Anyway, you can get a lot of benefits.  By the way, German Gref, talking about how it was necessary to integrate the databases of several departments of the region to launch the citizen's electronic card, mentioned a 30 percent reduction in the number of beneficiaries that existed due to duplication of lists.

      <b>State regulation</b> <br>  As for state regulation, there are already a number of established rules governing interdepartmental document circulation.  One of them is described here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eos/blog/109299/">habrahabr.ru/company/eos/blog/109299</a> .  In addition, the technical requirements for the MEDO were approved, including the requirements for the gateway.  The composition of the gateway workstation software, for example, should include: <br><br>  <i>a) an operating system like Windows XP Professional Russian;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) Secure Pack Rus 1.0 for Windows XP;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>c) Office Professional Plus 2007 Russian OLP NL</i> <br><br>  The composition of the gateway server software should include: <br>  <i>a) an operating system like Windows Server Standard Edition 2003 R2 Win32 Russian OLP NL;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) SQL Server Standard Edition 2005 Win32 Russian OLP C.</i> <br><br>  <b>Medo Architecture</b> <br>  For the interaction of electronic document management systems used in different ministries and the government apparatus of the Russian Federation, a specialized electronic postal service is used, which delivers documents between the SED using specialized gateways. <br>  In turn, each electronic document management system used in the framework of the MEDO project has its own adapter, which, when sending a document, brings the document card to the ERMS in a single approved format. <br><br>  This format is based on the XML language, and is described in the Government Decree on the approval of the provision on the MEDO (No. 754 of September 22, 2009), as well as in the Ordinance of October 2, 2009 (N 1403-p) (On the approval of the MEDO technical requirements) . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f597e569/41bb5e4a/ce487c87/3daed540.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Pilot project or what is already there</b> <br>  In 2009, as part of the e-government creation program, the first pilot project was launched for the implementation of an inter-agency EDI between the Government Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications and the Ministry of Economic Development.  To date, this very project is already undergoing trial operation: for example, there is a document flow between the Government Office and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, as well as between the Ministry of Agriculture and other federal executive bodies connected to the system.  In the future, it is planned to gradually connect the regions - the Kaliningrad region will become a pilot region connected to the MEDO. <br><br>  MEDO was created on the basis of the existing postal system MEDO and EDS used by federal executive bodies.  In the course of the project, technical requirements were developed, including a common format for interaction between the SED and interfacing tools of the EDMS EDF to ensure work in a single format.  Also, unified rules for conducting office work, regulations on the system of interdepartmental electronic document circulation, interaction between the Government Office and the federal authorities were developed.  Also carried out a phased expansion of the functionality of the interaction and the composition of documents sent electronically. <br><br>  As a result, the system at the moment looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a7e2d7ec/ac174430/e14e8954/0673421a.jpg"><br><br>  What currently makes MEDO do: <br>  - send federal electronic copies of resolutions of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation and his deputies; <br>  - send federal electronic copies of the minutes of meetings in the Government of the Russian Federation; <br>  - send letters of structural subdivisions of the Government Office of the Russian Federation to federal authorities and organizations included in the MEDO system in electronic form. <br><br>  In addition, the following processes are being worked out at the MEDO: <br>  - the order and technology of sending letters to structural subdivisions of the Government Office of the Russian Federation in electronic form; <br>  - organization of training administrators of automated information systems FOIV connected to the system MEDO, the order of interaction on the use of basic technological elements of the interface of electronic documents; <br>  - pilot testing of sending electronic copies of outgoing letters of federal executive bodies and organizations to the Government Office of the Russian Federation; <br>  - development of software and hardware to ensure access to information on the progress and execution of documents sent to federal executive bodies. <br><br>  Of course, we can say that so far not so much has been done, but this is only at first glance.  Each function requires working out the routes of movement of documents, coordination of these routes in all departments and so on, and there are a lot of them in each department.  If we talk about technical and technological problems of interdepartmental electronic document circulation, then, perhaps, the greatest difficulties are associated with the signing of electronic documents in terms of the adopted technology for issuing documents (without a number and date), as well as organizing the full interaction of electronic document management systems with document passage control in addressees. <br><br>  This is how things are with the MEDO at the federal level.  At the regional level, the situation is significantly different, but we will tell about this in the next post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110001/</a></p>
