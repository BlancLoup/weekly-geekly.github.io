Naturally, I could not get around and I was this my "favorite" topic [ <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D70552">1</a> , <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D70036">2</a> ]. <br><br>  I'll start with a quote.  It is collected from some of the statements of one, in general, quite interesting author *.

    <blockquote>  ... zadolbali these habradebily ... Like Habr positioning itself as a social network for IT people - people who, in theory, should have intelligence, but, apparently, with an increase in the number of users, the average IQ is sharply reduced ... In general, if you want to correct the actions of idiots, mined article, and you liked the article itself, then put it more pluses. </blockquote><br><br>  So I turned into a moron and a jerk.  And only because for a variety of reasons I could not agree with some of the conclusions of this author. <br><br>  Rarely I put the cons of the materials and, practically, never - by the authors themselves.  And I do not do this not for humanitarian reasons, but simply because I cannot approve [ <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D28930">3</a> , <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D29684">4</a> ] <br>  principles of evaluation and ranking of materials and users, adopted in today's social networks.  And then could not resist and set.  And on you :). <br><br>  The aforementioned author is so sure of his one-hundred percent rightness always and everywhere that he cannot even imagine how someone might disagree with him.  And not just one person.  Hence, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome kind of conspiracy of these same morons and the organization of some ‚Äúflash mobs‚Äù against him, passing through the red thread through his auto-commentaries. <br><br>  In this case, note: I did not meet in the discussions on the author's notes a single rough attack.  It just turned out: in order to be an intellectual, you simply have to agree with the author.  Moreover, there is no doubt that the author himself refers not only to intellectuals, but also to intellectuals.  About the first I will not argue.  I just do not know. <br><br>  But as for intelligence, certain doubts still appeared.  After all, it is not in the spirit of an intellectual to divide others into the elite, which is always right, and all the rest: morons, jerks or, as often, this same elite calls them - cattle.  The intellectual, unfortunately, may be even more often than required, doubts that he is right.  If they prove to me that I am wrong, then from that moment I stop talking about the intelligent social web.  Solemnly promise ... <br><br>  And I‚Äôm not even saying, about one of the Habrava commandments, ‚Äúdo not beg for karma‚Äù and similar to it, which the quoted author also clearly violated. <br><br>  <em>* I remind you that a note that includes the text you read (with all the necessary links) is in the iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D73825">blog</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19583/</a></p>
