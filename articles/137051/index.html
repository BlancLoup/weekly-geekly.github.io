  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remote Web Studio Guide</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The post is not advertising, I‚Äôll just tell you what I use to organize and control the processes in my small and highly specialized web studio working on a remote basis.  Perhaps someone already uses these simple and affordable tools, and someone has moved to something more.  If you belong to the second group - share, please, experience, I think everyone will be interested. <br><br>  Also, I hope that this post will dispel the myth that all the ‚Äúremote profile‚Äù web studios are sloppy and unprofessional. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The team of developers (designers and programmers) was formed from competent employees, manually found on freelance exchanges and collected on personal recommendations.  All the guys are well versed in the specifics of the development of online stores (the studio works only in this direction) and have an impressive experience behind them.

      The whole organization of the work of the studio, the internal delivery of projects and tasks goes through this service. <br><br><img title="Untitled-1" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-1.gif" width="577" height="328"><br><br>  I also tried timlab and other English-language analogues, as well as software solutions in the form of offline organizers.  Nothing like it.  Creating projects, assigning performers, tasks, deadlines (I don‚Äôt like the word deadline, it brings something negative. It should be the other way around), comments and feedback to the projects.  All this makes the project an indispensable assistant for me.  Leprozoria's influence on this service is felt :) <br><br>  Attaching it to a tab in Google Chrome and making it automatically open, I see all the projects and work done on them in the morning.  The ‚ÄúWho is to blame?‚Äù Tab shows those who have an assignment deadline for which object.  The calendar is also convenient for displaying some personal files, such as ‚Äúpay taxes‚Äù or ‚Äúgo to the mother-in-law‚Äù. <br><br>  The standard set of communication with employees and customers - QIP, Skype, The Bat!  At first and last, I would like to dwell in more detail, because  Reflection and contact management is configured in a fairly convenient way. <br><br>  It may be trite, but the contact list in icq is divided and sorted according to the degree of importance of contacts (a long-awaited function that Kvipovs have not been able to realize for a long time) into groups, which allows us not to be distracted by personal contacts and is constantly ‚Äúin the work environment‚Äù.  Customers in the first place and above all.  For some contacts and employees I use the signs +, ++, +++, which means the level and knowledge of a specialist.  Despite the fact that he is intimately familiar with each of the workers, there is no need to urgently crawl into their resumes, in case of any questions. <br><br><img title="icq" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/icq.gif" width="161" height="541"><br><br>  Address Book in The BAT!  as follows: <br><br> <a href=""><img title="book" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/book.png" width="715" height="591"></a> <br><br>  As you can see, the lists and mailing groups are quite convenient and do not give any recipient the abyss without a trace.  Clients are divided into four groups, I pay special attention to the analysis of ‚Äúfailed‚Äù - those with whom the dialogue began, but did not produce a result.  Later, I selectively cast aside some of them with proposals on similar subjects, but it is not yet possible to turn at least one into ‚Äúshort-term‚Äù ones. <br><br>  According to the lists "Employees" I send out new ones.  Tasks and notifications for studio staff.  After that, all those who unsubscribe are going to the teamer in the task branch, where we discuss it.  Free competition within the team, but the last word is still mine.  A design can be drawn by just one person, and a whole crowd nakidaet him tips.  He can only filter and analyze information. <br><br><img title="Untitled-12" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-12.gif" width="768" height="353"><br><br>  One box in which all work mail is drained.  The Inbox folder is nested as two folders.  "IMPORTANT" stores letters, correspondence on which is currently very important and which cannot be projected ... to start.  The "Questionable" less important, but no less promising letters.  Skipping them is also undesirable.  In the "sent", I highlight in red the groups of letters, the answers for which should be kept under control.  I used to use Thunderbird, but with the expansion of the list and categories of contacts, I stopped to like it. <br><br>  Document Management Workshop goes through Dropbox, standing in the office, at home and on the laptop.  For the studio I have my own folder, which has the following structure: <br><br><img title="Untitled-22" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-22.gif" width="779" height="254"><br><br><img title="Untitled-33" src="http://www.mirolubow.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Untitled-331.gif" width="792" height="302"><br><br>  Everything is clear and accessible.  If anyone and employees are interested, share the ‚ÄúUseful‚Äù folder in which I have collected interesting books and an article on web development (mostly in design and usability - this is closer to me than coding). <br><br>  In addition to these programs, I also use Snagit for screen shots (with saving pictures on ftp and copying the link to the clipboard for a quick exchange of views via icq) and in addition minor tools for development.  It seems to be all the tools that help me remotely control development processes.  And, I forgot the most important ones - A4 sheets on the wall.  How not to twist - you can not get away from them :) <br><br>  The scale of the studio is not very large, but ambitious plans. <br><br>  Share your tools and tools for remote control of work, otherwise I may be using something already non-working. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137051/</a></p>
