      But!  Until now, patients come to the consultation and say that - ‚ÄúBut in another clinic, the doctor said ...‚Äù They say that such wildly complex teeth should be removed outside the hospital, the wards of the facial surgery (maxillofacial surgery), and even without general anesthesia .  Like, is fraught with consequences. <br><br>  Not only the words ‚Äúhospital‚Äù and ‚Äúmaxillofacial surgery‚Äù in many patients cause a feeling of fear on the verge of a panic attack, but also after such statements it is extremely difficult to convince them of the opposite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sm/mo/xq/smmoxqrmfayyfodciwe75svwdzw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  After such intimidations, I can‚Äôt call it any other way, many actually go to the hospital, collect tests, agree to intubation anesthesia and lie in wards for a few days, enjoying the local community, attentive attitude of nurses and nosocomial infection. <br><br>  At the same time, to the question ‚ÄúHow did you justify the need for tooth extraction exclusively in the ward?‚Äù I never received a clear answer. <br><br>  The only thing that they usually say: ‚ÄúWell, they told me a complex tooth ... it is deep ... near the nerve ...‚Äù.  Yes, I can well imagine that all this is true, and there is a nerve there, and there is also a deep hole, but ... what is the fundamental difference in the technique of stationary and ambulatory removal? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/be/ir/xvbeirccpkk078r-0_e9gokquro.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Survey? <br><br>  Well, computed tomography (3D surround image) can be done - anywhere. <br><br>  For what? <br><br>  And in order that orthopantomography (OPG, panoramic or panoramic image of the teeth), is planar, which means that every detail of the image is superimposed layer by layer on each other.  Therefore, to consider the object of study, in particular, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wisdom tooth, located near the mandibular nerve, in all planes, at a different angle or other projection is impossible.  CBCT (Conical Beam Computed Tomography), on the contrary, gives us this opportunity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/it/4n/qgit4ndqdh1a5pkm5s4rce9x6we.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maybe, in these of your own cells there are specially trained doctors, who possess methods of non-contact tooth extraction?  Which without cuts and any efforts will force the 8k to dissolve only by the power of thought? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x3/_k/3k/x3_k3kffmrd5pv-omgdyuhbnn5y.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, too, no! <br><br>  And I keep asking: ‚ÄúApparently the tooth was quickly removed and nothing bothered?‚Äù Damn!  Not even here. <br><br>  The average time of removal of the lower, impacted wisdom teeth (those that are completely under the gum) in such institutions, according to the patients, is 2.5 hours.  I heard a couple of times, just think about 4 (!) Hours.  Do you think this is overkill?  During this time, you can spend sinus lifting on both sides, install 8 implants, order lunch for yourself, and even have time to take a nap.  On my statements like "in our clinic, the removal of such a tooth takes an average of 25-30 minutes, from anesthesia to the suture," many, to put it mildly, look surprised. <br><br>  I think that you, having spent 4 hours in the dentist‚Äôs chair, and even some professor hung with regalia, would hardly believe that all this could be done ‚Äúa little‚Äù faster.  And in a more friendly, relaxed and comfortable atmosphere.  Without unnecessary risks and worries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ch/0u/of/ch0uofe-oqrxtnvennonrxk-nta.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>So why are people sent to the hospital for the removal of wisdom teeth?</b>  <b>Who does this?</b> <br><br>  But who: <br><br>  <b>- either the doctor does not know how / afraid to remove such teeth and wants to be safe, referring you to another specialist (which is most likely)</b> <br><br>  <b>- either they want to dissolve you for money.</b> <br><br>  With the first paragraph, everything is clear.  Do not know how - give it to another.  It is right. <br><br>  But where does the money come from and why is it ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù?  Because you pay for services in which, as we just found out, there is no need to: <br><br>  - the cost of days spent in the hospital is about 4 thousand rubles.  Depending on whether you have a single chamber, or you will hear snoring for twenty more of the same ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù with wisdom teeth for several nights. <br><br>  But that is not all. <br><br>  If you need general anesthesia, add to your money spent on the ward advice from an anesthesiologist and resuscitation specialist (about 1.5 thousand rubles), necessary laboratory tests (an average of 3 thousand rubles), and the procedure of general anesthesia itself.  At least two hours, but sometimes more.  And it can cost you from 8 to 30 thousand rubles. <br><br>  But even the surgery itself is worth something, right?  As a rule - removal of the impacted tooth costs from 14 to 23 thousand rubles.  We can assume that in a good hospital the cost of removal will be comparable (not counting the wards, anesthesia, tests, consultations and anesthesia). <br><br>  Feel the difference?  Well, not a divorce?  They scare you, then they shake your money.  A lot of money. <br><br>  <b>Why did I even write all this?</b> <br><br>  I want to tell you, dear friends, that there are practically <b>no such wisdom teeth that could not be removed outside the hospital, at a regular outpatient admission.</b>  Having spent, on the strength of, forty minutes for consultation, examination and the operation itself, you solve the problem once and for all.  In the shortest time you will be in the ranks again, you will be able to go about your business, almost without losing your way of life.  No need to take sick leave and hire a carer.  Live a normal life, but with small postoperative recommendations, appointments and inspections. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  I will be glad to answer your questions in the comments! <br><br>  Sincerely, Andrei Dashkov <br><br>  <b>What else to read about wisdom teeth and their removal?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455286/">Wisdom teeth: remove cannot be left</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455499/">Removal of wisdom teeth.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455499/">How it's done?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456402/">Teeth of wisdom: pull-pull</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457336/">Consequences of late removal of wisdom teeth</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458218/</a></p>
