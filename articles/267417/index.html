In this book, it is fascinating and easy to talk about the formation of a modern picture of the world, how resolutely and painfully it was revised with the development of science, what incredible horizons are opening up before cosmology, one has only to step out of the plane defined by the Big Bang theory and traditional astrophysics.  The latest work of Victor Stenger, in which he actually sums up her scientific activity and life, convincingly proves that the Multiverse could have arisen naturally, without the intervention of any higher powers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In July 2012, shortly after I sent the publisher the first draft of a book titled ‚ÄúGod and the Atom: From Democritus to the Higgs Boson‚Äù, a news conference was held in Geneva, at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN), which soon hit the front pages newspapers around the world.  At this conference, it was announced that the results of two independent experiments, each of which cost about a billion dollars and united the work of thousands of scientists from dozens of countries, with a high degree of empirical significance confirmed the existence of an elementary particle called the Higgs boson. <br><br>  The Higgs boson was theoretically predicted 48 years earlier as a particle, due to which other elementary particles can <br>  gain weight.  This discovery strengthened the position of the standard model of elementary particles, developed in the 70s of the twentieth century.  Since then, the standard model has been successfully used to describe the basic elements of subatomic matter and the forces by which these elements interact to form the material world.  Until now, the standard model could not be experimentally refuted.

      Fortunately, I was able to include a detailed description of the discovery of the Higgs boson in my book God and the Atom, published in 2013.  And in March 2014, when I sent the publisher a draft of the book ‚ÄúGod and the Multiverse,‚Äù the story repeated.  At this time, the attention of the world public was attracted by the news conference at Harvard, which also got into all newspaper headlines.  An international group of researchers working at the South Pole reported that they with a high degree of confidence were able to detect the second type of polarization of the CMB, called the B-mode.  The B-mode was regarded as a signal from the gravitational waves generated by the quantum fluctuations of space-time, which appeared when the Universe appeared 13.8 billion years ago.  Most of the reports published in the media did not mention that these are preliminary results, that other versions of the radiation origin have not yet been ruled out, and that independent confirmation of these results is still awaited.  However, if confirmation is received, the consequences will be colossal. <br><br>  The existence of the B-mode polarization at the early stage of the Universe formation was first predicted in 1980 in the so-called inflationary model of the Universe.  According to this model, almost immediately after the appearance, the Universe expanded exponentially by many orders of magnitude.  The model helped to solve a number of important problems of cosmology and withstood several serious checks that could well disprove it. If the inflation model is correct, it strictly follows that our Universe is not alone, but there are many other universes that make up the so-called Multiverse without boundaries neither in time nor in space.  She had no beginning, no moment of creation.  It existed and will always exist. <br><br>  This time, again, I managed to include this discovery in my book, the relic radiation (RI) will be considered in it in detail. <br>  We will see how accurate measurements of the characteristics of RI from space and from the surface of the Earth, made with the help of state-of-the-art technology, have helped us to penetrate deeply into the history of the development of our Universe from its very birth to our days. <br><br>  The goal that I am pursuing in this book is to show how for thousands of years, since people first looked at the sky and wondered what was there, the current ideas about the huge Universe around us and about the real possibility of the existence of many universes were formed. .  We will look at how our ancestors conceived the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdivine creation, designed to explain phenomena, the causes of which, as it turned out, were purely natural processes. <br><br>  This is a long story, and the reader should be patient to consistently, step by step, follow how the human concept of space has changed: from flat earth, between water and heaven, to hundreds of billions of galaxies, each of which consists of hundreds of billions of stars and countless potentially livable planets, and then to the eternal limitless multiverse. <br><br><h5>  about the author </h5><br>  Victor J. Stenger is a specialist in particle physics and the author of 12 books (not counting this one), including the 2007 bestseller, according to the New York Times, the book God: an Unsuccessful Hypothesis.  How science proves to us that God does not exist. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dr. Stenger grew up in a working-class Catholic family in the American city of Beyonne, New Jersey.  His father <br>  was a Lithuanian immigrant, and mother - the daughter of immigrants from Hungary.  He attended a public school and in 1956 received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Newark College of Engineering (now the Institute of Technology in New Jersey).  While studying in college, he edited the student newspaper and received several journalism awards. <br><br>  After receiving a scholarship to Hughes Aircraft, Stenger entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where he became a master in 1959 and a doctor of physical sciences in 1963.  After that, he worked at the University of Hawaii, and in 2000 he went to the University of Colorado.  In recent years, he served as honorary professor of physics at the University of Hawaii and adjunct professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado.  Dr. Stenger also worked as a visiting professor at the faculties of the University of Heidelberg in Germany and at the University of Oxford in England, as well as a visiting researcher at the Rutherford Laboratory in England, the University of Florence and the National Laboratory of Nuclear Physics in the Italian city of Frascati. <br><br>  His research career covers a period marked by the enormous progress of particle physics, which <br>  eventually led to the emergence of the Standard Model in its modern form.  Stenger participated in a series of experiments that helped establish the properties of strange particles, charmed quarks, gluons and neutrinos.  He was also among the pioneers of the emerging scientific fields of the physics of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays and neutrino astronomy.  During his last research project before retiring, Stenger took part in an underground experiment in Japan, which for the first time made it possible to prove that neutrinos have mass.  In 2002, Masatoshi Kosiba, the scientific director of the project, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new-science/product/bog-i-multivselennaya-rasshirennoe-ponyatie-kosmosa">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601765/978549601765_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601765/978549601765_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  The book is part of a series of <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/new-science">New Science</a> . <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley a 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Multiverse</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267417/</a></p>
