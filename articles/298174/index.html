I continue the cycle (on the blog of a wonderful person Michael, the owner of Textbroker) about the letters, and what can be done with them. <br><br>  <b>Most likely, the presentation nafig not need anyone except you</b> .  Behind the presentation are hiding employees who do not know how to write what they need in words.  In most cases, this is just a crutch, just not to blurt out anything extra. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      There are two important exceptions.  The first is when you are talking to big business.  There, the presentation will be carefully printed out and laid on the table to the head.  The leader and recipient of your letter are different faces, so you need an essence that will reach him.  The second exception is when you need to pack a lot of pictures, graphs and other pieces, that is, in fact, attach either a catalog of goods, or a project outline. <br><br>  <b>The main rule of the presentation is</b> very simple: if the first and second frame is about you, and not about the recipient, it immediately flies to the basket without any questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Smoker Presentation </h3><br>  As a rule, this is a full-weighted (5‚Äì20 Megabyte) richly designed PPTX, which lies as an attachment to a letter and is not represented in any way in this letter.  Like, we have a profitable offer for you, in the presentation presentation, see for yourself, freaks. <br><br>  The result is consistent. <br><br>  <b>The structure of the presentation of the smoker is approximately the same (frames 20, each item - 2-3 episodes):</b> <br><ol><li>  We are such a company. </li><li>  We are able to do this. </li><li>  And here it is. </li><li>  We have cool customers. </li><li>  Here is the full list of services. </li><li>  Clipart image. </li><li>  And here is the offer for you. </li></ol><br>  All this is carefully provided with small inscriptions, a total of 300 words in the presentation, or even a thousand. <br><br>  As you probably guess, only the ears reach the battery, because the only frame that the recipient needed was so tightly snykan that it would not be opened. <br><br>  The second point is the attitude towards people who do not know how to structure thoughts, which is appropriate in business.  Therefore, even if the offer is profitable and necessary - somehow dumb with such characters in contact. <br><br><h3>  Presentation of a healthy person </h3><br>  On the other hand, normal working investments (which are needed in practice) look completely different.  This is a PDF that opens beautifully on any machines and phones.  It is typed on a light background, because it implies further printing - it is necessary to take into account the life of the carrier.  There from 1-2 pages (if it is A4 PDF) to 5-6 frames (if it is made under the screen).  Volume - a maximum of 2 megabytes, more often - 500-700 Kb. <br><br>  <b>Approximate structure:</b> <br><ol><li>  Hi, you have this situation </li><li>  We will do this for you.  Photo or scheme. </li><li>  You get this: numbers. </li><li>  My name is Ivan, here is my phone. </li></ol><br>  Again, the structure corresponds to the optimal structure of the product offer - the simplified steps are the same.  Problem statement, solution, details, contact. <br><br>  There are very few words in such a presentation, usually around 50. As a rule, these are headings and captions for pictures.  Superfluous nothing.  The task of the presentation at this stage is to set an impression, and not to substantiate in detail.  It is still necessary to substantiate in detail at the meeting. <br><br><h4>  Check list </h4><br><ul><li>  On the first frame, the client‚Äôs task is accurately described, there is its name and logo. </li><li>  Everything about your company overboard, by reference or at the very end is small, the focus is on the recipient's task. </li><li>  No common words.  Not ‚Äúwe have a profitable offer,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe use the latest technologies for geolocation,‚Äù but ‚Äúwe make geo-poults‚Äù and ‚Äúcontact costs 10 rubles under such and such conditions. </li><li>  Photos, schemes and other drawings are strictly on business.  If you can not justify the train, why the image in the presentation - overboard. </li><li>  Superfluous words - in the letter, but not in the presentation. </li><li>  All this should be read a minute, maximum two. (Exception is diagrams and directories).  Check on friends. </li><li>  There is an accompanying letter describing what it is, who it is and why to open the presentation. </li><li>  Contacts are not continued (taking this opportunity, I send my greetings to the mail.ru advertising department, which regularly sends out special offers without the possibility of contact). </li><li>  Does not kill the printer with a dark background. </li><li>  No more than 2 megabytes. </li></ul><br>  Well, do not forget that if you can do without a presentation - it is better to do everything for this. <br><br>  Yes, and one more.  The presentations came to us from the decadent West, where they enter the culture of the story about different things.  We have exactly what they say, and there they show.  They need slides.  Therefore, the approach described above should be redone when dealing with Europe and the United States. <br><br><h3>  Other materials </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">Why 98% of the texts on your sites do not work.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">At all.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/203490/">And how to fix it.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/236365/">How I chose a hedgehog copywriter</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22162/">How to make TZ radio easier</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/mosigra/blog/22192/">How to describe an online store product</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/22770/">How to write the main, and what should not be there</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/textbroker/blog/23218/">Transaction letters</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298174/</a></p>
