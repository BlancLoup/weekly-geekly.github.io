  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RSS feed ‚Äúmillions‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img alt="RSS feed" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee7/3f8/c30/ee73f8c303d0c78f200d708fa1177248.jpg" align="left">  I asked this question recently.  ‚ÄúDoes it make sense for me to post my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Katya_Pushkareva">RSS feeds</a> completely, or can I just make announcements?‚Äù  Now I understand that I am doing the right thing when I post my posts completely.  They told me recently that in the west, business on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS feeds is</a> very popular.  Now I will explain this with another portion of ‚ÄúPushkarevschiny‚Äù <br>  Katya Pushkareva is already read by 238 RSS subscribers.  Site attendance at the same time does not exceed 100 visitors per day.  This means that 2/3 people read a blog in RSS.  I wanted to make sure that all RSS subscribers went to the site.  That is, the RSS would simply post an announcement of 1-2 paragraphs, and the rest under read more.  But then I realized that from this I only lose. <br>  The fact is that I read all RSS news in <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Katya_Pushkareva">Google Reader</a> .  When I see only the announcement of the news, I rarely click to finish reading it to the end.  Here you need to make a sooooo cool headline so that I read this news.  But the news that in RSS "merge" completely, I read with a probability of 90%.  By the way, this also means that you always have to put yourself in the place of your user or client.  It helps a lot in business (: <br>  So, where is the actual money here?  And the money is in the same place as regular e-mail newsletters, only there are more.  Money in your readers.  Yes Yes!  Yesterday, one person made an offer to me, which can increase my income every 3 months for a few months and my goal is to make 3,000 euros a month in principle be real.  And all because he read my blog.  And reads it in RSS.  Yes, the same Adsense can be twisted in RSS.  Although I was disappointed in him, but many still think that you can make money with it. <br>  But not in this happiness.  The happiness is that RSS is convenient.  It is more convenient to read than sites.  Displaying the RSS itself can also be customized as you please.  In the same <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a> , Google Reader can be tuned so that from the original form does not remain a trace.  But the main thing is the happiness of RSS, but the news is read in one place, and you don‚Äôt need to search the sites like ‚Äúfucking rex‚Äù in search of fresh information.  The one who came up with this technology is a revolutionary in time management. <br>  So on all this you can build a good business.  Let's see how.  We will proceed from the fact that you are writing really good and useful content.  As I said, you can embed any information in this content.  Rather, almost any.  Restrictions are still there.  The disadvantage of RSS is that many of the ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of the site are not available here.  For example, the AJAX poll, which I used <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/28/zabytye-metody-i-sekrety-internet-marketinga/">here</a> .  But this is not important in our case. <br>  When you write quality content, hundreds of readers are waiting for your next post.  Then they read it from cover to cover and ... everything (: They stupidly wait for the next post, which will give them enlightenment for a while and the cycle will repeat. BUT! There are about 10% of people who read the post and DO! And they really do about 3% and another 7% are trying to do something. And these people bring the main money. I already said in the <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/22/podkast-1-vvedenie-v-biznes-po-prodazham-vip-servisov/">podcast</a> that it really makes sense to work with only 10% of people. The rest will never achieve anything. It's the same here. <br>  When I post this post, I understand that this post is only useful for 10% of readers.  Only 23 people.  But just one of those 23 people yesterday made an offer that can make me richer and more successful. <br>  I generally accept any suggestions from people.  Interestingly, many remain ‚Äúproposals‚Äù and do not go into action. <br>  So, returning to receive money from RSS.  Do not think about how to cram in RSS ads and more, but more abrupt links.  Until you have at least ten thousand subscribers, you can hardly make money on this.  It will only annoy.  Although I saw a couple of blogs that, along with RSS, ‚Äúmerge‚Äù ads.  But I do not like it.  The main goal of RSS is to give the user what he wants - information.  Advertising user wants to see the least. <br>  In fact, all that needs to be done is to bring the user information on a silver platter.  And "feed" this information from time to time.  I made sure on this with the help of this blog.  If all goes well, then this blog can pay for all my projects together.  Even if I will do only RSS feeds.  If I knew excellent English, I would do the same for the western Internet and the effect would be greater. <br>  Therefore, returning to the sources, I want to say: "Give information to people, spread it in all ways that only come to mind."  Only in this case, you can get a good financial return.  Information today is the most valuable and most important.  Do not forget about it. <br>  <strong>Read more:</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/30/chto-prinosit-maksimalnuyu-pribyl-v-internete/">What makes the most profit on the Internet?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/28/zabytye-metody-i-sekrety-internet-marketinga/">Forgotten methods and secrets of online marketing</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/22/podkast-1-vvedenie-v-biznes-po-prodazham-vip-servisov/">Podcast number 1.</a>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/05/22/podkast-1-vvedenie-v-biznes-po-prodazham-vip-servisov/">Introduction to the business of selling VIP services.</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://z.codeby.net/2007/04/26/slozhno-li-sdelat-dengi-v-internete-na-samom-dele/">Is it difficult to make money on the Internet really?</a> </li></ul></div>
