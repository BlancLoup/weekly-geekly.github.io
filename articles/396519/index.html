Farewell to the gray industrial cardboard, now the HyperX Predator DDR4 RAM is packaged in a box decorated in the classic HyperX design, and through the transparent window you can see one of the modules.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/35f/204/03335f204c7d4af0834e8dba3dca8e42.jpg"><br><br>  The inner space of the box is used with maximum efficiency, everything is packed tightly and nothing dangles.  Included with the modules, the user will find a warranty card (recall that the HyperX Predator RAM is accompanied by a lifetime warranty, and the warranty period for Russia is ten years) and a decorative sticker with the HyperX logo on the front panel of the system unit or on any place that attracted the buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f01/72e/35d/f0172e35d9024614ab9f0848f014cb70.jpg"><br><br>  Externally, the new HyperX Predator DDR4 revision differs not only by changing the decorative design, but also by decreasing the height of the radiator: now it is 42.2 mm against the previous 55 mm. <br>  Thus, despite the fact that the HyperX Predator memory line is primarily aimed at enthusiasts who prefer liquid cooling systems, Kingston has taken into account the wishes and users who use large-size air-cooling systems of the processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a03/c9c/051/a03c9c051d344e34a67d45a597dee37b.jpg"><br><br>  Sometimes, in pursuit of a spectacular view, some memory manufacturers do not wonder about the size of the resulting product, and when the question of increasing the volume arises, it turns out that memory modules do not physically fit in adjacent slots, which forces them to replace modules completely instead of simply adding them.  Fortunately, the engineers at Kingston have taken this moment into account: the HyperX Predator modules are perfectly adjacent to each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e3/539/178/3e3539178b9749c0af90956e6e52319d.jpg"><br><br>  When inspecting the modules themselves, it can be noticed that the contact patch with the thermal pad is incomplete and part of it hangs in a vacuum, as well as the DRAM chips are not completely covered.  But DDR4 memory heats up very poorly and, as testing has shown, no problems with overheating arise even during overclocking. <br><br>  The modules themselves are one-sided, and for ‚Äúequilibrium‚Äù, on the reverse side, a thermal pad with an increased thickness is enclosed under the radiator plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a0/859/e1b/8a0859e1bb4c417ab96e9a30e6b43bc3.jpg"><br><br>  When removing the radiator, you can verify the reliability of the contact thermal spacers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/2d4/791/64d2d4791af8463084c050716e7f135a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f0/cb3/cae/6f0cb3cae882449b81b599bdeccfed57.png"><br><br>  The new HyperX Predator revision uses the latest SK Hynix <b>H5AN4G8NAFR-TFC</b> (Hynix AFR) chips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/037/c56/758/037c56758f4d4069b784441e6a4fbe43.jpg"><br><br>  This is a technical difference from the first revision, where the Hynix MFR series was used.  Thanks to Hynix AFR, it is possible to release kits with a frequency of 3200 and 3333 MHz.  The delay formula has also changed: if the first version of the HyperX Predator worked with the formula ‚Äúx- (x + 1) - (x + 1)‚Äù (for example, 15-16-16), here the formula already looks like ‚Äúx- (x + 2) - (x + 2) "(for example, 16-18-18 for the frequency of 3333 MHz).  Operating voltage remains the same - 1.35 V. <br><br>  Yes, indeed, if you find the appropriate SK Hynix " <a href="https://www.skhynix.com/static/filedata/fileDownload.do%3Fseq%3D323">Q2'2016 DATABOOK</a> " <a href="https://www.skhynix.com/static/filedata/fileDownload.do%3Fseq%3D323">document</a> , you may find that the H5AN4G8NAFR-TFC chips were originally designed to work with an effective frequency of 2133 MHz at a voltage of 1.20 V with delays of 15-15-15.  Not only Kingston is engaged in overclocking in the factory, absolutely all companies that produce high-frequency DDR4 modules are engaged in this, due to the fact that there are no official standards for frequencies above 2400 MHz. <br><br>  I would like to emphasize that work at such frequencies is a matter of purely voluntary, not only for memory chips, but also goes beyond the bounds of all standards of JEDEC and Intel.  In other words, only one set of high-speed memory to acquire a little, used in the assembly of the copies of the motherboard and processor must also be able to work at such frequencies.  So there is nothing surprising in the fact that after assembling the system and manually activating the XMP profile, it is possible to encounter the inoperability of the system - such ‚Äúpunctures‚Äù sometimes occur. <br><br>  In all HyperX Predator DDR4 modules, in addition to the standard SPD profile at 2400 MHz with 17-17-17 delay and 1.2 V voltage, two XMP profiles are stitched: for the nominal frequency and reduced.  For example, in HyperX Predator DDR4-3333, profiles for frequencies 3000 and 3333 MHz are stitched, and in HyperX Predator DDR4-3000 - for 2667 and 3000 MHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/25d/4e0/21025d4e0346496184c2b7a20c1dce8b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c6/3f1/4c3/0c63f14c377a4a829640341e929be5f1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/f2b/1f7/9d1f2b1f706a49afbe3f3376d8660913.png"><br><br>  When installing HyperX Predator DDR4, it is necessary to check the correct installation of the VCCIO CPU and VCCSA CPU voltages by the motherboard, which, in particular, ensure the operation of the memory controller integrated in the processor and the increased values ‚Äã‚Äãof these will ensure stable operation at high memory frequencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ab/9d1/aba/0ab9d1aba9134c3f95a82ae35901fd98.png"><br><br>  Not all motherboards increase these voltages automatically.  With manual configuration, do not overdo it: installing a VCCSA CPU over 1.2 V and a CPU VCCIO over 1.1 V can damage the processor. <br><br>  When overclocking the HyperX Predator DDR4 kit, it was possible to face the individual features of both available Core i5-6600K processors: over 3333 MHz stable operation took place when only two modules were installed (any of which from the kit).  Only in this way was it possible to achieve 3466 MHz while maintaining the nominal voltage on the memory modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/ebc/2d2/2e2ebc2d23e34f459c2f580cb453032d.png"><br><br>  The final overclocking in comparison with the nominal frequency of 3000 MHz was not so significant, but you need to understand that 3466 MHz is in itself a very worthy result.  Especially if we recall that we are talking about a set that was initially overclocked at the factory, and the original chips were designed only for 2400 MHz. <br>  The performance gain of the memory subsystem in comparison with the standard DDR4-2133 frequency was about 30-40%, despite the significantly increased latency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/265/f81/07a265f8189b41a88bbd110c1597bd0f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c1/fd9/511/0c1fd951120e489f89e586208f729095.png"><br><br>  Thus, the enthusiast who bought the Hyper X Predator series memory will get memory not only from the initially high factory frequencies, but also, if necessary, ready to offer additional possibilities for improving performance.  The main thing is that the rest of the system does not turn out to be a ‚Äúweak link‚Äù. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, stay with Kingston on Geektimes.ru! <br><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru/">the company's official website</a> .
