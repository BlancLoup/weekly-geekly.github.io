      It's about the <b><a href="http://mamagps.com/">MamaGPS</a></b> GPS tracker.  The manufacturer's website provides examples of using the device - for <a href="http://www.mamagps.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Dabout-product">children</a> , the <a href="http://www.mamagps.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Delderly">elderly</a> and for <a href="http://www.mamagps.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Dpets">pets</a> .  I will not pull the cat by the tail and list its main features, according to the documentation: <br><br>  - Determination of location at any time <br>  - View location, speed of movement at any time on GoogleMaps maps <br>  - View history of movements on the map <br>  - 4 channels for voice communication <br>  - SOS signaling <br>  - Information transfer both by SMS, and by E-mail (in the format "street, house") <br>  - Message about exceeding the set speed <br>  - Message about entry / exit outside a certain territory <br>  - Service management on the personal page on the Internet <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79c/2d4/227/79c2d4227e27aea3dcd73c2f44b823b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the box is the tracker itself, charging from the network and from the vehicle's cigarette lighter, as well as USB-miniUSB wiring - unfortunately, there is not a software CD or even instructions.  The fact is that the roots of the device grow from the Netherlands, where they do not even suspect the existence of Russia.  Therefore, it may be that the manual is meant to be downloaded from the manufacturer‚Äôs site, but I didn‚Äôt dare to delve into it - nothing is clear anyway. <br><br>  But on the other hand, Ukrainian craftsmen are doing a good job, they are developing a service for these trackers - they have it all in a more understandable language.  Including manual. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The dimensions are very compact - a bit larger than a Zippo lighter;  tracker easily fits in your fist.  Weight with battery less than 100 grams. <br><br>  The front side of the device is made of black glossy plastic, it has a speaker, a power button and a 5-position "circle", about which a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dce/87b/238/dce87b238037c5242470291f66e714ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the sides you can find the SOS buttons ... Why two identical buttons?  That's right, so that the alarm signal is not sent randomly, you need to simultaneously hold two buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ced/de8/325/cedde832506815e144757163547b8ec3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right, you can connect an external antenna behind the rubber plug, and on the left is a microSD port, where you can also write data.  The SOS button on the left side is combined with another button - together they are responsible for the volume level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fd/7e3/954/3fd7e395452de90d7eb3cf6fd75a4acc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is good that the connectors of the device are protected by rubber plugs - practical.  And one more pleasant trifle - holes for fastening the lace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c95/b85/3c7/c95b853c71e948701b8ad4fe9cc39812.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The back cover is almost matte and on one of the ends is its retainer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01e/233/57f/01e23357f7da2f157fa0ac8b99728ce4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/941/377/b0d/941377b0d49e2eabea7f19495e64f104.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside there is a lithium-ion battery for 750 mAh - given that there are no color displays, Wi-Fi and other buns, one charge lasts almost a day to transfer GPS data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54c/a2c/b38/54ca2cb3865cea205349329d80b40ac4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the battery is the IMEI-code and a slot for a SIM-card, through which data will be sent to the network and which will open access to other interesting functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2af/9e3/144/2af9e31445092164bf99fdcc15c783f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  Despite the fact that some examples of using the device were presented on the site, I didn‚Äôt even have thought to ‚Äúhook‚Äù the tracker to the child, the cat or the grandmother - first of all I wanted to beat the script ... with the car.  Recently, I reviewed a rather expensive <b><a href="http://autokadabra.ru/post/38598/">MINI Cooper S</a></b> , on which it was decided to try out the spy thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb5/5b2/e80/eb55b2e802f6fb83ea7e3a1caa657e91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Imagine - you bought a car, and in the salon you were still forced to install an alarm system, even the most incredible, with ‚Äúsatellite tracking‚Äù.  An unclean employee of the salon (or insurer) reports to the side all the information about the car and the security system, which greatly facilitates the work of the hijackers.  Those leave on your car, requesting a full-time system, without even suspecting that ... you, without violating any guarantees, interventions in the design of the car and without other problems, put up your little ‚Äúplug-in‚Äù) This can be done just a minute after leaving the salon, no one informing.  No, on arrival in a quiet place, it will not be difficult for craftsmen to find a tracker, disable it and throw it out the window, but all the information will already be online. <br>  The minicar has a nice bonus in the luggage compartment - the second ‚Äúcigarette lighter‚Äù hid there inconspicuously, into which you can plug in anything (for example, an inverter or pump) - it was a sin not to plug in the charge from the device;  The tracker itself was hidden in a small cutout designed for the first-aid kit.  As a result, almost nothing betrayed the presence of a foreign device, while the tracker itself became completely autonomous in terms of power supply (not counting the Internet).  Pale, yes, but the hijackers will hardly climb under the hood or in the trunk - of course, they will drive off first, and only then ... But the whole charm is that you will be able to drive after your car without delay waiting for slow employees in the alarm service - unless, of course, the tracker's GPS signal is muted.  In general, the whole script for the film, but as it turned out, everything works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/8a8/95b/8f88a895b0f3694c1cf82fb44dcba49c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the case of me, I drove 700km from Moscow to the legendary city of Uryupinsk in the Volgograd region.  The trip was 8 hours - the tracker silently worked autonomously in the glove compartment for all this time (if you consider that the device can work autonomously for up to 20 hours, you could find the car not only in Uryupinsk, but also in the more distant sub-Moscow region, for example, somewhere in Yekaterinburg or even Omsk).  Without noise and dust, the tracker ‚Äúburned‚Äù our route with a fairly high accuracy - at least in some places the trajectory of our movement coincided to a meter.  But it's better that way than nothing at all, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfd/938/2f1/dfd9382f1a346ee3df242e596e341fa4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41a/b78/687/41ab786879f1c4ff6cd46563b23eaa48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are some inaccuracies along the route itself - perhaps this is due to the speed and the fact that the tracker was hidden in the bowels of the cabin (this can be solved by installing an external antenna).  When the tracker was in the pocket, the signal was transmitted much more accurately, as evidenced by the trajectory of movement in the park: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dda/472/1e8/dda4721e86ddee6b82ebbf761e3be855.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or one more ‚Äútest‚Äù - I asked a friend to drive off in any direction by car (with a tracker in the glove compartment) and stop.  Armed with a netbook and an egg from an iota, I found a sly and contented face in neighboring courtyards - already 10 minutes later, walking on foot. <br><br>  All of this - screenshots of the map in GoogleMaps, where the tracker in a couple of clicks can export its data.  If you wish, you can <b><a href="http://bit.ly/93FV3W">see the route</a></b> yourself.  Everything is convenient and very clear - almost like in the movies :) <br><br>  Here is a video for clarity: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ck829BKvsTY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpuqBFEcit5jKD20FZjzZ6ghFSLQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If, however, to discard all the bad thoughts, then this device can still be useful where many.  For cyclists (to memorize the route and share it with friends), for photographers (to overlay geo-data on pictures), just for travelers ... but where there are many.  And, of course, to control children and the elderly, who occasionally know how to tickle nerves - as you can see, the tracker will greatly facilitate their search.  The only strange thing is that a cover with a carabiner or something else is not included - now the only reliable option is to put the device in a zip pocket. <br><br>  As for the other functions, in my opinion, less useful. <br><br>  On board the device there is a slot for a microSD card - there, if you insert a card, the tracker will write the GPS data that it sends to the server.  It is useful if the SIM card runs out of network access money - the data will not be lost, later they can be exported to the system.  For one thousand kilometers, the tracker recorded data on 48kb and another 500kb of some system data, such as ‚ÄúFasten, send data to the server!‚Äù. <br><br>  There are 4 buttons in front - in the administration panel of the tracker you can attach 4 numbers to them for an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù.  Pressing two SOS buttons at the same time, an SMS with the tracker's coordinates (address ‚Äústreet, house‚Äù) is sent to the phone first in the SOS-list and at the same time a voice call.  Incoming calls are accompanied by a funny ringtone. <br><br>  In addition to the SMS, you can call the specified phones - just press the desired button and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  For conversation, there is an external speaker, volume control buttons and even a jack for a wired headset - it is hidden on top of a rubber cap. <br>  There is a small undocumented possibility of fine tuning the device.  So, for example, one of the commands (they are sent via SMS) allows the tracker not to start a new GPRS session every time the connection is lost - this will lead to non-weak saving of money, and the operator will not round up the smallest session until the numbers are favorable to him (for this case, the tracker has a cache so that the data is not lost).  After the trip to Uryupinsk and back the balance on the SIM-card was 191.48 rubles - buying a SIM-card (Megaphone Login), I put on it with a margin of 200 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae8/d63/92a/ae8d6392a747fd750c9b011a12a94a35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the web interface, it is good enough.  The map on which the path of movement of the selected tracker is plotted (there may be several registered trackers on the account). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c1/981/6f4/1c19816f4b08a888cf3700d7b2ee562a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Top - menu with different settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/374/721/6ac/3747216acdedc54cdf1b553d156a74d6.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e2/19d/4c2/7e219d4c22cd6122f99912cf0b24fdc5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The time and the coordinates of the movement are shown on the right - you can select any period of time and see the trajectory for this period.  All coordinates can be exported to GoogleMaps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d0/300/efc/4d0300efcb725bd2429f2d57b6d3dc05.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you wish, you can set ‚Äúgreen zones‚Äù, upon exit from which (or upon entry to which) the tracker will send an alarm SMS message to the phone specified in the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62d/940/efd/62d940efd32f66ff23f7ca84fbe5ca8a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Very cool in general.
