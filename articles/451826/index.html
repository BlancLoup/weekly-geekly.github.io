This approach is called ‚Äúirrational marketing moves‚Äù or ‚Äúabsurd hypotheses‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gwGRRGaEMo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Watch the video and read the notes under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In his report, Mikhail Trutnev shared his vision:

    <ul><li>  Why do absurd ideas work? </li><li>  Four absurd marketing ideas for the first user session in the paid part of the product </li><li>  Two rules for teams working on paradoxical ideas. </li></ul><br><h3>  People make irrational decisions </h3><br>  Why do absurd, illogical and paradoxical ideas work?  First of all, they work because people make irrational decisions.  Earlier, I thought that when making decisions, people follow some arguments.  In fact this is not true. <br><br>  Let's imagine.  When you choose a friend, you are not guided by such rational arguments as: he is polite, kind, treats parents well.  You subconsciously understand: "This is my man."  The same goes for choosing a girl, boy, car or house.  We just see - this is my car, this is my man. <br><br>  Often people choose and buy products according to this very logic.  Referring to the transactional analysis, where it is explained that the decision of a person is not due to the moment when he already makes a decision, but by the scenario or the story he got at that moment.  And, accordingly, absurd ideas are ideas that fall into this very scenario, which is incomprehensible even to the person himself. <br><br>  By applying this approach, we have obtained a multiple growth of the user and financial metrics in the product.  In my report I will talk about four main ideas. <br><br><h3>  The first idea is not to tell the user about the value of the product. </h3><br>  What does this mean in terms of experiment?  The more arguments or values ‚Äã‚Äãin the direction of your product or any decision, the less importance of the first argument. <br><br>  If you have one powerful argument in favor of buying your product - leave it all.  As in the example of Ultimate Guitar Landing (see below), just one argument: ‚Äúthe easiest way to learn and play songs on the guitar.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tx/i2/gx/txi2gxawu7goclbh9y-de8wqthw.png"><br><br>  It is not written about the largest catalog, it is not written that your song can be here.  Nothing is written at all.  Simple - the easiest way to learn and play.  And it works. <br><br>  Another option is to say nothing about the value of the product. <br><br>  On the image (see below) our other service is for musicians who play by the notes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/bs/gd/zybsgdykqtpzuehw7pf4o3air3o.png"><br><br>  On the page at the top there is a Start Free Trial button.  (Note * for clarity of the example, I highlighted the button with a pink gradient and placed it in the center, on the website, of course, this is not the case). <br><br>  In this case, we don‚Äôt say anything about why the user should buy the product; we don‚Äôt show any value.  The person is on the free part of the product, he studies the notes of ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù and suddenly sees the Start Free Trial button without demonstrating the value of the product.  Just written Start Free Trial and it works. <br><br>  We recall the transactional analysis.  If a person has already decided that he will buy a paid version, then he does not need to interfere, no need to explain anything.  Faith does not require any evidence.  Try a person who believes in God to convince that there is no God.  Or vice versa.  This does not work.  Also here.  If a person already believes that he needs to buy - do not interfere, do not explain anything, just let him buy. <br><br><h3>  The second idea is not to show the product to the user. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d5/tv/sa/d5tvsaxm9tapeoxdswtwpp5updg.png"><br><br>  After the user has clicked Start Free Trial, the purchase process begins without displaying the product itself.  If we think that we are in an irrational scenario, when a person has already decided that he will buy it, then do not confuse him with your product.  Maybe he will start watching the product and he will not like it. <br><br>  And another example about a mobile application. <br><br>  We make 68% of purchases in mobile applications on tour (onboarding). <br><br>  68% of our users purchases are made at the moment when a person has not seen the product.  Onboarding begins after the user has already downloaded the application. <br><br>  In the image below you can see our onboarding.  One guitar player in the background and nothing about the product - neither about songs, nor about notes, nor about the catalog.  Just a set of questions about which we will talk later.  Again, do not show the product and get a higher conversion in Trial or in purchases.  The authorship of this approach was suggested to me by Mikhail Tokovinin, who makes amoCRM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-h/am/ft/-hamftz8pmde18srgvaudr-osek.png"><br><br><h3>  The third idea is to remove the feature description and product features. </h3><br>  You and I are used to describing in detail the features and advantages of the product.  The idea is not to do this. <br><br>  Let's return to the onboarding mobile app Ultimate Guitar.  This approach in onboarding converts well. <br><br>  What really interests people?  They themselves, of course.  People are only interested in people, so our entire onboarding is about man.  They ask him: ‚ÄúChoose the instrument that you play on;  choose your favorite genre;  Choose the songs you like. ‚Äù  I‚Äôm almost 100% sure when people go round the touring, they think that our application adapts to these issues. <br><br>  Thus, we do not tell the user about the functions in the application, and we give him the opportunity to think through ourselves that we have it.  He answers questions about himself, and we get a high conversion. <br><br>  There is one more thing that works.  We have user information.  If we know that this user has visited a certain song, then we will indicate this song in the sales layer of onboarding, so the conversion also increases. <br><br><h3>  The fourth idea is to lure the user in a big payment. </h3><br>  For us it is important that the user bought the most expensive annual plan.  Why?  We know from data and analytics that the person who invested more money in our product is more involved, plays more music, plays more, means more pleasure from our product and most importantly from his hobby. <br><br>  This is a win win solution.  Therefore, we are doing everything so that as many people as possible buy exactly a long and expensive plan.  He, conditionally, dear.  Actually, the dear is a monthly one: the user will buy a monthly plan, will not be engaged, will not come to the application, and his money will be wasted.  And the money he spends on the annual plan is more likely to bring him a return. <br><br>  There is still win win win approach.  When the user takes a yearly plan without trial.  Because during the trial, people are also quite relaxed about their investments and may not come into the application. <br><br>  More product marketing reports available at the <a href="http://ttps//youtu.be/1gwGRRGaEMo">@epicgrowth</a> Telegram Channel. <br><br>  Epic Growth Conference (www.egconf.ru) is a product marketing conference organized by Mobio and Getloyal with the support of myTracker, Minimob and AppMetrica. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451826/</a></p>
