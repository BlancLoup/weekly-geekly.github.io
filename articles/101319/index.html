But the development of two guys from Kazan, with whom I met almost by chance (they found out on Twitter that I had flown in), I was pleasantly surprised - they thought of working out something that I had never even thought about working out.  However, you already understood everything from the title. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/964/e65/7c0/964e657c064a1bc86efd9545e3415161.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meet: Arthur Abdulin (chief engineer) and Ildar Gaynanov (CEO) - the creators of the Speechphone, an innovative warning system installed in the access intercoms: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d3f/f38/a74/d3ff38a7454c502d1bb4ddb1676fe2c5.jpg">

      I will not beat around the bush - in some detail the principle of the system‚Äôs operation is described in their promotional video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMGkuGRSenY&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlvhhuJ0wCPktqL_Kz_Oh5nxcwFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù of this system, where I looked at the living example of how everything works, and also found out what the administration panel looks like. <br><br>  Inside the Speakphone module (in the first photo) there is a motherboard with a special software.  Everything is connected to the doorphone device and allows audio informational messages to be broadcast through the doorphone speaker.  The module simply intercepts the control digital and analog intercom signals (the moments of opening and closing of the door, as well as the call of the subscriber through the intercom handset) are recognized - these events are accepted by the system as the beginning of the message broadcast. <br><br>  According to the creators, the device can be crossed with almost any model of intercom, which is installed in Russia.  After installing the module, the intercom continues to operate as usual, but acquires new features. <br><br>  At a minimum - you can change the melody to something more pleasant - instead of the regular pilican, people put something more melodic instead.  During the test, we turned off a non-standard melody, and the first tenant remarked: ‚Äú <i>Eh, where did the good melody go? !!</i>  " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/960/bc5/bd1/960bc5bd1b187b2505d8502e6e63194a.jpg"><br><br>  Music is music, but instead there may be other alerts - any socially important (the selection and preparation of broadcast information is carried out with the participation of housing and communal services, responsible ministries and departments) for up to 8 seconds.  ‚ÄúHot water will be turned off from Monday to Wednesday‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou have rent arrears, payment until the end of the month‚Äù, ‚ÄúElections will be held on Friday, your polling station will be 123‚Äù, or something else there will be plenty of options. <br><br>  But it is possible, pah-pah-pah, that one day the device will have to work according to its main purpose - informing the public about emergency situations and other troubles.  Fire?  The intercom starts ringing, the tubes inside the apartments, by the way, can too.  Has a chemical plant exploded?  In this case, notify the house in the "risk zone" is not a problem.  And believe me, this will work better than a radio alert (which no one is listening to), on a television (which no one is watching), or on a telephone (which is not everyone‚Äôs room).  Not to mention the catch phrase ‚ÄúWere we supposed to get around everyone? !!‚Äù ... <br><br>  Moreover, in apartment buildings one of the intercoms is proposed to be painted in red - from such an intercom with ‚Äú112V‚Äù it will be possible to make a free emergency call to talk with the operator.  Such devices are planned to be additionally equipped with a video camera (external or inside the intercom) - including in order to cut off some of the false calls from homegrown bullies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/169/5a8/fd1/1695a8fd1eeb84c3c3f1b62b9d7383bd.jpg"><br><br>  Network exchange protocol allows you to transfer messages remotely using GPRS or Ethernet connection.  At the same time, for the operation of the system in the ‚ÄúEmergency‚Äù mode (in case of failure of the standard data transmission channels), developers are designing advanced modules with built-in technology for transmitting information via a Wi-Fi channel.  It is implied that such an improvement will allow, in the absence of a signal, to organize independently into a flexible network in which each module will work not only with the terminal apparatus, but also with a repeater - a router for the remaining modules (located within a radius of 100 meters).  That is, the Emergency Call 112 function will work all the time, which means that even in the event of a serious cataclysm and a failure of cellular communication and the Internet, people will still be able to call the emergency service, ambulance and the police. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/myTV2whM4fw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgh4L0GKIDb7wijFsIn0ebqRWh6yA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <s>The whole botnet</s> The entire network of intercoms is administered through a web interface, the capabilities of which are already pretty good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8b6/4c5/554/8b64c55546abae9181ba48e082fee26f.jpg"><br><br>  We select the necessary house and porch on the map, and then we set up the intercom: each has about 30 ‚Äúslots‚Äù for audio files that can be programmed quite flexibly (depending on the action performed by the resident, time of day, etc.).  Here is how the device works live: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uaOGicqYK8g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhWT1w3NFCzIsLlaF3OsdREmftSpQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At present, only a small part of residential buildings in the Vakhitovsky and Privolzhsky districts of Kazan are equipped with Speakphones, although the project organizers have plans to cover not only all districts of the capital of Tatarstan, but also other Russian cities.  And something tells me that they will succeed: the rescue services are very interested in technology, they have allocated some money for development, etc.  So far, the system is sharpened specifically for ‚Äúrescue needs‚Äù, so the development of ‚Äúuser chips‚Äù has faded into the background.  But it would be cool to have your ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù (or even a mobile application) from which you could set up an intercom for yourself.  At the exit, ‚ÄúKey-documents-iron, cork 4 points‚Äù, and at the entrance - ‚ÄúMatch Spartak-CSKA at 21:00 on the first channel‚Äù ... Well, or offer your scripts in the comments - perhaps they will inspire the creators. <br><br>  Someone will ask - what does this thing have to do with MegaFon, since the article about it appeared in the framework of a special project?  Everything is simple: a good GPRS channel is required for the operation of the Speechphone, which Megafon provides and that - all the transmitted information comes through the operator's network from the Speechphone server.  However, it seems as in these devices there is a slot for a backup SIM card, which allows the device to stay connected even in case of any malfunctions at the main operator. <br><br>  Some more details about the project are on the <a href="http://speakphone.ru/">official website</a> and in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Wikipedia</a> . <br><br>  Guys, let's go to us on Habr - you have something to tell!  ;) <br><br>  The remaining posts of our "historical" <a href="http://ad.adriver.ru/cgi-bin/click.cgi%3Fsid%3D1%26ad%3D417569%26bt%3D21%26bid%3D2841701%26bn%3D2841701%26rnd%3D1408440764">special project</a> : <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5812/">Anatomy of the mast connection</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/192638/">The history of mail development</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/193090/">About Morse Code</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5830/">Telegraph history</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5866/">Thanks to radiophysics</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5858/">The history of the advent of radio</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5850/">LTE in Kazan.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5850/">Universiade</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5764/">LTE in St. Petersburg</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5836/">LTE in Yekaterinburg</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/megafon/4g/post/5766/">Overview of LTE Devices</a> <br><br>  <font color="#e6e6e6"><b>! important: The</b> article does not pretend to the completeness and accuracy of all data.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101319/</a></p>
