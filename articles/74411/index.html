At the moment, when mentioning the term, it makes sense to consider flights on the <i>ISS</i> and suborbital flights on the <i>SpaceShipOne</i> (June 21, 2004) and <i>SpaceShipTwo</i> (ticket sales in Russia began on June 23, 2008, and tests of the ship began this year) <i>Virgin Galactic</i> . <br><br>  Let's start with the last. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The name of <i>Richard Branson</i> at the hearing of all more or less interested in the topic, without diminishing his merit is to say that Mr. <i>Branson is</i> just a businessman, although very talented.  I think that no one will tell about himself better than himself, so I attach his autobiography to the article.

This historic flight has allowed <i>Bert to</i> win the <b>X-Prize</b> , established by <b><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Peter Diamandis</a></b> , and this is nothing less <i>than $ 10 million.</i> <br><br>  <i>Bert Rutan is a</i> classic genius from the aircraft design department, who already <i>in eight years</i> <b>(!)</b> Built a working model of an aircraft of his own design, and at 16 he made his first independent flight as a pilot.  <i>Scaled Composites</i> , the company of <i>Bert</i> , is engaged in translating the plans of a genius into life.  <i>SpaceShipTwo</i> , like its predecessor, <i>SpaceShipOne</i> , was built by her, this year the trials began, and <i>commercial launches are planned for 2011</i> . <br><br><h3>  And at this time in orbit ... </h3><br><br><h4>  year 2001 </h4><br><h4>  Dennis Anthony Tito </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/dentit.jpg" align="right" alt="tito"><br>  Born August 8, 1940 in New York.  In 1962, he graduated from the College of Engineering at the University of New York and received a bachelor's degree in astronautics and aeronautics.  From 1963 he worked as an aerospace engineer in the <i>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</i> .  Participated in the flight program of automatic stations to Mars and Venus.  Engaged in ballistic flights of interplanetary stations of the type <i>"Mariner"</i> . <br><br>  In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree (engineering technology) from the Rensaler Polytechnic Institute.  In 1970, he completed a training course at the Aderson School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles to receive a Ph.D. in financial activities.  In 1972, he founded <i>Wilshire Associates Inc.</i>  in Santa Monica, California.  Currently, this company is a leading service provider in the field of management, consulting and technology investment. <br><br>  In 2000, he was going to fly to the <i>Mir station</i> , but did not grow together, our government decided to flood it.  As you know, the money was spent a lot, so on December 28 of the same year it was included in the main crew of the first Russian expedition visiting the <i>ISS</i> . <br><br>  In the period from February 12 to April 10, 2001, I was preparing for flight as part of the main crew of the <b>ISS-T1</b> . <br><br>  In the summer of 2003, he was included on the board of the <b>X-Prize Foundation</b> . <br><br><h4>  2002 </h4><br><h4>  Mark Shuttleworth </h4><br><br>  Regarding Mark I will not be sprayed in detail, for wikipedia knows <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA">it</a> .  And on Habr√© it is generally <i>persona grata</i> .  Although something is certainly worth telling. <br><br>  He basically earned his fortune by selling consulting firm <i>Thawte</i> , which he had created during his last year at the university, in which he had been working for four years. <br><br>  As a fairly wealthy and very generous person, Mark is actively engaged in financing social projects and free software in South Africa, taking for example <b>Freedom Toaster</b> , a network of kiosks in different cities where free software is recorded on a <i>CD to</i> all who need it. <br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/norm.jpg" align="right" alt="norman"><br>  In 2000, he formed a venture group called <b>HBD</b> (an abbreviation of the phrase <i>‚ÄúHere Be Dragons‚Äù</i> , which, according to legends, indicated white spots on old maps).  This group seeks to invest in innovative South African companies with global potential.  Dragon <i>Norman</i> is the talisman of <i>HBD Venture Capital</i> . <br><br>  On April 25, 2002, he fulfilled his cherished dream by flying into space aboard the <b>Soyuz TM-34 spacecraft</b> .  During the flight, he conducted four experiments devoted to the study of stem cells, muscle training in space, measurement of metabolism and protein crystallization. <br><br><h3>  " </h3><br> <code>        .            .      ,       .     ,  ,  ,         .   ,             ,           . <br> <br> ,  ,         ,    ,   ,     ,     . ,     ,    ,       .</code> <br> <h3>  " </h3><br><br><h4>  2005 year </h4><br><h4>  Gregory Olsen </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/grols.jpg" align="left" alt="olsen"><br>  And this gentleman became rich even when many of those who read this article walked under the table.  And <i>Gregory Olsen</i> considered the development and production of high-precision equipment (infrared cameras, various sensors, artificial crystals, etc.) and earned his capital on the very fact that neither is a high-tech business region. <br><br>  At the moment he is the president and chairman of the board of directors of <i>Sensors Unlimited Inc.</i>  , one of the founders of which is. <br><br>  From the entire list, one of the most controversial <i>‚Äútourists‚Äù</i> , the path to the stars for which was very thorny (here the film‚Äôs name and this article, <i>‚ÄúThrough thorns to the stars‚Äù</i> , fit like nothing :) since it was originally planned for the 2005 spring expedition, then the plans were going to be replayed by including it on the autumn expedition of 2004, after which the <i>Roscosmos</i> bureaucratic machine misfired, or even the transfer of its flight was a rumor, now it is not known, and not so important. <br><br>  As a result, in the spring of 2004 he passed a medical examination for admission to special training during which he was rejected by the servants of the syringe and enema.  After some time, comrades in white coats took pity or Mr. Olsen's health recovered extremely quickly (it is also not clear how so?), And it was recommended to include him in the main crew of <b>the Soyuz TMA-7</b> .  And again the medical board for admission, but this time everything went fine. <br><br>  After a rather long special training with one space ‚Äútourist‚Äù in the world, there was more, and the treasury replenished <i>$ 20 million</i> . <br><br><h3>  " </h3><br> <code>      ,   ,     .     ,     ‚Ä¶</code> <br> <h3>  " </h3><br><br><h4>  2006 </h4><br><h4>  Anyusha Ansari </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/ansari.jpg" align="right" alt="ansari"><br>  The key role in the fate of this heroine of the article was played by the decision of the parents who sent her at the age of eighteen to the states where she received a good education and later remained there to live. <br><br>  After marriage, <i>Anyusha turned</i> her head into the family business (in 1993, <i>Ansari</i> founded <i>Telecom Technologies, Inc.</i> ), as a <i>CVO</i> .  After 7 years, the sale of the company turned to the Ansari family a grand scandal in which the buyer ( <i>Sonus Networks</i> ) accused them of insider trading. <br><br>  Mrs. Ansari‚Äôs biography is also active in the <b>X-Prize</b> , with the <i>Ansari</i> family becoming the <i>title sponsor of the</i> prize, and the trophy itself was renamed <b>Ansari X-Prize</b> . <br><br>  On September 18, 2006, the ship on board of which our heroine was successfully launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome, and <i>Anyusha Ansari</i> became the first cosmic (or rather orbital :) <i>blogger</i> . <br><br><h3>  " </h3><br> <code>-      ,       ‚Ä¶        .     ‚Ä¶             .    ,      ‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶   ‚Ä¶    ,      ‚Äî    ‚Ä¶</code> <br> <h3>  " </h3><br><br><h4>  2007 </h4><br><h4>  Charles Simon (Carol Simon) </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/chsaim.jpg" align="left" alt="simon"><br>  You can easily write a whole book about this person, but unfortunately there is a format, so I will limit myself to a few.  Of the entire list, <i>Charles</i> is the nicest, although this is, of course, a moot point.  Below I will simply list some things that confirm this. <br><br>  He started programming at school, after which he began to work in his specialty (it sounds a bit strange, because at that time he officially didn‚Äôt have it).  A few years later, Mr. <i>Simony</i> laid the foundation for the existence of today's caste of <i>‚Äúoffice plankton‚Äù</i> , developing the <i>‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù of</i> all modern office suites - the text editor <b>Bravo</b> in the IT forge <b>Xerox PARC</b> . <br><br>  After some time, he began working at <i>Microsoft</i> , where he worked for 21 years.  During this time, he visited various posts, participated in the development of most products and internal standards of the company, for example, the <i>Hungarian notation</i> (hello to programmers) - his work (good or not) is not the topic of this article).  He left the corporation in 2002 in order to create his company <i>Intentional Software</i> . <br><br>  In addition to the brilliant programming career, <i>Charles is a</i> very versatile person.  He is a member of the <i>National Engineering Academy of the USA</i> , an honorary doctor of the University of Pecs in Hungary, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  In 2006 he was awarded the Order <i>of Merit</i> in his homeland. <br><br>  Here's a nerd, right?  Here and not only, <i>Charles Simon is a</i> licensed pilot of multi-engine aircraft, jet planes and helicopters, who by the end of 2006 had flown more than 2,000 hours. <br><br>  Of all the <i>"tourists",</i> he was the only one on the <i>ISS</i> twice, in 2007 and this year. <br><br><h4>  2008 </h4><br><h4>  Richard Garriot </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/rigar.jpg" align="right" alt="garriot"><br>  Here, too, writing a lot is just silly in a wiki about him a rather detailed <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%258D%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">dossier</a> . <br><br>  This <i>"tourist"</i> decided to fly into space even when he was a boy (in the USSR, however, all the boys wanted to be astronauts), and there were good reasons for this, because Richard's father is also an astronaut.  In fact, <i>Garriot</i> is a real <i>‚Äúlucky‚Äù person</i> , nature has awarded him a rare talent, the ability to create worlds, and he was able to turn his hobby into a profitable business with the main milestones of which can be found in the wiki article. <br><br>  <i>Richard Garriott</i> is the <i>"dad" of</i> the <b>Ultima</b> gaming universe, including one of the first <b>MMORPGs</b> - <b>Ultima</b> <i>Online</i> .  In some way, he had a hand in the <i>‚ÄúLine‚Äù</i> (here I just refrain from commenting, get up from the table and clap my hands in a token of appreciation). <br><br>  In connection with the main theme of the article, it is worth mentioning that <i>Garriot</i> is the owner of a copy of the first Earth satellite and the first Soviet lunar rover (which is really on the Moon :), and also serves on the Board of Trustees of <b>X-Prize</b> and the Board of Directors of Space Adventures. <br><br>  On October 12, 2008, Mr. <i>Garriott</i> officially became the second person in the family who was in space.  During the orbital flight, it was the first of the <i>"tourists"</i> to carry out commercial experiments in orbit related to the crystallization of proteins. <br><br><h3>  " </h3><br> <code>         .      ,      ,     . ,     ,         ‚Ä¶</code> <br> <h3>  " </h3><br><br><h4>  year 2009 </h4><br><h4>  Guy Laliberte and Charles Simon (above) </h4><br><br><img src="http://sprockets.ru/pic/glal.jpg" align="left" alt="gi"><br>  <i>Guy is the</i> most unusual and outlandish visitor of the <i>ISS</i> , whom you can imagine.  Just look at the headlines - <i>‚ÄúClown in Orbit‚Äù</i> , etc. <br><br>  In fact, <i>Guy is a</i> fifty <i>-</i> year <i>-</i> old boy who continues to have fun and fool around his entire adult life, but, like many other gifted people, he was able to put talent into his service. <br><br>  At 25, he and his group of like-minded people created their own circus - the <i>Circus of the Sun</i> , and this is not as easy as you might think, because circus artists are mostly caste, their entire profession is shrouded in mystery, the secrets of the profession have been passed on from parents to children and Most of the less well-known circus figures belong to the old dynasties of circus performers. <br><br>  He was the first to achieve a unique fusion of cultures and circus genres.  From the very beginning of the circus, he heads the <s>creative</s> creative group of the circus and participates in the creation of each show, trying to raise circus performances to the rank of high art. <br><br>  He is also very calm about the attempts to videotape his shows, since no matter how high definition video it is, he is simply unable to convey the full range of sensations arising in the process of watching performances by <i>Cirque du Soleil</i> artists. <br><br>  In the not too distant 2007, <i>Guy</i> founded the <a href="http://www.onedrop.org/ru"><b>One</b> <i>Drop</i></a> charity foundation, which fights poverty around the world, providing residents of different countries with constant access to drinking water. <br><br><h3>  " </h3><br> <code>    ,   ,      - ‚Ä¶ ,    ,    -.      ,       .</code> <br> <h3>  " </h3><br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br><br>  I think no one will argue that each of the heroes of this article is an extraordinary, talented and interesting person who has something to learn and we are lucky to be their contemporaries. <br><br>  <b>Now drop everything and go to fulfill your dreams,</b> <br><br>  <b>and may the Force be with you!</b>  [ <code>¬©  </code> ] <br><br>  <b>Files for the article:</b> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://sprockets.ru/files/teryaya_nevinnost.pdf">Autobiography of</a> Richard Branson <br>  ‚Üí Themed <a href="">wallpapers</a> . <br><br>  <b>To this topic:</b> <br><br>  ‚Üí Mark Shuttleworth <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/">Home Page</a> , <br>  ‚Üí One of the best <a href="http://www.astronaut.ru/">sites</a> about space, <br>  ‚Üí About cosmotourism on the website of <a href="http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art1848.htm">the World of Science Fiction magazine</a> <br>  ‚Üí Internet magazine <a href="http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/">"Astronautics News"</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74411/</a></p>
