  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to do novice specialist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, in technical forums (for example, <a href="http://developers.org.ua/">preschool educational institutions</a> ) you can find a large number of posts from novice specialists with questions about what to do or where to start in order to find a job with no real experience.  The reason is quite simple - the crisis, because of which companies are not in a hurry to acquire new employees without experience.  Honestly, I am tired of answering such questions, so I will try to describe everything in one article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Try yourself in freelance </h4><br>  The first thing that advises young professionals is to go to freelancing.  I am skeptical about this advice because it will be very difficult for a young specialist to win a project.  The reasons are as follows: you need to know English, be able to realistically assess your knowledge and possible labor costs, understand the rules of labor exchanges, etc.  I will not say that this is not realistic, but I will say that it is difficult.  There are also advantages: the ability to work independently, development in several directions. <br><br><h4>  Participate in an open source project </h4><br>  This is the second most popular advice to young professionals.  I think that the advice is good, but not applicable to all.  For a serious open source project, experience is also needed; for other projects, options are possible.  You can fix bugs, write some features, customize for yourself.  I can‚Äôt say exactly about the advantages and disadvantages here, because I didn‚Äôt study it myself, but I don‚Äôt have friends who started from open source.  But the main thing is that there is such an option too. <br><br><h4>  Write your project </h4><br>  In my opinion, the best way to get the first experience is probably because he himself began that way.  You need to invent a project for yourself and implement it, put it somewhere on a free hosting service and ask your older colleagues to "kick it".  For colleagues, this will be a trifling matter, and you will get an objective view from the outside.

    <h4>  Offer your services for free </h4><br>  This may be freelancing, a university project, a small commercial job - it does not matter.  The important thing is that the one who gives you the job will think in the following way ‚Äúdo it ‚Äî well, do not do it ‚Äî I won't lose anything‚Äù.  Sometimes I see such announcements on the forums - ‚ÄúI will do it for a tick in the portfolio‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will do it for experience‚Äù.  The only rule - do not jump, if you agreed to work. <br><br><h4>  Participate in conferences </h4><br>  Again, I recommend this method to everyone, since it is a quick step to get knowledge in a compressed form, get acquainted and communicate with professionals, formulate a plan for further actions and just have a nice time. <br><br><h4>  Participate in user groups </h4><br>  Practically in any city there are user groups.  For a junior, this is generally a great chance to prove yourself.  You can ask all your questions and get answers to them, try yourself in the role of speaker, light up in front of employers. <br><br><h4>  Create a personal blog and write quality articles. </h4><br>  Method tested.  Write quality material, deal with the new framework, write a review, a comparative description, share experience (experience can be successful and not successful) and after a while you will be approached with job offers.  The main thing here is to be consistent and patient.  And most importantly - the material should be interesting. <br><br><h4>  Participate in promotions, contests and other events. </h4><br>  This can give you a lot of experience, help you get acquainted with the organizers and sponsors (who are just looking for future employees among the participants).  Well, if you still find yourself in the winners, then the chance to get a job is almost one hundred percent. <br><br><h4>  Find a Friend Specialist </h4><br>  Offer him cooperation - you help him with routine work, he helps you with tips and materials.  You can do this through ICQ, Skype or through forums.  Ask questions, even if they seem stupid to you - a normal person will not send you and will not offend, because he understands that he himself was once the same. <br><br><h4>  Read quality resources </h4><br>  Subscribe to news of popular sites on your subject, participate in discussions, share materials.  This will help you to keep abreast of events, to receive quality information. <br><br><h4>  Write a resume and send to employers </h4><br>  The resume should be well-written, be sure to check the spelling.  Ask senior colleagues to look at the resume before sending it so that HTML doesn't accidentally appear in the ‚Äúprogramming languages‚Äù column. <br><br>  Nobody has canceled luck and luck.  Perhaps your resume will fall into the right soil and you will get a job. <br><br>  These tips are not universal, but can give some guidance to novice specialists.  But there is the most important advice: <i>set a goal for yourself and go to it</i> .  And then all the other tips you may not need. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74726/</a></p>
