  <section class="page js-page"><h1>11 reasons to put on your bike eczo.bike electrification kit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A group of Russian engineers developed eczo.bike, a bicycle electrification kit that helps to drive on steep hills thanks to a powerful central motor (2kW) and drive long distances, up to 100 km, on one battery charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c69/aed/362/c69aed362ac445b8a4b04a721cff0e1e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Bicycle with a motor - an ambiguous phenomenon, which according to some cyclists kills the whole point of this two-wheeled transport.  However, despite the skepticism of the supporters of the ‚Äúpure‚Äù pedal torsion, electric jets and electric kits for ordinary bicycles become more and more. <br><br>  We will talk about the benefits you can get by turning your regular bike into an electric bike.

      <b>1. Go further - up to 80 km.</b>  You live in a big city and still think whether to go to work by bicycle through the whole city.  Put an electrokit and you can drive 15-20 km to work and back, easily, without even sweating. <br><br>  <b>2. Easy to drive up the hill.</b>  Even the coolest slides can now be overcome without acceleration and without effort.  This is true both in cities with difficult terrain, and on rough terrain. <br><br>  <b>3. Arrange cycling trips.</b>  Now you can go from one city to another, go on long bike trips, even if you do not have enough physical training.  Removable spare battery will extend your route twice. <br><br>  <b>4. Spend more time with the second half.</b>  How often does a bicycle cause contention in couples, where someone wants to drive and climb slides, and someone does not?  Elektrokit brings together and converts joint skating in a really pleasant pastime. <br><br>  <b>5. Feel the speed and drive.</b>  Even if you do not have enough physical fitness or have health restrictions.  The wind in your ears, the sinking of heart from delight, are now available to you when you turn the throttle.  Want to enhance the effect, pedal. <br><br>  <b>6. Bicycle in your pocket.</b>  The application turns the bike into a full gadget.  You can track the location, monitor tire pressure, block the engine, exercise cruise control while driving. <br><br>  <b>7. Do not be afraid that the bike will be stolen.</b>  The three-stage protection system allows you not to worry about the bike with the kit: the position of the bike is always monitored through the application, the kit is turned on only with a password, the onboard computer firmware can be erased remotely. <br><br>  <b>8. Charge anywhere.</b>  Removable battery greatly simplifies life with an electric bike.  It can be charged literally everywhere: at home, in the office, in a cafe. <br><br>  <b>9. Ride a bike in the winter.</b>  Cooling is no reason to take the bike away to the storage room.  A heated battery helps to prolong the season. <br><br>  <b>10. Take care of ecology.</b>  Elektrokit meets the ideas of conscious consumption: the old bike is not sent to the landfill, but improves and is used further.  At the same time, an electric bike is more environmentally friendly than a car. <br><br>  <b>11. More convenient than an electric scooter.</b>  The only thing common to a bicycle with an electrification kit and an electric scooter is a motor.  The rest of the bike with the motor retains all the advantages of an ordinary bike: it can go on sidewalks and parks, it is easy to bring it into the apartment and store there, it can be left on any bike parking. <br><br>  Now the working prototype is undergoing test tests in Moscow, is preparing for mass production with significant improvements.  Already in the new bicycle season, bicycles with sets can be seen in Russia and Europe.  Mass production is scheduled to start in May. <br><br>  Read more at <a href="http://www.eczo.bike/">www.eczo.bike</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398717/</a></p>
