    <h4>  Knowledge </h4><br>  The need for knowledge arises when there is an idea and there is a process of its creation during which we are faced with a problem that we cannot solve due to the fact that we don‚Äôt know how.  That is, even if you have an idea and you start thinking about it and at the same time encounter a problem that you cannot solve, then this will immediately cause a desire to gain knowledge to solve this problem. <br><br>  If I need to clear land from trees and I have an idea to cut them, but I do not know where to get a saw and how to use it, it will immediately make me want to know where to buy a saw and how to use it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the technical side, the following happened: the level of idea and creation exceeded the level of knowledge, which began to level off, that is, there was a need to increase the level of knowledge so that it became the same as the level of factors of the idea and creation. <br><br><h4>  Ideas </h4><br>  The need for an idea arises when there is knowledge and skills, but there is no plan how to use it to solve a problem.  That is, if I have the knowledge that there is a saw and it is used for cutting trees, and there is also a task that I need to clear the area from the trees on which I start working mentally, this will immediately lead to the generation of ideas.  In other words, if I knew that there was a saw and began work on solving the problem (cleaning the area), it would give me ideas, for example the idea that you can cut down trees. <br><br>  On the technical side, an increase in the level of knowledge and creation led to an impulse to increase the level of ideas, which led to their generation. <br><br><h4>  Creation </h4><br>  The need for creation arises when there is an idea and there is knowledge.  That is, if I have an idea that you can cut down trees and I know how to use a saw, I have a desire to start implementation. <br><br>  That is, an increased level of knowledge and ideas led to an increase in the level of creation. <br><br><h4>  About the power of this </h4><br>  For example, at the moment I just do not want to create anything and I have no ideas.  And even if I forcefully try to think of something or force myself to do something, it will work, but it will not bear the fruits that it could.  And we do not rarely ask ourselves, it seems to be necessary, but we cannot force ourselves, or we want to invent something, but it does not work and there is no desire. <br><br>  The fact is that we are simply not ready for this at the moment, we are at a different stage, the body itself speaks about it by means of feelings, by what causes antipathy to creating something or generating ideas. <br><br>  In this case, we will definitely have a desire to go somewhere, relax, visit something.  And this is nothing more than an expression of the need for information and knowledge. <br><br>  That is, if at the moment I can‚Äôt think of anything, and I don‚Äôt want to do anything, it means that I don‚Äôt need to do anything, I need to start getting new information.  Go somewhere, read or see something, do something abstract.  No, it is not a weakness or a rest, it is a process of obtaining new knowledge and information.  And after a certain time, I will simply stop wanting to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù, and ideas will come to my head, or I will want to create something, this indicates that the level of knowledge has leveled off and now I am at the idea or creation stage. <br><br>  And if I have a lot of ideas, but there is no desire to do anything, I will definitely want to create something. <br><br>  Or if I don‚Äôt want to create anything, and I have a lot of ideas, I‚Äôll certainly have a desire to do something abstract. <br><br><h4>  From personal experience </h4><br>  I have been trying to organize life for a long time from the point of view of the highest efficiency, and for several years I live exactly in the manner described above, and I can say with confidence that it works and always works.  You just need to understand the desires of yourself and fulfill them in the right direction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142623/</a></p>
