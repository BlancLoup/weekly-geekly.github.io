And how often in your daily life do you meet "Made in China"?  But now is not about that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f7/efb/72b/7f7efb72bf7c4731b4799aa1a7e36ee0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Import Substitution Program</b>

      To import substitution can be treated differently. <a name="habracut"></a>  But the task of increasing the resilience of countries to external influences and protecting their security is obvious.  Starting with the policy of protectionism in relation to national goods in different countries (China, Brazil, Russia), states come to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimport substitution, and not just copying, but creating fundamentally new systems and technologies, in particular, software development.  The program of import substitution has just started to gain momentum in the Russian Federation, but candidates for replacing software have already stood out.  Among client and server operating systems, this is a consortium of Alt-Linux, NTC Rosa, CryptoPRO, Lanit-Integration, and others, among the domestic Linux developers. "New communication technologies" with its ONLYOFFICE cloud service. <br><br>  <b>China experience</b> <br><br>  China headed for import substitution in IT after the revelations of Edward Snowden, who spoke about the espionage of American intelligence services over Internet users and communication networks around the world using the Internet. <br><br>  But the first steps in this direction were made long before that.  In 2002, the development of the Ubuntu Kylin operating system began (Ubuntu functionality + a set of Chinese software and applications) specifically for China and tailored to the needs of the Chinese.  The Ubuntu Kylin team works closely with the WPS Office (Kingsoft Office) - the most popular office suite in China - more than 800 million users.  WPS Office is preinstalled on Ubuntu Kylin as a replacement for Microsoft Office and includes editors for documents, presentations and spreadsheets. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to repeat the successful experience of China in the Russian realities?</b> <br><br>  To assess the chances of Russian office software for success in import substitution, <a href="http://www.onlyoffice.com/">let's</a> compare office packages <a href="http://wps.com/">WPS</a> and <a href="http://www.onlyoffice.com/">ONLYOFFICE</a> .  So, both office suites include editors of documents, spreadsheets and presentations.  You can read about the available features on the official websites of the programs, so here we will only consider their distinctive features. <br><br>  In addition to the basic editing functions, format support, font set, without which the editors would not be editors, office suites have fundamental differences. <br><br>  WPS are desktop editors with the ability to track changes and leave comments on documents.  Unlike WPS, ONLYOFFICE is a cloud platform, the desktop version of which is still only being prepared for release and will soon see the light.  The features of WPS, some of which currently distinguish the product favorably, are document templates, an Android application, and many people like the function of switching documents by tabs, which allows editing several documents at the same time.  ONLYOFFICE has document templates only in the plans, and the Android version is under development. <br><br>  What distinguishes ONLYOFFICE from WPS (also due to desktop / cloud differences) is the ability to jointly edit documents in real time along with commenting and tracking changes;  preservation of document formatting features due to the HTML5 Canvas element both in browsers and on various devices.  Fundamental to the transition to the new product has the support of old formats.  Editors are fully compatible with MS Office and Open Office formats.  In addition to the office suite, there is also a system for collaborating on projects, CRM, mail. <br><br>  Successful testing of the cloud service on Alt Linux gives every reason to believe that it may well be preinstalled on this operating system afterwards, like WPS on Ubuntu Kylin. <br><br>  With its flaws and strengths, WPS was able to replace Microsoft Office in the Chinese market.  Will it succeed ONLYOFFICE in the Russian space - time will tell. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Russia and China are also discussing joint projects within the framework of the program of import substitution of equipment and components for various industries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292834/</a></p>
