You leave the apartment clean, ironed and smelling pleasantly, and you come to work or meeting friends with dirty shoes and soiled clothes.  In the spring, neither personal transport nor taxi helps.  Sometimes a few meters of muddy sidewalk are enough to get dirty before the very purpose of your journey. <br><br>  Exit here - either to monitor the cleanliness of the sidewalks and roads, or to somehow protect their clothes and shoes.  In some regions, they are trying with varying success to fulfill the first point, but it‚Äôs not good at all and not always.  In this case, go to step two.  But what kind of protection can be used?  Galoshes or rubber boots?  It is possible and so, but there are more modern ways.  In particular, the tool HYDROP. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is HYDROP? </h3><br>  This is a highly effective water-repellent compound that protects the surface of clothing and shoes from getting wet.  Accordingly, if the fabric or skin is dry, in most cases nothing can stick to it.  This tool is produced by the domestic company Nanobarrier, which spent about two years and 8.5 million rubles on the development of the composition.  As a result, the desired composition still managed to get.  It has a strong hydrophobic effect.  93% consists of water, 6% - these are additional components plus another 1% - miniature particles of titanium and silicon dioxide.  After the composition was received, the creators demonstrated its work in a simple but effective way: they dipped the tie of one of the meeting participants soaked in HYDROP in a smoothie (yes, without a smoothie - nowhere).  As a result, there was not the slightest dirty or wet spot on the tie.

      Now the company produces four different products with a completely different principle of operation.  For example, the protection of clothing and footwear from moisture and liquid contamination, which works for suede, textiles and nubuck.  This is HYDROP Textile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7d/268/7be/c7d2687be4db4c20a1e90fb34f1c1484.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a tool that can remove even ingrained dirt of various types.  It does not require the use of water.  This tool is called HYDROP Clean. <br><br>  Another product - HYDROP Fresh.  This substance has deodorizing, antistatic and antibacterial properties.  That is, the T-shirt will protect from smell, it will be useful for shoes. <br><br>  The last thing worth telling is about the Phantom Reflective Spray.  This tool will be useful for cyclists and motorcyclists.  The spray is completely invisible on clothes during the day, but perfectly reflects the light of headlights and flash units at night. <br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br>  In this article we describe the principle of action of only one of the above products.  Namely - HYDROP Textile.  It comes in the form of a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-textile-capsule/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">HYDROP Capsule</a> - a small aluminum spray that lasts for a whole ‚Äúdirty season‚Äù. <br><br>  And in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-textile/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">form of a spray</a> in a bottle larger than a capsule, size. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sksxp7gHajs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This substance is necessary to process the material of clothing and footwear, after which the following will occur: <br><br><ul><li>  Dirt and water droplets simply roll off the fabric, leaving no residue; </li><li>  Reagents do not leave stains on the shoe.  No need to try to clean or tint material; </li><li>  You can wear stylish shoes in the rain and slush. </li></ul><br>  In this case, the spray can be used with delicate surfaces, it does not stain.  Also spray is safe for children.  HYDROP Textile does not get wet clothes and shoes, and therefore there is no favorable environment for bacteria and other microorganisms.  One shoe processing lasts about 2-3 months, clothes - up to 10 washes. <br><br>  The only thing is to apply the product to clean clothes.  Spraying it on a dirty cloth will not help.  After processing, clothes or shoes can be easily cleaned, even if something remains on the clothes.  There is no need for cleaning products - only water. <br><br>  In addition to this tool, you can also use <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-fresh/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">HYDROP FRESH</a> , a product that is simply indispensable when traveling.  It reduces friction between the fibers of the fabric and relieves static stress, and also smoothes the fabric and makes it soft.  HYDROP FRESH contains components that deactivate oleic acid (the main source of sweat odor), and eliminates sources of a whole range of other odors, and also contains components that provide an effective property for disinfecting textile surfaces.  Accordingly, using this composition, you can kill several birds with one stone: <br><br><ul><li>  Smooth large folds; </li><li>  Kill bacteria; </li><li>  Remove odors and prevent the accumulation of static charge. </li></ul><br><h3>  Where can one buy? </h3><br>  In Russia, the three mentioned products, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-textile-capsule/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">HYDROP Textile Capsule</a> and HYDROP Textile as <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-textile/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">a spray</a> , plus <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/hydrop-fresh/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop">HYDROP FRESH</a> can be purchased from Madrobots. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhydrop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373297/</a></p>
