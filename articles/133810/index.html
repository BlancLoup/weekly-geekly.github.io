  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Piracy: crime or coercion?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am very interested in the question of why the paid software industry is very poorly developed in Russia. <br><br>  Asking this question to my friends, acquaintances, or simply looking for an answer on the web, I came to disappointing conclusions. <br>  Many said that this is due to the fact that in Russia the situation with copyright protection is very bad, someone cited the fact that why spend money on developing anything, if in a few weeks this product is hacked and free ones will appear on the network (hacked) counterparts.  And someone quite pessimistic said that in our country it is simply impossible to engage in high technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In part, they are right, but let's look at the problem more closely and try to analyze it. <br><br>  So, what we have:

      1. To create software (hereinafter, under this abbreviation, I will mean any product, from a desktop program and a mobile phone application to a website and a game on a social network), specialists in programming and design and managers are needed for successful project management. <br><br>  2. Investments or own funds are needed to pay for the work of specialists and further product promotion to the market. <br><br>  3. A platform is needed through which users could buy this software. <br><br>  And what of this we currently have: <br><br>  1. We have learned to educate programmers at the worst (why it is at a loss, but because most programmers are only programmers, some of them cannot decide for themselves what color links on the site to do), but this is not because they cannot accept this decision, but because they fought off the desire to take responsibility for making decisions with the wrong management methods. <br><br>  With artists and designers things are a little better, but they also lack knowledge in the field of psychology (for design to cause consumers exactly those feelings and emotions that were supposed to).  And about the managers and can not speak, as it was not.  The truth is now in some companies have begun to engage in the cultivation and training of their managers, but they are so few that it is just a drop in the ocean. <br><br>  2. Investment is generally a sore point for Russian business.  In order for a business to invest a day, he should not be afraid that this money will simply fly into the pipe by passing some unnecessary law, which no one in our country can guarantee.  Yes, and the simple problem of "throwing", when money just disappears along with the performers ... <br><br>  3. Sites, this is actually the most sensitive point: I can assume that before the game and other applications did not appear on social networks, Russians did not spend money on the Web at all or so little money that they were not interested in coma.  Now, with the advent of these applications and a less stable system established in the system, the producer - social network - the user, more and more free developers and companies are starting to invest in the development and creation of these applications. <br><br>  But in other areas, except for social networks, things are as before.  I tried to find a website where I could buy and download a book in .epub format (I prefer this book format) from the sphere of IT publications in Russian.  The results are terrible - I could not find more than one site on which I could buy books and upload to my electronic reader.  That is, the publishers themselves have given this niche into the hands of so-called pirates. <br><br>  Almost the same thing happens with audio and video, many users would be happy to watch high-quality movies and listen to high-quality music, but a small deletion arises, first, many users simply cannot find resources that provide buying opportunities, and if they do, then Often the buying and payment process is organized in such a way that even the most experienced user can not always perform all the inconceivable actions to buy. <br><br>  As we can see, all of these three problems, one of the most important for normal software development, is the development of platforms or resources that are indexed by purchase requests in search engines, providing a normal product (tested) with a normal payment system.  In social systems, these conditions are realized, which led to the development of the social games and applications development industry. <br><br>  Even in the US, before the advent of adequate purchasing systems, such as iTunes, many users downloaded pirated music and movies (provided that the laws prevented this more than we do). <br><br>  So in my opinion, not a change in legislation, but the development of services will lead to the extinction of piracy in this manifestation. <br><br>  At the moment, ‚Äúpirates‚Äù work only in those areas where there are no official resources or they work so that the user simply cannot use them. <br><br>  So piracy is a compulsion to react to the needs of users, not a crime in order to deprive the right holders of their legitimate profits. <br><br>  Buy programs, books and games and then development in these areas will be more dynamic ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133810/</a></p>
