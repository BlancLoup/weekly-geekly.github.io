      Let's see how successful applications use them skillfully and let them all indulge at the same time. <br><br>  Pope Gregory in his work ‚ÄúInterpretation of the Book of Job, or Moral Interpretation‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.lectionarycentral.com/GregoryMoraliaIndex.html">Expositio in librum Iob sive Moralia</a> ) streamlined them from the most simple to implement, but not all appealing to the most powerful, over which, however, we must work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Pride </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/5d8/bf3/4125d8bf300e418a97912223fdd8857c.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  "Look, I bought a new car!" <br>  "Look, I went to rest on the beach in Turkey!" <br>  ‚ÄúLook, I rented a new apartment with a wonderful view of the bread factory!‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The ability to show off is one of the easiest to implement.  It is enough to allow users to share their content in a suitable form, and they will do everything themselves. <br><br>  However, it often interferes with laziness - it is three positions stronger in this list.  But if pride wins, the user is yours. <br><br>  This includes all possible limited and personal offers, closed groups, counters likes-repost-views, loyalty bonuses and other buns that allow the user to feel special. <br><br><h3>  Envy </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4f/444/1fc/b4f4441fc4ab47c8838e21e26a6fb181.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhere did he get the money for a new car ?!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhere did he get money for holidays in Turkey ?!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhere did he get the money for the new apartment ?!‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Here we will cover a larger circle of people, because laziness is hardly hurt - just run the application or open the site and start envy.  It remains for us to motivate people from the previous point to create content that causes envy and to make it catch the eye of people who generate envy. <br><br><h3>  Anger </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00c/63d/335/00c63d3353e44a6d8fdee6cd6b729f4a.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  "In vain took: French / Japanese / Korean / German / ... cars - shit, because it is worse than German / Korean / Japanese / French / ...!" <br>  "You can not post pictures from the beach, when people here in the office work!" <br>  ‚ÄúLook at the bread factory - at least look at some rolls!‚Äù </blockquote><br>  As you understand, it is enough to add the ability to comment, and users will again do everything themselves. <br><br>  Here, as in the case of pride, laziness sometimes interferes, but to a lesser degree: it is easier to write a comment than a whole post.  Counter anger can also prevent, so in anonymous services people are more likely to fry each other in the comments. <br><br><h3>  Depression </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/08f/28d/f2508f28da014f4b85eeda765be8054f.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  "While changing tires for winter, I poke into the phone ..." <br>  "The hotel is so-so, there is nothing special to do, but at least there is a wifi ..." <br>  "I will not go anywhere today, I will lie on the sofa ..." </blockquote><br>  The central player of our magnificent sevens.  The golden mean in the balance of implementation and efficiency.  Typical examples: an endless ribbon of content or, for example, many game levels that delay the user for a time sufficient to release an update with new levels. <br><br>  This is an ideal motivator, because in the modern world there are a huge number of convincing excuses to gladly indulge in despondency: ‚ÄúI am tired,‚Äù ‚ÄúI had a difficult day‚Äù, ‚Äústill waiting and nothing to do‚Äù ... We love despondency. <br><br><h3>  Greed </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/409/86d/02b/40986d02b96146d88308306f1650e370.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  "Make a repost and win aaaaaaavtomobiiiil!" <br>  ‚ÄúOur hotel is all inclusive, and you pay the same amount regardless of how many liters you drink!‚Äù <br><br>  "Take a mortgage and pay for your apartment as much as for a rental!" </blockquote><br>  Everything is simple: very effective, but very costly.  It is necessary that the business model converges with payments to users, and then they will start uploading videos to your YouTube, frantically sharing it with all possible means. <br><br><h3>  Gluttony </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/531/86e/011/53186e011ca242398f139514efc03a5f.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  "You can buy our food while driving past and even without leaving the car" <br>  ‚ÄúThe main restaurant is open from 6 am to midnight, a snack bar is open at night, in the evening you can enroll in an √† la carte restaurant, you can use the room service and there is in the room.  Surely you can eat somewhere else - we don't remember everything here. ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúDelivery works around the clock: just call and we will bring you food and put it in your mouth‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In the Internet space it is difficult to realize this sin, but this is still well managed by Instagram: perhaps not on the same scale as before, but people still like to photograph food.  So you can indulge in mental gluttony again and again, simply by revising your tape. <br><br><h3>  Lust </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0f/0d1/5be/e0f0d15bedeb4453b402785ea887eb39.jpg" height="350"><br><blockquote>  <i>I slept with a girl in the elevator</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I slept on the table.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I slept with her on the plane</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the jeep Chevrolet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I slept in the bank in the office</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Straight on bills.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Slept everywhere, not to mention</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sills!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(Chorus)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I do not know where else ...</i> </blockquote><br>  Subsequently, Dr. Sigmund Freud will confirm that all our actions are dictated by either a desire for destruction, or a desire for reproduction.  This is a somewhat simplified scheme, but even in a system of two components, one place is prepared for debauchery.  And - let's not be goodies - this is good. <br><br>  Even the most chaste ladies are not averse to a sneaky look at the pumped up male torsos and the toned female priests.  You can say that lust has nothing to do with it, but this is it, just in a neat form.  And I do not blame anyone: as I said, sex is wonderful. <br><br>  The hitch is that the mobile app stores do not share these views and ban all those who could not enlist the support of the powerful.  Believe me, if you find pornography in your application, they will delete you.  You can at the same time endlessly throw off examples of posts with a strawberry from Tumbler, Twitter, Facebook, or just give a link to Snapchat - this will not help.  All people are equal, but there are those who are smoother. <br><br>  However, if overcoming persecution and legal difficulties, you succeed, having wiped your hands in blood, to promote a porn site, you will most likely have a comfortable old age. <br><br><h3>  Life examples </h3><br>  <b>Social networks (7/7)</b> <br>  - pride: look what I have. <br>  - envy: where did you get this from? <br>  - anger: you are all freaks because you voted for [Donald / Hillary / Bernie ...]! <br>  - gloom: * scroll * * scroll * * like * * scroll * ... <br>  - greed: participate in the draw, come to us, buy, do at least something from what we offer in our group. <br>  - gluttony: I ate lobster today.  You are not. <br>  - lust: hello, let's get acquainted! <br><br>  <b>Apple (4/7)</b> <br>  - pride: I have the latest iPhone, and in the next six months before the next model will be released, I will be the coolest owner of a 60 thousand loan! <br>  - envy: he already bought the latest iPhone, and I'm no worse. <br>  - anger: pathetic users of Android, you will never be so elite! <br>  - lust: I have the last iphone - all my chicks. <br><br>  <b>Clash of% smth% (3/7)</b> <br>  - pride: our clan is the strongest. <br>  - anger: we scatter these noobs into slivers. <br>  - gloom: nothing interesting happens in my life, but here I am a cool fighter. <br><br>  <b>Pornhub (4/7)</b> <br>  - envy: this is where the girls get up there! <br>  - gloom: I have nothing to do, but I have napkins and free time. <br>  - greed: if you post a home video from my ex, you can cut a couple of hundred dollars. <br>  - lust: lust! <br><br><h3>  How to deal with this? </h3><br>  Many centuries have passed since all of the above was the most terrible thing that a person can do.  But the world has changed: now everything is possible.  Now do not burn.  So let your users indulge in sin, and they will thank you.  What to do - so this world is arranged. <br><br>  <i>PS Yes, this is an April Fools' article, but for some reason it came out frighteningly plausible.</i>  <i>If you decide to apply this framework in life, let me know about the results.</i>  <i>If it is not too lazy and you can get to the keyboard through heaps of earned money.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324230/</a></p>
