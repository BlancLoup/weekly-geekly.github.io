      Commenting on the signed agreement, the President of the Skolkovo Foundation, Viktor Vekselberg, noted that this agreement will be one of the starting points for the further development of high-tech and high-tech industries in Russia and bringing them to an international level.  Standardization of innovative products will make it possible over time to make such industries export-oriented and competitive. <br><br>  At the end of the post are the answers to the questions <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/122953/">posed by the</a> Habrawers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0ae7c357/78a8a347/3f9977ba/53299c54.jpg"><br><br>  The head of Rosstandart, Grigory Elkin, in turn told reporters: ‚ÄúThe signed agreement will allow for adjusting the work to technical committees that will be able to develop standards that promote the commercialization of Skolkovo products for the domestic and international markets.  In addition, cooperation with Skolkovo will make it possible to move from national standardization focused on the domestic market to advanced international standardization. ‚Äù <br><br>  Working with specialists of Rosstandart within the framework of the agreement will allow speeding up the procedures for bringing the results of the research activities of the Skolkovo project participants to the market.  In addition, we can now safely speak about the possibility of standardizing Skolkovo products under a simplified scheme, including using the mechanism of prestandards.  This means that participants in the Skolkovo project will be able to initiate improvements in the Russian standards base and form requirements for high-tech products, which, in turn, will make individual projects more attractive from the point of view of future profitability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7b6ad1b3/c0a80bb3/56e7b242/223229cb.jpg"><br><br>  At the press conference, journalists raised several interesting topics: <br><br>  <b>What does cooperation with Rosstandart mean to you?</b> <br><br>  First of all, this will speed up the procedures for bringing the results of the research activities of our participants to the market.  We are talking about the standardization of Skolkovo products under a simplified scheme, including using the mechanism of prestandards. <br><br>  This means that Skolkovo project participants will be able to initiate the improvement of the standardization base of the Russian Federation and independently formulate requirements for high-tech products, which, in turn, will increase the commercialization component of individual projects. <br><br>  Since we are talking about positioning in global markets, we focus on the experience of Rosstandart and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia in harmonizing existing requirements with international standards, including within the framework of the Customs Union and the Russia-EU dialogue. <br><br>  Perhaps, thanks to such cooperation, in a few years a new quality guarantee will emerge in Russia - the Skolkovo international standard. " <br><br>  <b>Rosstandart‚Äôs activities are focused more on the domestic, Russian market.</b>  <b>However, many of the projects of the participants in Skolkovo are focused not only on the domestic, but also on the world market.</b>  <b>Do you plan to sign such an agreement, for example, with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday, there is already a practice of participation in such international organizations of representatives from specific states.  And in this case, these representatives are just employees of Rosstandart, whose task is to take part in the development of international standards together with representatives of other states.  And the role of Skolkovo in this case is to help Rosstandart expand the range of issues that should be brought to the international level in order to prepare the ground for those companies that have participant status to enter international markets. <br><br>  <b>What standards will be applied on the territory of Skolkovo?</b> <br><br>  - In accordance with the Skolkovo law, we have the right to apply both Russian standards and standards that operate within other countries, for example, standards of EU countries.  The decision on the use of a standard is made by the management company during the project.  Moreover, if the decision is in the direction of European standards, we are obliged to inform the agency that we are applying the standard not from the Russian Federation.  Moreover, such a decision must be well substantiated. <br><br><h3>  Answers to questions Habrayuzerov </h3><br>  At the end of the event, I asked Viktor Vekselberg questions and the Skolkovo press service, which you, dear Habrazhiteli, sent in the comments to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/122953/">post</a> .  I must say that several questions were sent by e-mail, they were also answered. <br><br>  <b>- Tell us how much money and what has already been spent?</b> <br>  - By law, the management company must report annually.  You can still familiarize yourself with the Fund‚Äôs investment policy: <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/docs/investicionnaya_politika/">www.i-gorod.com/docs/investicionnaya_politika</a> <br>  Public placement of the report will be announced in the media. <br><br>  <b>- Do you plan to keep any open source community under the wing of Skolkovo?</b>  <b>Does it mean to create new or support existing Russian ones?</b>  <b>And then the school switched to open source, maybe it makes sense, so to speak, to give a favor?</b> <br><br>  - The main criterion for Skolkovo projects is innovation.  In this regard, the Foundation refers to open source projects as well as to all others.  The law ‚ÄúOn the Skolkovo Innovation Center‚Äù defines requirements for residents.  In short: a resident is a legal entity engaged only in research and commercialization of their results in one of five areas: IT, nuclear technology, bio-honey, energy efficiency and space.  Well and the main thing - an authoritative foreign expert and at least one employee of a Russian or foreign educational institution should participate in the project.  So if any of the open source ideologues wants to join the Skolkovo IT cluster, this is only welcome!  The main thing is compliance with the foresight of the cluster: <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/it/">www.i-gorod.com/it</a> <br><br>  Moreover, together with Intel, we announced the contest ‚ÄúComputer continuum: from idea to realization‚Äù: ( <a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/index.php%3Fact%3Dcomputecontinuum">en.intel.com/business/community/index.php?act=computecontinuum</a> ).  Participants can submit applications in 17 directions until October 31, 2011, including ‚ÄúNew services based on open source‚Äù. <br><br>  As for schools, among the areas of activity of the Skolkovo IT cluster is education ( <a href="http://i-gorod.com/it/">i-gorod.com/it</a> ).  At the moment, we cannot regulate the delivery of software for schools, but within Skolkovo, a homeless grant can be issued for developing school software. <br><br>  <b>- How to patch KDE for FreeBSD?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor a long time, the KDE FreeBSD Initiative has existed ‚Äî its team has been specifically dedicated to ensuring a high level of compatibility between FreeBSD and KDE.  They discuss patches, look for bugs and suggest new features.  Join - <a href="http://freebsd.kde.org/">freebsd.kde.org</a> <br><br>  <b>- How long?</b> <br><br>  - It is expected that Skolkovo will be created in a period not exceeding seven years.  The main construction program of Skolkovo will be completed in 2015. <br><br>  <b>- What advantage overcame high prices for land and real estate in the near Moscow suburbs, and how Skolkovo turned out to be better than Tomsk, Novosibirsk and other cities with a highly developed scientific infrastructure?</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  - Starting from scratch gives you several advantages: <br><br>  - it is not necessary to stretch the plan on the existing infrastructure; <br>  - no need to compromise in science cities, which were designed decades ago; <br>  - if successful, it will be possible to scale this experience from scratch, which is one of the long-term goals of the project; <br>  - it becomes possible, for example, to achieve low or zero emissions of harmful substances.  Buildings in Skolkovo almost will not consume energy from external sources. <br><br>  At the same time, one should not think that the experience of Tomsk, Novosibirsk and other science cities decided to simply reject.  About 40 agreements have already been signed with leading scientific centers of the country, and some of them have initiated some of the Skolkovo projects.  Here we welcome the arrival of any specialists and companies, wherever they work before. <br><br>  <b>- Is ex-Russian suitable as a ‚Äúcompulsory foreign specialist‚Äù for the Skolkovo resident company?</b>  <b>Have the formal requirements for these specialists already been described?</b> <br><br>  - The main requirement for a foreign specialist is his credibility.  Compliance with all formal requirements is considered by the expert boards of the foundation.  They also determine the level of compliance of the involved specialist in each specific case.  The requirement of a foreign specialist is not a whim of the foundation;  international cooperation guarantees the implementation of truly innovative developments.  Therefore, a specialist must be of world class. <br><br>  <b>- Russia over the past 20 years has lost markets for high-tech products.</b>  <b>How do you imagine the average participant in your business incubator who can solve this problem?</b>  <b>If this is a small business, then he himself will not be able to find markets.</b>  <b>Are you going to help him somehow?</b>  <b>If so, how?</b>  <b>Treaties between countries or corporations?</b>  <b>Are any of them already concluded and operating?</b>  <b>If it is designed for big business, then why does it need Skolkovo?</b> <br><br>  - Skolkovo big business needs as a source of start-ups and a platform for organizing R &amp; D centers, which is why a number of major corporations have already signed agreements with us. <br><br>  Skolkov needs participants - startups, whom Skolkovo will assist in standardizing business, obtaining patents and a number of other services, including consulting in investment relations at the international level.  All services of Skolkovo as a technology park are described in the section <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/technopark/">www.i-gorod.com/technopark</a> <br><br>  <b>- Why is everything in the country so that no one believes in the benefit or commercial success of the Skolkovo project?</b> <br><br>  - Because there is nothing to compare. <br><br>  <b>- Will migrant workers work in Skolkovo or is it planned to create an infrastructure with housing and roads around?</b> <br><br>  - Of course, infrastructure is planned.  The building will be compact: housing, jobs, public spaces and services - within walking distance.  Skolkovo will also have a dense road and street network, and IT systems will manage flows. <br><br>  <b>- What is the economic return (benefit) of Skolkovo and Russia when issuing large grants to successful companies, like ABBYY, Parallels?</b> <br><br>  - The basis of Skolkovo is not economic return, but innovation.  Companies that can develop innovations, commercialize them, do not leave Russia, and apply here are worthy to enter Skolkovo.  It is worth noting: all applications are considered on an equal basis. <br><br>  <b>- What are the main areas of Skolkovo: joint projects with major players in the high-tech market or support for new seed companies?</b> <br><br>  - The mission of Skolkovo is to create a favorable innovative environment that attracts the best research and development.  To do this, you need to organize a full cycle of the innovation process, that is, to attract the most diverse players - both large and small ones.  Support for seed-companies that generate innovative projects is impossible without the participation of large players, so we attract both those and others to participate in the project.  The first ones - as participants and recipients of gratuitous grants, the second - as business partners and creators of R &amp; D centers in Skolkovo. <br><br>  <b>- Then why can't you immediately make a good, high-quality and safe site, so as not to redo it ten times?</b> <br><br>  - We are working on it right now. <br><br>  <b>- Do they understand that because of the difficulty of access to this zone, it will be difficult for young teams to get there, and large companies can use this zone for tax evasion and as a method of obtaining investments?</b> <br><br>  - Access to Skolkovo as easy as possible.  It is not even necessary for young teams to register a company - in the first stage, an individual can apply for a preliminary review.  Fortunately, not all Skolkovo participants (http://www.i-gorod.com/participants/) are large companies. <br><br>  By the way, according to the law, the activities of persons involved in the project should be consistent with its objectives.  What you are talking about is a violation of the federal law ‚ÄúOn the Skolkovo Innovation Center‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/docs/20100928-fz-244/">www.i-gorod.com/docs/20100928-fz-244</a> ). <br><br>  Violators of the project rules lose their right to participate. <br><br>  <b>- Why is it simply impossible to provide students not far from the institute with a working area with a free lunch at 2% of their startup?</b> <br><br>  - Students are scattered throughout the country, do not know about the business criteria for innovation, do not have access to employees and the developments of large R &amp; D centers.  Often, representations of universities about the modern investment policy of large business structures, the real directions in which money is invested, are obsolete.  That is why Skolkovo chooses universities as scientific experts, being for them, in turn, an information hub that creates a request for personnel and projects.  In Skolkovo, however, all innovative teams will be able to exchange experience, get significant benefits and, most importantly, have direct access to representatives of the Russian and foreign business elite. <br><br>  <b>- As you can not understand: if you choose a direction and team, then you become a simple employer, and not limited to anything, create the right environment, when masterpieces come to the surface from delusions.</b> <br><br>  - The fund, of course, is not the "employer" of companies whose applications have been approved.  But your analogy is clear.  You can answer it like this: a directed explosion is much more effective than usual.  That is why in Skolkovo there are five clusters of trunks that should be directed to shoot innovations, and not wait for the masterpieces that pop up to the surface.  And the situation in the city will be such that in one cafe there can be experts from participating projects, students and teachers of the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, employees of world R &amp; D centers deployed by business partners in Skolkovo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dc927ea5/e31f4d57/af7fcea4/df2de75e.jpg"><br><br>  PS Thanks to everyone who asked questions.  I tried to ask them in the most unchanged form.  I hope you have received answers to interesting topics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123226/</a></p>
