  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wonderful outpost in orbit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  November 20 marks the 20th anniversary of the International Space Station.  I have no doubt that there will be a lot of stories about its history, design and operation.  I do not want to repeat the same thing, and I decided to reflect on what would be the most important for us from the experience that the ISS gave? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/kw/-r/aukw-rpt0odbmyfaqgztqcodpho.jpeg"><br>  <i>Docking of the first modules of the ISS Zarya and Unity December 6, 1998, photo by NASA</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Now every new day of the ISS is a record of the duration of operation</b> <br>  The previous record holder, the Mir station, stayed in orbit for 15 years (5511 days), of which 12.5 were inhabited (4594 days).  The ISS has been in orbit since November 20, 1998, which is 1.3 times more, and has been continuously inhabited since November 18, 2000, which is one and a half times more.  At the same time, the work of the ISS is precisely extended to 2024, and it is quite possible that the station will continue to operate.  This is a completely unique experience in operating, aging and repairing technical systems.  At the same time, the ‚Äúold woman‚Äù of the ISS is still very cheerfully holding on - not a noticeable increase in the number and severity of accidents.  The longer mankind is going to work in space, the more benefits the ISS experience will bring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xs/sy/4h/xssy4hbim5l78-_58nmpshllgnq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Damage to the heat sink panel S1 in 2008, NASA photo</i>

      <b>Construction and operation of the ISS - the most useful and positive experience of international cooperation</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eo/v4/7l/eov47lf8pcaw2yvf1tepv3b5geg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cover of the ISS contract</i> <br><br>  At the beginning of the 90s, work on the ISS looked like a real miracle - people who had recently learned to shoot at each other (this is not an exaggeration, there were quite a few military pilots among cosmonauts and astronauts), began to work together.  And Russia with the United States is not limited to the list of participating countries - in fact also Canada, Japan and thirteen countries of the European Space Agency (Brazil was also, but, unfortunately, left the project).  This experience is especially useful to remember now, during the next cooling of relations between Russia and the United States.  Whatever happens today, we are able to negotiate.  And expensive space projects, which are engaged in fundamental science and do not bring instant profit, are best of all built by the whole world. <br><br>  This also includes the fact that the ISS remained a completely civilian object - the predictions of alarmists about the placement of weapons at the station turned out to be, fortunately, erroneous. <br><br>  <b>The ISS is studying how people will live and work in space</b> <br><br>  Even if humanity in the future becomes cyborg, the experience of the ISS will be useful for the functioning of the biological part in space.  Weightlessness is not a familiar and harmless environment for people, well-known problems with muscles, bones, eyesight.  And even if suddenly, in the foreseeable future, artificial gravity generators appear (which is highly unlikely), the issues of the effects of cosmic radiation or the psychological aspects of working in space will not disappear. <br><br>  <b>ISS is a lot of science</b> <br><br>  For twenty years <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/116">,</a> more than 1,500 experiments <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/116">have been conducted</a> at the station.  And research directions were very different - from <a href="https://habr.com/post/203460/">dusty plasma</a> and Bose-Einstein condensate to the <a href="https://habr.com/post/404609/">spread of the flame</a> and the <a href="https://habr.com/post/380613/">reproduction of</a> living organisms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/314/309/b6d/314309b6d0c44d43aa5299f1e4a2c0ed.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Jellyfish" from the flame in zero gravity on the ISS</i> <br><br>  <b>ISS shows how cool and interesting space</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/jv/fe/wvjvfefeiivctvvezqdgy6qo1g0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Halloween on the ISS</i> <br><br>  Popularization and PR activities on the ISS cover a wide variety of audience segments.  Junior schoolchildren can be shown the classic experiments with water in zero gravity, senior pupils and students - <a href="https://habr.com/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26order_by%3Drelevance%26q%3D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%2B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%2B%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%2B%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%26flow%3D">serious and beautiful</a> experiments.  Even for those who skipped school, it will be clear that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Df0lpiXAHuyA">chasing colleagues</a> in a gorilla costume, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKaOC9danxNo">singing to a guitar</a> or throwing costume parties that the whole Internet will smile with is cool. <br><br>  <b>ISS demonstrates that we still have a lot to learn in order to go to Mars</b> <br><br>  The crew of three people <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/celebrating-15-years-since-the-sunrise">consumes</a> about 7 tons of supplies per semiannual watch, and the vast majority of them are used and thrown away.  Some more tons are spent on spare parts.  And if such a scheme works for the near-Earth orbit, then for long flights far from Earth, where it is not possible to replace the warehouse from a warehouse in the event of a breakdown and bring a new backup device to the nearest cargo ship, only one ‚Äúextra‚Äù accident can put the entire mission on the brink of disaster.  Right now, in relatively comfortable and safe conditions, one must train to work with <a href="https://habr.com/post/223211/">closed life support systems</a> and repair broken ones in place. <br><br>  <b>ISS is still early to retire</b> <br><br>  Initially, the ISS set goals to be a laboratory, an observatory and a plant in orbit.  In 2010, added commercial, diplomatic and educational purposes.  Also, mission servicing beyond the limits of the Earth's orbit were called possible.  And if everything is fine with the laboratory, the observatory and the classroom, the remaining tasks have not yet been properly accomplished.  Weightlessness is a special physical condition that cannot be obtained on Earth for a long time.  It is worth trying to experiment with growing proteins or crystals - what if it shoots?  Commercial use of the station also has room to grow - there were no tourists on the ISS for a long time.  So, despite the fact that for technology 20 years is a long time, the international space station can still bring a lot of benefit.  Happy Birthday, ISS! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430304/</a></p>
