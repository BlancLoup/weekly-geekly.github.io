And the more webpack. <br><br>  For now, I can conclude that your weak points are the processes that you use.  Perhaps you can start with them.  It is possible to pull up English in parallel (if we go further, it will be necessary to read too much, and ask a lot), if you feel the need. <br><br>  By process, you should familiarize yourself with existing methodologies in layout.  BEM, Css modules, etc.  Now all popular frameworks (including angular) are essentially reusable components, and similar approaches to the layout will give you some kind of foundation. <br><br>  Before you learn the framework, it is worth deciding on goals.  If you need an angular knowledge at the template level - well, then you can just read it and try it in your free time.  If you are interested in a qualitative understanding of everything, but before the frameworks, you need to study javascript well (and familiarize yourself with the current ES2015 standard).  And after that you can start frameworks. </blockquote><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/2e4/b5c/e382e4b5cc1b4f91b269230d27bba0a6.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  Section <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/interest_questions">"Business"</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/297229">‚ÄúHow to develop a service center?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  <i>How to open a service center and find customers?</i>  <i>open problems no, but how to attract customers?</i>  <i>The city is small and search queries in the internet are almost zero for the keys of interest.</i> <blockquote>  1.
