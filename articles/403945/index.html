Well, or just have fun, clicking buttons, switches, rotating the ball and performing other calming actions.  By the way, with such a thing even speaking to the public is easier - just do not show everyone what you twist in your hands.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/283776/">We already wrote about</a> how the Fidget Cube appeared and what it represents. <br><br>  Now everyone has lips (and in their hands too) spinners whose full name looks like this - Fidget Hand Spinner.  It may seem that this thing was invented recently.  But no, her story is richer than that of the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù that were invented by a pair of creative engineers.  Spinners appeared in the last century, and in 1993 a patent for a spinner was registered.  The inventor is the chemist Katherine Hettinger. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact that Hettinger invented the spinner was written by such famous publications as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/03/fidget-spinner-inventor-patent-catherine-hettinger">The Guardian</a> , <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/style/fidget-spinners.html">The New York Times</a> and The <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/05/05/woman-who-invented-fidget-spinners-isnt-getting-squat/">New York Post</a> .

Giving an interview to one of the newspapers, Catherine said that she was planning to make a toy to relieve stress and nervous tension when she learned that Israeli teenagers were throwing stones at the police.  According to the inventor, she decided to do a thing that can absorb the nervous energy of young people and "contribute to the world." <br><br>  But in another interview, she said that she created a toy for her daughter when she suffered from myasthenia Erba-Goldflam (an autoimmune disease that causes the syndrome of pathological muscle fatigue).  Catherine could not play with her daughter, so with her own hands she made a toy for her.  She collected it from scrap materials.  But after the daughter showed the toy to her friends, they wanted something similar for themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a6e/032/ced/a6e032ced9fc4baba3d63c654b796b35.jpg"><br><br>  As a result, the invention began to produce and deliver in small batches in Florida.  On May 28, 1993, Hattinger received a patent for a spinner.  The patent expired in 2014, and it did not renew it. <br><br>  The authorship of a chemical engineer raises some doubts among a number of patent specialists.  These doubts were voiced, for example, in one of the materials of Bloomberg News.  The fact is that spinners, which appeared in 2017, are somewhat different from the patented toy Hattinger.  True, she herself does not claim the authorship of the current version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e6/6b7/1a8/7e66b71a8e33eecc827e0222fc2ea659.jpg"><br>  One of the versions of spinners, at rest and during rotation <br><br>  Spinners in modern form did not appear in 2017, but earlier.  At the end of 2016, one of the Forbes authors called the toy ‚Äúmust-have for office‚Äù.  It is clear that after this publication a huge number of readers paid attention to the gadget.  Already in March 2017 spinner reviews began to appear on YouTube and Reddit.  Entrepreneurial companies began to produce their own versions of spinners, which received a wide variety of colors and shapes.  In May of this year spinners became one of the best-selling products on Amazon.  In ordinary stores spinners dispersed like hotcakes.  Actually, this trend continues to this day. <br><br>  Spinners are really a lot of different.  Lot?  Yes, they are just a huge amount! <br><br><h3>  Well, well, is there an effect? </h3><br>  As a toy, the Fidget Hand Spinner attracts attention.  But is there a real effect - does the toy relieve stress?  A number of publications at various times checked toys, interviewed doctors of different specialties.  As it turned out, they still relieve stress.  Some people spinners help to concentrate on thinking about a task.  Not everyone can concentrate with the spinner in his hand, but the toy still helps the majority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/271/9a5/d4f/2719a5d4f40348d98a22ff33bec94404.jpg"><br><br>  This is a great gift for a child - spinner helps children to get rid of excess energy, which some people have too much.  Even an authoritative publication such as the US News &amp; World Report has written about it, there are <a href="http://wtop.com/life-style/2017/04/kids-parents-in-search-of-fidget-spinners/">other</a> similar <a href="http://health.usnews.com/wellness/health-buzz/articles/2017-04-25/are-fidget-spinners-helpful-for-kids-with-adhd-autism-and-anxiety">opinions</a> .  In some US schools, spinners have banned, deciding that they are delaying students' attention to themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/856/535/0ca/8565350cae1d4d9a9df33df052de7667.jpg"><br><br>  Somehow even reasoning was published that spinners can be useful for autistic children whom this toy calms.  This is not so clear, since scientific studies on this topic have not been carried out. <br><br><h3>  Where to buy this thing? </h3><br>  Well, the answer is the easiest to answer.
