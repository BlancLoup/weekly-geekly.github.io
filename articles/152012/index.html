Not just lived and worked.  I had a very definite goal - to open my shop.  And now, tomorrow there will be a new day, tomorrow it will be necessary to look for new achievements, think about mistakes, correct and improve the created one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  The first steps </h5><br>  Morning festivals - the most working time.  For a few hours you need to get settled: put up a tent, tables, lay out the goods, compare prices, stick price tags. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And so, I sit, I look at people, I drink coffee, brewed right there on the camp burner, I get acquainted with the sellers and guests of the festival.  Very different and interesting people.  On the next pole sits a huge raven, squinting at me with one eye.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to treat him - scary. <br><br>  Festivals bring about 20-30 thousand for departure.  It‚Äôs impossible to earn more - the volume of the machine does not allow to fit so much product into it.  Yes, and visitors come here not that without money, but they spend more on beer.  My task is to attract people to me, get to know them.  And provide the necessary things.  This year there was a young couple who forgot sleeping bags at home. <br><br><h5>  Progress </h5><br>  They say that everyone should achieve something in this life.  ‚ÄúWhat did you do for hip-hop?‚Äù I asked myself.  Almost all your life you have been doing tourism, and you have not done anything for tourism. <br><br>  Yes, you help people, you trade with them honestly.  You take away the goods, you tell about him, you are not afraid to say bad things about this tent, but about this good one.  But this is not enough. <br><br>  When I invented the folding toilet, nobody laughed at me.  Just do not believe in this idea.  Disbelief did not break me. <br><br>  Two days later, it turned out that it was not me who invented it.  In the US military, a similar device has long been used, and in Russia, some enthusiasts have done such things out of the DSP. <br><br>  But it did not break me.  I developed a device, made drawings, manufactured a probe, then ordered parts at factories.  The first batch sold out in a month. <br><br>  Now I can proudly say: I gave tourism folding toilets. <br><br><h5>  Victory </h5><br>  Just recently, there will be a large tourist all-around - Crocodile. <br><br>  The organizers are good guys.  The participants are wonderful people.  I know them for two years now and am a sponsor of the project.  Among the awards, the winners give out my prizes. <br><br>  They do a good job.  It warms my soul that I help them. <br><br><h5>  Dream </h5><br>  I already wrote about my dream in previous posts.  My dream is a store with a clearing.  On the clearing - tents.  In the store, I myself, badge Valera.  In the middle of the store is a round table.  And gratis coffee with stew. <br><br>  Such a store, more reminiscent of the tourist club of the Palace of Pioneers, I still could not create. <br><br>  But I managed to rent a room in a completely adequate place.  For quite an adequate price.  And arrange it is not so very comfortable, but in general, even nothing so. <br><br>  By the way, you will need to remember to bring mannequins and a screen for trying on clothes. <br><br><h5>  Reality </h5><br>  Getting out of the Internet into reality turned out to be difficult. <br><br>  Finding a room was difficult.  In some places they asked for quite an exorbitant 100-200 thousand for a tiny room.  In others, it was not so simple.  One strong man made a demand to use his cashier.  I soon said goodbye. <br><br>  When there was no choice left, a good offer was unexpectedly received from the Kozhevniki shopping center. <br><br>  Now I have a recently read book by Kotin on my shelf, ‚ÄúAnd Botanists Do Business.‚Äù  The main character opened his first store on the sixth floor.  I was more fortunate - I opened on the fourth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8df/18c/718/8df18c718e50a0e24590c62935283ca7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first visitors were local.  The first purchase occurred out of the box.  We have not yet laid out a single product, and have not placed racks. <br><br>  Then came the acquaintances.  They have been waiting for this meeting for a long time.  They wanted all the best, looked at the product, exchanged experiences and impressions.  The summer is gone, the summer to see off was sad.  I could not even help on Friday with the calculation - we saw off the summer. <br><br>  Then passers-by and random people arrived.  Opposite the store is a department of jewelry.  Husbands agree with their wives when choosing jewels and through glass doors with sad eyes look at the backpacks hanging to my left.  I smile and leave them business cards.  There will be time - come to me specifically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e77/854/9e4/e778549e4e4c29ce4b74977bc8322c4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When we eventually decomposed, a young guard approached me.  ‚ÄúFinally, at least one store is needed in this place,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  I guess I'm still doing the right thing. <br><br>  <b>Morning UPD:</b> In the morning, when the head had already begun to think what the <b>server</b> command <b>httpd fullstatus issues</b> , I realized that the link, once asked, needs to be issued.
