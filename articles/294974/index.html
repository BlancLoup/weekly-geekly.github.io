Will it always be like this?  Business will be, if they competently manage further, but customers will not always leave only good reviews.  Moreover, in addition to reviews, one will have to face such phenomena as bots, trolls, negative comments on social networks.  Negative on the Internet is a separate topic for research and reasoning. <br>  In this article we will look at some strategies for working out the negative.  Let's get started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Case one - parking negative</b> <br>  The business is successful, orders are delivered to customers, and the company's marketing efforts are aimed at attracting new customers.  But old customers also should not be forgotten.  Sometimes they need to be reminded of themselves through emails and other channels.  Some brands practice sms-mailing on their client base.  Of course, sooner or later, one of your clients will complain about any of your advertising channels.  In this case, customers began to complain about the incoming SMS.  Examples of such negative references are presented in the screenshot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90c/205/977/90c20597779b48569eea60b21d167b89.PNG" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It is worth exploring these references separately.  What is remarkable about them: <br>  1) the first message indicates that the client has already complained to the support service; <br>  2) in the first message there are details of the negative reason - SMS, arriving in the middle of the night, as well as several messages per week; <br>  3) in the first message there is a call to the discussion at the end of the message; <br>  4) in the second message there is a conditional warning to write a negative under each post; <br><br>  Why do you need to quickly respond to these messages: <br>  1) Other users see a detailed negative; <br>  2) It is clear that the brand calls for discussion; <br>  3) A curious warning to write a negative under each post - users can like it, because the situation is unusual; <br><br>  What is reasonable to do in this situation: <br>  1) End each discussion with one comment so that no further discussion takes place.  Than it is dangerous - in the further open discussion, customers can also express a new negative, as a result, other customers will see it, which is highly undesirable, as this may scare away further orders.  And if this potential negative is seen by new potential customers, their final conversion into purchases will be less likely; <br>  2) Bring the discussion to a non-public format, where in the case of the appearance of a new negative it will not be visible to anyone; <br>  What can be done in such situations is presented in the screenshot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/2b3/b3f/e9c2b3b3f3874af0a02925496bb190d2.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  What do we see here?  Two clients with negative comments were given an answer to where to write their complaints.  But at the same time, the answer contains important details that need to be taken into account when working out the negative - the first client was given an email where to send questions or complaints, and the second was told to send input data in a personal message to the store account.  It turns out that further discussion will take place in the format of correspondence by email or in personal messages on the social network.  What is especially useful in such a system of non-public discussion with a client: <br>  1) Of course, all questions and customer complaints will eventually be worked out; <br>  2) If the client in communication will talk about the new negative, other users will not see the new details of the negative; <br>  3) All customers see the store's responses, which means they see that customer questions and complaints are taken into account and processed by the store; <br>  4) When the negative reason is worked out and the situation is completely exhausted, it will be entirely appropriate to write one more comment on behalf of the store under the client's correspondence like ‚Äúall issues are resolved by email.  Thank you for your message!".  So the brand can additionally show that not only they react to the negative, but also solve the situation to the end; <br><br>  <b>Case two - squeezing the negative out of sight</b> <br>  Groups of banks in social networks have always been of particular interest in terms of research comments and negatives that appear under the posts-posts.  Banking theme is special because it is connected in one way or another with money, so users are especially worried.  Using the example of a group of one of the well-known banks, we will begin the study of the next method of working out the negative.  Good news appeared in the bank group: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/a32/574/745a32574563405b8f69c957c52d58a9.PNG"><br><br>  There are likes and reposts, the group has good coverage, it remains only to see how the live audience responds to the good news about the joint co-branding map with the railways.  See comments to the post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c7/847/eb2/8c7847eb25fd4efaa5b26a617c4a37e1.PNG"><br><br>  Only three comments in a row, but the general tone of comments is sharply negative.  What is especially worth paying attention to in these comments: <br>  1) This is a discussion of two interlocutors. <br>  2) it is the negative that one of the two authors writes, and the second is only interested <br>  3) the original news in the group of the bank was left on June 26, the first negative comment appeared only on June 29, and the second negative comment appeared on June 30. <br>  The result - a correspondence with a negative tone began with one comment, for the day it was not answered on behalf of the group of the bank itself, and no one deleted it, as a result, all users of the group already see the whole discussion. <br>  If you do not take into account this particular situation, then let's imagine the following case: <br>  1) you have a negative in the group in the comments under the message <br>  2) the support service for some reason did not work for it or simply did not notice <br>  3) SMM department did not process it in any way. <br>  4) other users still see this negative <br>  Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is simply to remove negative comments.  But users who wrote negative messages can be real, not fake.  Moreover, it may be your current customers, and deleting their comments may offend them, which would entail the emergence of a new negative or, even worse, the loss of customer data altogether.  What can be done in this situation without deleting negative messages?  The most correct way is to make other users stop seeing these messages, or rather to make them harder to see them. <br>  While the support service is setting up its work, and the SMM department is trying to understand your dissatisfaction, you can simply add comments, which are not necessarily even directly commenting on the news itself, to the original news.  Example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/650/a7a/c89/650a7ac8979d4da481c198388e5605cc.PNG"><br><br>  What is worth paying attention to here: <br>  1) comments do not imply a discussion with the authors of negative comments; <br>  2) the comments do not discuss the details that attracted negative comments.  You can discuss the picture to the news and other side details; <br>  The usefulness of this method of working out the negative is that negative comments when viewing a group are now hidden under the button ‚Äúshow all xxx comments‚Äù.  Most users see the news only in their friends feed and see only the latest comments.  Thus, your responsible services have time to process this negative.  As it was stated in the previous examples, they should now enter into communication with users via private messages, and then just leave a visible comment to everyone that the question has been settled and the complaint has been processed. <br><br>  This is only part of a huge topic of working out the negatives in the network.  Soon there will be more articles with new cases and strategies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294974/</a></p>
