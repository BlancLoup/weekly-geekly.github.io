  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Yandex.Money Terms of Service - FAQ</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you heard about the new terms of using Yandex.Money?  As many already know, the new rules are not a whim of Yandex.Money, all changes are directly related to the requirements of the law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù. <br><br>  We publish the answers to the most common questions: with them the last three weeks have been visited by our users, bloggers, journalists and partners. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What are the main changes in the new offer? </h4><br>  The law requires all electronic money systems to introduce new limits - for both anonymous accounts and identified customers.  See what they will be: <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Identified </th><th>  Anonymous </th></tr><tr><td>  Balance limit </td><td>  100 000 rub. </td><td>  15 000 rub. </td></tr><tr><td>  Limit for transfer from account to account </td><td>  Not </td><td>  40 thousand rubles  per calendar month </td></tr><tr><td>  Single payment limit </td><td>  100 000 rub. </td><td>  15 000 rub. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  We understood that legislative restrictions change the old habits of account holders in Yandex.Money.  For many benefactors, for example, the balance may be more than 100 thousand, and some anonymous users keep more than 15 thousand on their account. We have come up with a compromise solution.  From September 27, the total user balance will consist of the available <b>balance</b> (see the table above) and funds that are in the <b>replenishment queue</b> .  [Some users will see the first pilot already on September 18]. <br>  Please note that we have no limits on the amount of funds that may be in the queue. <br><br>  <u>Example</u> : you have an anonymous account, today in your e-wallet 34 thousand rubles.  What will happen to your money after the entry into force of the new offer?  As before, it is your money, you can use it at any time. <br>  From September 27, Yandex.Money will show you the account status of the two halves: by clicking on the total amount, you will see 15 thousand rubles on your balance, and the remaining 19 thousand rubles are in the queue.  As the balance decreases, money from the queue will automatically be added to the available balance.  The queue principle will work for all Yandex.Money clients: for Russian and foreign, for anonymous and identified, for those who manage the account from the mobile, and for those who work with the system from a computer.  But if you have less than 15 thousand rubles on your account (that is, less than the limit limit), then you do not need a queue.

Everything is simple: withdraw and spend several portions in a row, for example, 300 thousand rubles can be withdrawn into a linked account at Alfa Bank in three stages of 100 thousand rubles each (or you can receive it in cash using CONTACT).  The same principle applies to all Yandex.Money accounts and applies to all expense transactions. <br><br><h4>  New rules Yandex. Money prohibit commercial activities in the system? </h4><br>  All tasks defining the format and nature of commercial activity are determined by the user independently and according to the rules established by Russian law, and not payment systems.  Yandex.Money does not regulate business in any way; our system is only a tool for online payments.  The Russian law ‚ÄúOn the national payment system‚Äù (as well as the law ‚ÄúOn banking‚Äù) requires the use of certain types of accounts to reflect transactions in the accounting of commercial organizations. <br><br>  <u>Example</u> : you got several collections of coins as a gift, but at some point you realize that you have nowhere to store these coins, and now it‚Äôs more interesting for you to convert the entire collection into two tickets in Bali.  You find several buyers on the numismatists forum, negotiate the price and payment through Yandex.Money.  Or one more example from life: you give English lessons on Skype - students pay you through Yandex.Money.  How, in such cases, do you yourself determine the format of such activities: open a legal entity, register the status of an individual entrepreneur, or do nothing?  This is your own business. <br><br>  <u>Will Yandex.Money monitor such calculations?</u>  We have no such obligation.  The system is not interested in the essence of the agreement of the account holder with those who send him money.  But we allow credits from third parties: from friends or from a stranger, to whom, say, you sold your collection of coins.  For those who sell their coins regularly, the system already proposes to use Professional Accounts, a special category of wallets with a special <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/pro/%3Ffrom%3Disuglink">complaint handling</a> mechanism (in case of violation of any agreements between the sender and the recipient of money).  The new offer Yandex.Money retains the possibility of using ‚ÄúProfessional Accounts‚Äù, but note: as before, the tax authorities do not take into account the income received on such accounts. <br><br><h5>  What you need to do online stores that accept Yandex.Money? </h5><br>  If you have a large online store and you have a direct contract with our system, then, most likely, our commercial department is already working with you - and you are in the process of renewing contracts with the Yandex.Money NGO.  Nothing special to do. <br>  If you are submitting a small Internet project that Yandex.Money collected through our special <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/embed/smallshop/">payment forms</a> , you just have to take into account new limits (see the first paragraph) or identify yourself and not depend on limits. <br><br><h4>  What happens if you do not accept the offer? </h4><br>  On the night of September 26/27, the system prohibits all expenditure transactions for users who do not accept the offer.  At the same time, the opportunity to accept the offer will of course be available after switching to NPOs - with the first payment after this date you will be offered the ‚ÄúI accept the offer‚Äù checkbox.  If you don‚Äôt want to wait, go now to the link on the <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/">main page of the Yandex.Money site</a> . <br>  For reference: <br><ul><li>  <a href="">New offer Yandex.Money</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2011/06/30/fz-dok.html">The law "On the national payment system</a> . <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2011/06/30/fz-dok.html">"</a> </li></ul><br><br>  PS If you do not find the answer to a question, ask it in the comments to this post.  Here we will answer - simply and with examples. <br><br>  <b>Maria Gracheva, Yandex.Money Business Development Director</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151290/</a></p>
