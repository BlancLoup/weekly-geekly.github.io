  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Introducing the Gates Foundation's College Knowledge Challenge Winners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/710/288/eaa/710288eaadc9497ccfffc7730883bc5b.jpg">  The competition was launched in September by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation with the aim of attracting entrepreneurs and developers to create completely new, amazing educational applications on the Facebook platform.  Called the <a href="http://www.collegeknowledgechallenge.org/">College Knowledge Challenge</a> , the competition began with the EdTech hackathon, organized jointly by the Gates Foundation and Facebook at the headquarters of the social network at Menlo Park. <br><br>  The competition called for developers of all ages to create applications that would help future college students at the stage of selecting an educational institution, enrolling in it, and also providing financial assistance. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The hackathon participants, who divided the initial prize pool in September, entered the competition for the main prize - $ 100,000.  Finally, Gates Foundation and Facebook announced 21 projects, the creators of which will take the prize with them. <br><br>  But before moving on to announcing the winners, it‚Äôs worth answering a question that arises in some readers: why it was decided to support the creation of applications for Facebook, while in the education system there are more serious problems.  Why, for example, not spend this money on the introduction of Wi-Fi in schools, which would help low-income students with Internet access and mastering computer technologies? <br>  This question is answered by Stacey Childress, Deputy Director for Education of the Gates Foundation.  She said that social networks have become the main means of building a circle of communication outside the immediate environment, which is especially important for low-income students.  Thus, Facebook contributes not only to academic success, but also stimulates perseverance in students.  Thanks to the social network, students feel more involved in public life and much more willing to stay in school.

      In turn, technology has proven its ability to democratize access to information, as well as its dissemination.  Elliot Schrage, vice president of public policy for Facebook, added that the Open Graph information exchange system from Facebook allows students to immediately share any content with each other without any difficulty.  Thus, according to Elliot Schrage, the involvement of the social network in the process of education will allow to radically change the lives of students and how they learn. <br>  The main focus of the competition was on applications for low-income students and freshmen in particular.  It is worth noting that many winners seek to gain income from the growing popularity of trends in educational technologies, personalization of the educational process, with an emphasis on first-year students and students with low incomes. <br><br>  Now is the time to move on to announcing the winners.  At the time of publication of this article, the official source provided information only on 20 projects without a single application from New York students called WOOP, which I hope will not make you feel deprived.  So, to the winners. <br><br>  <a href="http://applyful.com/">Applyful</a> .  The application is a platform for choosing a college.  Applyful helps applicants to collect, accumulate and exchange information among themselves on colleges of interest, as well as unite in groups of peers, establishing interaction with each other at the entrance stage.  This approach allows future students to make a more informed choice of school.  At the moment, is at the testing stage. <br><br>  Career Connect from ConnectEDU and CareerVillage.  This application came into being as a product of the <a href="http://www.connectedu.net/">ConnectEDU</a> collaboration, a company that connects students and career opportunities, and <a href="http://careervillage.org/">CareerVillage</a> , the creator of social games that prepare students for career building.

The application implements a step-by-step approach to the planning process and a visual representation of the progress for each student, and also added its own system of support and encouragement of students. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.collegezen.com/">CollegeZen from The College People</a> is a product from a young startup from Pittsburgh, founded by Wahab Owolabi and Neil Soni.

So, their first social application, CollegeZen, simplifies the process of finding and selecting a suitable college, as well as paying for education, especially for promising students and those parents who consider college the best place for any student. <br><br>  Degree'd by Nuvana and 10,000 Degreese - created by two companies Nuvana and 10,000 Degreese, the application uses a gaming framework to provide low-income students and their families with a comprehensive curriculum.  Using the mechanism of learning through the game, which combines the actions and obtaining useful information, Degree'd gives students access to the right information and helps them achieve success in education. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/nerdscholar/">The FAFSA Community from NerdScholar</a> - this app <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/nerdscholar/">brings</a> students, parents and administrators together via the Facebook platform.
