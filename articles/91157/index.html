      After opening the library, which received the name "National Technical Library" (Czech. "N√°rodn√≠ technick√° knihovna", abbr. "NTK"), all technical libraries located in Prague began to move.  Now separate libraries of various faculties of those.  Universities are located in one place, at the metro station Dejvick√°. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/036/7a2/b49/0367a2b49abc9804f17b30598f2c82a5.jpg" alt="IMG_5881" title="IMG_5881" width="500" height="333"></a> <br><br>  In addition, they are constantly updated with very modern and expensive literature in various languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  You do not need to buy expensive rare literature - you can take it here almost for free (a six-month subscription costs CZK 50, that is, 80 rubles). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5fd/5d4/bfe/5fd5d4bfe4bf8cc1511562bfdcc14a09.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The building is built with the most modern technology - consumes a minimum of water, electricity, provides the maximum level of comfort and automation.  The library works with minimal staff intervention - everywhere access is provided by contactless RFID reader cards, the reception and issuance of literature are automated.  Books of interest can be found using terminals located throughout (especially a lot of them near the entrance).  It is very easy to understand them, the video help scrolls endlessly at the top of the terminal.  Also, books can be searched through the <a href="http://www.techlib.cz/">official website</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8cc/db0/14e/8ccdb014eb919570196b19256cebd391.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The photo shows an example of the original NTK card, although in fact many people use university student cards, <a href="http://www.podebrady.ru/2009/10/26/isic/">ISIC</a> , city travel cards or <a href="http://www.podebrady.ru/2010/02/16/in-karta/">In-Karta railway cards</a> .  The main thing is that inside the card was a RFID tag, the appearance does not matter in the design. <br><br>  The terminal will indicate the exact location of the book on a particular stand on one of the 6 above-ground floors. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d32/a29/f56/d32a29f56a265862e76574654890ec9c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It is possible that the required book is unpopular or rare and is located in one of the underground storages - then it should be ordered in advance through a terminal or site.  You can also order literature from a giant list of libraries in Germany, USA, UK, Spain, etc.  As I understand it, no additional payments will be charged. <br><br>  To take a book home, go with it to a special terminal with a glass shelf, insert your membership card with a chip, and then a book.  The machine will issue a check with information about the book, the date it was received and the required return date.  Books are issued, as a rule, for 4 weeks - after that it can be extended or you can pay a daily fine of 1-2 crowns (2-3 rubles). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f07/73c/fb4/f0773cfb47d53bf72c07f0f4b935bbf2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Return of books is much more interesting.  In several places at the entrance to the library there are windows for receiving books.  To hand over the book, it is enough to invest in this window. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6c5/735/d8e/6c5735d8e996eb03c06a8f76fea0f49f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Then the cunning machine will close its belly, count the identification code from the chip and swallow the book.  The book will be written off from your subscription and will proceed along the conveyor to the sorting machine, which lays out the books in the necessary departments for delivery by staff.  The windows for receiving books are very clever, with many windows coming from books in just a few places and therefore the staff do not need to collect books from all over the building. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/107/fae/066/107fae06657e0b9096527b522d8f7cc8.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd6/596/687/dd6596687b7aa172167f59f9eb4bd297.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The issuance and reception of literature are as convenient as possible for both employees and visitors.  But, of course, the most interesting part of such a modern library is the reading rooms.  Here everything is created for the most convenient pastime.  Firstly, free high-speed WiFi is everywhere (access requires a reader‚Äôs number and password from it).  By itself, and sockets for laptops.  Accordingly, there are a lot of people with laptops here. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0b3/bf3/e5f/0b3bf3e5f251c6de05b3986a4c6d44f2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  WiFi covers not only all rooms of buildings and libraries, but simply the entire campus - you can lie on the lawn on the street and enjoy high-speed access. <br><br>  Secondly - on each floor there is a buffet with coffee machines and chocolate-baguette cookies.  In the Czech Republic in the student environment are very common baguettes - a long bun with various fillings.  I don‚Äôt know how to call a baguette a hamburger or a sandwich. I don‚Äôt know any analogues in Russia.  There is a baguette of 30-50 crowns (48-80 rubles).  In the NTK in the machine, it is at the lowest price, 28-30 CZK.  Coffee-tea - also at the minimum, no more than 8-10 crowns (15 rubles).  Prices inside universities are significantly lower than even in supermarkets - as far as I know, the Czech government and universities compensate part of the cost, take care of students' pockets (although higher education in Czech in all state universities for free, paid only in English).  By the way, a full hearty lunch (first-second-compote) in the university canteen costs about 50 kroons (80 rubles). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dab/ecc/081/dabecc0813d47959de3f87306d2026ee.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Thirdly - in the warm season you can go on the 6th floor to one of the open terraces for fresh air.  They are open now, but there are no people willing to sit at 10-15 degrees. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e6d/799/56b/e6d79956b0bfa16c84316d118084f7ff.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Moreover, the terraces harmoniously fit into the interior of the 6th floor, creating additional lighting. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/233/eb6/b46/233eb6b4632c511407259949a94851ba.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In NTK there are 29 individual audiences (including 2 for disabled people and 2 for the visually impaired), 18 common reading rooms and 1 automated night reading room on the 1st floor (for a separate entrance from the street it is enough to attach a library card).  Like other public places, everything is equipped to access the library of persons with disabilities.  Everything is done for people. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/738/f4c/cae/738f4ccaeed08aafcc977d71c28103ad.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Design is a separate question.  Outside is glass: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/abf/79d/928/abf79d928b0687d6fde495622f2d02eb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Inside - concrete: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b5d/2c5/3be/b5d2c53beb11fb9a0ca87fedd2c8f995.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Mrs. Librarian even noted that the construction of the library has already been completed and that it is not worth thinking that something will change.  I really like the way all excursions take place in the Czech Republic - instead of the Russian ‚ÄúDo not walk here‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo not take pictures‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo not touch anything‚Äù, on the contrary, they ask you to touch, look, try. <br><br>  The interiors in the library are original - there are cables, ventilation boxes outside, and the concrete is not painted anywhere.  But it all looks harmonious.  The drawings on the walls are made by a Romanian artist named Dan Perjovschiho.  Very extravagant, I must say, drawings. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b7b/afc/fcb/b7bafcfcbce307265bad365ca68805c2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  You can navigate through the library on foot along the stairs: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/636/fee/95e/636fee95e2b2218c767ebbc9e98e93c4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  By the way, everywhere on the steps you can see the number of calories expended to rise to it from the first floor: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/08c/9c4/954/08c9c4954ca8c7e4752e6c7bcf557bf1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Everywhere there are marks of the width and height of objects.  The perimeter and height of the building is indicated on the facade.  Separate elements are marked inside - the width of the step, for example: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/38c/431/9d0/38c4319d05975669e278333bafea9fe9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In order not to burn calories on the stairs between 9 floors - 4 modern comfortable elevators. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/527/4b1/5e3/5274b15e3499a93cad87f65dfde05f93.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, there is everything, everything, everything - even a parking lot for 300 places (as I understood it, underground), a parking lot for 200. Applicants walked around the building with an open mouth in admiration: ‚ÄúWow!  I want to study at ƒåVUT! ‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91157/</a></p>
