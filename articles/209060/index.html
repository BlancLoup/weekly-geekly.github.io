  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung branded retail in the province: we test and wonder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I already wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/195370/">here</a> that I consider smart watches in their current manifestation to be not a very successful invention.  The reasons are simple - instability, short battery life, and in some cases also a very high price.  Probably, after such statements, it will be strange to read that I did become the owner of the Samsung Galaxy Gear - perhaps the most expensive ‚Äúwatch with brains‚Äù present on the market.  It was like this: parents who had become interested in digital technology some time ago, handed over a certain amount of money to NG and told me to buy for myself ‚Äúthe very same watch that was made for my telephone‚Äù.  The right thing: I would have earned it myself - I would have taken something else, but such requests from people ‚Äúover 50‚Äù usually sound so nice that I don‚Äôt feel like resisting.  In the end, I went to look and buy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5c/032/23b/e5c03223b30fe6c80c2b1cb275b22972.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, it should be noted that in our county city of N. the most interesting novelties appear not so fast.  Things are massive and inexpensive - please, but specific gadgets come to us for many months.  I assumed that with Galaxy Gear everything would be exactly like that, but then I remembered that there were already two Samsung brand salons in the city.  The first one was opened with great fanfare last summer, the second one, it seems, in the fall.  I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs in Moscow and Kiev, but Samsung‚Äôs salons probably operate according to this scheme: the Korean company finds some local baryg entrepreneurs more decently and, under conditions unknown to me, agrees that they will conduct Samsung‚Äôs businesses locally .  For this, they get the right to be called brand retail, a sign with the big word Samsung, a bunch of stands, cute blue T-shirts for consultants and - for sure - something else there. <br><br>  So, in search of the Galaxy Gear, I found myself in the Samsung brand store, where the HD boy played the role of a consultant.  It's no secret that for some reason, the Korean company mounts the watch on very specific stands with fastening on the ‚Äúcorset‚Äù with bolts (!).  As the boy said, this is so that they are not stolen.  Well, I do not know ... Fastening smartphones to stands with cables seems much less reliable, and they are often much more expensive. <br><br>  The mount looks like this, that is, it passes under the bottom panel (facing the arm), visibly thickens the clock and does not allow to understand how they will sit on the arm without a corset.

I knew people who ordered smartphones with a diagonal of 5 inches on the Internet, then shouted that the size did not suit them, but eventually they got used to it.  Another companion bought a huge 18-inch Sony laptop on the Web, which also turned out to be too big and did not fit on the table, but he also accepted it.  But with the clock, the situation is different: they have to be constantly dragged around the wrist, and here it is important to immediately understand whether they correspond to this wrist.  I have it, for example, relatively thin, and it could be that the Galaxy Gear just does not "sit down."  And I got used to leather straps, but at Samsung‚Äôs brainchild, it is either plastic or silicone ... In short, I asked to measure it, specifying that if they did, I would buy them.  The boy froze for a couple of seconds, a little twisted, switched to Full HD mode and issued something like the following: ‚ÄúThey are difficult to unscrew, so no, I won‚Äôt give a measure.  Here you will take - then otkruchu. <br><br>  Honestly, I did a little bit ofigel.  No, I do not at all treat class consumers ‚Äúcame to success and now I look at sellers as you know what‚Äù (and we have enough of these in the provinces ‚Äî not just watched yesterday's representatives of the working class, boning consultants just for fun).  But a similar approach to customers who looked into the corporate salon of the world leader bla-bla-bla for the purchase of gizmos for $ 400, frankly, alarming.  And I'm not talking about the level of training consultants: I was warned that the clock only works with Android 4.3.  In fact, everything is a little different: Galaxy Gear is currently working only with the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy Note 3 ... (Support for a couple more models was promised, but for them, as far as I know, the corresponding updates have not yet been released.) <br><br>  Having overcome a very keen desire to promise to complain where it should be, he said that I would still take the watch.  The calculation was simple: in the yard on December 31, I wanted to go home, and if I didn‚Äôt like the way Galaxy Gear was sitting on my arm, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought anything.  Well, the boy would have to tinker with the bolts, but in the reverse order.  However, I liked the watch, and I took it. <br><br>  It would seem to complain?  Well, once stumbled upon an inhospitable consultant, it happens.  And then I remembered that fate once drove me to it - in the summer of 2013, when I was looking for a yellow Flip Cover or S View Cover for Samsung Galaxy S4.  Then I went to the same salon, but the guy could not tell me the price of the accessory, although the latter was on the display case.  I spent a long time picking at the computer, and then somehow sluggishly said: "In short, no, I don't know."  The meaning was approximately the same - pshal from here, got it.  Then I described the situation in the appropriate form on the Samsung website - they say, you train your consultants or something.  To know the prices and were a little more friendly.  A few days later, the answer came by email: ‚ÄúThank you for your interest in Samsung Electronics.  The information you provide will be taken into account and transferred to the appropriate department. ‚Äù <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know whether the robot generated this text or a living person, but the ‚Äúrelevant department‚Äù seems to be dealing in a very peculiar way with a low level of service.  Well, or the memory of HD consultants is short, and in six months its contents are completely reset. <br><br>  It is a pity that this is the place to be.  The competition is serious, and there are non-branded stores in the city, where they will not only sell you the desired thing, but also give you a kiss on the fifth point.  And even if you take out the brain of a consultant for two hours, and then you smile and you don‚Äôt buy anything, [visible] evil will not subside.  I sincerely hope that in the future, Samsung‚Äôs similar shoals will disappear from Samsung retail.  In the meantime, the ‚Äúcolor‚Äù of a particular salon, as my German teacher used to say <br><br>  PS I have already mentioned that there are two Samsung brand stores in our city.  So in the second, everything is really clear - in the good sense of the word.  Already a couple of times I bought there devices, and there are no complaints about the service at all.  This is just in case: I would not want to be recorded in the ardent samsunungonenavistniki without any reason. <br><br>  PPS Samsung Galaxy Gear were very curious in operation.  My dislike for smart watches has not disappeared anywhere, but ... In general, I will write a separate post about them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209060/</a></p>
