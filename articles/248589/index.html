I am not the most organized person in the world.  (A colleague of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/slavapankratov/" class="user_link">slavapankratov</a> loves to tell a story, how I managed to order only two of four tickets to Kazan). <br><br>  Evil tongues call us slobs.  I like the term "irrationality" better.  However, I had several attempts to do time management, and I learned one piece of advice for myself reinforced concrete.  This advice, as they say in American books, has changed my life.  And it was like that. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/448/235/ec2/448235ec25c557497cc8e55247e7bd9d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Once upon a time, even when I was working as a manager in a large company, a world leader in the production of microprocessors, I once found myself feeling sad.  The reason was eventually recognized.  I realized that my day goes by a simple repeating algorithm: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. I come to work, pour coffee and open Outlook. <br><br>  2. From Outlook'a drops a ton of mail.  The American colleagues, while we slept, worked, the Novosibirsk colleagues have been working for 3 hours already ... I start it all somehow to rake.

      3. At this moment, the local Arkharov residents run in with the words: Oh, Sasha, it‚Äôs good that you have already arrived, there is such a small question ... <br><br>  4. Further meetings begin.  In the evening - phoned with American colleagues. <br><br>  In short, the whole day you wade through this incoming stream.  By late evening you come home: <br><br>  4. The thought arises: it would be necessary to read some clever book.  The book at this moment is already on the bedside table, ready to open to you all your 192 pages of wisdom. <br><br>  5. Immediately the tired organism says: no, we need to rest.  I'll see better football.  Or I will play with the child, or my spouse will reset my husband points account. <br><br>  Here, unnoticed day and ends.  Since morning: <br><br>  1. I come to work, pour coffee and open Outlook <br><br>  ... <br><br>  Groundhog Day.  So quietly a year passes.  A year later, you look back: what was done?  Well, yes, we have released four versions of our product!  And these are just major versions! .. <br><br>  And you, here you are, dude in the mirror, what is your personal progress?  Do you even go there something? .. <br><br>  At some point, I began to remind myself of a giant meat grinder.  A dense stream of such incoming flows into it from above, and results, delegated tasks and other small stuffing fly out to the side.  And every year my throughput as a meat grinder is growing ... In fact, my life is not determined by me, but by the flow of incoming ones.  Something is wrong here‚Ä¶ <br><br>  The main enemy was identified immediately.  This is Outlook!  Here he is a villain who spoils all his life!  Therefore, the fight began immediately the next day: <br><br>  Arriving at work in the morning, I did not open mail.  It was a treacherous blow!  He immediately confused me: what to do? <br><br>  It used to be very clear what to do.  Here are the project plans, here is the mail - that's all that's written there, it's yours.  And then - it is not clear.  Began to think.  I took a piece of paper and began to write myself some tasks.  Remembered the goals.  What once was the idea to go into their own business.  I wrote myself to find some kind of seminar on this topic.  Found a seminar, signed up. <br><br>  In short, I decided to try living like that for a couple of weeks.  What turned out? <br><br>  Remember how it was written in the book ‚ÄúThe richest man in Babylon‚Äù: when you receive your salary, pay 10% yourself first.  Because otherwise, you will pay the rent, for electricity, for the loan and by the end of the month there will be nothing left. <br><br>  It feels like everything is the same over time.  Work, colleagues, family, television, social networks and many others pretend to our time.  It is very hard to find time for yourself if you first give it to others. <br><br>  In general, in the morning I made my plan for the day.  Then he added listening to all sorts of audio books and courses on the way to work.  A couple of weeks accustomed to such a regime.  And it went.  Sadness, longing said goodbye, and I even understood why. <br><br>  Because when you do something from your plan and put a plus sign on the item, you understand: yeah, I did it for YOURSELF.  Oooh, I'm not standing still, I'm not really a meat grinder ... <br><br>  Something began to change qualitatively.  A year later I went into my business, having made all the necessary preliminary steps.  Business during the 2008 crisis experienced everything he could, but in the end turned into the Stratoplan School of Managers, but that's another story. <br><br>  What is interesting is that I have been in my business for more than 6 years.  At first there was no mail, now again 300 letters a day.  And from time to time it delays.  But every six months, I say the mail is absolutely no and stop reading it in the morning.  As a prevention of sadness, melancholy. <br><br>  Why am I writing all this?  Colleagues who are constantly engaged in daily planning will tell me: Sasha, this is obvious.  Those who are not engaged, also called Captain Obvious.  And of course, you will be right.  Advice not to start your day by reading the mail is trivial.  There is no sacred knowledge. <br><br>  But before all this, I went through two time management trainings, and even tried to apply something there.  But if someone had given me advice not to read mail in the mornings a year earlier, and would insist that I use it, perhaps, I would say thanks to this person. <br><br>  The problem is not knowledge, the problem is that few people apply this knowledge.  If you are starting your day right now with mail, try to postpone it and see what will fall into your daily plan. <br><br>  PS If you have your own time management experience (I am sure that it is), and there is some one piece of advice that has brought you tremendous benefits - share it.  I am sure that this will inspire us all to return to this most necessary occupation.  Then in life there will be a qualitative change. <br><br>  PPS Before the New Year, we wrote several articles in our blog about the current information background: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245199/">How does a state or business system behave in relation to you at the moment of crisis?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245317/">How the situation developed in 2008 and counter-examples of crisis thinking, behavior and results</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245455/">Solution in statics: counter-loading information that is tested and useful in perspective (knowledge)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245685/">Dynamic Solution Check: Idle Brain and Situational Anxiety</a> </li></ul><br>  In fact, these are additional inlets in our meat grinders.  Geopolitics, conspiracy, emotions - this is all that takes our time and resources.  As Professor Preobrazhensky said there: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDon't read Soviet newspapers before dinner.‚Äù <br>  - Um ... But there are no others. <br>  - Here are no read. </blockquote><br><br>  To help with disconnecting from this background and defining our tasks for 2015, this Saturday we decided to hold a <a href="http://stratoplan.ru/school/calendar">large planning meeting on drawing up strategic plans for the year</a> .  There we will analyze another tool, after which it will become clearer what to write in daily plans.  The planning meeting is free, but requires registration (UPD: 2,500 people have already signed up - it‚Äôs incomprehensible, like everyone, but we‚Äôll think of it). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248589/</a></p>
