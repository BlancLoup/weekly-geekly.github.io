  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The details of the Google Root Car Exam are published.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In May 2012, Google was the first to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143459/">obtain a license</a> for the movement of autonomous vehicles on general roads in the state of Nevada.  Today, September 16, unmanned car traffic rules on the roads of another US state - California, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/223813/">come into effect</a> .  By this date, journalists of the IEEE Spectrum edition, using the US Freedom of Information legislation, managed to <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/how-googles-autonomous-car-passed-the-first-us-state-selfdriving-test">get copies of the</a> test <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/advanced-cars/how-googles-autonomous-car-passed-the-first-us-state-selfdriving-test">report</a> and electronic correspondence related to their conduct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/478/d50/19c/478d5019c2126b98346d820dc8b29d2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The exam was held on May 1, 2012 in Las Vegas.  As it turned out, Google representatives had the opportunity to choose the route on which the car moved during the exam, and also had the opportunity to move the test in case of bad weather.  In addition, during the exam, Google engineer, who sat behind the wheel for safety, had to take control twice.  However, in general, Google's robotic car showed its driving abilities no worse than that of the average driver.  Perhaps the main drawback noted by the examiners was the excessive caution of the robot, which seemed to start annoying them a bit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ec/7ad/95a/0ec7ad95a7adf5ee51c6a38f1428a3ea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mark in the graph about the passage of traffic lights: "It seems that the car is too cautious when approaching some traffic lights."</i>

      Google's correspondence with the Nevada State Department of Motor Vehicles also revealed that at the time of the exam, the company's security policy did not provide for the possibility of unmanned driving in some situations that are particularly difficult for a robot or dangerous for passengers and pedestrians - at railway crossings, near schools, in parking lots supermarkets, roundabouts (where, according to Google, many drivers do not know and do not follow traffic rules), as well as in fog and rain.  In addition, directly during the exam, the car "did not dare" to independently overcome a difficult turn, where part of the road was blocked due to repairs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2f/93e/248/a2f93e248ffdae0826b9f3b166d31e2a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúHaving approached the repair site, the car stopped and demanded switching to manual mode‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Since Google honestly warned the examiners about these restrictions, and given that regardless of the degree of autonomy of the car, there must be a person behind the wheel, this did not become an obstacle to obtaining a driver's license.  In most situations, both on the highway and in city traffic, both day and night, the unmanned vehicle showed itself well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ff/21d/86f/3ff21d86f1199aeb434e7b96319b9837.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Interestingly, Google almost never used a driver's license in Nevada.  After May 2013, when the first license expired, the corporation did not renew it for eight months.  The fact is that almost immediately after obtaining the license Google managed to agree on admission to general roads with the authorities of California and no longer go to the neighboring state. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237001/</a></p>
