  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Port scan using zombies.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ABOUT!  Dug out an interesting thing.  All of you probably know that hacking often begins with port scanning.  However, often with port scanning begins not only hacking. <br>  For port scanning, for example, a tool called nmap is used.  This is a console utility that can detect open ports.  And also guess what the OS is on the attacked (scanned) machine. <br>  So ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I used it the other day, and I found the possibility of hidden scanning using a zombie machine. <br>  What is the focus here - not a single packet containing the scanning address comes to the scanned machine.  And this is awesome!  The attack is very beautiful.  I do not really understand much about how TCP / IP works, but I don‚Äôt need to know much here.  Here is a description of the attack - <a href="http://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html">nmap.org/book/idlescan.html</a> <br><br>  Briefly tell how it works - <br>  When a TCP packet comes to the machine to establish a connection (it is called SYN (session establishment)), the machine can answer either SYN / ASK - that is, accept the connection, or answer RST - that is, reject it. <br>  When a machine receives a SYN / ASK packet which it does not wait for, it responds to RST, and when it receives an RST, it answers nothing. <br>  Also, on the Internet (IP networks), you can send a packet with any return address.  It is clear that the answer to it should not be expected, this answer will go to a fake return address. <br>  And the last - that actually allows the attack.  Most systems number ALL IP packets in a row, regardless of the recipient.  Packages must be numbered so that the recipient can collect them in the correct order upon arrival. <br>  The fact that the packets are numbered in a row means that you can find out how many packets were sent by computer B between two requests from computer A to it. <br><br>  How is the attack - <br>  There are 2 cars - A, C. Machine A wants to secretly scan C. For this, she randomly selects any weakly loaded ‚Äúzombie‚Äù car on the Internet - B. She sends her an IP packet and finds out the IPID of this machine. <br>  Now she sends the SYN to machine C, but does the return address to B. <br>  Then there are 2 options. <br>  1. The port on machine C is open, and it sends the answer (and it is sent to machine B) - SYN / ASK.  Machine B responds to her RST, since it does not wait for the connection, and generally hears about it for the first time.  But its IPID increases by 1. <br>  2. The port on the machine C is closed, and that sends RST, again machine B (about And she does not know anything at all).  Machine B as it should be, according to the rules, ignores this packet and its IPID does not increase. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Now the malicious, pimply and unwashed hacker can send another IP packet to machine B and receive a response in which there is a new IPID of machine B. If it differs from the first request by 1, then the port on machine C is closed.  And if on 2 - that is open!  So that! <br>  Note machine B - did not get infected with anything, and machine C did not receive one hint of the one who didn‚Äôt actually scan it. <br><br>  In the English article on the reference there are wonderful pictures, for those who do not understand anything, but who are interested.  And there is a picture of how the RIAA was scanned.  It's right.  RIAA should die. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40413/</a></p>
