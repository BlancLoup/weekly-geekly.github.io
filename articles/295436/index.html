And when I saw the book ‚ÄúThe Pyramid of Efficiency‚Äù, I mentally rolled my eyes, asking: ‚ÄúIs it really possible to write something new on this topic?‚Äù.  As it turned out, quite! <br><br><br>  Tamara Myles, a certified trainer on productivity, gathered all the necessary knowledge and methods into one book, calling her idea simple and clear.  Well, why wise? <br><br>  <b>Efficiency Pyramid Levels</b>

      1. Organization of working space. <br>  2. Organization of electronic documents and resources. <br>  3. Time management skills. <br>  4. Verify compliance with goals and actions. <br>  5. Opportunities like openness to new victories and goals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/e51/154/f3ae511544d540a580af4625dc94b19c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  <b><u>Level One: Workspace Organization</u></b> </h5><br>  Letters, reports and other documents often constitute the bulk of the work.  To make it easy to understand them, divide the papers into 3 parts: those that need to be thrown out, saved or immediately responded (pay, reply, delegate). <br>  Key words in the choice of paper storage method - convenience and speed of access.  Distribute them in different categories: ‚ÄúReports by Month‚Äù, ‚ÄúTerms of Reference‚Äù and so on.  Well, let's work shredder - get rid of unnecessary documents in time! <br><br>  <b>Chips for a clear organization of space:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Immediately disassemble the incoming paper in 3 directions (throw out, respond, save). <br>  ‚Ä¢ To systematize, use color coding, sticking on the edges of folders with the appropriate color tape (red - reports, green - teaching and learning materials, blue - briefs, etc.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Store documents into wall shelves, cabinets, racks, boxes, using a convenient type of systematization (chronological, alphabetic, by category, by number). <br><br>  <b><u>Personal experience:</u></b> I use several types of folders.  I keep urgent, temporary papers on each project in usual corners for each project - the number of publications on the project per day or month, the wishes of customers, notes to unpublished articles, ideas.  In folders on buttons or rubber bands I have carefully laid out logins, passwords, technical tasks.  In plastic briefcases - archive. <br><br><h5>  <b><u>Second level: organization of electronic documents and resources</u></b> </h5><br>  The ‚Äúthrow / execute / archive‚Äù principle also works at this level of the efficiency pyramid.  With an unwavering hand, send unnecessary documents to the recycle bin, and save the necessary documents in certain folders.  How to systematize?  As you wish.  Define the principles of the names of folders and documents (job categories, surnames, project keywords) and adhere to these principles. <br><br>  <b>Chips for working with electronic documents:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ In time, unsubscribe from unnecessary mailings and remove spam.  And automatic folding into folders in the mail browser will greatly facilitate the work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use data backup systems or duplicate important information on hard drives. <br>  ‚Ä¢ For storage and quick access from anywhere in the world, you can use "clouds", for example, Yandex.Disk, Google Drive, DropBox, SugarSync. <br><br>  <b><u>Personal experience:</u></b> oh-oh-oh, at the second level I was stuck for a long time, having a habit of creating documents with names like "Vasya contact."  I admit honestly, I did not manage without outside help.  Together with me, I developed a whole scheme of folders, labels, labels and symbols.  My main tools are Yandex.Disk and Evernote.  In the first one I create all the documents, in the second I keep tables, counts, make plans. <br><br><h5>  <b><u>Level Three: Time Management Skills</u></b> </h5><br>  Technician and time management methods are a huge amount: ‚ÄúEat a frog‚Äù, To-do List, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/245587/">Eisenhower Matrix</a> , ‚Äú <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/20162/">Pomodoro Method</a> ‚Äù, mental maps, ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/166681/">Cut the elephant into steaks</a> ‚Äù, Alps.  You can even buy a diary of Gleb Arkhangelsky or a nice leather cover design.  The main thing is that your time should be clearly planned. <br><br>  <b>Chips for proper time allocation:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Get rid of multitasking.  The brain works much more efficiently if it needs to solve only one task. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not share the calendar for personal and work - because you have only one life.  Make in planning all trips to doctors, family activities and work presentations - so you can clearly see the whole picture of your life. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Find thieves (checking email, social networks) and destroy them. <br><br>  <b><u>Personal experience:</u></b> I have 2-3 work periods during the day.  At the first peak of working capacity from 9 am to 11 am, I turn off the mountains and take the most difficult things.  Then the second period from 14 to 16 hours.  Here I am cleaning up tails, doing work that does not require concentration.  If I break a big project into ‚Äústeaks,‚Äù I can take a second period for it.  To control myself, I use CrocoTime, the Tomato method, I work with only one browser tab, whenever possible, or even close everything except Word. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/913/2c4/b409132c49d244bfb87d57dcf8ff9bba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b><u>Level Four: Matching Goals and Actions</u></b> </h5><br>  There is nothing to periodically return to previous levels.  Did you get promoted?  Perfectly!  Then you will again have to organize the physical space by embedding new documents in it, change calendar entries and revise existing goals. <br>  ‚ÄúHaving a goal means living every day, thinking about its desired result, doing something that will help to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and see the picture in perspective,‚Äù says Tamara Myles. <br><br>  <b>Chips to help achieve goals:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Commitment, clear demonstration of readiness to achieve goals.  Some ask for repost in social networks, so that people know - ‚ÄúSergey plans to attract 150 new clients to the company‚Äù, the second disciplines themselves with the help of such services as <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> , attracting subscribers who remind of the chosen course in time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Understanding the importance of the goal.  How will your life change when the goal is achieved?  What feelings will you experience and how much better will you feel? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Formulation of the goal and its decomposition into small tasks.  Keep calendars in which local achievements are noted.  For example, the mark ‚ÄúI mastered grammar!‚Äù In February will vividly demonstrate that the goal - to learn a language is quite achievable. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use infographics.  Draw charts, curves, tables to see intermediate results and set local, small tasks. <br><br>  <b><u>Personal experience:</u></b> when I am big, I divide the global goal into small stages, it becomes easier to achieve it.  As a tool, <b>SmartProgress is</b> convenient for me here.  In my account I can correctly formulate my goal, peek at how others do it, make a clear plan of action and break the whole way to the goal into small segments.  And then, as you know, the road will be mastered: I start walking or sometimes even crawling towards the goal. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/879/e41/009879e418414194ae9363c8bf5298ee.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  <b><u>Fifth level: opportunities like openness to new victories and goals</u></b> </h5><br>  ‚ÄúOrder on the table - order in thoughts - clarity of goal‚Äù - this is how you can briefly formulate the essence of the Pyramid of efficiency.  At this level, visible opportunities help maximize their potential, without being distracted by finding the right papers or unimportant meetings. <br><br>  <b>Chips to search for opportunities:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Be active.  Learn new trends, read books, play sports, in general, constantly keep your mind and body in good shape. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enjoy.  Psychologists have shown that in a favorable state of mind a person pays more attention to the world around.  So, you can notice the new features and take advantage of them. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Experiment.  Novelty makes our brain work differently, to look at things from an unusual point of view. <br><br>  <b><u>Personal experience:</u></b> if I‚Äôve got a lot of projects, I don‚Äôt see new opportunities, I just don‚Äôt have time to react to them.  Therefore, I give myself the right to rest and watch deadlines, breaking the project into several parts.  Jamming on the topic ‚ÄúAAA, tomorrow I have to take a sammari, but I have not read the book‚Äù in this case is excluded.  I submit the task on time and I have free time to look around, see new interesting areas of work, and just enjoy life. <br><br>  Climbing to the top of the pyramid, you may be amazed at the new prospects.  Think: what do you want?  What owns your thoughts?  How can you achieve what you want?  This is the fifth level of the pyramid of efficiency.  You are ready to use the opportunities.  So go and do it! <br><br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress - achieving goals</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295436/</a></p>
