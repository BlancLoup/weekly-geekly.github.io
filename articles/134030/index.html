    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Summary of post: <br><br>  1. CINEMA 3D: technological features, special glasses, the absence of interference and flicker. <br><br>  2. Application: how and on what devices it works. <br><br>  And now let's take a closer look at everything. <br><br>  <b>Technological features of CINEMA 3D</b> <br><br>  CINEMA 3D - 3D-technology screens from LG Electronics.  Many have probably heard such a term as FPR (Film-type Patterned Retarder). <br><br>  With this technology (it is also called ‚Äúpassive‚Äù), two images are available to the viewer simultaneously.  And all this is perfectly safe for the eyes!  The 3D effect appears flicker-free.  This was made possible thanks to special polarized 3D glasses. <br><br>  Read more about glasses read on. <br><br>  Where does the name CINEMA 3D come from?  Technology owes its name to 3D films going to the cinema and thus to the first special glasses that were given to the audience (complete with a napkin, of course). <br><br>  Officially, CINEMA 3D technology was introduced in May 2011.  In the near future, the LG Display division plans to release 3D displays for which special 3D glasses will not be needed.  This technology is called auto-stereoscopic. <br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D: Flicker-Free Image</b> <br><br>  Where does the flicker effect come from?  In most cases, because of the glasses, or to be more precise, because of the interaction of glasses with other light sources.  Researches say that 90% of 3D TV viewers like Shutter Glasses notice flicker.  The Japanese 3D consortium (there is one) even issued a warning that "flickering can lead to photosensitive epilepsy." <br><br>  In CINEMA 3D technology, flicker is completely absent.  And thanks for this, again, points! <br><br>  And CINEMA 3D allows you to watch TV without interference and more clearly, because FPR technology initially divorces the right and left image. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2oto.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Technological features of CINEMA 3D</b> <br><br>  Another advantage of CINEMA 3D - the 3D effect is available to a large number of viewers, regardless of body position.  With the usual LED-LCD television screens of the previous generation, you would not be able to watch TV in 3D lying, and here you are.  And all because of the increased parameter of the viewing angle (with CINEMA 3D, it is more than 170 ¬∞). <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3huh.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CINEMA 3D technology is capable of artificially increasing the frame rate at 4 times from 60 to 240 frames per second.  As a result, the image is perceived more clearly, realistic and alive - especially in dynamic episodes. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/4mjm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>From 2D to 3D</b> <br><br>  Turn any 2D image (games, movies, etc.) into 3D with CINEMA 3D technology - no problem!  What is the conversion of the image?  Due to the clear contrast on the screen (between large and small objects, their intersection or due to different levels of brightness or clarity), which causes your eye to perceive the picture differently. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5nnn.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D glasses</b> <br><br>  About polarized (or FPR) 3D glasses, we have already spoken at the very beginning.  Points of this type allow you to view three-dimensional image on any 3D-devices from LG.  And the same glasses (which, by the way, are 10 times cheaper than active - their price is only 5-7 dollars) are suitable for viewing not only the TV content, but also the monitor screen, mobile device and even the projector.  This means only one thing: now you can enjoy volume content at home with the same level of image quality as in the cinema. <br><br>  And the good news is for those who wear glasses with diopters: LG offers several modifications, including a model that simply puts on over ordinary glasses. <br><br>  At leisure, compare the models of the usual active glasses (Shutter Glasses) and glasses CINEMA 3D (FPR): <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/6ziz.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And also, which is also important - CINEMA 3D glasses do not need batteries and other energy sources, which significantly reduces their weight.  In addition, with them you are not exposed to electromagnetic radiation, which is dangerous to health. <br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D: TVs</b> <br><br>  CINEMA 3D - so called all new LG TVs.  Depending on the country, model names may vary.  But still, the name of the model includes the code CINEMA 3D - LW, followed by the size: 42, 47, 55 and 65 inches.  Models with the DM code (also known as ‚ÄúSecond TV‚Äù and - a little earlier - as ‚ÄúTV monitor‚Äù) are available with a 23-inch diagonal. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/7lhl.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D: monitors</b> <br><br>  CINEMA 3D is not only TVs, but also monitors with full full HD support.  For example, the model D2342P-PN supports a low load of the personal computer system and does not require additional elements to view 3D content.  A set of glasses is attached to the monitor, as well as to the TV. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/8mhm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D: laptops</b> <br><br>  The LG A520 laptop ‚Äî the next model after the A510 ‚Äî is known as the world's first personal computer with 3D technology.  This model is available with a 15.6 inch screen with full HD support, a 750GB hard drive and an Nvidia Geforce 500 graphics card. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/9zsz.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>CINEMA 3D: how it works</b> <br><br>  Why is CINEMA 3D cool? <br><br>  First briefly about how the stereoscopic effect of a moving picture is achieved.  Two images overlap and are projected onto the same screen through polarized filters in the opposite direction.  The spectator's glasses are equipped with pairs of analyzing filters (polarizers of a rounded shape in a different direction) - again, the opposite direction.  The light, polarized on the left, is extinguished by the analyzer on the right, exactly the same thing happens on the other side.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/10rdr.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The three-dimensional image CINEMA 3D appears due to two divorced images and is completely safe, since the twinkling is completely extinguished by polarized glasses.  But we talked about this earlier. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/11wpw.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is not surprising that viewers' preferences are on the side of FPR technology. <br><br>  <b>What do the viewers choose</b> <br><br>  In America, 3D TVs were tested for image quality, 3D glasses comfort, 3D effects quality, in which a number of models were offered to viewers.  For the purity of the experiment, the manufacturers' logos were hidden.  80% of respondents preferred 47LW5600 - one of the TV models with CINEMA 3D TV, and other 3D convection TVs. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/12kkk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What users choose</b> <br><br>  Similar studies (albeit, now not only in the USA, but also in Russia, Italy, and South Korea) were also carried out for 3D monitors.  We are pleased that LG CINEMA 3D monitors were chosen by 77% of respondents. <br>  Most participants noted that during the test, the eyes felt much better when working with these monitors, and not with SC technology monitors. <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/sed8dd" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in general, that's all. <br><br>  It is clear that to squeeze in one post all that we would like to tell about CINEMA 3D, is simply unrealistic.  So, if you are interested in this topic, then velkam: <br><br>  1. Beautiful and detailed about CINEMA 3D TVs <a href="http://www.lg.com/ru/cinema3d/index.jsp">here</a> . <br><br>  2. Visually about CINEMA 3D monitors <a href="http://www.lg.com/ru/press-release/article/lg-3d-monitors.jsp">here</a> . <br><br>  3.
