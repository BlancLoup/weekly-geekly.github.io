      The following are ideas that will help make online support effective: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. <b>Be available</b> . <br>  No one forces your managers to work around the clock, but the status of "offline" near the "chat with the operator" button during working hours is not credible.  If you can not provide support at least in business time, then you can even abandon this idea? <br><br>  A good solution is the written schedule of work of managers near the chat button. <br><br>  2. <b>Be polite and follow etiquette</b> . <br>  It may sound funny, but not everyone remembers to say hello and say goodbye! <br>  Many chat services offer the visitor to introduce themselves before asking a question.  Then why do not you contact the person by name? !!! <br><br>  There is nothing more discouraging than rude and stupid support responses.  And for God's sake, do not argue with customers) <br><br>  3. <b>Constantly improve the art of communication and sales</b> . <br>  Your task is to help the visitor.  To help deal with your service and product.  Treat the visitor as a pleasant guest and then he may become your client.  Collect sample questions and scenarios, analyze and prepare good answers to them. <br><br>  A typical mistake can be considered the silence of the manager after the greeting (often automatic).  "Hello" ... Help a person navigate: "Hello, Michael!  Ask your questions. ‚Äù <br><br>  4. <b>Smile to your guests</b> . <br>  If the selected chat allows you to set a photo manager, be sure to use this feature.  Let the support be with a human face.  But do not rush if you do not have a good, welcoming photo.  Dark or red faces with flare and fatigue on the face are suitable only to please your competitors. <br><br>  5. <b>Do not redirect questions to other managers without extreme need</b> . <br>  Try to answer completely, without discrediting your competence and not forcing the visitor to explain the same thing several times.  If you need an explanation of another specialist - contact him independently, without transferring the client. <br><br>  6. <b>Be more flexible</b> . <br>  Studying the work of support on two competing sites, we specifically asked managers for a non-standard service.  At one of them we were told ‚ÄúSorry, we can‚Äôt‚Äù, and on the other they said: ‚ÄúActually, we don‚Äôt work like that, but wait a minute, I‚Äôll clarify what you can think of.‚Äù  And we were offered an alternative option.  Which store will you come next time: the one where you were refused or the one where you tried to understand and help? <br><br>  This does not mean that you need to deviate from corporate principles or rules.  Just initially, you can lay a small margin that managers can use as space for maneuver. <br><br>  7. <b>Promised - execute!</b> <br>  Your reputation can be "drained" in a jiffy.  Think carefully before you make a promise to customers.  Empty promises are worse than failure! <br><br>  8. <b>Do not become robots, communicate</b> . <br>  In the third paragraph, we have already spoken about the response scenarios.  They help save your manager time.  They help to solve typical situations.  But do not abuse it.  After all, your client went to the chat, and not in the section "Help on the site."  And rightly awaits the dialogue.  If you need to insert a large standard phrase, at least pretend that you type it <br><br>  The checklist for organizing support for online stores contains much more than eight items.  However, compliance with at least these small rules will allow you to avoid the dissatisfaction of your customers and increase their loyalty. <br><br>  <i>This and other articles can be found on the <a href="http://ish.com.ua/">blog about online stores in Ukrainian realities.</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54630/</a></p>
