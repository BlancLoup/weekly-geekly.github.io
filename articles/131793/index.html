Recently, UPSs are increasingly common not only among advanced PC users, but also among ordinary consumers who want to protect their consumer electronics from power surges and a sudden power outage.  In one of our previous reviews, we talked about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apc/blog/117819/">APC Power Saving Back-UPS Pro 550</a> .  In today's article we would like to talk about the latest new product from APC by Schneider Electric - Back-UPS 650 (BX650CI-RS). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Back-UPS 650 uninterruptible power supply is designed for operation in areas with unstable power supply and is equipped with an automatic voltage stabilization (AVR) function.  Thanks to this function, the UPS drives the overvoltage and undervoltage to a safe level for electrical engineering and allows it to be operated with unstable voltage in the power grid.  But the main function of all UPSs is the ability to provide backup power from a battery, devices connected to it during a brief power outage.  According to the manufacturer, the power of the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù should be enough to ensure the functioning of the equipment with a power consumption of 300 W for 3.5 minutes.  Thus, sudden power outages, which in recent years have become far from the most rare, will not take you by surprise.  As far as the data provided by the manufacturer coincide with the real indicators, we will see a little later. <br><br>  In recent years, the use of UPS is not limited to the protection of only desktop PCs and computer equipment.  These devices are increasingly used in everyday life to protect the power supply of various consumer electronics, as well as life support systems in country houses, for example, the electronics of gas heaters used to heat water.  In case of a sudden, short-term power outage, the presence of such a UPS will allow to ‚Äúhold out‚Äù until the power supply is restored or an external generator is connected.

      Monitoring the status of the UPS and the electrical network is carried out using a light indicator and audible alarm.  If the mains voltage disappears, the UPS goes offline, which is indicated by a flashing light and an intermittent beep. <br><br>  The UPS is configured using the proprietary utility PowerChute.  The program allows you to monitor the main parameters of the uninterruptible power supply, as well as calculate the battery life of the connected devices, based on the battery charge level.  In the event of a long power outage, PowerChute can automatically start the data saving and shutting down the PC procedure. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics of Back-UPS 650 (BX650CI-RS):</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/b08/3c7/981b083c701abd8096ac4817c61bc452.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Appearance and equipment</b> <br><br>  Like most of their older ‚Äúmates,‚Äù from the Back-UPS family, the BX650CI-RS uninterrupted power source is packaged in a discreet box of recycled cardboard.  APC by Schneider Electric adheres to an environmental conservation course, and therefore uses recycled materials to make packaging for its products. <br><br>  Since Back-UPS 650 is an entry-level device, the device does not involve anything extra: in the box, in addition to the UPS itself, you can find instructions and cables to protect the telephone line.  If in the future the user wants to be sure that the data will be saved during a long power outage and the PC is turned off correctly, he can additionally purchase a cable for connection with the computer and download the PowerChute program from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. <br><br>  Unlike the previous UPS model, considered by us earlier, the Back-UPS 650 model has a non-removable battery, which means that in the event of a malfunction, its replacement is possible only in an authorized service center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ae/144/8b4/7ae1448b4a8bf9f9ce51e4f8d77dd65a.jpg"><br><br>  The appearance of the device does not have the original design or unusual color design - in front of us is a classic UPS, in black with the familiar ‚ÄúAPC‚Äù logo on the case.  On the front panel of the uninterruptible power supply is a power button, combined with a light indicator.  On the rear panel there are three standard, European sockets, a reset fuse button, two RJ-45 connectors for connecting secure telephony and a USB port with which the UPS can be connected to a desktop PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2c/806/858/b2c806858ebdd9068c84e796456f2c88.jpg"><br>  <i>Any new UPS will be accompanied by a factory test report.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a94/fdf/67d/a94fdf67dbc6ffb2568a3c3b9d29a5fe.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a2/526/1ea/8a25261ea376c0fd84cd2a8bbd856524.jpg"><br><br>  Since the battery in this model of UPS is not removable, after purchase it is necessary to install the plug located in the upper right corner of the UPS in the appropriate slot to connect it.  Thus, the battery of the new uninterruptible power supply is protected from discharge during storage and transportation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/678/f04/183/678f0418332a76a0d2c60902d0021f79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db9/ca3/4ef/db9ca34ef81589d7903a04a3cbc564e2.jpg"><br>  <i>The battery is connected and the UPS is fully operational.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/690/e94/0cb/690e940cb197b7da232086c637c6cb5f.jpg"><br>  <i>The package is minimal, the manufacturer offers to purchase a cable for connecting to a PC separately.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bf/327/81d/9bf32781d58941192697f15a95872e42.jpg"><br>  <i>Optional accessories: USB cable for connecting to a PC and a disk with the program PowerChute</i> <br><br>  <b>Testing</b> <br><br>  The test bench on which the capabilities of the UPS were tested has not changed from the previous review and still consists of a desktop PC and a plug-in laboratory autotransformer ATP-2 kVA.  You can <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apc/blog/117819/">view</a> your PC configuration <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apc/blog/117819/">in the overview of the</a> APC Power Saving Back-UPS Pro 550 uninterruptible power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/746/e2b/bcf/746e2bbcfe7181d41f9913e525f400d3.jpg"><br>  <i>Test bench: desktop PC, UPS and transformer ATR-2 kVA</i> <br><br>  Reducing and increasing the voltage with the help of a transformer, we traced at what values ‚Äã‚Äãthe voltage of the UPS switches to different modes of operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/333/3b8/584/3333b85841b10d1f56d267b897aaf3f6.jpg"><br><br>  To control the parameters of the UPS, we used a proprietary utility PowerChute.  Details about the work we described in our previous review.  Below are a few screenshots showing the main items for setting up and monitoring the status of the UPS. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4522/106136655.c/0_6b986_6e48b8de_XL.jpg"><br>  <i>Main menu of the PowerChute program</i> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5313/106136655.c/0_6b987_8d04271e_XL.jpg"><br>  <i>Set the upper and lower thresholds of the UPS</i> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4712/106136655.c/0_6b988_929f9024_XL.jpg"><br>  <i>Battery condition and charge level (mains powered)</i> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4418/106136655.c/0_6b989_3f5a24f1_XL.jpg"><br>  <i>Battery condition and charge level (UPS offline)</i> <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4712/106136655.c/0_6b98a_225d153b_XL.jpg"><br>  <i>Sleep mode setting</i> <br><br>  Using a transformer, we simulated a drop in and increase in the voltage in the power grid, monitored the operation of the automatic voltage stabilization system (AVR), and also determined the threshold of the autonomous mode switching the UPS to battery operation. <br>  When the mains voltage drops to 198V, the internal transformer of the UPS switches to the first step-up winding, stabilizing the output voltage.  A further reduction in voltage to 166V switches the transformer to the second step winding.  When the voltage is reduced to 140V, the transformer of the uninterruptible power supply switches to the third winding, and with an even greater voltage drop, the UPS switches to the autonomous power mode from the built-in battery.  Power off mode occurs when the input voltage rises to 154V.  Then, with a gradual increase in the input voltage, the transformer of the UPS connects the step-up windings ‚Äî the first one at 178V and the second one at 208V.  If the supply voltage is much higher than the standard, the UPS connects the down-winding, this happens at a voltage above 254V.  Thus, the AVR system allows you to protect equipment with sudden voltage drops in the power grid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/029/bbe/813/029bbe813ff2e55e80e020633e3c3f0d.jpg"><br>  <i>Autotransformer UPS winding switching graph versus voltage change</i> <br><br>  <i>Video of the UPS, depending on changes in supply voltage:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v76y8nUoKI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiFZiz4vIDDW4u4ufU3cezdt2m1Tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Working offline in the UPS allows you to save important information during a sudden power outage, as well as correctly complete all IT equipment shutdown procedures.  The autonomous operation time of the test bench with a load of 85 watts when the power supply was disconnected and the source went offline was 21 minutes 10 seconds.  This time is more than enough not only to save important information, but also to troubleshoot the power grid, or to switch power supply to the generators. <br><br>  Concluding the review of the UPS, the following conclusions can be made: The Back-UPS 650 UPS is a simple and inexpensive uninterruptible power supply, without any frills, but reliable and well suited to provide protection for both the home workstation and any other consumer electronics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131793/</a></p>
