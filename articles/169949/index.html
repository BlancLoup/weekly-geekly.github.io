  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview for junior position. Antipertenants interviewing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon habrayuzer!  Not so long ago, I started looking for a job for a junior developer position.  Even thanks to my modest resume, I was able to attend many interviews in a relatively short period of time.  From each interview, I endured something new for myself, somewhere there were my punctures, but it was much more interesting to notice the contacts of me.  Actually, I would like to talk about such punctures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here typical questions and answers will not be presented, and for certain this material will be more useful for the interviewer than for those who will be interviewed.  Although at the end of the article I highlighted a few, in my opinion, good rules when conducting an interview.  I think it will be useful to get acquainted with them all. <br>  It is worth noting that this material does not claim to be the ultimate truth.  On Habr√© from time to time there are articles on this topic.  I decided to describe a job search from the position of a junior developer, in search of a specific job that met certain requirements (who now thought about money - you have a bad approach to recruiting :)).  To summarize the names of companies omitted. <br><br>  Immediately, I‚Äôll make a reservation that I‚Äôll consider interviews for a junior developer‚Äôs job, and I agree in advance that much of what is said here may not be applicable or is not so relevant to the position of middle / senior.  All the positive or negative points that I remember, I decided to group and give them a name.  It turned out something similar to patterns and anti-beer, with them I propose to become familiar. <br><br><h4>  Antiparenting interviews </h4><br><h5>  1) Template questions </h5><br>  Tell me, why should a senior programmer, and especially a tmlid, bother to invent new insidious questions if you can go in and just type something like ‚Äúquestions to C # junior developer‚Äù in the search.  It's so wonderful when in a second you can print out these standard questions that fully reflect the required knowledge.  We can all imagine the ideal version when the interviewer asks a list of questions from the site that the candidate read 15 minutes ago.  Here you can certainly hope for complete understanding.  Of course, this happens extremely rarely, because Google / Yandex / Bing does not give out the same results to candidates for a vacancy and people conducting an interview. <br>  Speaking absolutely seriously, I think that the only person who has the right to ask standard questions is HR.  All technical questions can and should be changed (namely, ‚Äúchange‚Äù and not ‚Äúreplace‚Äù) in order to make the respondents think and not say the same text a hundred times. <br>  I completely failed to say my first interview, because I did not answer a few such questions, but the second reminded me of checking the multiplication table.  I sometimes had the feeling that the people interviewing me really read the same article as I was 15 minutes ago.  But the saddest thing is that apart from these routine questions I was never asked anything.

    <h5>  2) Why ask for a job? </h5><br>  This antipattern, as the logic tells me, is extremely rare.  But when he gets you, you know you got great luck.  When you reach the tmlid you will be able to tell stories in the style, but as for me at the interview ... <br>  Its essence lies in the banal things.  You just do not ask for a job.  At all:).  All that you have prepared, everything for which you have prepared, keep it with you.  It happens when the company simply does not have specialists from your area, but there are other good specialists.  Let's say the company has no iPhone programmers, but there are Android developers who are happy to ask you about the intricacies of activity lifecycle).  It is also possible to rank here the remarkable question of the interviewee: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how it is implemented in the X language, but in the Y language it is implemented this way and that.  Please compare me with the implementation. ‚Äù <br>  Considering that you are just going to the junior developer position, a reasonable question arises: from whom will you actually learn and on whose example can you improve your skills?  Unfortunately, the anti-pattern does not give an answer to this question. <br><br><h5>  3) We will conduct an interview with the whole company) </h5><br>  Well, when you are at the beginning of the interview, PM talks about the project and the company and simultaneously performs the role of HR (for lack of one).  Bad when then in a technical interview, when you should ask those.  Specialist, PM is sitting next to and looking carefully at you then on those.  specialist.  Again, from my own experience, it seems to me that at such an interview the technician is experiencing even more than the one he is interviewing.  In fact, he also conducts an interview in front of the chief).  In addition, in this case, the one who will be interviewed does not really know who is better to answer.  If you ignore PM at all, it turns out that something like an interrogation under.  watching glass, but without glass. <br>  This anti-paternal is rather my personal conviction about how an interview should proceed, but still, maybe someone will find it reasonable. <br><br><h5>  4) Repetition is the mother of learning. </h5><br>  Have you ever had a sense of d√©j√† vu when passing the next interview?  Especially when you have to answer once again what singleton is and what it is eaten with.  It probably happens.  Especially if you have to answer 2 times in the same company, and even at the same interview.  This happens when the PM decides that he (or she) is universal, and can also conduct those interviews.  It is especially funny when such an interview goes after an interview with a real technical specialist, and in a commonwealth with the first anti-patron, it turns out to be a combo at all. <br>  It is no secret that sometimes, when you incorrectly answer a question, you are immediately told the correct answer.  In the case of this anti-patern, there is a unique opportunity to fill up all the technical issues and then immediately correct it. <br><br><h5>  5) Never give test tasks home.  Never! </h5><br>
