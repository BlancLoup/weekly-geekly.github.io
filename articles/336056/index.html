But how and what to do in practice is not so clear.  On webinars and in the process of negotiation with potential clients, we constantly face a large number of different kinds of innovation issues.  We selected 35 of them and asked our experts to answer them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/744/6e5/69e/7446e569eebf437dbc2fbb2d69ade175.jpg"><br><br>  Answers under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Check Formation </h2><br>  <i>1. Is there any time during payment for goods via the Internet during which you need to print a receipt and transfer it to the operator of fiscal data (CRF).</i>  <i>For example, 5 minutes from the date of payment?</i>

      <br>
      There should be no time delays.  Under the new law, the check should be sent to the OFD immediately after its formation. <br><br>  <i>2. Do I need to form a new check if the buyer entered the email address and phone with an error and noticed it after the payment?</i> <br><br>  If the buyer is wrong, then the responsibility is on him.  It is not necessary to form a new check, because it will lead to its duplication.  Just call the customer the parameters of the check, for which he can find it in an electronic format (in the CRF, or the Mobile Check Checks mobile application for Android and iOS). <br><br>  <i>3. Do I need to issue a check when returning the goods?</i> <br><br>  Under the new rules, the return operation requires a receipt.  In such a situation, for the new requisite of the check ‚ÄúSign of settlement‚Äù, select the value ‚ÄúReturn of the parish‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>4. How to issue a check when you return is not "day to day"?</i> <br><br>  For any return, a cash voucher is drawn up, in which the value ‚ÄúReturn of the parish‚Äù is selected in the ‚ÄúSign of settlement‚Äù requisite.  In this case, a refund is not necessary to spend the day and can be done at any cash desk of the organization (that is, not necessarily at the same one on which the sales check was made) <br><br>  <i>5. Does the QR code on the check print automatically or does it need to include special settings?</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b04/974/074/b049740748264e96b7ce875420a350c3.jpg"><br><br>  On the paper version of the check, the code is printed automatically, but for this you need to enable the corresponding setting in the checkout.  And in the case of sending an electronic check, the QR code is formed by the operator of fiscal data. <br><br>  <i>6. If an organization applies a simplified taxation system, is it obligated to print the entire nomenclature on the check?</i> <br><br>  If you do not sell excisable goods and are an individual entrepreneur, you can leave out the name and quantity of the goods on the receipt until 01.02.2021. <br><br>  <i>7. What data about the cashier, except for the full name, must be indicated in the check?</i> <br><br>  In addition to the name of the cashier indicated his position.  In the electronic version of the check, sent to the CRF, in formats FFD 1.05 and 1.1., It is also necessary to indicate the TIN of the cashier, if there is one.  In the case of using the cash desk in a non-operating mode (payments on the Internet, payment terminals and vending), it is necessary to print / display the slot number on the check. <br><br>  <i>8. Do I need to keep a cashier-cashier's logbook when using the online cash desk?</i> <br><br>  If you are using an online cash register, then the cashier‚Äôs teller‚Äôs log is not required.  This moment is explained in the letter of the Ministry of Finance of September 16, 2016 No. 03-01-15 / 5441. <br><br>  <i>9. If the contract with the CRF does not provide for the transfer of the check to the buyer, who should transfer it: online cash desk (ATOL) or should the company itself provide for such a possibility?</i> <br><br>  The company should provide such an opportunity itself. <br><br><h2>  Features of the use of cash registers for the sale of goods / services via the Internet </h2><br>  <i>10. Can an online store not buy / not rent a cash desk and at the same time work in accordance with 54-FZ from July 1, 2017?</i> <br><br>  Yes, two options are possible: <br><br><ul><li>  Use an external delivery service.  If the buyer pays cash on delivery, the courier must use the courier, who delivers the goods. </li><li>  Use cashless payments (Internet banking).  In the case when the money is transferred to the account of an online store without using a card, the cash desk until July 1, 2018 is not needed. </li></ul><br>  <i>11. Is it possible to use the cash desk marked ‚ÄúF‚Äù for payments on the Internet?</i> <br><br>  Yes you can.  For payments on the Internet, you can use any of the online cash registers - they allow you to generate both electronic and paper checks.  For example, the ATOL cash desks can disable the mandatory printing of a paper check and use it both at the point of issue of the goods and for payments on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3c3/e89/9e5/3c3e899e578b47319990a3ccc8f3c71b.png"><br>  <i>CCP ATOL 30F +</i> <br><br>  <i>12. We have an online bookstore.</i>  <i>There are no offline stores, no cashiers.</i>  <i>Is it possible to use (or somehow configure) a physical CCP that would receive information from the site (remote hosting), on which the user buys the product, and send it to the CRF?</i> <br><br>  This is exactly how any cash desk should work on the Internet in order to fulfill the requirements of the law on sending a check at the time of settlement.  This is how the <a href="https://online.atol.ru/">ATOL Online service functions</a> .  Everything happens automatically without the participation of the operator (cashier).  The main thing is that the CMS of the site (or the used payment aggregator) be integrated with the cash register. <br><br>  <i>13. Do the provisions of Article 7 of paragraph 9 of Federal Law No. 290 FZ of 07/03/2016 about the possibility not to use cash registers before July 01, 2018, apply to online stores?</i>  <i>Previously, it was not used, and this did not contradict the law.</i> <br><br>  It depends on which payment method you use.  If payment is effected using electronic means of payment without entering payment card data (for example, electronic wallets, transfer from an individual through an online bank or a bank branch), then till 01.07.2018 the cash desk is not required. <br><br>  <i>14. Is it necessary to use online cash desk if we do not sell goods, but provide services in the form of advertising on our website.</i>  <i>Payment for services is possible, in particular, through payment aggregators and only individuals.</i> <br><br>  While you can issue a strict reporting form (BSO).  After 01/07/2018 it will be necessary to apply the cashier.  But in this case it is necessary to ensure the transfer of BSO to the buyer at the time of calculation, which is rather difficult.  We recommend that you now proceed to the fiscal calculation and send electronic checks, which will be replaced by the BSO. <br><br>  <i>15. If our product is infobusiness and advice, is it necessary to use online cash registers?</i> <br><br>  Yes need.  Among those who are exempted from the use of cash registers (TCC), there are no such categories of entrepreneurs. <br><br>  <i>16. Is it possible to use one cash register for an online store and a point of sale?</i> <br><br>  Yes you can.  The same cashier can also send an electronic check to the buyer when paying for the goods online, and print a paper check when calculating at the point of sale, but this will require appropriate software. <br><br>  <i>17. Who should issue a check when working with dropshipping?</i> <br><br>  The main rule: the cashier applies the one who accepts payment from the buyer. <br><br>  <i>18. If we receive electronic payments in foreign currency from non-residents through payment systems (foreign), do we need to issue cash checks?</i>  <i>If so, in which currency?</i> <br><br>  If you conduct calculations on the territory of the Russian Federation, then you must use CCT.  All checks are always made out only in rubles. <br><br><h2>  Use of payment aggregators </h2><br>  <i>19. Do I need to use online cash registers when accepting payments through Yandex.Money?</i> <br><br>  Yandex.Money (Yandex.Cassa) is a service for payment using various means of payment, such as credit cards and electronic wallets.  In the case of card payments, it is necessary to apply the cash desk from 01.07.2017, and when receiving funds from electronic wallets - the cash desk will need to be used from 01.07.2018. <br><br>  <i>20. Is it necessary to use online cash offices when accepting payments through Yandex.Cash or other payment aggregators?</i> <br><br>  Yes, sure.  As according to 103-FZ "On the activity of receiving payments from individuals, carried out by payment agents." (Art. 1, p. 2): <br><br>  The provisions of this Federal Law do not apply to relations connected with the settlement activity: &lt;...&gt; <br><br>  4) carried out in non-cash order; <br><br>  5) carried out in accordance with the legislation on banks and banking activities. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, the payment aggregators are exempt from the use of CCP, and the obligation to apply CCP rests on the online store. <br><br>  <i>21. We use the services of the payment aggregator and receive from it information about the receipt of payment 1 time per day.</i>  <i>When should we punch a check?</i> <br><br>  Once received information about the receipt of payment. <br><br><h2>  Checks and delivery of goods </h2><br>  <i>22. Is it possible to deliver the buyer only an electronic receipt upon delivery of the goods by courier?</i> <br><br>  Not.  The same rule applies here as for normal trading.  The buyer has the right to ask for a paper check, and the online store should be able to provide it.  The courier must have a cash register with him, as the electronic check must be formed at the place of settlement.  Send an electronic check from the office would be against the law, as well as print a paper check in advance and send it by courier. <br><br>  <i>23. Is it possible to connect ATOL Online and with the help of special software to make the courier print checks on the spot through a mobile printer and telephone?</i> <br><br>  No, because the cash desk must be applied at the place of settlement, that is, at the time of receipt of money by the courier.  This requirement is clearly spelled out in the law. <br><br>  <i>24. Is it possible to use the cashier model with the designation ‚ÄúFS‚Äù for payments both on the Internet and when issuing goods in the pickup area?</i> <br><br>  No you can not.  Cashier with the designation "FS" does not print paper checks, and the pick-up point is an offline point of issue of goods, where the buyer has the right to demand not only an electronic, but also a paper check.  If at the offline point you do not give the buyer a paper check, you are breaking the law. <br><br><h2>  Registration of cash registers </h2><br>  <i>25. If one legal entity has several sites, do you need to register separate cash registers for each site?</i> <br><br>  No no need.  When submitting an application, you need to put a tick in front of the item ‚Äúcash for payments on the Internet‚Äù and then in the field that appears you can specify several sites. <br><br>  <i>26. We now have one site for several legal entities.</i>  <i>Can we leave one site when registering the checkout, or should we separate them so that each legal entity has its own site?</i> <br><br>  Sharing is optional.  Several legal entities may have one site.  However, each legal entity must have its own cash register. <br><br>  <i>27. There is a first level domain (store).</i>  <i>On him registered cash.</i>  <i>Do I need to register separate cash registers for the second level subdomain (of the same domain), or can the main domain / store cash registers be used?</i> <br><br>  You can use the main domain cashier. <br><br>  <i>28. What should be indicated in the CCP registration in the fields ‚Äúaddress of settlement‚Äù and ‚Äúsettlement point‚Äù if the cash desk is to be used for settlements on the Internet?</i> <br><br>  The settlement address is the place of installation of the cash register.  When the tick ‚Äúpayments on the Internet‚Äù is checked, a field appears in the application where you need to list the websites of online stores. <br><br>  <i>29. In the application for registration in the paragraph about the agent there are no options ‚Äúagent‚Äù, ‚Äúcommission agent‚Äù, ‚Äúattorney‚Äù.</i>  <i>If we are not a paying agent, do we need to check the box?</i> <br><br>  In the application for registration this checkbox should be checked only if you are a paying or bank agent.  If it's just an agent, then you don't need it. <br><br>  <i>30. I can not register the cashier with the label "FS".</i>  <i>With what it can be connected?</i> <br><br>  When registering such a ticket office, you must check the box ‚ÄúCash register equipment used for settlements in the information and telecommunication Internet network‚Äù.  But it is worth remembering that such a box office is not suitable for online stores that accept payments not on the Internet (for example, upon delivery by courier, at the pick-up point). <br><br><h2>  ATOL Online </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d6b/2d4/f1d/d6b2d4f1d00f4475a6c0da709cb3dc00.jpg"><br><br>  <i>31. What is the address of the installation site at the cash register, if it is ATOL Online?</i> <br><br>  Address of the data center, where there will be a box office. <br><br>  <i>32. If we have two sites, how many cash registers in ATOL Online do we need to rent?</i> <br><br>  It depends on the volume of incoming orders on websites and traffic payments.  Usually, one cash register is rented for each site, but the calculation is best done individually using a calculator ( <a href="http://online.atol.ru/">http://online.atol.ru/</a> ).  If the payment on the sites is small, you can use one cashier for several URLs. <br><br>  <i>33. Is it necessary for an online store that wants to work with ATOL Online to be connected to any payment aggregator?</i>  <i>Or does ATOL Online allow you to directly pay for goods from plastic cards?</i> <br><br>  Data exchange takes place between the cash register and the CMS site, or between the cash register and the payment aggregator.  The ticket office itself cannot take information from the site; another participant (system) must send it to it.  This can be either a CMS or a payment aggregator. <br><br>  <i>34. Will the integration of ATOL Online with the old platforms and configurations of 1C: TiS?</i> <br><br>  No, but there is an API, thanks to it, you can add it yourself or contact the web-studio or 1C integrators for help. <br><br>  <i>35. How are goods returned or prepaid when renting to ATOL, if all payments are made via the Internet?</i> <br><br>  The CMS instructs the cashier to make a refund, after which the cashier generates a check.  In the near future, we plan to realize the possibility of issuing checks for return or correction through the interface of the ATOL Online Personal Account. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336056/</a></p>
