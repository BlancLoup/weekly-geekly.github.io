  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WWDC'08: Will there be happiness?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time, the entire Internet only does that wash the bones of the apple company.  The most incredible news about what Vel will present to the first places of news sites is constantly getting out.  and Oh.  on the next WWDC.  And every year, Steve manages to specifically shock us, break off, and generally turn everything upside down. <br><br>  However, in my case, after several years of absolutely identical performances (devices and slides change in the background, the style of the story does not change completely) a certain immunity has already developed, the jaws are tired of falling, and the brain has learned to catch the untold and correctly digest it.  Plus, there is enough general knowledge about what is happening in the iron world and what it is headed for.  Therefore, I will try to play the prophet and motivated to confirm or refute on points the whole muddy stream of rumors, which is growing by a snowball closer to the start of the conference. <br><br>  <strong>iPhone 3G</strong> : existence is practically not discussed.  Another thing - what mythical talents gave him popular rumor? <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      For a long time, pictures of various degrees of dread with an allegedly <em>plastic case</em> walked on an Internet.  Already convincingly proved that it is a fake, just Chinese cases for iMobilek or their clones.  Is it really not possible to see the general, straight as a nail, the company's line of complete transition to metal in their devices?  Look at iPod design changes as a good example. <br><br>  On the subject <em>of body colors</em> (white (although rather ‚Äújust lumin‚Äù), red, black) - why not?  They learned to paint aluminum for a long time :) Again, black color can be given the status of a more expensive one (by $ 100) and a Tach flush (even if the real wholesale cost of this flush is a penny). <br><br>  Also quite confidently say that the <em>background will lose a little in size</em> .  Quite an obvious movement of progress, Apple engineers have proven that they can show off on Air.  Strong body and exterior will not change, rather, the new background will be identical to the current iPod Touch.  And it is thinner and slightly smaller. <br><br>  <em>New superprotes and technology</em> in phones: the main question is, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Apple already has an almost perfect iron platform with an OS that fits under it.  Apple loves to save no less than show off, and with an iPhone they are already sewn up in black.  They had to redraw the work schedules and tasks for a bunch of their programmers (postpone the release of the leopard and transfer half of his team to iPhone) in order to ensure a fairly stable 1.x.x firmware, not to mention the global internal changes in the deuce.  Even such ‚Äúdream companies‚Äù lack the qualified personnel to meet their needs.  Here just to bring to mind the software part, minimally touching the iron.  They will slap the next version of the radio chip from the same supplier (read - the number of legs and the dimensions are identical, it also works, it is also programmed, two bows and one 3G were added) and the minimum possible second camera.  People have enough. <br><br>  This implies the following conclusion: <em>no superfish in the 2.0 firmware</em> .  They have enough of a smut with 3G support and a complete redrawing of the system offal, so that zhoporuky programmers from the outside (the App Store) can work there.  In general, I expect "exactly what was shown at the v2.0 presentation" and not a bit more.  They are so fond of, already repeatedly noted. <br><br>  <em>GPS</em> : So so, 50/50 Recall how these devices work, how long they start and consume energy.  Maybe they will manage to plug the module into the housing already packed, or maybe they will go some other way and at the same time start selling a separate GPS module with the phone.  I tend to think about a separate device, there are several benefits for the company: for such a ‚Äúunique‚Äù device you can set the price absolutely ‚Äúfrom the baldy‚Äù.  Plus meet the "less automotive" European markets, which it is not much stuck.  Plus, the work of the GPS module assumes the presence of a map on which it is necessary to put a cross, which, in turn, implies the presence of an unlimited Internet, in the place where the user is (Everest, Amazon, the center of the Sahara).  And not all European official iPhone operators give this unlimited internet, plus with coverage and roaming is not always good ... <br><br>  Sorry further, evaporated.  The first post, 3 o'clock in the morning.  Round out and bow out.  If people in kamentah will like my calculations, I promise to write the second part, with ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù :) on the remaining products of the future WWDC. <br><br>  PS: To habramir to believe in my talents;), I can cite a small statistic: <br>  +1 box of beer won in the dispute about the existence of the x86 version of the system.  It was won at the time of the official announcement, while knowledge of existence reached me back in 2001 (the super-secret project ‚ÄúMarklar‚Äù). <br>  -1 box of cognac, lost by me (not yet, but at the moment almost one hundred percent) in a dispute about the purpose of the next cat Apple.  I came up with the idea that they would still miss the pussy market, my opponent categorically denied such blasphemy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26915/</a></p>
