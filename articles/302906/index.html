  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the data center market. Apple and Microsoft are expanding their holdings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There has been a steady increase in the volume of media content, which is stored in the world wide web.  Many factors are now contributing to the active and rapid expansion of computing and network resources on server farms around the world.  More than once it has been written that the vector of many giant corporations, such as Apple and Microsoft, is directed towards building hyper-scale data centers.  Corporations are not constrained in the amounts for the construction of new data centers, their offspring are hyper-scale buildings of tens of megawatts with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãtens of thousands of square meters.  Own powerful data processing and storage centers allow reducing costs not only due to lower PUE ratio, but also due to independent development and small-scale production of server equipment, operators have more opportunities to optimize IT equipment, auxiliary equipment, all this makes it possible to improve technological processes, increase server system load level, automate infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/8a8/45a/76b8a845a9ec410ab1fb6bbd1c3d0147.png"><br><br>  Earlier, in one of the articles, it was said that in February last year, Apple announced its intention to build a new mega data center in Ireland.  For this was chosen a picturesque piece of undeveloped land in the county of Galway.  The project was approved by the local authorities, but the construction did not begin because of the complaint of activists, plus the American corporation is accused by the Irish opposition members of not paying state taxes.  Apple and some other high-tech companies "found" in Ireland, so to speak, tax haven <a name="habracut"></a>  : The local tax system allows corporations to significantly reduce tax deductions due to loopholes in the law.  According to Irish law, international companies registered in Ireland, but operated from other countries, are not tax residents of Ireland, therefore they are exempted from paying taxes on profits that they receive from the sale of goods and services through Irish divisions.

      Back in May 2013, the US Senate accused Apple of tax evasion (the sum was counted at $ 74 billion) through a network of offshore companies, registered mainly in Ireland.  However, the investigation has reached a dead end and revealed no violations, because the company used loopholes in the law. <br><br>  Everything had to be decided by the beginning of this summer.  But to date, the construction of this hyper-scale data center, with a total cost of $ 950 million, has not begun.  Representatives of the local public with their demands to ban the construction have become the reason for stopping its implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dd/816/3b9/0dd8163b918d4362ac4b437f6f724642.png"><br><br>  The public discussion of the project will involve 12 groups or individuals who oppose the construction of a server farm.  The position is as follows: there are fears that this project is a danger to local wildlife, and after putting the data center into operation, nearby golf courses may be flooded.  To implement the project, Apple planned to deploy 18 diesel generators, which would become a source of noise and vibration, and for the activists such noise pollution seems to be simply unacceptable.  Almost 100 local residents will participate in the negotiations. <br><br>  However, Apple has expressed its desire to find a mutual solution to the disagreements that have arisen. The company voiced one of the project‚Äôs goals, the essence of which is to minimize the negative impact of the new server farm on the region‚Äôs environment by using electricity using renewable energy sources.  The project provides for the deployment of a rainwater harvesting system for technical purposes. <br><br>  The construction project is frozen, the start time of construction is projected to be not earlier than 2018. <br><br>  But Microsoft has received approval for the construction of a new campus server farm in Ireland, in Dublin, as well as currently considering the possibility of building server storage in South Korea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a6/e5b/5b4/4a6e5b5b4eaa485cbbc39be8af889d58.png"><br><br>  Over the next three years, Microsof plans to build four additional data centers on local campuses in the capital of Ireland.  Prior to this, the corporation has already invested significant sums in the city‚Äôs economy through the construction of three server farms.  The data center in Dublin (campus in the Grangecastle business park) is the first Microsoft data center built outside the United States, it was put into commercial operation on July 1, 2009.  Its initial area was about 91 thousand square meters.  m <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63f/f0f/73e/63ff0f73e685431881bd57af59eab71a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ab/78a/36d/7ab78a36d1364804a86683b07d4029ec.png"><br>  <i>insulated hot corridors</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a9/f9b/bcd/9a9f9bbcd4644af4bd20568d1ac8f164.png"><br>  <i>insulated hot corridor from the inside</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f7/d98/287/4f7d982875554cbd87aa9c751aef1d92.png"><br>  <i>louvers that can be used to control the intensity of the flow of fresh air entering the Microsoft data center</i> <br><br>  The server farm in 2009 was one of the first data centers that operate without chillers.  Thousands of servers in the machine rooms of 51 thousand square meters throughout almost the whole year are cooled with the help of fresh outdoor air (free cooling technology). <br><br>  The American corporation Microsof plans to build simultaneously two server farms in South Korea, one of which will be located in the capital, Seoul.  This information has been confirmed by official representatives of the company.  In 2014, Microsoft planned to build a new data center in the South Korean city of Pusan ‚Äã‚Äã(worth about $ 9 billion), so it is possible that the second data center will be located in Busan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/874/2fe/82d/8742fe82d2ed45748411bfb2ca2ab78a.png"><br>  <i>Busan</i> <br><br>  Busan is also called the summer capital of the Republic, as well as the "sea" capital.  This is the second largest metropolis of the country with a population of almost 4 million people, and despite the powerful production potential, it looks quite a resort, thanks to its natural beauty. <br><br>  Microsoft is making its choice towards South Korea to accommodate the data center due to the availability of highly skilled labor resources, low-cost electricity and less susceptibility to natural disasters compared to nearby regions.  Plans to launch new data centers by September 2017. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302906/</a></p>
