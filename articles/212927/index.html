  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why you need a smartwatch: ten options for using Pebble</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At present, technologies have become so firmly established in our lives that most people who have forgotten their phones at home feel at least uncomfortable, and at most, this forgetfulness causes panic.  "And if I urgently need to call?".  Agreed to meet, but the person is not ... "And if he called to postpone the meeting?".  And what our relatives and friends sometimes think, if you don‚Äôt pick up the phone or sit down on a battery - such horrors will never come to your own mind. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fc/5f4/45c/6fc5f445ceae0786ee21cc9e88f1acab.jpg"><br>  If you already have a Pebble, or you are just eyeing them, or you are just choosing a smart watch for yourself - I ask you for a cat.  I will try to talk about the most interesting features of watches at the moment and how to simplify your life with smart watches. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is a pebble? <br></h4>  For those who still do not know what a pebble is, I recommend reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174641/">review</a> from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/grokinn/" class="user_link">grokinn</a> , the article on developing <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/avi/blog/204338/">applications</a> from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/" class="user_link">vvzvlad</a> and about the release of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/211386/">Pebble AppStore</a> .  Much time has passed since the first article was published, and the situation has changed radically, since  Third-party developers have updated and released a large number of applications. <br><br>  In short, Pebble is a smart watch that is connected to your phone and acts as a kind of companion for it.  They show incoming notifications and messages from programs - sms, mail, comments, messages, and so on.  To look at the watch is much faster and more convenient than getting the phone out of your pocket or bag. <br><br>  Since  on the watch case it says ‚ÄúMade for iPhone.  Works with Android ‚Äù, then the developers of the official firmware do the main emphasis on the iPhone.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that iOS has a limited number of devices, while Android produces phones for everybody with a huge number of options for internal stuffing, and developers have to spend a lot of effort implementing compatibility with all (mostly) Android phones.  As <a href="https://blog.getpebble.com/2014/02/11/an-update-on-android/">the developers themselves write in their blog,</a> several people work with android and they simply do not have enough time.  That is why we still have not seen the official release of the application with the built-in AppStore, which is available only to developers.  But in order to become a developer, you just need to register on the forum and download the <a href="https://developer.getpebble.com/blog/2014/02/03/Android-appstore-beta/">latest version of the application</a> .  At the moment, not everything works so smoothly, the application is frankly tupit, and many people periodically eat battery badly.  It can work at idle all night, and can drop the battery to zero per night from 40%.  Again, it also depends on the applications that are installed on the watch.  Maybe there is a strong weather update from some watchface. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Pictures</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46e/6f1/7d0/46e6f17d0aa1e4cbe547b9323bca6133.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c7/087/d76/4c7087d76b05d0fde0ffe729342b440d.png"></div></div>

    <h4>  Create custom firmware <br></h4>  Due to the fact that the watch is initially oriented to Americans and English-speaking comrades, only English is available from the box, SMS in Russian and you will not see the caller‚Äôs name.  Instead, there will be squares.  For all requests, official support stated that it is up to date, but when they will fix and add support for other languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not known, because  The priorities at the moment are completely different.  And how nice it is that we have such developers as <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BPavelVolkovitskiy/posts">Pavel Volkovitsky</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2B%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD/posts">Semyon</a> <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php%3Fu%3D2823490">Maryasin</a> .  It was these guys who decided to come to grips with the clock and gave us the opportunity to use them with convenience. <br>  Pavel launched the website <a href="http://pebblebits.com/firmware/">pebblebits.com</a> , which initially allowed Russian fonts to be embedded into the firmware to display messages with Russian text. <br>  At the moment it is the most powerful customization generator for pebble, which allows you to build the firmware with the following options: <br><ul><li>  fonts for different languages: English, Belarusian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, German, Estonian, Finnish, French, Dutch, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Kazakh, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese are available, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese - that is, each language will be displayed correctly with all its special characters such as umlauts, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f51/86e/b29/f5186eb2982e54df01b3023cbac45bfa.png"></li><li>  interface localization - what language will be the menu <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/137/8e6/7831378e60b7a84045030756f2679784.png"><br></li><li>  Disabling embedded applications (this does not give additional space for applications, just for convenience) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b0/0ec/7e5/4b00ec7e581f63b75e4eba293fd56461.png"><br></li><li>  patch for fixing question for an incoming call under iOS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/201/b52/68f/201b5268f0922b6bb380aabf5bb07ed7.png"><br></li><li>  QuickLaunch patch (for quick launch of applications using the Back button from the watchface). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0af/038/524/0af03852432f59c806ad937e6c91391a.png"><br></li></ul><br><br>  The last two options I would like to highlight: <br>  The appearance of the patch for iOS in the generator is due to Seeds, with the participation of Vadim Kolontsov (@ vk2), which they will tell about later. <br>  QuickLaunch Semyon wrote quite recently.  There are 3 options to choose from: <br>  Launching the first installed application from watchface using the Back button <br>  Run the first installed application from watchface by double clicking on the Back button <br>  Launch the first four applications from the watchface by pressing the Back-Back, Back-Up, Back-Middle, Back-Down buttons.  How it will be useful to us - a little lower. <br>  The plans for Semen to implement actions for a long press and a few clicks, display in the menu the connection status and the battery in percent. <br>  Since  I constantly test new applications, on the phone there are several versions of firmware from the generator with disabled menu items, so as not to interfere.  The firmware takes less than a minute and it does not bother at all.  Why have a standard notification on the clock, if there is a third-party?  Why have a standard Music app on your watch if there is a MusicBoss?  Why the alarm menu, if the alarm rings on the phone?  You can get rid of all this with the help of a generator. <br>  If you like what guys do, feel free to donate them.  The link for Pavel is available on <a href="http://pebblebits.com/firmware/">pebblebits.com</a> after the firmware has been created, and for Semyon is indicated <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php%3Fu%3D2823490">in the profile details on the XDA</a> . <br><br><h4>  Installing firmware <br></h4> So, choosing the version of hardware and ticking the options that interest us, press the Create Firmware button. <br>  Thinking, the site will give us a direct link to download and QR-code.  It is more convenient for me to collect the firmware from the computer and then download it with the help of Barcode Scanner.  In the Android file manager (for iOS, you will have to install the firmware via Dropbox), we click on the firmware, and the phone offers to choose a program to handle the action.  Select Pebble, in the program itself, select Load and wait for the end of the firmware. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/291/2b9/871/2912b9871f8ee9949f5c8231a95011c5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/675/237/25a6752377cb9db03f4f1ea924cfe1c4.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, if you already have an updated application - all previously installed applications can be downloaded from Locker, a kind of repository of installed applications that are stored on the phone and do not require an Internet connection during installation.  With this, you can also ‚Äúcircumvent‚Äù the restriction on 8 applications by simply unloading the currently unnecessary applications and loading them back with all the settings when they are needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3a/d5e/63f/e3ad5e63f6a44eb6a8fdac216bad584b.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56e/909/825/56e9098250e67505b902d1dfc36eb956.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, it became comfortable to use the clock in Russian, the extra was removed, the necessary was added.  Actually, why did we buy this device?  Why are such devices called smart? <br><br><h4>  What is Watchface and Watchapp <br></h4>  Everything that is installed on the watch is divided into 2 categories: watchface - in fact, it is a watch in different variations with additional functions such as calendar display, weather, clock and phone battery level, connection status, and so on.  Watchapp - programs that perform a variety of actions and have their own interface, run from the menu. <br>  I don‚Äôt like standard watches, so I noted in the generator that they are not needed and removed the item in the watchfaces menu as well.  Moreover, some faces are forced to update the weather when flipping, and when there are several of them, it‚Äôs not very comfortable to flip through the ships there.  And so, when you press up or down, the weather is updated on the same face in one motion. <br>  Having tried many different skins, I settled on Modern.  It shows the analog dial (seconds are removed so that it doesn‚Äôt eat the battery), shows the day of the week, the day and the weather.  In my opinion, the most convenient and minimalistic option. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/541/540/df2/541540df21b13e52e322844eff747ab8.jpg"><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Duk.co.finebyte.pebbleglance">Glance for Pebble</a> can make your own customized versions of watchfaces, you can download from several thousand ready-made direct from the official application or the unofficial <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dpebble.apps.pebbleapps">Pebble apps</a> , or do it yourself online at <a href="http://www.watchface-generator.de/">Watchface Generator</a> or in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.pennas.pebblecanvas%26hl%3Dru">Canvas for Pebble</a> program. <br><br><h4>  First application.  Manage calls with hands: Pebble Dialer <br></h4>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.matejdro.pebbledialer">The main application</a> that is used on the watch and greatly expands the capabilities of the standard application.  For correct operation, you must disable the call notification in the standard notifier.  Allows you to accept / reject the call, put on the speakerphone, turn off the microphone when making a call, informs about the duration of the call.  By default, the incoming name will be truncated, because  Russian language occupies twice the volume when sending characters.  But the craftsmen from the well-known site translated the interface, increased the transmitted number of bytes from 16 to 32, broke the caller's name into 2 lines (though the second character is truncated and if the last name contains 8 characters, you will see 5 characters and a three-dot).  Allows you to view call history, make calls.  Works great with a headset.  You can never remove the phone from your pocket. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/986/b30/e28/986b30e281ee451be69f286ad16025e4.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a3/2ac/436/7a32ac436ae758007c8ea54f0f3afcd4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The second application.  Manage music: Music Boss <br></h4>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dca.rebootsramblings.musicboss">The application</a> extends the capabilities of the standard, with the ability to perform actions by double and long pressing the buttons.  You can adjust the volume, switch tracks, switch the application for music, which will respond to buttons, launch the active application on the phone.  There is integration with tasker and can intercept commands from the standard music application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/663/ba9/bf8/663ba9bf8addd8cb7bb08de1650d0140.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aeb/321/b4d/aeb321b4dd433b32ea0c693d422e3969.png"><br><br><h4>  Third application: Receive notifications without getting the phone out of pocket <br></h4>  There are about 10 notifiers at the moment. But they can do dismiss - that is, an analogue of the svayp in the notification panel of the phone, only 3 pieces.  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.matejdro.pebblenotificationcenter">Notification Center for Pebble</a> , a mod on its basis and the YaNC application - <a href="http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/10373/android-04-02-14-sdk-2-0-yanc-yet-another-notification-center-beta">Yet another Notification Center</a> from the same developer, but with a different working principle.  For myself, I chose the latter, since  It generates a notification picture and sends it to the clock.  Someone annoyed that the drawing of the picture is slow, but the clock vibrates only upon completion of the drawing of the picture and it does not bother me at all.  You can customize the filter of applications from which you want to receive notifications and due to the fact that the processing takes place on the phone, allows you to send any characters, including emoticons from the Hangouts.  There is an integration with the tasker, you can add 4 actions from the list on the phone (if the tasker is installed on the phone and configured). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44a/caa/683/44acaa683af8d6e273e9067fb2dfc95f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcf/ac4/cd2/dcfac4cd26d003aced2d2d9d284e7926.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Fourth application.  Wrist Navigator <br></h4><br><h5>  Pebble Adventure Navigation <br></h5>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ay.PebbleTurnByTurn%26hl%3Dru">The application</a> works through Google maps, sends the next hint on the route to the clock.  If you still translate the team into Russian, and make it possible to talk about maneuvers in advance, then the price would not have been.  At the moment, the new instruction comes during the passage of the checkpoint, and at the prompt ‚Äúgo straight for 5 km, then turn right‚Äù, here it is to the right and it will buzz.  It is not suitable for navigation in the stream on machines - you do not have time to rebuild.  For pedestrian navigation is a good application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/787/9a0/645/7879a06456d034f664e82c13daf1ac3a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/7db/d5c/8497dbd5ce765cc4e0b41bfbf0dd6377.jpg"><br><br><h5>  OnkoCycle <br></h5>  <a href="http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/9016">The application is</a> still in beta, so you need to join the G + <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/102205632034079912764%3Fpromo%3Dnotifications%26cfem%3D1">community</a> to access the download in the market.  It works on the basis of Google maps, but some cut-down version.  Houses are kind of shown on the map, but unclear and there are no numbers.  Although if you poke into the house, the address will show and you can make a route.  Originally intended for cyclists, but allows you to choose a hiking route and a car.  Rebuilds the route when leaving the target, there is voice navigation, and for cyclists additional useful settings like "do not make the route up, down or just over the hills."  Whether due to the fact that the application is in beta, I have conflicts with something, but for 10 minutes the way home hung for 2 times for 2 minutes. When reaching an intermediate point, it vibrates and gives a new hint.  The clock displays the current, average speed, distance to the intermediate point and the next maneuver.  If you finish and integrate with google now for normal search of routes and display of maps, I will always use it on trips. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ab/dbe/175/8abdbe1755caf5ba2aaa6ced770aa18c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e52/bba/cdf/e52bbacdf8bc9a288ee9d5da03afa57c.png"><br><br><h4>  Fifth application.  We read books: Pebble Reader <br></h4><br>  A handy <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.azya.pebble.pebblereader%26hl%3Dru">application</a> for reading documents in txt format.  It has a file manager with which you can select a file without getting the phone.  For some, this is the perfect option for cheat sheets with tickets divided into folders and files.  When you press the button back, it starts the clock, when it is restarted, it opens the file at the point where the viewing stopped.  It has font size settings, display options are white on black / black on white.  It remembers the last directory, there is a manual and auto-selection of the encoding, the settings for the line break, the indent value, the line spacing.  Can hide infobar, which displays% of read and number of pages read / total pages.  When you start the application, you can forcibly turn on the backlight during operation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/810/1ad/980/8101ad9809cd374e767b80d14efce4e8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d04/e79/214/d04e792143c24074e741943aa84ba28a.png"><br><br><h4>  The sixth application.  Sticky Notes: PebMsg <br></h4>  A simple <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dco.exampl.pebmsg">application</a> to send a small text to the clock.  The text is shown as a notification and therefore it does not occupy a slot in the clock.  I use it every day, sending my shopping list to the watch, which my wife takes off in the hangouts.  It is much more convenient than walking with a leaflet or constantly holding / taking out a phone with a list. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/611/9a5/e13/6119a5e135f36859191b33b720e4e7ba.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d3/23a/881/5d323a881092b3b179b5ea19187c8cda.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Seventh application.  Camera control <br></h4><br><h5>  Watch Trigger for Pebble <br></h5>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.wordpress.ninedof.watchtrigger%26hl%3Dru">The program</a> allows you to take a picture from the phone or start / stop video recording while running a third-party application on the phone.  With integrated camera does not work.  It is convenient to take photos for example of yourself and the girls, setting the phone so as to get into the frame.  You can turn off the sound of photographing, set the timer, control the flash. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/ca2/660/8f9ca26602cb0583c31c658f68eb9cc6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71c/d63/2e6/71cd632e65d056942f342074823adaf5.png"><br><br><h5>  Pebblecam <br></h5>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.heikobehrens.pebblecam%26hl%3Dru">It looks like</a> the previous application, but in addition it sends a picture from the viewfinder to the clock.  The quality is not very, transmitted and updated slowly enough, but to understand what exactly is in the frame can be.  You can also turn off the screen in the program on your phone so as not to give yourself away. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/458/205/c70/458205c700fad6d71d93c4f5e8a5e560.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/502/890/eb0/502890eb09462bb05ec29a8c6c4787eb.png"><br><br><h4>  Eighth application.  The mood of the action itself: PebbleTasker <br></h4><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.kodek.pebbletasker%26hl%3Dru">The application</a> allows you to attach Tasker events to your buttons using the application on your phone.  A single press on the 3 buttons, a long press on the upper and lower buttons is still an event and with a long press on the middle button, a list of 20 tasks opens.  Total, you can use 24 commands for the phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef1/e32/1b0/ef1e321b058acf98b07509d5362a77ad.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/687/16f/65c68716f0a743c1da030627f32da051.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Ninth application.  Full Messenger: Pebble Messenger <br></h4>  <a href="http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/7954/android-pebble-messenger-whatsapp-sms-quick-responses-typing/p1">Shows the</a> last 10 sms or whatsapp messages.  Allows you to respond to these messages 10 pre-prepared templates.  It is very convenient to send an answer if you are driving or under the rain, given that the watch is waterproof.  You can also write messages by letter.  Only English characters are available (I hope the craftsmen will think of something).  The way is vaguely reminiscent of T9 on the phone.  For buttons, 3 groups of characters are defined.  The upper is from <b>a</b> to <b>i</b> , the middle is from <b>j</b> to <b>q</b> and the lower is from <b>r</b> to <b>z</b> .  If you need to insert the letter <b>m,</b> then you need to press the middle button, then the choice will be given by the following option: upper <b>jkl</b> button, middle <b>mn</b> , lower <b>opq</b> .  Accordingly, for the letter <b>m,</b> you need to press the middle one, then the last choice will remain: at the top of <b>m</b> , at the bottom of <b>n</b> .  Being accustomed, you can quickly type the text without getting the phone out of your pocket, which can be useful in the cold.  For messages sent from the clock you can add a signature. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/de5/e0f/839de5e0fe50040c40aba11023d40cef.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5a/828/e4e/e5a828e4ebcee8919794fcc28b2f54c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Tenth application: Universal combine: AutoPebble + Tasker + plugins <br></h4><br>  Well, we got to the most interesting. <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autopebble">AutoPebble</a> from the Portuguese developer Jo√£o Dias.  Without exaggeration, one of the best applications for pebble.  Allows you to do everything that tasker can do, and displays everything in a form that is easy to read. <br>  It all started pretty funny.  On January 25, the famous American video blogger and reviewer of all kinds of gadgets Marques Brownlee, who has more than 1 million subscribers on the channel, uploads the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdYzlWWa8dCU">Top 5 Wearable Tech</a> video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdYzlWWa8dCU">!</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdYzlWWa8dCU">(Early 2014)</a> , which tells about the best wearable gadgets at the beginning of the year.  In this video, the phrase slips: <br><blockquote>  Everything goes to the fact that after a couple of months, or years, you will say "Okay Google Naw, set the timer to 10 minutes." <br>  And in 10 minutes a timer will sound ... on your wrist ... </blockquote><br>  And after 2 days, Jo√£o Dias uploads a video response with a demonstration of this action. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fo-R5bIpVLY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhimEKlVqciC3JaTFYhlhJux7euz1w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Description of all the features of the program AutoPebble draw on another article.  Therefore, if the topic has caused interest and you want to know how to make the shown on the video below with your pebble, then unsubscribe in the comments.  If there is demand, there will be an article with examples, screenshots, all the necessary settings and saved profiles and projects, so that you can import them into the tasker and adjust them to fit your needs. <br>  So to start the video from the creator of the program: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4b9JVDp8JHM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjr5QTdgDfrxsO_Idqup4Oww8Smg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  For those who are not quite friendly with English, voice-over translation: <br>  <i>Control your life with a pebble watch with AutoPebble.</i>  <i>This is a new and dynamic way of interacting between watches and other devices, which gives you an unprecedented level of control over what your pebble does.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Dynamic screens.</b></i>  <i>When you open the application on the clock, the screen that you are shown may depend on the situation in which you are.</i>  <i>For example, you may have different screens when you are at home, at work or late in the evening.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Lists</b> .</i>  <i>With the lists screen, you can create customized lists consisting of a heading and items.</i>  <i>Each item can have different names and actions.</i>  <i>For example, run a list of installed music programs when headphones are connected or bluetooth is activated in the car.</i>  <i>Or show a list of your favorite TV shows and run them on your TV.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Notifications</b> .</i>  <i>You can redirect notifications to the clock using the AutoNotifications program.</i>  <i>Or create your own notifications, on which each button will have its effect.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Quick screens</b> .</i>  <i>You can also install quick static screens that have a name and 3 options.</i>  <i>And you can assign different actions to each button.</i>  <i>With this you can use the clock for example as a control panel.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Text screens</b> You can make a screen with a title and very long text, for example, to read news or view your notes at your convenience.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Rotate, shake, press.</b></i>  <i>You can assign any action to the rotation of the brush.</i>  <i>For example, this will allow you to reject the notification, without having to touch the clock.</i>  <i>Or you can switch in the console between the teams and the list of channels.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Short, long, double tap.</b></i>  <i>Each knob on the clock can perform different actions depending on the duration of pressing.</i>  <i>For example, a short press on the middle button in the SMS notification may show the full text of the message.</i>  <i>Or you can assign a light switch to a short press and a long press to check the status of the light.</i>  <i>Or assign a double-click action to restart the video, in addition to the main launch action on a single click.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Vibration.</b></i>  <i>You can set any vibration pattern / pattern to open a program or to any action while AutoPebble is open on the clock.</i>  <i>You can "click melody" online on your computer and it will be played exactly on the clock.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Backlight</b> You can turn the backlight on and off on the clock as you like.</i>  <i>You can always keep it on at night and turn it off during the day.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Office windows</b> .</i>  <i>You can control the creation and rejection of windows.</i>  <i>For example, by assigning IDs to windows, you can make 2 windows constantly change each other when shaken, and when you press the back button, you always return to the first screen instead of the previous one.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Do not disturb</b> .</i>  <i>You can make the current screen not be replaced by a new notification, which will always keep open such as notes (spurs =) by the author).</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Fonts</b> .</i>  <i>You can change the font sizes as you like in different windows.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>References music application</b> .</i>  <i>You can intercept the buttons of the standard music control application on the clock.</i>  <i>For example, assign the launch of the application by pressing the middle play button.</i>  <i>Or assign it to the rewind button ‚Äî launch the application to view the news in the morning, and use the same button to launch your favorite game in the evening.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>AutoPebble is like a tasker for your watch.</i>  <i>With this application you can replace other applications on your watch.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  From the features of the program that appeared after this video: <br><ul><li>  Added the ability to interact with other third-party clock applications, such as button interception.  Applications can be imported <a href="http://joaoapps.com/autopebble/other-pebble-apps/">from the site</a> , or include the definition of applications in the program itself.  Upon detection, you must rename for convenience.  You can force AutoPebble to respond to commands sent to or from the phone.  That is, you can bind tasker tasks to the actions of any clock application, if it sends commands to the companion application of the phone, regardless of whether this application has tasker support or not. </li><li>  Added the ability to respond separately to the movement of clocks in each X, Y, or Z plane. </li><li>  Added the ability to create a full-screen (without statusbar) window on the clock. </li><li>  Notifications without buttons have text on the whole screen. </li><li>  Added new variables% apstatus and% apstatusdesc, now you can respond to status changes. </li><li>  Added the ability to respond to the following events: the application is open, the connection with the clock is established, the connection with the clock is broken, the previous track is played, the next track is played. </li></ul><br><br>  For the implementation of all shown in the video, as well as for additional, no less interesting features, you need plug-ins for Tasker from the developer.  Since the watch is waterproof, you can, for example, run music in the shower, make calls, write SMS, etc .: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autovoice">AutoVoice</a> - allows you to respond to voice commands </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autoshortcut">AutoShortcut</a> - launch applications and application actions </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autoapps">AutoLaunch</a> - launch applications and a list of applications to carry out actions with them. </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autonotification">AutoNotification</a> - interaction with notifications </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autolocation">AutoLocation</a> - allows you to respond to events based on your location and speed.  For example, launching a navigator or map, while typing a certain speed </li><li>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.joaomgcd.autoshare">AutoShare</a> - use any application with tasker.  For example, voice recording from a microphone and insert to automatically search for and start playback by song title.  Or intercept the coordinates and insert the data in the SMS.  A list of current templates (intents) is available on the site.  It is enough to log in from the phone, click on the item of interest and it is imported.  Available text, voice, music search;  media control devices;  make a photo, automatically edit the photo;  create a text / voice note in Evernote;  podcast management;  open file;  send an email;  find music through shazam, etc. </li></ul><br>  Free versions of the application have limitations.  To use all the features you need to buy the full version.  I advise you to support the developer.  Believe me, they deserve it and are not so expensive.  For all the questions that arise, there is <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110193399489813640793%3Fcfem%3D1">the Google+ community</a> , where there are a lot of helpful people, including Jo√£o Dias himself.  Very sociable person, always answers questions.  One day, I corresponded with him all day.  One of the applications did not work.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> He 4 times sent a new corrected, based on my logs and bug reports, and gave advice on incorrectly working projects / tasker profiles. </font></font><br><br><h4>  Where can one buy? <br></h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pebble and Pebble Steel watches are available on Madrobots.ru, the official distributor of Pebble and Pebble Steel. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company provides Pebble warranty support in the Russian Federation. </font></font><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/23/53/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Order a Pebble watch for 5990 rubles. </font></font></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/23/1579/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pre-order a Pebble steel for 9990 rubles (delivery May 30).</font></font></a> <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212927/</a></p>
