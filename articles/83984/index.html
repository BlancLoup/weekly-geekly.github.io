      <b>The Peacocks system lacks certain important elements</b> , because of which, over time, in practice, people break down. <br><br>  It‚Äôs like with management theory, if you don‚Äôt know the Adizes manager‚Äôs role theory and you don‚Äôt select a team based on it, in practice, sooner or later, your team will either collapse or be ineffective, as you probably cannot make critical The thing is to balance 4 roles. <br><br>  <b>My yogi coach Sasha showed me how to improve the Peacocks system.</b>  I have achieved stable excellent results, I have been getting up very early for 3 months already, 5-6 in the morning and, I hope, for me it is already a habit / skill. <br><br><h5>  The secret of efficiency </h5><br>  - The most important secret that Sasha, my yogi coach, told me, and I will tell him to you, is that <b>morning time is the most productive.</b> <br><br>  - The secret of an effective person is that he <b>gets up early and spends the morning on creation.</b>  For example, now is 06.18, I finished an hour of yoga and I am writing this entry. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  - Naturally for many it is no secret.  Many read about the "great" and effective people, and many of them got up very early.  Lincoln got up at 5 and spent the morning building up.  Which of the ‚Äúgreats‚Äù do you know? <br><br>  ‚ÄúA lot of people want to get up early, but they don‚Äôt succeed, their system falls apart, they don‚Äôt know what theory is based on and what is crucially important to pay attention to. <br><br>  - If you don‚Äôt have anything to do in life, you don‚Äôt have any idea what to do for 2-3 hours while the wife / husband is sleeping - then think, maybe something is wrong in your life?  Sick people, children, the elderly - sleep a lot.  People in depression sleep _ very much.  They just do not want to live.  If you are accustomed to sleep a lot, maybe you have a mild form of depression? <br><br><h5>  Let's take a quick look at the theory. </h5><br>  - The most effective sleep in a person is from 22.00 to 02.00. <br>  - From 02.00 to 04.00 sleep less effective. <br>  - After 04.00 am not effective. <br><br>  - It is very good to sleep an hour, or at least a little, or at least take a nap after a meal.  This is necessary so that blood, which is concentrated in your stomach, starts digestion.  And then, back in your head, so that you can continue to function effectively.  I'll tell you something now.  What you won't believe.  I sleep at work.  Not always.  But sometimes I sleep.  Minutes 10-20.  In the meeting room, on the ‚Äúottoman‚Äù, without these 10 minutes, it can be difficult for me in the afternoon.  At first, it was shocking to our people, now, it seems, people are used to, and they even try to ‚Äúnot wake me up‚Äù these 10-20 minutes. <br><br>  - <b>There</b> are <b>no people "owls" and "larks", the biorhythms of people are the same</b> .  This idea is very difficult to accept.  I myself do not believe it to the end.  How so.  I believed in the opposite 20 years.  Most people disagree with this.  On the other hand, when was the majority right? <br><br>  - <b>There are habits of people to go to bed early, or go to bed late</b> .  This habit is not so difficult to change.  My yogi-coach showed me such ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù, my results ‚Äú-30kg in 3 months‚Äù, my changed personality, my new efficiency - I believe in what I check for myself.  I was always an owl.  I always went to bed late or very late, at one time I worked at night, I always got up very badly early.  I have changed.  I became a "morning person".  "Back" I do not want. <br><br>  - People are such "bio-batteries."  Sasha Yogi says that we have a ‚Äúbattery‚Äù of years at 150. Not many, naturally, live to 150 years. <br>  - <b>When we do not sleep from 10 pm to 4 am we ‚Äúburn‚Äù our battery</b> .  Do not sleep from 22.00 to 04.20 is equivalent to not switching in the Power-Safe mode of your ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù laptop when you are on battery. <br><br><h5>  Additional thoughts </h5><br>  - The task is to gradually, slightly, <b>align their biorhythms.</b>  Initially it was very difficult for me to get up at 9 in order to come to work at the beginning of the working day (yes, in our team of 20 people, a fixed start of work at 10 am).  Then I began to get up at 8. Over time, at 7-6.  Now I get up at 5-6.  I feel sorry for an hour a day, I am waiting for my ‚Äúbody‚Äù to start getting up at 4. The very coolest yogis get up at 02 at night.  Go to bed at 10, wake up <br><br>  - I never use an alarm clock.  My body rises itself.  He just does not want to sleep.  What for?  After all, sleep after 4 is not effective. <br><br>  - There is a <b>yoga massage - marma.</b>  It helps to start and normalize your wrong biorhythms.  I think this is optional.  Initially, I was ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù with 3 massages in a row. <br><br>  - <b>What to do when you went to 22, and do not want to sleep?</b>  There is a very simple and very effective thing - <b>special breathing.</b>  You breathe through your nose, slowly inhale and exhale, holding your breath as if you are choking.  I do not know what it is called, Sasha showed me.  Maybe someone knows and can say.  20 sighs and exhalations and you already want to sleep.  The first 2 months, I fell asleep early only through this thing.  Now I don‚Äôt need it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you do this, you will have a very deep sleep.‚Äù  I am now quite difficult to wake up.  I get up very easily, but I sleep soundly.  Once I almost didn‚Äôt drive through the city when the conductor thought that it would be enough to say loudly and turn on the light to wake me up at 6 am, yeah, of course. <br><br>  - Many people confuse the <b>effectiveness of the night and the early morning.</b>  When Vysotsky drank all night and then worked at night, he actually worked early in the morning.  So yogi Sasha told me.  You can do that.  But understand that this is how you burn the battery. <br><br>  - Sasha is very advised to engage in the morning work.  Well draw something.  Even if you (now) think that creativity is not yours - try it, Sasha says that this will help you greatly in your other affairs. <br><br>  PS If you are interested in Sasha Yoga, I will continue ... There are so many things. <br><br>  PS2.  There are 7gb raw video of the <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_dva_/89837.html">seminar</a> , in the near future we will process and upload.  I will also make a short and clear samarium, I will tell you how it was, what will happen next. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83984/</a></p>
