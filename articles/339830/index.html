My name is Welsknight, I am a professional yutuber and stream partner Twitch.  Having received a particularly bad letter from someone who offered me a sponsored video series (he wrote my name incorrectly and, more importantly, did not provide any information about his game), I decided that it would be useful to share my point of view on how to communicate with YouTube and streamers.  So, without further ado ... <br><br><h1>  Tip 1: simplify my work! </h1><br><ul><li>  Don't make me look for information about your game.  Add screenshots, a link to the trailer, a short text description of your game, tell us what it looks like, etc. </li><li>  Just send me a key.  If I have to answer a letter to ask for it, then, most likely, I will not do that. </li><li>  Attach the press kit.  I need a good PNG of your logo with transparency and beautiful background images to use in the video icon.  If you <em>really</em> want to impress me, add a PNG with the main characters and enemies that I can use too.  Remember that I will have to collect from your illustrations a holistic and beautiful icon of 1280x720. </li><li>  If your game has not yet been released, specify the release date, and whether there will be an embargo on the video review. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Tip 2: Choose the right! </h1><br><ul><li>  I ignore 99% of received emails.  Why?  Because they are about games that are not interesting to me.  For three years of creating content on the channel, I have never played mobile games, horror games, sports games ... well, you understand. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Addition: here I should explain, because this item caused discrepancies.  By "ignore" I mean that the game will not be on my channel.  This does not mean that I do not read the letter at all.  It would be difficult to determine whether the game would interest me if I had not opened the letter at all. </blockquote><br><ul><li>  On the other hand, in one of the best letters I received there were such lines: ‚ÄúI see that you played a lot in [the name of the game] and you liked it.  This game has become a strong source of inspiration for our game.  You will probably like it too! ‚ÄùSpend 10 seconds studying the YouTube channel to learn more about it, and use this information in your letter.  This is <em>very</em> useful. </li><li>  The point is that you will be <em>much</em> more successful when referring to those content creators who are interested in the games of your type, especially if you write to them about why you turned to them.  Examine the question a bit and find content creators who have played games similar to yours.  Most of us attracted our audience to certain types and genres of games.  If the game is not suitable for the channel, then the chances are high that the vast majority of viewers will not be interested in it anyway. </li><li>  Do not forget - you are not just trying to ‚Äúsell‚Äù your game to me, you need to convince me that it is suitable for my channel.  There are many games that I like, but I will never record videos about them, because most of my viewers will not watch them. </li></ul><br><h1>  Tip 3: Be professional! </h1><br><ul><li>  If your letter has a lot of spelling and grammatical errors, then I will assume that you put as much effort into your game.  Maybe I will seem overly cynical, but I also ignore such letters.  Take a minute to read the letter before clicking on ‚ÄúSend‚Äù. </li><li>  In addition, it is necessary to write my name correctly (that is, the same as on my channel, on Twitter, etc.).  My name is "Welsknight", not "WelsKnight" and not "Welshknight", and definitely not the name of the last YouTube you wrote to.  I repeat, read the letters. </li></ul><br><h1>  Tip 4: Be patient and not overstate your expectations. </h1><br><ul><li>  I have a crazy schedule (I think, and you, too).  Sometimes it takes a little more time to reply.  Do not send me letters every day, hoping for an answer, they will only annoy me. </li><li>  Every day I get a lot of letters from people asking to play their game.  If my answer is no, then I just will not answer. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Addition: this paragraph also needs explanation.  If I get the impression that I am the only recipient of the letter and at least a little work was invested in it, then most likely, in the case of a ‚Äúno‚Äù answer, you will receive a respectful response with a refusal.  If I get the impression that I received an email just because I got on the general YouTube list with a certain number of subscribers, or that your only difficulty was pressing ‚ÄúCTRL + V, Send,‚Äù then you will not receive an answer, just like I do not answer my local telecommunications company, throwing mailboxes with flyers about my new package of services. </blockquote><br><ul><li>  Games that I want to play are <em>always</em> more than games that I have time to play.  If I ignore the game, it is not necessary because I considered it bad or it did not interest me.  Often this happens just because it can not fit into my schedule. </li><li>  In addition, there were many cases when I received the key, downloaded the game, tried to play and decided that it was not suitable for my channel.  I <em>never</em> decide to create a video for the game without spending some time on it. </li></ul><br><h1>  Tip 5: the most important thing in the first place </h1><br><ul><li>  I read letters from the phone.  I see the headline and the first sentence.  If you do not fit the most important part of the letter in this short piece of text, then I probably will not read the rest. </li><li>  Before clicking on the link or watching the trailer, I briefly look through the letter.  If the basic information about the game (genre, etc.) is not at the very beginning of the letter, then I most likely will not follow the links and watch the trailers. </li><li>  What should be the most important part of the letter?  See tip 2. </li></ul><br>  That's all I can say for now.  Add - these tips do not have a certain order and were recorded in the order of inventing.  I hope I did not seem too cynical - this week the letters were especially bad.  If you have any other questions (about communicating with YouTube / streamers or just about YouTube / streamers in general), then you can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/758n3d/a_few_tips_for_contacting_youtubersstreamers_from/">ask them</a> .

      Update: after the publication, I slept, and now I am ready to add a couple more things that came to mind after the first post. <br><br><ul><li>  When you think about whether you like YouTube to like your game, look at the "Playlists" tab on its channel page!  It will allow you to quickly understand what types of games he plays and what games he played in the past. </li><li>  In addition, a great way to find YouTube users who might like your game is to simply go to Youtube and write something like "[GAME LOOKING TO YOUR] in the search box] Let's Play".  These YouTube players deliberately decided to play games similar to yours, and this greatly increases the chances that they will be interested in it. </li><li>  I am trying to convey to you one basic thought - you need the right person.  Probably, you will not hire a plumber to get you in the yard, and you will not hire a lawnmower to repair the roof.  Similarly, there is no point in asking YouTube to play your first-person shooter, which has attracted its audience to fans of the large-scale 4X strategy genre;  You need a yuber specializing in first person shooters.  It is in them that his audience is interested, she likes games of this particular type, and therefore you need <em>them</em> , and not another channel that deals with a different genre of games.  Although successful multi-genre channels exist, most of us find our niche in a certain set of genres. </li></ul><br><p>  Addition 2: I was asked to give examples, so here are some examples from recent unsuccessful letters with my explanations: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/2b3/58e/0442b358e4be35402b645a9dad835ed8.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  1) There is no information about the game, except for its name, and by name it seemed to me that it would not interest me.  So failure. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a8/e20/823/4a8e20823954613f8924dcb24a502c56.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  2) Oh, flight simulator.  I do not do simulator reviews.  Also no. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e80/d40/40c/e80d4040c24b6adaf30d5ac10b9e4758.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  3) And again, no information about the game, except for the download link.  Renouncement. </p><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/b6c/4e0/19cb6c4e0afddaaef9dd97de83883cfe.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  4) The motto of my channel is ‚ÄúFamily gaming.  Everyday".  He is on the banner of my channel, and this is the first thing that people see on my channel.  I do not think that erotic occult horror is suitable for family viewing.  Besides, I don't play the demo.  Following. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/8dc/f53/6068dcf53b3b5359507a3440726562a1.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  5) There is no information about the game, only if I do not want to download a ZIP file from Google Docs.  In addition, not the most professional letter in the world.  Also miss. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/722/1f9/84b/7221f984b289d04a55e18f2e9c3f6d09.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  6) This letter is already a <em>big</em> step forward; the author appeals to me as a ‚Äúsciencey / buildery Youtuber‚Äù (youtube with reviews of scientific / building games).  This tells me that before sending the letter, he at least studied the channel a little.  I carefully considered the proposal, despite the grammatical errors in the letter.  However, it did not have a key and, more importantly, there is no free space in my schedule right now, so I missed it too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339830/</a></p>
