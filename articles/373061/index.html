  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best LED lamps at half price</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The day before yesterday, I unexpectedly ended up at the IKEA Belaya Dacha store (I was nearby and decided to drop in, buy new test light bulbs).  It was found that in Ikea until January 25, there is a sale and many lamps sell at half price.  These lamps with honest 600 Lm (full replacement of the incandescent lamp 60 W), a very high color rendering index CRI (Ra) = 91.5, a ripple of less than 10% and support for adjusting the brightness (dimming) are sold for 249 rubles (matte) and 229 rubles (transparent ) at the usual price of 499 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb1/d88/238/eb1d882387c421273137e95104975a90.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/categories/departments/lighting/20514/">the IKEA website,</a> these lamps are worth the regular price, and only some of them have a sale price.  Moreover, at home I discovered that here such dimmable candles 400 Lm I was sold for 249 rubles apiece, while on the website and on the price tags in the store the price is 399 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/189/708/48a/18970848a18e582e1ef4762fa6f113b2.jpg"></div><br>  Candles give honest 400 Lm (full replacement of incandescent bulbs 40 W), their color rendition index is even higher - CRI (Ra) = 92.1, ripple less than 10%, dimming almost to zero.

      Other lamps are sold with discounts - LEDARE pears 1000 Lm for 499 rubles instead of 899, GX53 1000 Lm for 599 instead of 1299, GX53 600 Lm for 399 instead of 799, GU10 400 Lm for 229 instead of 399, G45 RIET ball 400 Lm for 169 rubles instead 199, RIET candle 200 Lm for 79 instead of 169, large balls G95 1000 Lm for 649 instead of 799, G95 1800 Lm for 599 instead of 999. <br><br>  upd .: Thanks to the readers!  It turned out that such prices for these lamps are only at IKEA Belaya Dacha.  On the link <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/store/belaya_dacha/sale22">www.ikea.com/ru/ru/store/belaya_dacha/sale22</a> you can see which lamps have discounts at this store.  If you follow this link, choose another store and click on the ‚Äúsale‚Äù banner, you can see which lamps are selling at a discount in other stores. <br><br>  I bought all the new lamps that have not yet been tested on lamptest.ru. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e7/e37/78c/2e7e3778c4e66ec46f7925a9acf1c6f3.jpg"></div><br>  Five lamps are sold under the same articles as before, but now they are different lamps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/886/de7/f73/886de7f7397694a67be5a84c4a1cf257.jpg"></div><br>  The three lamps (903.115.97, 003.014.23, 102.667.54) changed the manufacturer, the bar code changed accordingly (the last 5 digits of the bar code in Ikea encoded the manufacturing plant), the two lamps (203.185.16 and 303.046.51) changed the design , while the manufacturer remained the same and the shtrikod is exactly the same as the old lamps.  You can only distinguish them by designation.  For example, the old spot GU10 303.046.51 has the designation LED1493R6, and the new LED1532R6.  In the old lens, the LEDs protrude from the housing, and in the new they are flush with the housing. <br><br>  It seems that even those lamps that do not change the designations, articles and barcodes, IKEA is slowly refining and improving.  Many IKEA lamps were buzzing at work.  All new lamps are silent (only quietly buzzing when dimming).  For many lamps, the ripple was 15-25%, and for some even up to 29%, for all new lamps the ripple does not exceed 10%.  Many lamps dimmed poorly (the minimum brightness was about 20% of the nominal), now even with a cheap Lezard dimmer from Auchan the minimum brightness is 7%, and with a special dimmer for LED lamps the brightness of dimmed lamps can be reduced to almost zero. <br><br>  IKEA has three types of lamps - dimmable LEDARE, undimmable LEDARE and RYET. <br><br>  Most LEDARE lamps have a color rendering index (CRI) of more than 90. They are very close to incandescent bulbs in terms of light quality.  No other lamps sold in Russia have such high CRI indices, except Nanosvet has several CRI lamps of about 90. CRI over 90 indicates Gauss on its lamps, but this is not true - in fact most of this manufacturer‚Äôs color rendering index values is about 85: <a href="http://lamptest.ru/results/%3Fbrand_2%3Don%26type_1%3Don%26sort%3Dlamp_cri%26page%3D1%26sort%3Dlamp_cri%26type%3D2">lamptest.ru/results/?brand_2=on&amp;type_1=on&amp;sort=lamp_cri&amp;page=1&amp;sort=lamp_cri&amp;type=2</a> . <br><br>  At RYET CRI is about 83. This is at the level of good lamps of all other manufacturers.  In addition, RYET has a simplified driver - unlike LEDARE, these lamps cannot work with switches that have an indicator (they flash when the switch is off). <br><br>  IKEA does not sell cold light bulbs, but there are only two 4000K white light bulbs - 600 and 1000 Lm pears.  All other lamps have a warm light of 2700K - the same as that of incandescent bulbs.  I believe that this is correct - for the house the best light is warm.  White light place only in the office. <br><br>  IKEA very often takes the lamps out of the range and starts selling new models.  So the day before yesterday I found out that RYET 400 Lm candles were removed from the assortment (LEDARE 400 Lm and RYET 200 Lm remained), all G45 LEDARE balls were removed (only two RYET remained - 200 Lm with E27 base and 400 Lm E14) <br><br>  All IKEA lamps have a 2 year warranty (although this is not written anywhere).  If there is a check, they can be exchanged at the Ikea where they were bought for two years, if there is no check, the lamps can be exchanged at any Ikea for 2 years from the production date (on any IKEA lamp the year and week of production are written, for example The bulbs from the title photo, which I bought, show the production dates of 1543 and 1618, so with a loss of the check, 10-20 months of warranty is left). <br><br>  Last spring, I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/273988/">did a review of</a> all the lamps that were sold in IKEA at that time.  The results of testing new lamps will publish on lamptest.ru in the near future. <br><br>  Until the sale is over, IKEA lamps are the best LED lamps that can be bought in Russia for 250 rubles.  I recommend until January 25 to get to IKEA Belaya Dacha and buy them. <br><br>  ps Just in case, I will write that I do not advertise IKEA and company representatives do not know anything about this publication.  Don't know yet :) <br><br>  ¬© 2017, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373061/</a></p>
