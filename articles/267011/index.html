      <b>How did you come to work on Ruby?</b> <br><br>  Like many, wrote in PHP.  Then I got acquainted with Ruby and Rails for a couple of weeks, passed a test task and got into a combat project on Rails (this was back in 2006). <br><br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  The main working draft is <a href="http://www.bioproximity.com/proteome-cluster">ProteomeCluster for the company Bioproximity</a> . <br>  Work takes up half the working time.  The remaining half I try to invest in something smarter than selling my working time: <br>  1) In the spring I got hooked on <a href="http://nemytchenko.ru/leanpoker">Lean Poker</a> , and now, if possible, I spend it wherever I can.  The day after RailsClub I will spend Lean Poker in the Scrumtrack office.  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lean-poker-registration-18394438260">There are still places</a> ;) <br>  2) I recently realized that besides the ‚ÄúHow to stop being Rails-developer‚Äù report there is a lot more to be said on the topic.  I launched the site <a href="http://railshurts.com/">Rails Hurts</a> and at the same time I try to formulate thoughts in the format of a book. <br>  3) From October I start a new thing for myself - a <a href="http://nemytchenko.ru/skillgrid">remote internship for junior ruby ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopers</a> who want to work on a real project so that there is something to show in the resume. <br><br>  <b>What was the last thing you learned from the world of web development?</b> <br><br>  I will not even say.  Just over time, the old knowledge is supplemented and systematized.  Functional approach is a little bit in the head fit. <br><br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  In general, I still think the same: <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="456116996196007936"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  1) The part will continue to fall into functional languages <br>  2) The part will continue to pray for DHH, and not understand why their applications turn into unsupported monsters in six months. <br>  3) Part of the people learned to live and hach ‚Äã‚Äãrail, so that it does not hurt.  Will obviously continue to do this. <br>  4) Well, the part will dig in the direction of modularity and isolation of business logic from the rails. <br><br>  I hope to contribute to this last part. <br><br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  Monopoly Rails for web development.  Although this in itself is not a problem, but the consequences of this are quite harmful. <br><br><br>  <b>What is missing in Rails?</b> <br><br>  Well, everyone probably own something missing.  Depends on the specifics of the project being developed.  Often it's not about missing something in Rails.  Often in the head there is not enough understanding how to use Rails so as not to rake :) <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  I'm not a polyglot at all.  I managed to try a little Clojure - I liked it. <br><br><br>  <b>What technology do you think will be the most promising in the near future?</b> <br><br>  The ability to use the brain will be much in demand technology for a long time. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b>  <b>What projects are you participating in and why?</b> <br><br>  At one of the first Rails Rumble, our team wrote down three <a href="http://inem.github.io/">hemes</a> : <a href="http://inem.github.io/">inem.github.io</a> .  <a href="http://inem.github.io/tequila.html">Tequila</a> later became the inspiration for the author RABL.  But somehow I didn‚Äôt manage to get involved in Open Source seriously. <br>  I really want to participate in the development of Lotus, but not enough time for it. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/andrzejkrzywda">@andrzejkrzywda</a> from <a href="http://blog.arkency.com/">Arkency</a> is a great fellow.  And reading the blog <a href="https://twitter.com/adman65">@ adman65 once helped</a> me a lot too: <a href="http://hawkins.io/">hawkins.io</a> <br><br><br>  <b>Best read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  It seems to me that it has not been written yet. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Not to take slogans and postulates on faith, but to check everything first hand. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  In the third grade at school they made a wall newspaper, where everyone answered the question about a dream.  I answered: ‚ÄúI want everything to be like a fairy tale‚Äù :) <br>  If you look at the development of technology today, then we can assume that in a sense, it has come true.  For many of us, work is quite a ‚ÄúMonday begins on Saturday‚Äù. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  Nope <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  The same as now - internship and project Rails Hurts, only fulltime. <br><br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview!</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Ivan will tell you <b>how to stop being a Rails developer</b> . <br>  For a long time, we thought we were different.  That the Rails approach is so cool that we don‚Äôt have a whole class of problems that unfortunate Javista tinker with.  But for some reason, Rails applications with enviable regularity turn into unsupported monsters in six months, or even less.  It turns out that we are not really us and others: \ Ivan will share the experience of switching the brain from Rails-only-mode. <br><br>  As he writes himself: <br>  ‚ÄúAs soon as you stop taking for granted the default way of organizing code in Rails, wonderful things happen.  In my case, the new roles of objects (Form objects, Services, Repositories) appeared in the code in a natural way - as solutions to specific problems, and not because of what Martin Fowler bequeathed to us.  As a result, I received a flexible (modular, if you want) code that is easy to maintain and modify. <br><br>  Colleagues, stop blaming the mess in the DHH code!  The year 2015 is a great time to become someone more than a framework-based programmer. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Interesting?</b>  <b>You on <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub</a> !</b> <br><br><h4>  Our sponsors </h4><br>  General partner: <b><a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a></b> <br>  Gold Partners: <b><a href="https://cloudcastle.ru/">Cloud Castle</a></b> and <a href="http://npoprogress.com/"><b>Progress</b></a> <br>  Silver Partners: <b><a href="http://www.at-consulting.ru/">AT-Consulting</a></b> , <b><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></b> , <b><a href="http://www.insales.ru/page/vacancy-ruby-on-rails">InSales</a></b> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/"><b>JetBrains</b></a> <br>  Bronze Partners: <b><a href="http://rambler-co.ru/">Rambler &amp; Co</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/">Look at Media</a></b> <br><br>  Stay up to date with our news by subscribing to the newsletter on the website railsclub.ru, and stay tuned for updates: <br>  <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub.ru</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/railsclub_ru">twitter.com/railsclub_ru</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/railsclub">facebook.com/railsclub</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267011/</a></p>
