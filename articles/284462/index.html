  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Massive intimidation of pirates will begin in the UK</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Newsletters in the style of ‚ÄúPay or receive a subpoena‚Äù in the UK have been expanded by another 30,000 people whose names and addresses are obtained from Internet service providers.  Medical firm lawyers <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/30000-internet-users-to-receive-file-sharing-cash-demands-091125/">will begin distribution</a> in the coming weeks. <br><br>  It is known that in many cases it is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/72161/">much more profitable for</a> companies <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/72161/">to</a> collect fines from users of P2P networks than to sell the same products through legal stores.  In the first case, the amount of fees may be much higher.  As you can see, companies are gradually moving to this scheme. <br><br>  Permission for mass mailing of letters was received on November 19 as a result of hearings held in a London court.  Lawyers of the claimant ACS: Law, representatives of the Internet provider British Telecom (25,000 user addresses were obtained from it), as well as two users who were mistakenly accused of such offenses of the user who are regular visitors to the <a href="http://www.beingthreatened.com/">BeingThreatened.com</a> forums where they give P2P advice -users, future victims of threats from rights holders.  That is, these two represented the public. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The highlight of this case is that letters with threats are sent only on the basis of binding the IP address to its owner, which is not legal evidence.  That is, this information is not enough to charge the user through the court.  Moreover, representatives of media corporations themselves admit that not all recipients of such letters are guilty. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      That is why the mass mailing scheme is very profitable.  As practice shows, about half of the recipients of the letter agree to pay compensation, especially if the letter mentions the word ‚Äúpornography‚Äù, and respectable citizens do not want publicity.  Accordingly, the company receives hundreds of thousands of dollars with little or no effort.  This is the so-called "quick spin money."  Legal proceedings are not needed at all if people pay themselves.  And they pay if they scare them well. <br><br>  Thanks to BeingThreatened.com, information about the upcoming campaign to wring out money in the UK was leaked to the press, so that some users will be ready to receive "shocking letters."  Experts from BeingThreatened.com explain exactly how to avoid prosecution.  This requires sending a return letter to ACS: Law with the explanation that the accusation was made by mistake.  This is enough, because it is unlikely that the case will continue in court, because lawyers are much easier to send 30,000 more letters than to waste time and effort on individual court proceedings. <br><br>  It can be expected that in the future similar earnings schemes will be activated in other countries where piracy is popular. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284462/</a></p>
