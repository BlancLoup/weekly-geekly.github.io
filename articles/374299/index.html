  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales! 4 million HyperX headsets have found their lucky owners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  As Professor Farnsworth of Futurama said: ‚ÄúGood news, folks!‚Äù In February of this year, sales of HyperX headsets surpassed four million.  This, by the way, is three times more than the entire circulation of the first iPhone.  Such a number of headsets would be enough to provide an excellent gaming accessory for every resident of Latvia, Estonia and Luxembourg combined.  And the passage of this long-awaited checkpoint once again confirms that HyperX headsets are needed and loved by all buyers - from gamers to regular users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w8/ym/ub/w8ymubknd-b8jebft42b-dap3lk.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/u4/xg/udu4xgnfv_rsmllqc_t16593my8.gif"></div><br>  <i>February.</i>  <i>Russian office HyperX.</i> <br><br>  We have been creating gaming headsets since April 2014, that is, almost four years.  And if it took us a little less than two years to sell the first million devices, over the next two years we have already sold three million devices!  Now our headsets can be bought in 15 thousand stores in more than 100 countries on six continents.  During this time, our devices have received such a <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/reviews">set of awards</a> , as the North Korean generals would have envied.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/71/8y/js/718yjs75izre6xx_ucy8q412pns.jpeg"><br>  <i>If the HyperX headsets were humans.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  After the first million headsets sold, the HyperX brand entrenched in the cyber sports environment - not only ordinary gamers, but also world-famous champions began to use our accessories.  Who said there that HyperX cybersportsmen do not choose?  Here is a <a href="https://www.kingston.com/ru/hyperx/esports">list</a> of 23 world-famous teams that confirm the opposite. <br><br><h2>  Records and awards </h2><br>  Each of our headsets has left its mark on history.  For example, the elegant <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/headsets/cloud-stinger-gaming-headset">Cloud Stinger</a> was recognized as the best gaming headset in the segment up to $ 50 and even <a href="https://ifworlddesignguide.com/search%3Fsearch%3Dhyperx">received a</a> very prestigious iF design 2017 award. We also received awards from leading gaming publications.  PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/headset-of-the-year-kingston-hyperx-cloud-revolver/">was called the</a> <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/headsets/cloud-revolver-gaming-headset">Cloud Revolver</a> Headset of the Year.  The journalists noted a very high-quality sound and comfort during long-term use.  Yes, thank you, now it was especially nice! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHvoHLjWB_g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The world-famous IGN.com <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/25/hyperx-cloud-alpha-gaming-headset-review">called the</a> ‚Äúamazing‚Äù <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/headsets/cloud-alpha-pro-gaming-headset">Cloud Alpha</a> model for the two-chamber design of the cups: it provides a richer sound and emphasizes the spectacular bass, but does not change the dimensions.  The headset achieves the perfect balance between high and low frequencies.  Remember how cheap headsets are abnormally masquerading, hiding mids behind the bass?  Cloud Alpha is completely free from this drawback. <br><br>  New HyperX Cloud Flight - our first wireless model - <a href="http://headphones.reviewed.com/features/these-are-the-best-new-headphones-coming-in-2018">was</a> the Editor's Choice Reviewed.com edition as part of the review of announcements at CES 2018. For a short time since the release of the headset, she collected a lot of positive customer reviews. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bEQelY3ZEYk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And now the most impressive record: the headset HyperX Cloud II, recognized as the best model in the range of up to $ 100, was sold with a circulation of 1.3 million units!  This is a third of the sales of all headsets in four years.  In general, <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/headsets/cloud-gaming-headset%3Fpartnum%3DKHX-HSCP-RD">Cloud II was a</a> great success, otherwise you can‚Äôt tell. <br><br><h2>  It's all about magic bubbles </h2><br>  What is so special about HyperX headsets that they sold 4 million copies?  The secret is simple - cool foods, some hypnosis and a hare's foot under the shelves of stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/c3/_y/ddc3_y0ay6gqtdikz68vqob-hbw.jpeg"><br><br>  Although, to be honest, the whole thing in the feedback.  Make a good headset is real, but you can bring it to perfection, only taking into account the opinion of buyers.  HyperX works closely with gaming communities in all countries, and this is not only about athletes, reviews on store websites and comments (including articles on GT including) are taken into account.  We collect all the comments, systematize them and send them to the head office of the engineers so that they take into account the significant nuances when creating future models. <br><br>  For example, in the second version of the Cloud series, the usual foam in the headband was replaced with memory foam, and the microphone received noise reduction and an extended frequency range. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Del-COakcB5g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el-COakcB5g</a> <br>  It is not a sin to talk about our exclusive memory foam, which is used in ear cushions and headbands of HyperX headsets, in more detail.  It is much softer and lighter than foam, and provides excellent noise insulation in both directions.  In HyperX headsets with this foam, you can play CS: GO, Overwatch, Starcraft II or even Heroes of Might and Magic III for hours on end - your head and temples will not get tired like most other full-size headsets. <br><br><h2>  Further more </h2><br>  4 million headsets are a lot.  Not every game manufacturer can boast of such a circulation.  But HyperX is not only headsets, but also professional <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/mice/pulsefire-fps-gaming-mouse">gaming mice</a> with ultra-precise sensors and an ergonomic shape, steel <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/ru/keyboards">premium keyboards</a> with pinpoint RGB backlighting (and now also proprietary software!), RAM, high-speed SSD, capacious USB flash drives and even gaming mouse pads.  And each of these areas, we provide maximum attention, listen to your feedback and wishes, and always try to make the best products - in terms of quality, convenience, functionality and attractive prices. <br><br>  2018 has just begun, but we have already presented a number of new products at the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/297165/">January CES</a> .  And this year you are waiting for new gaming devices, even more cool.  And we are waiting for new records and well-deserved rewards :) Because HyperX is serious. <br><br><hr><br>  And we remind that for all fans of the products of Kingston and HyperX in our blog, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/298637/">a competition is held</a> before March 28, in which there are: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFuryDDR4">HyperX Fury DDR4 Memory Kit</a> (HX426C16FWK2 / 32) </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireCT">HyperX Pulsefire FPS Mouse</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFurySCT">Rug HyperX Fury S Pro XL</a> </li><li>  HyperX hoodies - 2 pieces. </li><li>  HyperX T-shirts - 5 pcs. </li></ul><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">the company's</a> official <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374299/</a></p>
