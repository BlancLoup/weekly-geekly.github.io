This will definitely tell in detail in the near future.  And here I want to share my impressions of one device, which, in fact, was the reason for this excursion and, I must say, really impressed. <br><br>  Those who follow the high-tech news, I think, have heard many times about the technology of obtaining stereo images.  Zalman has been selling the <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/24761">Trimon ZM-M220W</a> stereo <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/24761">monitor</a> for quite a long time, and competitors, for example, <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/25226">iZ3D</a> , are not in debt <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/25226">either</a> . <br><br>  But recently NVIDIA and Samsung joined the game.

      Samsung has released a seemingly unremarkable monitor SyncMaster 2233RZ on the usual TN-matrix.  But it has one interesting feature - it supports a sweep frequency of 120 Hz.  Why does such a sweep need an LCD monitor if it does not flicker even at 60 hertz?  First, as <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/26377">shown by</a> biased tests, the high frequency greatly increases the smoothness of the dynamic image.  I can confirm this because I saw it with my own eyes: the most usual movement of windows is much smoother than on the screen with a standard scan. <br><br>  But this is not even the main advantage of such a monitor.  More interestingly, a 120 Hz sweep made it possible to get a stereo image.  This required an additional device, which NVIDIA was not slow to introduce - a stereo glasses for GeForce 3D Vision.  In short, the technology is very simple: each eye has its own picture, as if different eyes are looking at the object from different angles.  More details can be found in the <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/monitors/26378">review</a> . <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that this technology allows you to make truly three-dimensional any, even old, 3D-games, and in the future, and movies.  Any special changes in the algorithms are not needed.  The video card simply calculates and displays the image from two different points of shooting.  This, of course, increases the load on the graphics processor exactly twice.  But for the application of the same principle in the films will have to shoot two cameras, by analogy with two microphones for stereo sound.  Therefore, here, unfortunately, it will not be possible to watch an old favorite movie in 3D. <br><br>  I'm not a fan of games, but what I was able to see was really impressive: an absolutely full sense of the three-dimensionality of the scene! <br><br>  The technology is working only with NVIDIA cards and only with DirectX.  Below are the pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Appearance kit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03a/2d6/247/03a2d6247a200645e9882f7297aba457.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the picture of the usual 3DMark video looks on the monitor without glasses (I apologize for the quality of the photo): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/418/6e9/6ab/4186e96aba72b2974142584eb3c114d2.jpg"><br><br>  The transmitter is connected to the computer via USB and with the help of the IR signal it synchronizes the frames on the monitor with the work of the shutters on the lenses.  The range of about 5 meters.  The glasses have a built-in battery.  All electronics are very compact and hidden under plastic. <br><br>  There is, however, one noticeable flaw - everything that you see around the monitor flickers at a frequency of 60 Hz.  If you sit close, it is not very noticeable, but if you at least move away a little, then I think your eyes will tire. <br><br>  But the glasses work in any resolution of the monitor - if only the video card coped (which they couldn‚Äôt think of to maintain the sales of top GPUs :). <br><br>  Viewing angles and color reproduction when using glasses do not differ from normal operation behind the monitor.  Due to some darkening of the lenses, the contrast of the picture even increases. <br><br>  The distance between the eyes is adjusted by the setting in the driver (not physically, of course, but the distance between the shooting points;) <br><br>  In general, the technology has left an interesting impression. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not possible to show what the 3D picture looks like on the photo, so if you want to take a look with your own eyes, it‚Äôs quite real - from today, the F-Center has a stand with this monitor and glasses <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Fhardnews/2009/05/27">open</a> to everyone.  You can also chat with the authors of technical articles of the portal.  I think there will be Oleg Artamonov, who wrote all the above reviews. <br><br>  <b>Update</b> .  The Ministry of Health warns about the harm from the abuse of games :) In the comments, by the way, interesting things are mentioned about the insecurity of the long use of such glasses.  I can not check, but it may well be.  I personally personally consider such immersions in virtual reality unsafe.  Looked - beautiful.  But I will not use it.  Pure academic interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60673/</a></p>
