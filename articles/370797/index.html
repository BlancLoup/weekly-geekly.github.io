  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nostalgia for wow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company that opened the worlds of Warcraft, StarCraft and Diablo to us, Blizzard at one of the auctions put out its ‚Äúobsolete‚Äù hardware as lots, thanks to which, players got the opportunity to get their own piece of WoW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7bd/703/fa6/7bd703fa63d4466983478d05868696d2.png"><br><br>  The blade server will be delivered to your door in a transparent "crystal coffin", actually a glass box, but why not turn on the fantasy.  In appearance, you will not find anything special: a green card, a RAM block, a reliable, powerful processor that plowed tirelessly 24/7 and carried thousands of gamers into the world of Azeroth.  Embossed, silent, ivory World of Warcraft logo placed on top, below - silver signatures of the developers of the legendary game.  In the middle - the name of the server (corresponds to the key characters of the legend of Warcraft) and a brief farewell from the creators of Blizzard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúBefore you is not just hardware, not an ordinary blade server, but something more: the vital energy of the magical world flowed through electrical circuits, the hard drive kept information about adventures and friendship.  From fishing in various reservoirs around the world to the victory over Arthas Menethil in the Icecrown Citadel.  This piece of iron contains thousands of all-consuming impressions, ‚Äùit says.  "We are grateful for the safety of this memorable part of our history."

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cac/280/daf/cac280daf2924d1793e41016751ad406.png"><br><br>  World of Warcraft consists of hundreds of realms, game worlds, as indicated in the flavor text of the game.  Each of them hosts units of the n-number of gamers (according to data, by 2014 more than 100 million accounts were created).  Roughly speaking, these are neighbors in World of Warcraft - each realm (the game world) has its own level of economic development and emotional content that the players of this realm themselves create. <br><br>  Technologies are in rapid development, so it‚Äôs not surprising that by 2012, not a lot is not enough, but 8 years have passed since the release of the first version of Warcraft in 2004 ‚Äî many server technologies have become outdated.  Blizzard's predictable solution is to relocate an extremely popular mass multiplayer online game (MMO) to new, more powerful servers, respectively - decommissioning old blade servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ff/9f7/7c3/1ff9f77c3e4048f4af00fb38416a68de.png"><br><br>  It would be unacceptable to use iron in any less resource-intensive projects or simply dispose of them, because the company decided to do otherwise, putting them up for auction, and send the funds to the children's hospital.  St.  Judah  It was clear that, despite the unsightly appearance, these blade servers would be in demand in the Warcraft community.  WoW fans have got a unique opportunity to get one of 300 ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù tombs with blades placed inside.  In short, Blizzard knows a lot about how to get benefits in everything. <br><br>  31-year-old Chris: "Unfortunately, I did not manage to get one of the blade servers at the initial auction. I wanted to buy 4 game worlds, but that day I worked and could not physically update the page physically per second ... these lots went to other users. After For some time I tried to find one of the servers in the secondary market, but it was not easy, and the prices went off scale. On eBay, we managed to make a good deal and get my sample of the game world of Warcraft (Blackhand server). " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b65/de9/820/b65de98201d14655b0ab01cd0a93cd09.png"><br><br>  Chris set the server, creating the Sanctuary of the Seven Stars, in his office.  This holy of holies is located above the glass cabinet, which houses the collection editions of World of Warcraft, and next to the server are the figures of Illidan Stormrage and Arthas Menethil.  In Chris's dreams, there is hope for a collector's version of the original World of Warcraft.  A piece of obsolete iron looks odd compared to the rest of the collection.  The server does not shine green like Illidan's eyes, it does not come in a luxury box, like a Legion gaming mouse.  But that's not the point.  For Chris, who spent the last 12 years in the world of WoW, the server is more valuable than all the other Blizzard souvenir items ever sold. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMany of my most exciting moments in life are moments spent with friends in the virtual world of World of Warcraft.  From the beginning of the game to getting your server - everything was exciting.  As a result, I developed a valuable friendship in the real world with many gamers.  And this is not just an outdated piece of hardware - it is a memory and a reminder of this time. ‚Äù <br><br>  23-year-old Alex, who lives in England, was also unable to purchase part of the game world at the initial auction.  He was young and there was no money to buy.  He played World of Warcraft as a teenager, in college and after graduation.  Now, from time to time, he continues to play, of course, without devoting, as in his youth, all his time to the game, but nonetheless plunges into this wonderful world anew, experiencing those emotions as before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c0a/b00/6f2/c0ab006f2aa942458de1f95f1b8b8a20.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that today I‚Äôm the person who made this game,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúI dedicated a large segment of life to Warcraft.  This played a huge role in the development of me as a person in society.  The game of Warcraft for me is like life in another dimension, it is different from other games, after passing which, you no longer return to them. ‚Äù <br><br>  He managed to get the server Grim Batol, which became the property of his living room.  All other exhibits of the Warcraft collection look like entertaining toys, the blade is the only serious object that impresses Alex's friends who have never traveled across Azeroth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2ff/062/fea/2ff062feaaf745b5aeae007239e59649.png"><br><br>  "I just wanted to own a part of World of Warcraft," he continues.  ‚ÄúThe game has been a huge head of my life for so long, and the blade server helps me to feel that I am also a piece of something grand.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c9a/feb/142/c9afeb142a2b477aa29d3967452084d2.png"><br><br>  The newest high-performance blade servers will cost you about 15 thousand dollars.  On eBay, you can take part in the auction of the Frostmourne replica (Ice of Sorrow - the rune blade ejected by Ner'zhul, the Lich King) for 1200 green.  There is a desire to lay out that amount for a piece of the legend?  You have every right.  Everything in this world is relative.  In the virtual as well. <br><br>  "It‚Äôs like a collector‚Äôs world: it‚Äôs worth it if someone is willing to pay for it," says Chris. "Why not? Someone who still plays WoW on Blackhand can be successful in real life world, it costs him nothing to pay a couple of thousand dollars for his "personal" server. " <br><br>  At the mention of WoW encompass feelings bordering on melancholy.  Just remember: you and 20 friends overthrew the greatest villains.  Constantly committed heroic deeds.  And over time, things are not as they used to be ... Someone gets a child and cannot make time not only for the game, someone burns out and goes headlong into the real world, gamers who have inculcated your interest and enticed you to Azeroth , gradually disappear from the screens, your fuse disappears.  Suddenly, you may feel silly to some extent, for some of your most cherished memories relate to unusual battles in the Den of Wing of Darkness.  All this causes a slight sadness, nostalgia. <br><br>  Blizzard on each server blade sold leaves an inscription in which the date of birth and death of the real is recorded.  "Grim Batol, May 8, 2005 - August 4, 2010."  For Blizzard, development is not just technology, things or objects, first and foremost an organism that was once filled with human emotions and experiences. <br><br>  Get your piece of legend?
