A small plastic cube equipped with buttons, wheels and a switch performs one single task - it helps to calm and concentrate the owner, who turns it in his hands, turns the wheels and clicks the buttons.  Such a tactile nerve damper is akin to a rosary or Chinese balls, but in our realities, the process of squeezing it can be compared to clicking a pen or spinning any small object in your hands. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/782/220/62e/78222062e83b411689cb67929192f831.gif"></div><br>  The novelty caused a great resonance in the geek environment - among fans of various start-ups and innovations, raised a wave of hype and attracted everyone‚Äôs attention.  Attention is well deserved, because it really works.  In addition, this toy develops fine motor skills, which contributes to the formation of new neural connections and is the prevention of certain diseases. <br><br>  There is only one small problem:

      Not everyone is ready to make an order from abroad, wait a long time for delivery and overpay for it more than the toy itself costs.  And at local retailers from whom the Fidget Cube can be purchased locally, prices are somewhat sad. <br><br>  But there is no reason to be sad: we have picked up more than a dozen alternatives, other fidget toys, which will successfully replace this unusual item.  3D printing will help to choose and create any of them, without overpaying money, which even so much does not happen.  Most of the presented models are distributed in digital form for free, with a free Creative Commons license, and the stamp itself will cost a penny.  And, no less important: it is a much larger choice than several identical cubes differing only in color. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523180"><b>No. 1: Fidget Widget - Fidget Widget</b></a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b0/ff0/567/4b0ff05675df48698423ae840737cece.jpg"></div><br>  Fidget Widget is a rather entertaining toy consisting of six interconnected parts.  At first glance, the thing is rather unassuming, but this is only in the photo.  After you print the Fidget Widget on your 3D and start to twist it in your hands, you will be fascinated by its movement.  Do not believe?  See: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a1/b18/4e1/9a1b184e126d45d0a157694f7b99f169.gif"></div><br><br>  For maximum visual effect, of course, it is better to make it from the material of two contrasting colors. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523180">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:188275">No. 2: Fidget Spinner Ring - Spinning Fijet Ring</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66b/d42/396/66bd4239698f4c718851f8809d339d4d.jpg"></div><br>  If you do not want to advertise your manipulations with the toy, then a custom fjjet ring is your option.  This is just a ring on the finger, the size, color and texture of which you adjust before printing.  The ring can be manipulated with one hand, turning the outer ring on the inner and not attracting too much attention.  And inside you can before printing, in the program-editor, add some message. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:188275">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929504">No. 3: Fidget Star - Star Star</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/8dd/75e/d498dd75eeb44d8fb982892583127b41.jpg"></div><br>  A fun toy, consisting of several parts of complex shape, which is printed in one operation entirely - together with looped connections.  Assembly is not required.  What is it - a cube, a star, something more unusual?  - Decide for you, twist as you want. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929504">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1082508">No. 4: Elliptical Gear - Oval Gears</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/14f/e53/87314fe53e9e41cbbebe0a6781ca9afe.jpg"></div><br>  The oval gear wheel is an elliptical mechanism without a central connection.  When moving parts relative to each other, the center of movement will constantly change. <br><br>  Simple, but frankly stupid toy, which is assembled from four separately printed parts. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1082508">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42608">No. 5: Toy Chain - Chain</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66d/45c/9c3/66d45c9c3f7e4d3d93abbc1e84ac2900.jpg"></div><br>  It can be interesting - take all the filaments available to you and print out several parts from each one, and then connect them in as long a chain as your patience and desire are enough.  It looks simple, but you can create many different forms by manipulating this toy.  In addition, you will get a good sample to demonstrate the capabilities of your 3D printer in working with different materials. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:42608">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:175416">No. 6: Trick Bolt Fidget - Fidget Bolt</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5a/06c/f38/c5a06cf389624260ba7b8154620c9d05.jpg"></div><br>  The fidget bolt was invented by the same person who made the Rotating fidget ring described above.  The original toy in the form of a bolt with two caps, on it sits a nut that can be rotated back and forth.  The nut is limited to the bolt caps and will never be lost, because it is printed together with the bolt on a printer with two extruders.  There is a key ring mount, so this is a good key chain. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:175416">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451">No. 7: Gear Bearing - Gear Bearing</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f2/93c/b29/7f293cb299404e779498edae4c445f91.jpg"></div><br>  One of the most interesting models, a remarkable sample of the possibilities of 3D printing, is the Gear Bearing which is printed at once, all its parts rotate relative to each other.  Some people like to turn it on the hex key, and especially crazy - with a drill to make these gears rotate really fast. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:243278">No. 8: Heart Gears - Mechanical Hearts</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12c/b99/b4d/12cb99b4dcde42209ebe1c248d2b8655.jpg"></div><br>  The work of the same designer as the gear bearing above.  This model requires a small assembly, but the end result is interesting - the object consists of interconnected gears, together having a heart shape, when you turn any of them, the configuration of the model changes, but if rotated further, the original shape returns.  Which is quite symbolic. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-qwmRwOpFQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:243278">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1307100">No. 9: Gyroscopic Relaxing Keyring - Relaxing Gyroscopic Keychain</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/642/350/f6c/642350f6c745430e882013d25b83cf52.jpg"></div><br>  Gyroscopes are quite popular in 3D printing - with proper skill and accuracy they can effectively demonstrate the skill of the author.  But these trinkets are quite simple, almost anyone can print them, perhaps.  Nice toy, but - if you periodically hold her hands - you will give out a constant ringing of keys. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1307100">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/make:247752">No. 10: Nautilus Gears - Shell Gears</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97b/e9f/e0d/97be9fe0d3f2494aa8edb843cc4b9485.jpg"></div><br>  The design of this model is based on logarithmic spirals and the appearance of the marine mollusk Nautilus - the point of contact between gears, as they rotate, constantly ‚Äúdrifts‚Äù back and forth, like that mollusk in the ocean.  Print several copies of different colors and give to your family and friends, they will be pleasantly surprised. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/make:247752">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18471">No. 11: Truchet Tiles - Fifteen</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fb/838/c09/1fb838c09a6b4ba78edc20c9ef1ceff4.jpg"></div><br>  Truchet Tiles is a board game taking up little space.  It is similar to the well-known game ‚Äú15‚Äù, but with a pattern instead of numbers.  The player can turn the chips otherwise for a different pattern.  The peculiarity of this fidget is that it is a project to demonstrate the capabilities of 3D printers with double extrusion.  Although, in a monochrome version, the toy will not lose its functions. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18471">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23685">No.12: Coffin's Half Hour Cube - 3D Puzzle ‚ÄúHalf an hour‚Äù</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eae/88d/b71/eae88db7191348daae55a8ff246b46a2.jpg"></div><br>  If you do not find it inconvenient to take along a fjjet from several separate parts, then this copy will take you a few pleasant minutes.  It is assumed that at least thirty.  This 3D-puzzle, resembling a small three-dimensional Tetris, many collect and longer. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23685">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:697635">No. 13: Ozo 1x2x3 Puzzle Bear - Ozo Puzzle</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/296/54b/baa29654b22e4614bab378b58a78bbdd.jpg"></div><br>  Ozo, perhaps the cutest and most tactile model in this review, is a toy bear, which is based on the Rubik's Cube principle.  The number of elements is smaller, and they are different in shape, but its assembly takes some time, which makes this fjjet interesting not only for children, but also for their parents. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/39656532" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:697635">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:143467">No. 14: Fully Assembled Ball Bearing - Ball Bearing</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/386/002/077/3860020770c84938a78d5ab6370fca3d.jpg"></div><br>  This full-featured ball bearing is great for playing, and its larger version will appeal to those who like to occupy both hands.

Snakes twist and move very naturally.  The author presents Snakez models of four sizes and you can choose which type to print - longer or smaller.

There are several designs to choose from, with some differences in texture and shape. <br><br>  The model is distributed for free, you only need to purchase or remove bearings for it from the old skate.  People who do not have a 3D printer and the ability to order a printout can buy this fidget on <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/product/LN3QR4XEJ/cog-tri-spinner-hand-edc-fidget-spinner%3FoptionId%3D60864346%26li%3DproductGroup">Shapeways</a> (but there will not be bearings in the kit either). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0OJFyHZ7V8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1805719">You can download on Thingiverse</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:784951">No. 17: Magnetic Bisymmetric Hendecahedrons - Magnetic Hexahedrones</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffd/b49/46e/ffdb4946edb64c7fad03ae2890ea9161.jpg"></div><br>  This is a desktop desktop widget or a good gift for a child.  The toy is a designer consisting of 11-sided plastic polygons in which three-millimeter neodymium ball magnets are pressed.

This toy used to be used as a fidget, although the word has not yet existed.  This version differs from the original and earlier copies in a smaller number of segments, more durable plastic and a more noticeable spiny surface texture. <br><br>  Download at the moment, you can not.

If you have not yet disassembled your skate to create the previous one, then you have a second chance.  This design is slightly more compact than the Cog Tri Spinner, and comes with an additional cap-axle for more comfortable holding the bearing with your fingers. <br><br>  Unlike the Cog Tri Spinner, this fidget is only available for purchase on Shapeways, but is available in a variety of colors. <br><br>  Download now can not, but you can design something of your own.

The main difference is that only one bearing is installed in it (which is quite logical), and the space left at the ends of the rays is filled with coins.  Available versions with different number of rays, from two to seven.
