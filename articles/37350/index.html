  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Time management is another step to success.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever wondered how much time you spend on empty talk, on tasks that are not your responsibility, or just on finding the right paper at the moment?  Count, and the result can unpleasantly surprise and even shock.  Now multiply it by the number of working days - and you will understand why, until now, for example, you didn‚Äôt become a boss, why you are not valued too much and you don‚Äôt get paid as much as the staff of the relevant position, or why you so passionately want to change your job position.  But time is the tremendous capital that is given to everyone from birth ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, today any workflow can be accelerated thanks to, for example, the same computer.  Imagine how good it would be for a monitor to sound a task that gave you a highly respected guide, and after a few seconds, get the desired answer on the screen with the necessary data, justifications and calculations, and then come to the boss, report it, get praise, then take it from the shelf pie‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Someday, perhaps it will, but for the time being your workplace exists because it‚Äôs impossible to do without you as a specialist in an organization.  Everything has its time, and we live here and now.  No wonder the poet of the Soviet era, Alexander Kushner, said: "Times do not choose, they live and die in them."  Therefore, let's think together what we lack in order to successfully manage our time.  On this, again, need to allocate time.  But such an investment will subsequently pay off. <br><br>  So, calmly think about how to save at work rapidly running seconds, minutes, hours.  Why, for example, for a meaningless conversation, you are able to quit everything, but not for an important task?  That's right, because idle chatter does not require any effort from you, and the matter needs special concentration of attention.

      1. Separate the priority from the secondary, urgent - from what can still wait.  Immediately prioritize.  Have done an important task - please scatter in the verbal fireworks if you need it.  But no, we always have the opposite!  There is another unpleasant problem: you cannot force yourself to just sit down and do it.  Decide what the trouble is: you do not know how to proceed with the task;  do not understand how to perform it in such a short time;  regret being involved in such a case;  just lazy or scary. <br><br>  Suppose you were assigned something that nobody else in your department did.  In principle, nothing new, but still somewhat scary.  ‚ÄúWhat if I can't do it?‚Äù - you think and postpone the case indefinitely.  The idea is not quite suitable for this situation.  If nothing comes to mind, start with the question that the notorious master of the outrageous Salvador Dali asked himself in the morning: ‚ÄúWhat else will this genius do today?‚Äù Bearing himself in mind.  Or write in capital letters: "The best employee in the field of solving complex (ambitious, large-scale, most responsible) tasks" - and put in front of you.  This tuning maneuver will definitely push you to action.  And along the way you will understand everything else that worries you.  For example, is it possible to cope with the task in such a limited time?  The main thing is that nobody and nothing distracts you from the process. <br><br>  2. Learn to say no to temptations and temptations, as well as the thieves of your work time.  ‚ÄúTime is money,‚Äù as the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin, who is known to us from the images on the hundred dollar bills, wrote in 1748 in his essay ‚ÄúThe Young Merchant‚Äù.  But we for some reason completely forget about it when it comes to the performance of official duties. <br><br>  An acquaintance of mine, a very clever businessman, a person who is fascinated and very sociable, is forced to work at home for most of the time.  It‚Äôs just that his friends in the posh office in the center of Moscow were already catching up at twelve o'clock in the afternoon and ... actively prevented him from working: ‚ÄúOld man, why are you all sitting at the papers?  And if we go to dinner at a new restaurant?  And not to go hunting for us (to the bathhouse, to fishing, to the billiard room, etc.)? ‚ÄùInstead of sending these fish-sticking, the businessman missed advantageous contracts, did not keep track of the existing ones and as a result lost a lot of money.  In such a depressing position, he was guilty himself: he did not know how to say when it was necessary ‚Äúno‚Äù.  And to do this, let's be extremely frank, great art. <br><br>  Basic rules for those who can not say "no": <br><ol><li>  "Do not hang monkeys", as psychologists say.  If you are asked to do something, and you are very busy, do not take on obligations.  So say: "I can not promise anything yet!" </li><li>  In order not to offend the dear "thief of your time", first enter his position, then mentally calculate the possible consequences of his refusal.  And say something like this: ‚ÄúOf course, I understand how important this is for you, but now I just can‚Äôt ...‚Äù </li><li>  Be sure to offer an alternative solution.  For example, to the sentence in paragraph B, add: "Ask Ivan Stepanovich, he understands this question better than me." </li><li>  If you have to refuse someone, do not avoid an unpleasant conversation (‚ÄúIs there no one for Smirnov today?‚Äù Is a familiar phrase?), It‚Äôs better to immediately explain culturally to the person.  And he will have no illusions, and you have a mountain from your shoulders ... </li><li>  Refusing to work, it is especially important to show that the interests of the cause require it, that is, you are not guided by personal motives: ‚ÄúI appreciate your perseverance and endless charm, but the investment you offer to our company does not fit into the budget of this year.‚Äù </li></ol><br><br>  3. Try to improve your own communication skills and organization.  In connection with all of the above, it is necessary to learn to communicate at work quickly and efficiently, and not to beat around the bush.  Then you can rightfully consider: if your co-workers or even more so, your subordinates do not immediately respond to your clear cues and instructions - these are their problems. <br><br>  Try yourself to quickly catch the essence of what they say to you, what they ask for.  Suppose a business partner long and flowery describes that his office was being repaired, because there was a fire in the neighboring building, the home computer was broken, the firm‚Äôs bank account was blocked, and the outgoing accountant confused the bills ... You immediately understood what he was driving at, so stop the interviewee : ‚ÄúIn short, do we need to redo our contract?‚Äù Let the explanation take as little time as possible.  Business is business. <br><br>  If you feel that the conversation is too harsh, soften it with a phrase like: ‚ÄúHow pleasant it is to deal with such a mandatory (attentive, energetic, business-like, sensible, democratic) person like you!‚Äù If you are a boss, learn how to delegate authority functionally and effectively and do not forget to control the process of performing tasks.  Perhaps what you understand from a half-word is not available to your subordinate. <br><br>  However, take the time to clean up the paper debris on your desktop.  Everything you need should be at the moment before your eyes.  Break up old records and documents!  Why do you need papers from the Ochakov times and the conquest of the Crimea?  Only if you know for sure that these documents will ever come up, create an archive: the folder is such and such, to be stored before that.  And at a specified time, do not be lazy to once again view the paper and send unnecessary in the trash.  Do not dwell on the past.  Different thoughts like ‚Äúthat's when we did it this way‚Äù will begin to pull at the soul, memories will flow and you will lose the necessary pace. <br><br>  And one more thing: whatever your work - whether you stamp parts in a factory or draw pictures in a workshop - make the most of your efficiency.  Be responsible, even insignificant at first glance, learn to do a little quality.  This is necessary in order to efficiently use your time (you will not do well - you will have to correct it!), Which means you have to be in good standing and grow through the ranks.  Yes, just to respect yourself. <br><br>  4. Make time work for you.  When Lord Russell‚Äôs cabinet voted to a liberal law extending the rights of citizens, including workers, statesman William Ewart Gladstone, addressing conservatives speaking against the law, wisely said: ‚ÄúYou cannot fight against the future.  Time is working for us. ‚Äù  Hence the expression.  But our task is much deeper than the historical source: we must understand not only what we can get in the future, but also realize the righteousness of our present efforts.  I emphasize that it is righteousness. <br><br>  This applies not only to work, but, oddly enough, personal life.  That, in general, is very closely related.  Let's give a simple everyday example.  The husband, having hit his wife hard, went to the other.  He hid for a long time, fearing reprisals from law enforcement agencies, but upon learning that he was not threatened for injuries, he grew bolder.  And he began to sue with his former second half because of the tiny apartment.  He studied legal and housing codes around the clock, went to various public institutions, tried to attract a child to his side - that is, used all the means to evict his former wife from the apartment, which he had left so recklessly and ingloriously in due time. <br><br>  The woman, having recovered from the beatings and shock, got a good job and directed all her efforts to career growth.  She knew that in this situation she had only a limited amount of time and it should work for her.  While her ex shouted at all corners that he had nowhere to live with a new family and a baby, the woman took out a bank loan and bought an apartment for her grown-up child.  Paying it, started building its own.  Fortunately, a high position in the company allowed her to take loans and credits.  She sold that unfortunate apartment, because of which there was a long-term ugly fuss, of course, giving the share to her ex-husband (which he apparently didn‚Äôt have enough for a down payment, as he still rents a house). <br><br>  Then the lady bought herself an apartment in a luxury house, built a cottage outside the city and eventually opened her own profitable business.  And her ex-husband, apart from neurosis, didn‚Äôt earn anything worthwhile ... Thousands of similar and reverse life examples can be found.  What can you say?  Do not waste precious years on war, feuds, restoration of "justice", be above petty household offenses.  Time is the best doctor.  Work in the literal and figurative sense of your bright tomorrow, and only then will the time itself obey. <br><br>  Remember the song of Michael Tariverdiev to the words of Robert Rozhdestvensky from the television series "Seventeen Moments of Spring," in which it says: "Do not think about seconds down"?  At work, we forget about them just - by smoking, pawing, drinking (tea, coffee or something stronger ...), without even hearing their artistic whistle at our temple.  Of course, everyone has his own temperament: someone, for example, makes decisions quickly, and someone has to think.  But it never served as an excuse for laziness, idle pastime, looseness and professional failures. <br><br>  How can one not recall another statement that is relevant to the theme of our narration, which was voiced in the sixth act of Vladimir Mayakovsky‚Äôs Bath drama: ‚ÄúTime, Forward!‚Äù It became especially popular after the release of the eponymous novel by Valentin Kataev in 1932.  And the well-known Soviet composer George Sviridov gave his musical play the same name, which for a long time served as a screensaver for the evening news program.  Do not forget you that time is inexorably running forward and our task is not to chase this wild, wild horse, but to learn to control it, like a dashing troika that flies to where we point it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37350/</a></p>
