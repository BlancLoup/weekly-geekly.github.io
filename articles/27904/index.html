Have achieved a meeting with an important person.  The meeting is held in the format of you + Boss + N boss assistants.  And here on the most interesting place at the boss the phone rings.  He answers.  What to do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Behavior options: <br><br>  1. <strong>Get offended</strong> .  You do not take a cell phone, or even disconnect it. <br>  <strong>Pros</strong> : you can be respected, you immediately put yourself as a serious person, which you should not neglect, interrupting his speech. <br>  <strong>Cons</strong> : non-constructive, creates unnecessary reasons for misunderstanding, lays a mine for further cooperation.  May have to endure and not like that.

      2. <strong>Ignore</strong> , continuing the conversation in the same manner.  You have something, because you have not been asked (and even if they asked, the refusal was not foreseen). <br>  <strong>Pros</strong> : the boss may feel that he was wrong, colleagues of the boss, having seen your self-confidence, may be filled with respect - you behave on an equal footing. <br>  <strong>Cons</strong> : the boss misses the share of IMPORTANT information, loses attention;  colleagues boss may be offended (they say, how daring), and he himself most likely will not understand your perseverance. <br><br>  3. <strong>Shut up</strong> with a view of a person who is ready to continue at any time. <br>  <strong>Pros</strong> : you respect the decision of a person to be distracted (especially if he asked for permission), you compromise, the conversation is not interrupted.  If your language is properly suspended (otherwise what is your PM?), And the boss is distracted from the meeting no more than 2 times, then it will not cause any damage. <br>  <strong>Cons</strong> : you show that you are ready to sag.  Hamish bosses and assistants may well decide that you are ready for anything, and further - it will be worse.  It can be extremely difficult to stop. <br>  Another important minus.  As a rule, 95% of the project time you will communicate with the assistant, and not the boss.  The fact that you shut up as soon as the boss gets distracted shows that you work for him, without respecting and not speaking on an equal footing with an assistant, humiliates him.  Let the person feel its significance ((c) Dale Carnegie). <br><br>  4. <strong>My option.</strong>  <strong>Reduce the pace and volume of speech, quickly switch the conversation to the assistant and start explaining something moderately interesting and important to the assistant</strong> ;  start a conversation that you can switch to a boss at any time, summarizing it (‚ÄúYes, as my colleague just found out ...‚Äù) and closely monitor the situation: listening to the boss‚Äôs remarks, watching the assistant‚Äôs reaction and making conclusions. <br>  Considerable help can provide personal secretary of the boss, if any.  His reaction will be the most informative - how it is customary here and how to position yourself in order to save face and project. <br>  <strong>Pros</strong> : everyone sees that they are respected;  you keep your importance, the conversation is not interrupted, you get the opportunity to build bridges at all levels: boss, assistant, secretary. <br>  <strong>Cons</strong> : high requirements for experience and negotiation skills, it is important not to disrupt any of the moments: attention, smoothness, correctness, tact in relation to the boss. <br><br>  These are trifles, but from such trifles and the ability to manage the situation and develops the art of negotiation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27904/</a></p>
