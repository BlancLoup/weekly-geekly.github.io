This approach, called structured concurrency, involves building the execution context of competitive threads.  In this context, it is easier to solve the problems of freeing up resources, catching mistakes and canceling associated coruntine. <br><br>  The idea was picked up by developers from other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Kotlin, C, Swift) and gave rise to a lot of questions: <br>  - And if instead of a list of equivalent competitive flows, we now have a graph? <br>  - How to safely transfer data between contexts? <br>  - Who will monitor the life cycle of such graphs? <br>  - How to effectively perform a graph of competitive flows on a single core?  And on a few? <br>  - How to achieve determinism of execution? <br><br>  Meanwhile, these issues were somehow solved in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies. <br><br>  Evangelist of the Moscow Python community Zlata Obukhovskaya will tell you how much the approaches from other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare applicable to the modern python. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1t/9h/kn/1t9hknkfzodzyx3z4t_klcbpreo.jpeg" width="120" height="120" align="left">  <b>Anton Patrushev, Spherical</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Python &amp; Rust: fun together</b> <br>  Rust is a hot topic in today's development world.

But what if this good old approach has problems and that there is more than one tool trying to solve them?  Nikita will talk about the existing problems of dependency management and see how the developers tried and are trying to solve them, go through tools like pip-tools, pipenv, flit, poetry and try to find out if they are worth it for you to pay attention to and bring to their projects, or is it just another train of madness that is worth going through. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lg/u7/j-/lgu7j-uww5-c8dmyuiptwvfo4rk.jpeg" width="120" height="120" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/ok/in/ueokinjhhlw7ifhnldvwg6sn438.jpeg" width="120" height="120" align="left">  <b>Artem Korolev, Timur Kadyrov, Dentsu Aegis Russia</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Creation of industrial datasets for deep learning tasks</b> <br>  The guys will talk about the topic, which you usually don‚Äôt look at Coursera and you don‚Äôt read about Medium: where do the pictures come from for marking dataset;  whether it is worthwhile to mark them up with your own hands or immediately give them to contractors and to the exchange;  how many days it takes to collect customer-specific data;  how to put TK on the markup, etc., etc. <br>  The report is designed for those people who think that deep learning is the lot of big companies with big data and huge departments of data science.

Most of these ECUs are microcontrollers (ESP32) that control peripheral devices: mp3 players, relays, and various sensors and use input / output devices: displays, diodes, buttons, keyboards, and many others.  However, this was not always the case, a couple of years ago there were much fewer devices in quests, the Arduino was the main computing module, and communication between different pairs of devices could occur using different protocols.  The report will be devoted to the formation of the architecture used by the Quest team, to solve similar problems in Micropython, in relation to popular microcontrollers from Espressif Systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/fq/tg/qrfqtgjcc8v0bjqyrao0u4ovjn0.jpeg" width="120" height="120" align="left">  <b>Nikolay Markov, Aligned Research</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Workshop "We pack a pit project from A to Z"</b> <br>  Many developers are not particularly soared with the design of the code and wrapping it in packages, especially with the advent of containers.
