In this speech, its goal is to <em>increase the life expectancy of everyone in the audience by seven and a half minutes</em> .  Our task: how do we then <strong>spend</strong> these bonus minutes of our lives? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the audience expectedly received an answer from her: ‚Äú <em>Spend it on games</em> ‚Äù ... In her previous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdE1DuBesGYM">speech</a> , she suggested that we spend <strong>twenty one billion hours a week</strong> to play video games.  As a result, the first comment she received sounded something like this: ‚Äú <em>On your deathbed, lying in bed, would you really like to spend your last seconds in this world on Angry Birds?</em>  ".  Just recently, a taxi driver who learned that she is a game designer said: <em>‚ÄúI hate games.</em>  <em>It's a waste of time.</em>  <em>Imagine, regret it for the rest of your life ‚Äî regret that the time spent could have been used differently ‚Äù...</em> <br>  She thought a lot about the taxi driver.  <em>‚ÄúIn our bed, on our deathbed, will we regret the time spent on the games?‚Äù</em> ... Here is what the social workers write about this, who released a report on the most often expressed regrets in the dying minutes: <br>  <strong>1</strong> .  I would like less tired work; <br>  <strong>2</strong>  I would like to be closer to my friends; <br>  <strong>3</strong>  I would like to be happier; <br>  <strong>4</strong>  I would like to have enough courage to express my true <em>self</em> ; <br>  <strong>5</strong>  I would like to live a life faithful to my dreams, and not the expectations of everyone else ... <br><br><img title="Jane jane" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/tg12_37222_d32_6144.jpg?w=530&amp;amp;h=356" width="530" height="356"><br><br>  McGonigal cannot help with these problems, but he notes that just <strong><em>games</em></strong> can help us to implement all five points.

      The first paragraph is essentially a <strong>family</strong> .  McGonigal comments: <em>‚ÄúGames are an extremely good way to set up family ties for the right mood, and also they are a good way to spend time together</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  The second item is <strong>friends</strong> .  She notes that one of the main reasons for using games today is to be in touch with friends.  Especially if it‚Äôs a social game like <strong>FarmVille</strong> or <strong>Draw Something</strong> .  Games are an incredibly powerful relationship management tool.  As for <strong>happiness</strong> , the researchers note: <strong>thirty minutes of playing</strong> any online game every day helps better than any antidepressants.  To point number four: games <strong>have always</strong> been a way to explore and demonstrate our true selves.  Here is an example: the latest research from Stanford University shows how idealized avatars change the way we act in real life, making us more confident that there is a <em>positive influence</em> .  The fifth point brings up the main issue of the presentation (at this moment a question symbol from <strong><em>Super Mario</em></strong> appears on the presentation slide). <br><br><img title="It`s a me, MARIO !!!" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8f/62e/878/d8f62e878542289ddb5aa1469ef7b582.jpg" width="400" height="250"><br>  <strong>Who is she?</strong>  <strong>What is her right to tell us that?</strong> <br><br>  Jane McGonigal is not a social worker or a researcher, but she has a right, for she has experience ‚Äî she just recently spent <strong>three months in bed</strong> with one desire ‚Äî <em>rather, to die</em> .  She hit her head and as a result received a severe concussion, which, if not treated correctly, creates frequent <strong>dizziness</strong> , <strong>headache,</strong> and <strong>cognitive impairment</strong> .  The doctor told her that in order to recover, she would need to rest: <em>‚ÄúNo reading, writing, video games, work, mail, jogging, alcohol or caffeine</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  Which may well mean: <em>"There is no point in living</em> . <em>"</em>  This is a joke ( <em>audience laughs</em> ), which, like many jokes, has a <strong>rather serious basis</strong> .  Yes, suicidal thoughts are common for head injuries, which happened to her - the voices in her head began to say that the pain <em>would never end</em> ... and Jane began to fear for her life.  And then she said: <em>"I'm either going to kill myself, or I'm going to turn it all into a game."</em> <br><br>  She called this game " <em>Jane: A Brain Concussion Slayer</em> ".  She called her sister to be her ally in the game.  <em>‚ÄúIt was the easiest of all ways to ask for help,‚Äù</em> says Jane.  Her husband joined the following, and <strong><em>together</em></strong> they fought the <em>‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù</em> that is, everything that could trigger symptoms, such as bright lights or cramped rooms.  They also collected bonuses, anything that could improve their health a bit: a slow walk around the house or hugging a dog.  Even with such a simple game, after only a few days, the clouding began to gradually <strong>pass</strong> : <em>"I felt relieved ... as if a miracle happened</em> . <em>"</em>  Of course, this was not some <em>miraculous healing</em> .  Other symptoms, such as headache and dizziness, continued throughout the year.  But even with them - at least she <strong>did not suffer so much</strong> . <br><br><img title="SHE IS JAAAANE !! 1!" src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/tg12_37530_d41_9460.jpg?w=530&amp;amp;h=384" width="530" height="384"><br><br>  <strong>Superbetter</strong> <br><br>  Already a little later after the incident, she published several posts and videos in her blog, and gave her game a name - <strong>SuperBetter</strong> (roughly translated as <strong><em>‚ÄúSuper Best‚Äù</em></strong> - <em>approx. Translator</em> ).  After these posts, she began to hear feedback from people around the world.  It turns out that they used this game as a treatment for many diseases: even from cancer, even from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Crohn's disease</a> or ALS ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7"><em>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</em></a> ).  They said they felt <strong>stronger</strong> , <strong>braver</strong> , that friends and family began <strong>to understand them better</strong> .  At this point, McGonigal wonders: <em>‚ÄúHow does such a trivial game take effect so powerfully?</em>  <em>In some cases, further human life and ... death</em> . <em>"</em> <br><br>  On this occasion, a study was conducted which said: <em>‚ÄúSome people become stronger, happier after traumatic events</em> .  <em>These people are experiencing what scientists call post-traumatic growth. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  Since the creation of SuperBetter, she discovered that people began to say: <br><br>  <em>My priorities <strong>have changed</strong> ;</em> <br>  <em>I feel <strong>closer</strong> to friends and family;</em> <br>  <em>I <strong>understand</strong> my inner self better.</em>  <em>I know exactly who I really am;</em> <br>  <em>I have <strong>a</strong> new sense of meaning and purpose;</em> <br>  <em>I better <strong>focus</strong> on my goals and dreams ...</em> <br><br>  This, McGonigal notes, is the <strong>exact opposite of the</strong> top five regrets: <em>‚ÄúSomehow, a painful event can open up the possibility of living without regret,‚Äù</em> she says.  How can we make this happen <strong>intentionally</strong> ?  Moreover, how can we control <em>this</em> ?  McGonigal hit literature and found a way to do it ... <br>  She says that we need to work with four exercises.  And gives us <strong>four quests</strong> . <br>  <strong>Quest One</strong> : Stand up and take three steps or clench your hands into fists and raise them above your head for five seconds.  Adds <strong>+1 to physical stability.</strong>  That is, it turns out that <strong>the best</strong> thing you can do for your physical health is <em>not to sit still</em> .  At this point, the audience begins to carry out this quest: everyone raises their hands, clenches their fists ... and she notes those who did not just one, but both of these exercises.  <em>‚ÄúSuper-successful, I like it!‚Äù</em> She says. <br><br>  <strong>Quest Two</strong> : click your fingers fifty times or count back from a hundred, taking seven units.  Exercise adds <strong>+1 to mental stability</strong> , which, in turn, gives decisiveness in difficult situations.  Studies also show that any of our internal qualities are like muscles, which with intensive workouts are getting better and better. <br><br>  <strong>The third quest</strong> : if you are indoors - find the window and look out of it;  if you are outside, then find a window and look into it.  No windows - think about the child [or your favorite animal], and then make a search query on Google or YouTube, making the key word what you saw from the window or remembered.  It gives <strong>+1 to emotional stability</strong> .  Any difficulty, advises Jane, can be overcome if you experience three positive emotions for one negative emotion ... <br><br>  <strong>Quest Four</strong> : Shake hands with someone for six seconds, or send a quick text message or thank-you email to your contacts list, which gives <strong>+1 to social sustainability</strong> .  A great way to improve social sustainability is <strong>gratitude</strong> .  After completing this quest, the audience becomes more relaxed and happy.  It looks like it works. <br><br><img title="Jane ... AGAIN." src="http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/tg12_37470_d41_94001.jpg?w=530&amp;amp;h=400" width="530" height="400"><br><br>  The latest batch of research from McGonigal: "People who <strong>regularly</strong> increase all four types of sustainability live <strong>10 years longer</strong> than others."  This is where she took those seven minutes that she gave us at the beginning ... <br><br>  Our mission, as McGonigal said at the beginning, is <strong>how to spend it</strong> ?  As with the desire to gin: you can wish for a million more desires - use these minutes to get <strong>even more</strong> , to get hours, days, weeks, years ... And if you approach life like a game, then you <strong>will not have any regrets then</strong> , for now you have done something better in yourself. <br><br>  <em>At this point, the room stands up and applauds standing ...</em> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lfBpsV1Hwqs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiNLWjtmTYAdvAz7wkvJ8ENRMh3Hw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148101/</a></p>
