  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the world began the fashion for "anti-MBA"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/203300/">an interview</a> in 2013, Ilon Musk said that he recruits people not because of their MBA degree, but because of its presence: ‚ÄúMBA courses are taught absolutely not to that.  They do not teach people to think.  And the more prestigious courses, the worse.  Because there people are taught to think that they are special, after which they are unable to perceive feedback and analyze their own mistakes impartially. ‚Äù  Dissatisfaction with business schools has grown since the 2008 crisis, when graduates of MBA schools were accused of undermining the economy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dissatisfaction with business schools has led to the creation of anti-MBA courses, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/management/articles/2015/06/11/596065-v-mire-i-v-rossii-v-modu-vhodit-obrazovanie-anti-mva">Vedomosti reports</a> .  The use of abbreviations in the title attracts customers. <br><br>  RZZTT CEO Ivan Kochetkov created the Badass AntiMBA School online course, where the emphasis is not on theory, but on simple things that are often forgotten in everyday life.  20,000 subscribers take part in the course, and its price is only 490 rubles per month. <br><br>  The general director of the Synergy business school, Grigory Avetov, is going to launch his anti-MBA program: in his opinion, entrepreneurs need specific knowledge, not academic disciplines, and special knowledge is needed on the Russian market - Anglo-Saxon textbooks will not help in this country.  The annual program of Avetova will cost 600,000 rubles.

      Dmitry Repin, CEO of Digital October, has created a laboratory for new professions with two short programs on training in big data processing in computer networks and the ‚ÄúProducer of online courses‚Äù. <br><br>  After the crisis in 2008, enrollments in 748 business schools around the world fell until 2013.  In 2014, 65% of two-year programs began to increase the number of applicants.  In 2009, the number of MBA students in Russia decreased by half.  The Director of Human Resources at Foamline, Yulia Sadykova, explains this by the fact that employees understood that employers do not want to pay extra for an MBA and value experience in the first place. <br><br>  In the next ten years, half of the schools with MBA programs will remain out of work, said the dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley Rich Lyons.  Now there are 10,000 business schools in the world, and online courses pose a threat to them. <br><blockquote>  The golden age of business education came in 1950‚Äì2000, when an MBA was considered almost mandatory for a good career.  But now it is in the past.  Even McKinsey willingly works with people who do not have a doctoral or other degree, and teaches them everything herself.  And if you come to an investment bank, you will be told that it is not necessary to get an MBA to become a managing director.  <i>Nitin Noria, Dean, Harvard Business School.</i> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291526/</a></p>
