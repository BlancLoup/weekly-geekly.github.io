  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Morse Code</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/192638/">previous article,</a> we talked about the development of paper mail - its appearance played an important role in history, but before the invention of e-mail, letters went for a very long time.  But the speed of information transmission is sometimes of paramount importance - well, for example, during a war.  Increased horsepower at the driver?  No-no, once technology was invented and without the use of horses.  For example, telegraphs are devices for transmitting signals by wire, radio, and other telecommunication channels.  But about telegraphs - next time, but for now - about the “language” used in them, Morse code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/897/592/e3e/897592e3ee8326499d0934f6cc254c84.jpg"><br><br>  Is it true that the inventor of the alphabet, and of the telegraph as a whole, is the American artist Samuel Finley Breeze Morse (1791-1872)?  In general, yes, but in fact - it seems like no.  According to one of the versions, Morse himself did not develop either one or the other - they say that he simply didn’t have free time for such things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But there were two fellow engineers (Joseph Henry and Alfred Weyl), who once spoke about a device invented in Europe in which a coil of copper wire is controlled by remote signals and transmits the resulting electrical pulses.  Morse instructed techies to implement the idea - so in 1835 a recorder appeared, working from remotely transmitted pulses.  Further more - a few years of improvements, and in 1837 the first electromechanical telegraph apparatus for transmitting and receiving messages appeared (the design of which Morse also had only an indirect relationship), and a year later Alfred Weil suggested the idea of ​​dots and dashes.

      The second legend is longer, but also more beautiful - the atmosphere of a startup is felt in it, and Morse still became an inventor.  Choose what you like best. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a3d/204/962/a3d2049622eb873276657f1804452886.jpg">  So, around the 1830s, Samuel returned from Europe on the steamer Sally.  In a group of people, he overhears discussion of experiments with electromagnetism, they say, an electrical impulse can be instantly detected at any point of even the longest wire.  A little thought of transmitting information in this way was immediately born in the head of a genius, and allegedly already on the ship he sketched a scheme (or even more than one) of a primitive telegraph system.  Moreover, leaving the ship, he told the captain: "Once you hear about such a miracle as the telegraph - you know, it was born on your beautiful ship." <br><br>  In fact, as was the case with many startups, optimism diminished - Morse didn’t manage to make even an electromagnet properly, although he was later told how to isolate the wire and how to carefully wrap it on a horseshoe core.  The result was a primitive apparatus in which an electromagnet attracted a pencil to a moving tape, putting dots and dashes on it. <br><br>  But the resulting device transmitted a signal only for a short distance, so Morse went for advice to Princeton (New Jersey), to Professor Joseph Henry.  By the way, he was already in full swing using the electric telegraph, with which he connected his house to the laboratory (with the only difference that instead of a pencil a bell was used).  Sensei inductance hardly kept himself from uttering the phrase “Read The Fucking Manual”, but then not only spoke about the errors of the Morse circuit, but also introduced him to his remarkable invention, the electromagnetic relay, which allowed to amplify a weak signal as it passed through the circuit repeater).  So Morse pumped his electromagnetic telegraph, which, away from sin, in 1837, he received a patent. <br><br>  And everything would go well, but the “investor” was not in Europe, nor in Russia, or anywhere else - this is now Habr and Kickstarter, but then everything was somewhat more complicated.  The story says that on March 3, 1843, the US Congress began to discuss the draft line of communication between Washington and Baltimore - initially they wanted to make a network of semaphores, but Morse managed to lobby his idea, and they decided to give him a chance.  However, they didn’t decide, but rather, they were lucky: 70 congressmen abstained from voting (stating that they don’t understand what kind of telegraph this is), the rest are 89 For and 83 Against.  The victory of a small majority brought Morse $ 30,000 to build the line. <br><br>  The work (on laying wires to the trees, since it did not work underground) was in full swing until May 24, 1844 - this morning Morse sat in one of the rooms of the Capitol (Washington) in front of the telegraph.  In Baltimore, in front of the same apparatus, sat his assistant, Alfred Vale. <br><br>  Shortly before that, Morse asked Anna Ellsworth (daughter of the head of the US Patent Office) to pick up some cool phrase for the first telegraph message, but she did not come up with anything better than to take a phrase from the Bible: “What hath God wrought!” (Something like “This is what God does!”, Although more often the translation is “Wonderful are your works, Lord!”).  After tapping these words, Samuel Morse publicly marked the beginning of the telegraphic century, and all of America was soon covered by a network of telegraph lines.  Startup shot: red piston, fur storages - yes, that's all) <br><br>  “––– · ·· - - ·· - · - · –– - ··· - - ·· · · - ·· · - - ··· - - · ––––– ·· · · · · - - ··· - –– · ––– ··· · –– · ––– - ·· ·· –– ·· –– ” <br><br>  However, according to other sources, the very first telegram (without a pump and fanfare) seems to have been sent on January 6th, 1838 to a distance of 2 miles (by wire to the Steelwell, not far from Morristown, New Jersey) and was the phrase “A patient waiter is no loser” (“Patiently waiting — not a loser”). <br><br>  · - –– ·· - ··· ·· - - · - · - - ··· - –– ––– · - · –– ·· · - ··· - · –– - ··· - · - –– ·· - ··· ·· - - · - · - ··· - –– –– · · - · –– ···) <br><br>  Similarly, if we talk about telegraphs, the very first electromagnetic telegraph seems to have been invented and created (in St. Petersburg, between the Winter Palace and the Ministry of Railways) a few years earlier (in 1830-32) Baron Pavel Lvovich Schilling von Kanstatt, just his circumstances did not work out.  Subsequently, the electromagnetic telegraph was built in Germany (by Carl Gauss and Wilhelm Weber, 1833) and Great Britain (Cook and Wheatstone, 1837), although all three of these telegraph devices are electromagnetic devices, while the Morse machine was electromechanical.  There were other attempts to create such systems (almost from the 16th century), but they are interesting only from a historical point of view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7e8/f51/8be/7e8f518be8acef6273bb33568e62583f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, as everything was in fact, we are unlikely to know.  However, in 1854, after numerous hearings, the Supreme Court recognized Morse as the sole inventor of the system, and therefore the device / alphabet was only named after him. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#009c46">Telegraph Morse</font> </h2><br>  The design of the device is very simple.  The Morse transmitter is the telegraph key, the receiver is the electromagnet that controls the work of the writing mechanism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/354/4a8/3aa/3544a83aaee1bb3f650af152960fc3a9.jpg"><br><br>  The transmitter serves to close / open the electrical circuit and is a metal lever, the axis of which is in communication with the line wire.  At its one end, the lever is pressed by a spring to a metal ledge with a clamping screw, by means of which it is connected with a wire to the station’s receiving apparatus and to the ground.  If you press the other end of the lever with your hand, it will touch the other protrusion connected to the battery, while, of course, the current will go in line to another station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/856/966/91e/85696691e9e0ec44077cdaafdea0bf92.jpg"><br>  The main parts of the receiver are: a vertical electromagnet, a lever in the form of a rocker arm and a clock mechanism for pulling the paper tape on which the symbols are left with a lever.  By passing a current through it, the electromagnet attracts an iron rod at the end of the lever;  at the same time, the other lever of the lever rises and presses the steel tip at its end to the paper tape, which continuously moves over it by means of a clock mechanism.  When the current is interrupted, the lever is pulled by the spring to its former position.  Depending on the duration of the current on the tape, the tip of the lever leaves traces either in the form of dots or lines - various combinations of these signs make up the Morse code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1a6/69f/c68/1a669fc68ff89de3f0012f28f610f7ce.jpg"><br><br>  Keys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/47b/4de/025/47b4de025020178f40814d6431c241d0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#009c46">Morse code</font> </h2><br>  All telegraphs use the so-called telegraph code - the accepted conventional notation, in which each letter (or sign) has its own combination of elementary premises of an electric current.  The elementary premise (element of the code) is the shortest, of which all the others are composed.  The number of elementary parcels for designating each character in the code may be different (non-uniform codes, for example, Morse code) or the same (uniform codes, for example, Bodo code).  The number of values ​​that an elementary parcel can acquire in the process of transmission is called the base of the code — according to this feature, the codes are divided into binary (binary), ternary, and some others.  Depending on the number of elementary parcels for transmitting characters, uniform codes are distinguished: 5-element, 6-element, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6a6/ce9/5d1/6a6ce95d13066d6997ca87d83f37e61b.jpg"><br><br>  “Morse code” (aka “Morzyanka”) is nothing more than an uneven telegraph code in which signs are indicated by combinations of current packages of various lengths.  The duration of a point is taken as a unit of duration, and the duration of a “dash” is equal to the duration of three points.  The pause between the characters in the letter - one point, and between the letters in the word - 3 points.  Pause between words is 7 points.  All signs in Morse code form the so-called Morse code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fbf/bc4/9d9/fbfbc49d99d593b5ad2c9ad3b2de8aa8.jpg"><br><br>  How to remember all this?  Well, as you know, Moscow was not built right away ... by letter a day - and everything will turn out :) By the way, the vast expanses of the Internet are full of amateur radio sites and forums that have not only information and good advice on memorizing, but all kinds of applications including for Android / iOS) for training. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that the original table of the "Morse code" significantly different from those codes that sound on the amateur bands today.  First, it used parcels of three different lengths (point, dash, and long dash).  Secondly, some of the characters inside their codes had a pause.  The encodings of the modern and original tables match only half of the letters (A, B, D, E, G, H, I, K, M, N, S, T, U, V and W) and do not match for a single digit.  Moreover, for the construction of the code of some characters in the original "Morzian" in general, other principles were used.  So, in addition to the "points" and "dash", there were combinations of "double dash" (letter L) and even "triple dash" (digit 0), and some characters included a pause.  The Latin letter C, for example, was transmitted earlier as “two points-pause-point,” that is, how the letters I and E transmitted successively — such nuances markedly complicated the reception of radiograms.  Including for this reason, soon there appeared various versions of the telegraph alphabet, which did not contain codes with pauses between the packages (Phillips, Balna, "marine", "continental", etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c18/d4e/cfa/c18d4ecfa8beff05606d9da6e4fb2c65.jpg"><br>  <i>Let's talk about telegraphs in the next article.</i> <br><br>  The modern version of the International Morse Code (International Morse) appeared relatively recently - in 1939, when the last adjustment was made (the so-called “continental” version), which mainly referred to punctuation marks.  In modern telegraphy, Morse code is used mainly by radio amateurs, since it has been practically supplanted by the uniform telegraph code of direct-printing telegraphs (which we will discuss in the next article). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/548/da5/c2f/548da5c2f87c35f7cd9cbbc7795a7616.png"><br>  Today, users, like cheese in butter: they do not need any telegraphs, no magnets, no knowledge of secret languages ​​and codes.  Enter the text, press the button "Send" and in a moment it reaches all over the world.  Cool?
