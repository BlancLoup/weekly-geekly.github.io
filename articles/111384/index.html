Not immediately, oh, not immediately, I tasted these devices and plunged into the apple world.  First, the iPhone drove out Nokia, Motorola and Samsung.  Oh, my God, I completely forgot.  All mobile devices I have are lying in the workplace and have not been bought for hard earned money. <br><br>  After a month or two, the iPhone became dangerously dear, his accelerometer and the perfect touchscreen forced my favorite designer toys into it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

I started a couple of games under the emulator and was horrified that I could not enjoy them on the phone.  Evil, for this you have to pay 99 bucks.  A search in the network certainly helped me bypass the apple barriers and enjoy the toy on a piece of iron for free, but! <br><br>  This is a bad, inconvenient, perverted way and Apple created all the conditions for the developer to leave the curve of the track, become a developer and give away $ 99.  I gave.  To not only use their own crafts, but share them with friends, relatives and, oh God, get paid. <br><br>  Speaking of money.  Apple will be happy to withdraw money from any VISA card issued by a Russian bank (I have the IBRD), but will not deposit a single cent on your ruble account.  For future millions, I opened a separate currency account in the same bank.  How to transfer cabbage from it to a wooden map will be printed just below. <br><br>  Dreams of millions did not make my head spin for long.  They ended after putting the first game in the appStore.  She brought me a month of buttting with the iOS Review Team, $ 5 on the first day, a couple of dollars over the next two weeks, for a total of $ 35 including a 30% apple bite.  Apple bites all apple products, even if the product is yours.  Cooling down in dreams, but not in desires, I began to produce games like rabbit rabbits.  This is a poetic heat, it cannot be stopped, nor extinguished until you throw the fire out.  The Apotheosis was the Gonchar toy, which took exactly 7 days to create and receive in the appStore.  Absolute record.  On December 17, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application was announced, and on December 25, a letter came from Apple - Ready for sale. <br><br>  The result of sales of the Potter Wheel was slightly better than the previous ones - 50 purchases in a week.  I know it will continue as usual, 0-1-2 random purchases per day. <br><br>  So, my paradigm of getting an apple pension has taken shape - I will make 100 toys that will bring me an average of $ 1000-2000 per month.  Ok right <br><br>  Ongoing games (I managed to produce them 7-8), began to bring 50-100 dollars a month.  And as you know, only starting with the amount of $ 200 accumulated on your apple account, Apple begins to transfer the grannies to your bank currency account.  As soon as it happened the first time, an apple transferred 160 dollars to my account, for some reason leaving 50 for a snack in its store. <br><br>  To get these first and desirable $ 160 apples, I ran a branch in Nizhny Novgorod (I‚Äôm not a Muscovite) at the MBRD and for 3 hours of communicating with my dear girls, I was first able to look at the contents of my currency account (he was wound up without thinking in Moscow), What designed Internet banking.  Is free.  After that, the girl made a long call on the numerous phones of the metropolitan services of the IBRD and gave me a sample application for transferring $ 160 from a currency account to a ruble card account. <br><br>  Successfully wrote a statement, and who can do it from you?  Keyboard killed epistolary genre.  So, I successfully gave her a handwritten statement and did not have time to get to Arzamas (I am not a Nizhny Novgorod), as my iPhone said, you fell 4,500 rubles.  Yes. <br><br>  The next time, after 2 months, this procedure took 5 minutes, but again required a trip to NN.  The girl was the same, but in a different business suit. <br><br>  Since then, I have not saved more than 200 dollars, but I think the bucks will be dripping for a long time.  Wish them and me good luck. <br><br>  If you are trying not to hurt me too much, ask if your toys are good, dude?  I boldly answer, hell knows.  For verification, I made two of them free until January 31, 2011, and by the way, 100-200 people shake them every day, and 300-400 fighters play them daily, boys and girls from 50 countries around the world try to win Daily Tournaments in three categories.  By the way, Russians and Americans play best of all.  The latter take the number, the race from the US is 5-8 times more than from the rest of the world. <br><br>  Finally, a few comments from the experience of communicating with the iOS Review Team. <br><br>  Do not argue with them, agree, thank for the comments that do not allow your application to the store, make minimal, formal corrections, that's enough. <br><br>  If the comments are stupid, like you are using bitmap that looks like an iPhone image, feel free to rename the project, lay it out again, it will get to the appropriate people and pass the test. <br><br>  Do not flirt with Kate, she braked one of the games for 2 months, stupid, I hope pretty. <br><br>  Myth 1. Checking and going to the store saves your application from errors. <br>  <b>Does not relieve.</b> <br>  I write very casually and secretly hoped at the same time for free testing from the iOS Review Team.  How I was wrong.  One fatal mistake deprived me of 1000 clients with iPhones whose names were UTF8-quotes.  Here you want to bring the code in the supervision of the descendants, but in this blog it is inappropriate. <br><br>  Myth 2. Free Lite version of the application helps sales of the paid version. <br>  <b>Does not help.</b> <br>  For two games I made free versions with reduced functionality.  Lite version downloads didn‚Äôt affect sales of paid counterparts. <br><br>  Myth 3. The lower the price - the more horse racing.  <b>Wigwam.</b>  I assign 1, 2, 5, 10 dollars - the result is approximately the same randomly at the level of noise.  But lower prices increase the level of sales threefold. <br>  Thus, for casual games, you need to assign a price of $ 3, when Apple approves the game, immediately install a sale of $ 1, which significantly increases the number of downloads. <br><br>  Myth 4. Free - download much more.  <b>This is like a Habrovsky UFO.</b>  2 applications out of 4, when they were declared free, took off to the level of more than 100 downloads per day.  But the other two (more salable and in my opinion interesting) did not react at all to the discount.  Your ways are <s>inscrutable Steve Jobs</s> God! <br><br>  Write for iPhone, comrades.  It is pleasant, useful, and some of us will be provided with old age. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111384/</a></p>
