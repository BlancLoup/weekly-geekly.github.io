Officials are concerned that various combinations of swear words, calls for suicide and much more can be added to this number of signs.  To prevent this, in 2010, a list of 4,000 obscene domains that were banned for registration was compiled, such as Sun-KOECHTO-in-chay.rf, bardach.rf, and others.  But practice has shown that users successfully circumvent the restrictions, using the wealth of the Russian language. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The current version of the rules in clause 4.4 provides for possible reasons for refusing to register a domain. <br><br><blockquote>  4.4.  The grounds for refusal of registration are: <br>  (1) the presence of a domain name in the Registry; <br>  (2) the presence of the domain name in the list of reserved domain names; <br>  (3) using as a domain name words that contradict public interests, principles of humanity and morality (in particular, obscene words, anti-human appeals that offend human dignity or religious feelings). </blockquote><br>  That is, ‚Äúobscene words‚Äù in the domain name are still grounds for refusal of registration.  The problem is that this rule is not respected: in most cases, registration is done automatically.

      ‚ÄúBefore launching the .rf domain zone, we prepared a stop-list of swear words, but domains that contain obscene language still appeared.  The creativity of the Russian person has no boundaries, - commented the former general director of the Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet, Andrei Kolesnikov.  - If the word sounds like a mate, and is not written as a mate, then this is an obscene expression?  Or a bad word is written with an error, is it mate?  All this is very controversial. ‚Äù <br><br>  In other words, the Russian language is too rich. <br><br>  Initially, in 2010, about 4,000 words were put on the stop list, which cannot be used in the domain name.  ‚ÄúFor ethical reasons‚Äù this list was not publicly published, although some information became public: any domain could be checked for availability in the stop list. <br><br>  In the first version of the stop list, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/netfox/blog/107906/">rather strange words</a> were encountered, such as sister.rf and bardach.rf.  Soon 88 words were excluded from the list of obscene ones, including ‚Äúprofurset‚Äù, ‚Äúback‚Äù, ‚Äúrastudy‚Äù, ‚Äúundercord‚Äù, ‚Äúglass cutter‚Äù and others. <br><br>  It turned out also that the stop list is not perfect.  For example, they included the domain <b>Sun-KOECHTO-in-chay.rf</b> , but <b>they</b> did not include <b>Sun-KOECHTO-in-kofe.rf</b> .  In general, it is impossible to foresee all variants of obscene vocabulary. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs virtually impossible to pre-moderate,‚Äù explained Sergey Kopylov.  - Since if we add an automated monitoring system for registering obscene words, it will immediately cut off the word hairdresser, as there is a word with the letter ‚Äúx‚Äù.  Semantics does not distinguish a bad word from a good one. ‚Äù <br><br>  In 2013, the problem of mate took up Roskomnadzor.  He applied to the Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences for an explanation of what is considered obscene language.  According to the results of the study, the definition was adopted that four words of the Russian language and their derivatives are considered to be obscene: <br><br><blockquote><ol><li>  obscene designation of the male sexual organ; </li><li>  obscene designation of the female sexual organ; </li><li>  obscene designation of the process of copulation; </li><li>  obscene designation of a woman of dissolute behavior; </li></ol><br>  as well as all linguistic units derived from these words. </blockquote><br>  On the basis of this definition, the domain x ** Chechenaya.rf (to the rhyme of the word ‚Äúlaundry‚Äù), which redirected to the website of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation, was recently delineated.  Anonymous registrars of this domain managed to bypass the stop list of the Coordination Center. <br><br>  After the changes in the ‚ÄúRules for the registration of domain names in the zone .ru and .‚Äù, the powers of organizations that can take action to divide the domains will be expanded.  Currently, Kaspersky Lab, Group-IB, the Center for Internet Technologies Regional Public Organization (ROCIT), Ru-Cert and the Safe Internet League have such powers.  After changes to the Rules, some of these organizations will have the right to segregate and abusive domains. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356038/</a></p>
