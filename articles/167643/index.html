The first model in our market will be the OPPO Finder.  In this post you will find an overview of this device, with all its advantages and disadvantages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83c/714/7ce/83c7147ce0005fdd81ea0c1ae1f4561b.png" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Contents of delivery</b> <br><br>  Two colors will be on sale: black and white.  The smartphone comes in a cardboard box with a decorative-looking and pleasant-looking touch.  Inside is the smartphone itself, as well as instructions, USB cable, charger, headset, microUSB adapter - 3.5 Jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/523/07f/177/52307f1776706db8b121f8ba9030099f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de6/d33/00d/de6d3300d1857794b123e60d9ec8e101.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8b/8fc/34c/e8b8fc34c5e4e164cba0c1c66a45c1bb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The size of the phone is 125 x 66 x 6.65 mm, the camera module protrudes slightly above the main line of the case.  This is the thinnest smartphone on the Russian market.  I would like to note that recently the OPPO has reviewed the thickness of the upper back cover and now the camera is noticeably less protruding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b4/f66/20b/9b4f6620bf14fe42244186f5f982c59c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The weight of the device is 125 grams.  The back cover of the smartphone is made of metal.  It pleasantly cools the hand and tactilely conveys the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãminimalist industrial design embedded in the apparatus.  The frame of the case is stylized as metal, but, in fact, made of durable plastic.  It is pleasant to hold the smartphone in hands and it is very convenient to carry in a pocket because of its compact sizes.  At the same time, it is not felt "fluff". <br><br>  Comparison of appearance.  From left to right: Apple Iphone 4, Apple Iphone 5, Meizu MX, OPPO Finder, Samsung Galaxy S3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ed/65a/562/2ed65a5629125947c09e8565018e3a7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a06/06c/e1d/a0606ce1d7e5d015f9cb25f4e873a30c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cb/0c6/2bd/4cb0c62bd1ce5f5a6ce9922e8692665e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The disadvantages of the appearance include the absence of a 3.5 mm connector.  To minimize discomfort while listening to audio content, branded OPPO headphones with headset functions are included with the device.  In addition to answering and ending a call, the button on the headset also has a media function: while listening to music in the player, pressing once turns on / off the pause, and double pressing switches to the next track.  In addition, the kit includes an adapter to the standard 3.5 mm Jack.  Its use does not affect the sound quality. <br><br>  The justification for the absence of a standard headphone jack is the thickness of the case, which did not allow it to fit.  On the left side of the cap is a slot for microSIM-card, just below - 3 pins for branded accessory OPPO - wireless case - charging.  On the right side is a paired volume button.  The upper end is an on / off / screen lock button, and here is a microUSB connector, also hidden behind the cap.  The button is outside the box on the left.  You quickly get used to this, as it is pronounced exactly under the use of your index finger.  On the rear panel there are: a camera and an LED flash, additional microphone holes for noise cancellation and a speaker.  At the bottom there is a hole in the main microphone.  On the front panel there is a screen, as well as a front-facing camera for video communication, a light sensor, and touch buttons: Menu, Home, Back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e67/f95/f51/e67f95f511ace523260bbae644d1a136.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f79/a1e/f85/f79a1ef85fadb8e1341ea86ad3aefb13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d7/8f0/36b/7d78f036b97550aecaf4881cbfbcf2f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8e/b99/3d4/a8eb993d4f6f911ecf4512da30f940b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/122/c95/b7e/122c95b7e790917d2ea2f053fc900976.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/457/2d2/ee44572d224957ab7299f346b64c55aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/241/b55/10d/241b5510d04448191cee003a1493d675.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Overall, the build quality makes a great impression.  As soon as the device is in the hands - all questions about the build quality and strength disappear by themselves.  The case design does not provide for opening directly by the user.  A few words about the stubs: for more than 4 months of exploiting the smartphone, not a single complaint arose to them, they are very durable and have shown their functionality. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  The OPPO Finder is equipped with a Super AMOLED Plus display, made by Samsung, with a diagonal of 4.3 inches and a resolution of 800x480 pixels. <br>  Displays up to 16 million colors.  Viewing angles are maximum.  The screen remains readable in the sun.  Sensor type capacitive, supports up to 10 simultaneous touches. <br>  Also noteworthy is the fact that in the manufacture of the matrix applied to the standard for the LCD RGB scheme: each pixel is formed of three subpixels.  In practice, this means no PenTile effect. <br><br>  <b>Platform and performance</b> <br><br>  The smartphone is based on Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon S3 MSM8260 dual-core processor, each core has a frequency of 1500 MHz.  GPU Adreno 220 is responsible for video processing. RAM capacity is 1 gigabyte.  In fact, these numbers make Finder work fast, not only in routine tasks.  The smartphone copes with all advanced games, not to mention the applications. <br>  Below are a few examples of ratings in popular benchmarks and the process of playing NFS Most Wanted and Dead Trigger: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d75/7f3/7c3/d757f37c3d5793a862679e508ac5d7d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/b7c/096/3fab7c0960fe87dba12ca023d9cd1668.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XNK0O8QOHo8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhht0VHFDpJo2VJC9H9FE6gAuNxm_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Battery</b> <br><br>  The Finder is equipped with a 1500 mAh lithium-ion battery.  By the current Andorid standards - the figure is small.  But, firstly, the Qualcomm MSM8260 chip has a moderate power consumption.  And, secondly, the software is very much optimized.  Read about it, below.  Claimed working time: talk time - 8 hours and 40 minutes;  Standby time - 400 hours.  In actual operation, ‚Äúunder load‚Äù in the form of Wi-Fi constantly turned on, about 30 minutes of conversation, 20 minutes of HD video and / or music, 20 minutes of games and / or surfing on the network, the Finder quietly lives until the next or the next of the day <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/818/432/564/8184325646693ec6d870201b3fef41a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Communication capabilities</b> <br><br>  Usb  USB data transfer speeds of up to 13 Mb / s (USB Mass Storage), multiple PC connection modes supported - charging only, drive mode, OPPO Assistant mode, modem mode.  It also supports the MHL standard, which, with the appropriate cable, allows you to display a picture on a TV or other monitor. <br>  Bluetooth  Bluetooth 2.0 version, supports a standard set of profiles, including A2DP, in the settings you can specify the automatic shutdown of Bluetooth after a certain time interval. <br>  Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n is supported, you can use your phone as an access point. <br>  GPS  There is a GPS chip, this is part of the Qualcomm chipset, GLONASS is supported.  A cold start takes about 15 seconds, A-GPS also performs positioning very quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/bcf/2fb/c04bcf2fbba508adedfd62e38fe1a6c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The device has an 8 - megapixel camera module, equipped with a flash and autofocus.  For photo and video shooting there is a minimum of settings: HDR, timer, flash control.  The picture quality is average for 8 megapixels, this can be attributed to the disadvantages of the Finder.  But OPPO does not hide it.  Moreover, the software is optimized in such a way that it uses the maximum possible of the hardware that is available.  In future models, modules from another supplier will be applied. <br><br>  Examples of photos taken on the <a href="">OPPO Finder</a> . <br><br>  <b>Software</b> <br><br>  Android 4.0.3 is installed in the Finder with the OPPO Unique UI shell.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis shell can be formulated as "Lightness and Functionality."  In OPPO, they tried to realize their ‚Äúfresh‚Äù look at Android.  At the same time, the functionality is thought out to the smallest detail.  Available, flexible settings can be divided into two types: personalization and functionality. <br>  The first one can include customization of lock screens, menu color schemes, desktop scrolling modes, font sizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/789/f35/f41/789f35f4174e83e591f2d8415bf68a40.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7f/18b/7d7/f7f18b7d7866cbef5a42c18601010737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/7ea/5cf/83d7ea5cf869c7934516073064a36dfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To the second, flexible, ‚Äúreally‚Äù working energy-saving settings, settings for the operation of some functions on a schedule, turning on the alarm even when the device is turned off, high-quality pre-installed software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/383/d58/fc5/383d58fc5f63a160ff46db635fe27169.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the set of applications available "right out of the box", I want to pay special attention.  Several branded OPPO applications are installed in the Finder.  "Energy saving" will help to fully control the smartphone functionality of the same name.  The creation of power modes with the disconnection and inclusion of individual options that affect the battery level is available.  Modes can be controlled either manually or by schedule or automatically.  The Antivirus application is not limited to high-quality protection of the device against malware.  In addition, it combines the functionality of a "firewall" and a center for storing confidential data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e8/e2a/b8a/9e8e2ab8ae6509f40bed42fd47816670.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a19/d46/4bc/a19d464bca3fca141a2e1db71040c4ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3c/8f7/3a2/c3c8f73a2c86c8ebef6cd518d41082a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, Yandex, Quickoffice popular services, clients of popular social networks, ivi.ru cinema, Google services are also preinstalled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c7/6b4/1c0/0c76b41c0b94a996a904ce32d12cac9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The multimedia features of OPPO Finder are standard at first glance: video and audio players. <br>  But pleasantly surprised that the video player supports almost any video format.  Here is a list of supported formats: AVI, MP4, 3GP, MOV, MKV, FLV.  Supports subtitles and technology Dolby Effect, there is an equalizer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34e/57b/3a1/34e57b3a105ca8886e9a9cfaac0ab4f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/213/ae8/662/213ae8662cde7c63f13f594563c884f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91f/290/57b/91f29057b644e4a2bfde9a1d2b2b055f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The audio player is also quite functional.  MP3, AAC, WAV, AMR, FLAC are supported.  Also, if words are ‚Äústitched‚Äù in the music file, they can be displayed, if desired.  There is a switch tracks shaking - is included in the settings.  There is also an equalizer and Dolby Effect, which really transform the sound quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/416/ecb/509/416ecb509e9bedf93b28e9f980c59a02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For OPPO, feedback from users is very important.  For these purposes there is an application of the same name.  Its functionality will allow you to send a report / request for errors by attaching the system logs and a screenshot directly to the company.  These "bugs" will be reviewed and resolved in the next updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5da/afc/57b/5daafc57bdcb53282f8af52bcae24f37.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Support and alternative software.</b> <br><br>  Finder will receive regular, monthly updates via OTA.  Also, the latest firmware versions will be posted on the official OPPO website in Russia - <a href="http://oppo.ru/">oppo.ru.</a>  In addition, the possibility of updating the device to Android 4.1 Jelly Bean is being considered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed2/d08/767/ed2d08767033834fb44fe031a3b9caa1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As an alternative software, the Russian assembly MIUI is already available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/176/2db/b9f/1762dbb9f339160833db716fcaf2577e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The smartphone has been deeply localized and tested for software and functionality (Field Testing).  Therefore, he has no problems with voice quality or signal reception. <br>  In its native Chinese market, Finder started half a year ago.  Inspiration in terms of "iron filling" became the flagships of 2011 from the world leaders in the market of Android-smartphones.  This fact can be attributed to the shortcomings of the device.  But the platform, as before, copes without problems with almost any tasks: both routine and entertaining. <br>  One of the main advantages of Finder is to include design, materials and build quality, dissimilarity to other devices.  It combines design and functionality, will allow you to get new impressions from the use of seemingly familiar to all for a long time familiar Android. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167643/</a></p>
