Some familiarity with the basics of C # programming will be useful for getting acquainted with the course, but this is not mandatory. <br><br><h4>  useful links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/azuretrial">Try Azure</a> for free for 30 days! <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.azurehub.ru/">Microsoft Azure Development Center (azurehub.ru)</a> - scripts, tutorials, examples, design recommendations </li><li>  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/windowsazure_ru">Twitter.com/windowsazure_ru</a> - the latest Microsoft Azure news </li><li>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/azurerus/">Microsoft Azure Community on Facebook</a> - experts, questions </li></ul><br></li><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/mva">Explore</a> Microsoft Virtual Academy <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/mva">courses</a> on cloud and other technologies <br></li><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/getvs">Download</a> free or trial Visual Studio </li><li>  <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/winstart">Become a</a> universal Windows application <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/winstart">developer</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259785/</a></p>
