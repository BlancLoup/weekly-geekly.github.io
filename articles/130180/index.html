  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Investing in gold</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/6526/20111011185019.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Looking at the history of changes in the price of gold, you can calculate what percentage of annual profits you would get if you invested a certain amount into gold 5 - 10 years ago.  You would see that this percentage is ten times higher than the bank interest on deposits.  It even takes into account that the market for gold prices, of course, reacts to the global economy and sometimes prices fall, but in general, since 2000, gold prices have been rising tirelessly.  Consider the main possibilities of investing money in gold. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The most traditional investment option is the purchase of gold bars.  The minimum amount that investors typically buy is one ounce gold, which is approximately 31 grams of gold.  Banks sell such gold ounces in branded packages and with a document confirming the authenticity and sample of gold.  At the time of this writing, the price of a gold ounce was $ 1,642 (as of October 9, 2011).  On many primary Internet resources, world gold prices are expressed in dollars per ounce.  Of course, banks also sell larger gold bars - up to 999 gram or 1 kilogram ingots, depending on the sample.  This type of investment has a very weak side, which is expressed in legislation.  When you buy any amount of gold through a bank, you pay the value of the VAT that it pledges.  If you want to sell gold, you naturally do not receive VAT, so the entire margin during the period you invested, eats up the VAT, making this investment option unpromising.  In addition, the risk factor in the storage of gold bars is present and must be spent either on the cost of the banking cell, or to store gold in a certain cache.

      The scheme with VAT does not apply to those who buy investment or collectible gold coins.  But in this situation there is one thing - the prices of gold coins are always too high, this can be explained.  The price, in addition to gold, includes the cost of producing the coin and evaluating its numismatic value.  Therefore, no one sells gold coins only as gold, by weight. <br><br>  It is also possible to open an impersonal metal account in the bank, in our case - a golden one.  Paying money to the bank and buying gold, you do not actually get it in your hands, it remains in the bank and is stored there.  In fact, in that branch of the bank where you opened an account, there is no gold.  But the bank ensures that your gold account is tied to its gold reserves.  Naturally, for such investments, a reliable bank is selected that is included in the deposit insurance system.  We study its annual reporting, intended for publication.  Professional investors study the entire audit history of this banking structure.  This method of investment will also require storage costs - the bank removes these costs automatically, in the form of a commission, when opening a gold account.  Prices are usually comparable to the cost of renting a bank cell. <br><br>  A very interesting type of investment is investing in e-currency.  In particular, the familiar Web Money system provides an opportunity to open the so-called G-wallets tied to the gold of the highest standard.  Of course, some investors are skeptical of this type of investment - the most sensitive issue is the protection of a virtual wallet.  After all, serious investors do not want to keep several ounces in their accounts, they buy kilograms of gold, and it is very risky to store millions of rubles in an electronic account without actually holding any documents.  Of course, hackers can crack your bank account, but you have documents, and the bank will return everything to you anyway.  The situation with Web Money is different - in the case of theft from your e-wallet, the system will only show the history of transactions and help in applying to law enforcement agencies, but it will not return anything.  In any case, investing in an electronic gold wallet is the most mobile investment in gold.  You can deposit gold to your account at any time using the internal or external system exchanger.  Also, at any time you can exchange your gold in dollars, rubles or euros (and several other currencies).  The Web Money system does not charge commissions, like a bank, for the storage of gold, although it is also tied to the gold reserves of their company. <br><br>  In principle, no matter how to invest in gold, the main thing is to do it at the right moments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130180/</a></p>
