  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ergonomic armrests "ErgoRest"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of this year, I had the opportunity to visit a small exhibition of technological devices created to help people to work with computers.  The exhibition was held on the territory of the Holon Institute of Technology ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_Institute_of_Technology">‚ÄúHIT‚Äù</a> ) and was for informational purposes only. <br><br>  Most of the products presented were designed for people with disabilities.  Some of them are so innovative that they pave the way for future developments of entire computer areas.  There were among the presented to the public developments and such devices that I myself would not refuse to install in my house.  Today I would like to talk about one of them, the ergonomic armrests of the Finnish company <i>ErgoRest</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ffa/336/804/ffa3368044dae35aa4d586a373a63ab0.jpg" alt="image">

      According to the developers, their main goal was to <i>‚Äúdevelop a device that would effectively solve the problem of overuse of muscles in the back, neck and arms of a person working at a computer.‚Äù</i> After talking with Israeli distributors of the company, I realized that the armrest should help first people suffering from diseases of the hands.  Surely, many of you have heard of the so-called <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0"><i>carpal tunnel syndrome</i></a> , better known by the people as <i>carpal tunnel syndrome</i> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Perhaps the armrests have become one of the favorites of the exhibition, so shoot video of people who test them was not difficult.  I, having finished a photo and video filming of the most interesting goods, I put the equipment aside and began to test the devices myself.  Most of all, it is imbued with armrests, so naturally they follow the hand that they do not understand why they are not used everywhere.  The answer to this question loomed itself when I found out about the price of the product.  At that time, one armrest offered at a price equivalent to $ 100.  Not the cheapest solution. <br><br>  Impressions of the tests are pleasant.  Hand movements are natural and to some extent even inert.  The armrest by inertia continues to move in the direction of the hand and thus creates the impression of flight.  )) However, after ten minutes of flight, when other visitors to the exhibition began to resent, I came to the conclusion that some of the movements were still shackled.  But this feeling arose not because of the impossibility of the armrest to turn at the right angle, in the right direction, but because sometimes you just need to remove your hand and make an independent movement with your hand.  And since you do not want to do this at all, such impressions are born.  )) <br><br>  In general, for myself, I concluded that how can I afford to freely dispose of my finances I will return to the question of acquiring such an armrest.  The gadget came out very pleasant, and if you also take into account that it is healthy, it makes you think about purchasing it. <br><br>  And for a snack a small video from the exhibition.  Sorry for the quality - ‚ÄúRuTube" cut all you can. <br>  He turned the fifty-megabyte video into 2 megabytes of poor-quality moving pictures. <br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/1201417.html?v=456d0bf538aae2d329707119053b277a </video><br><br>  PS In the process of writing the article, I found the <a href="http://ergorest.ru/">Russian representative office of the</a> company ErgoRest. <br><br>  Original article on <a href="http://nasladis.net/news/2008-11-15-126">"Enjoy.net"</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44684/</a></p>
