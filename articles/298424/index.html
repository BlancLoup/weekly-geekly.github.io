  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4 key tactical techniques to improve the conversion funnel of your mobile application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/511/495/045/51149504521a3a366da00bafa5e9e4d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you know, the key conversion factors are user registration, profile filling, newsletter subscriptions, and similar events.  Nevertheless, it is crucial to optimize the conversion funnel to increase the cost-effectiveness of attracting users and increasing the user base.  Once the conversion funnel is optimized, you can safely scale the actions to attract the user. <br><br>  But how to do it, where to start?  Which points of conversion are the most important, what should you focus on first?  What to measure, and how to test?  Let's talk about all this today.  We propose to evaluate 4 tactical techniques that allow you to optimize the conversion funnel for your program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reception 1: Looking for holes in a leaky bucket </h3><br>  In an ideal world, the conversion rate from the first day that a user installs your application before performing the first critical action is 100%.  But since none of the companies have such a situation, we need constant work to increase the level of conversion.  It is necessary to evaluate each step of the user in the "funnel", and then see what scares users, and causes them to leave. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It is not worth reminding once again that lowering the conversion threshold is good.  Ideally, users after the installation of the program should be as loyal as possible, and constantly work with this application. <br><br>  But for most apps, the critical point, the place where users leak, is registration.  A registration request, a reminder to register, helps to reduce the number of users and the unwillingness of users to continue acquaintance with an already installed program.  The difficult process of registration and verification is another hole in the ‚Äúleaky bucket‚Äù.  The requirement to fill out a profile is the same.  In order for users not to be frightened and not leave, it is necessary to determine the fact that it is critically necessary to request from a person and what can be abandoned.  Shortening the registration process, making it simple, reducing the number of items to fill in the profile - all this reduces the likelihood of a user leaving, and allows you to optimize the conversion funnel.  The flow of users becomes smoother and faster, so to speak. <br><br><h3>  Reception 2. Working with the user after installing the application (post-installation steps) </h3><br>  As soon as you have decided on the main leaks in the conversion funnel, you can think about developing a plan to create a series of post-installation actions, appeals to the user.  It can be various kinds of messages, interactive advertising (we talked about this in more detail here), information on the application page in the catalog.  Again, this is an optimization process, and it will be different for different audiences.  Some experts recommend segmenting user actions in your application, and working alternately with each group (filling out a profile, requesting certain information, working with the application for a specific time, etc.).  This allows you to focus on working with a narrower range of tasks in the case of each group, rather than dispersing efforts, trying to please everyone and immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/56e/fbd/399/56efbd3996448a2724a80e27f2a88f43.jpg" width="640"><br><br><h3>  Reception 3. Never stop testing. </h3><br>  Check various tricks, updates and elements of the application is always required.  It is necessary to listen to user reviews, analyze and draw conclusions.  One of the goals in this case is to improve the quality of the installation of the application, that is, to attract more active users of long-livers for the same period of time. <br><br>  Adding useful features, channels of communication with users, new levels (in the game, for example) - all this can be useful and in demand.  But without tests to understand this will not work. <br><br>  A particularly careful approach is needed to monetize the application, as we have already <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/appodeal/blog/22500/">mentioned here</a> .  It is worth using the original monetization methods that can make the user more loyal.  For example, <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/appodeal/blog/19750/">work with video</a> . <br><br><h3>  Reception 4. Additional factors </h3><br>  There may be many of them, and for each application they have their own.  For the game it is, for example, a bonus game currency for some achievements, or the opening of a new character.  For a medical application, this may be the provision of information to the user, and the information that is needed directly by him.  An example is a medical application where a person suffering from cardiovascular diseases will receive information about his illness and how to cure it on a regular basis.  And there is no need to take any additional actions, such as searching for reference materials.  The main thing here is to increase user loyalty. <br><br>  As a conclusion, we can say that optimization of the conversion funnel is not just a powerful tool, it is a necessary tool that allows you to achieve your goal and gain a base of active, loyal users.  <a href="http://appodeal.ru/">In this case,</a> we can help monetize your program with advertising without annoying users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298424/</a></p>
