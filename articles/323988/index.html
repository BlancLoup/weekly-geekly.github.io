But I want to start with the features of the organization.  Namely, to talk about the conduct of performances.  This is a fairly standard startup event.  I will try to explain the principle of organization in the simplest language. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/363/6ec/9e9/3636ec9e92b4a1f6c7d98c4b3706fb36.jpg" alt="image">

      Like every conference, Axis begins with an opening statement.  Then investors are invited to the stage one by one, each of them makes a short speech about himself and sits down on the stage.  The whole day of the conference is divided into parts and 6-10 investors are present on the stage in each part.  After the welcome word of each investor, the floor is given to the speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/593/d13/154593d136828e356148e470cb20e35b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The format of the startup presentation is in the form of a funding pitch - a detailed presentation.  After the speeches, during which there is always a lack of time, everyone wants to tell as much as possible about their company and present their project in the most colorful way.  After listening to the speaker, investors can ask their questions.  Then, on a coffee break, a pitcher can discuss his project with interested investors in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/490/cb5/b8d/490cb5b8d4ec3dd0110e329e1d0ddcec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the outside, this is not very similar to a standard IT conference.  There are no streams here; all conference participants do not come here at once.  It feels like the defense of a thesis, when a commission (investors) and a group of students (startups) are invited for a specific time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dba/1b9/ce9/dba1b9ce94f6ff59ebe5ffddec22bf44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the coffee break, start-ups (participants with yellow ribbons) revolve around investors (red ribbons) in an attempt to get a share of their attention and, as much as possible, on their fingers, to talk about the principles of work and the basic idea.  All the others (blue ribbons) came here for networking.  The organizers (white ribbons), in turn, very politely ask all participants to go to the conference room and listen to the performance :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/760/8d6/406/7608d6406a7b49d6f79e1a553c04f68c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In April 2017, Asix will be held in Moscow (April 24-25).  And the main question becomes whether to go there? <br><br>  I managed to talk to many participants and most of them, like I expected to see more people, have a more lively atmosphere, If I may say so, more IT atmosphere.  Here it is more and more directed to communicate with investors with one goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/ee9/3f1/08fee93f1604e34b20df7a75a668432f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, networking is a success.  And each received answers to his questions and a list of new contacts.  For our company abz.agency working in the field of web development as an outsourcing partner, we managed to find more competitors here than new partners and customers.  But I want to note that after a short conversation, our technology stack (Laravel, Symfony frameworks, Node and AngularJS, digital marketing (UX analysis, A / B test, and other CR enhancement methods)) was called quite popular and expressed interest in cooperation.  Which is rather flattering.  Thank you all for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/749/fc3/73c/749fc373c0470208bf5abbf0ae789454.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If readers will be interested in the issue of coffee breaks and business lunch, then I can note an interesting feature.  Despite the fact that the food was delicious and the coffee was fragrant, at the end of each pause, all food remained almost intact.  No, this is not related to the modesty of the visitors, just everyone tried to devote as much time as possible to communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/d5c/398/c23d5c398058cd8120d5574b965a3b25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I want to say a huge thank you to all the organizers for the networking opportunities provided and for the sunny coast on the bank of which this event took place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77f/2eb/84c/77f2eb84cf45f8d1c842333a18073f75.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323988/</a></p>
