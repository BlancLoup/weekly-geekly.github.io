It turns out that this will require very little - to seek advice from nature, which, with an appropriate approach, is always ready to answer any of our questions.  This was done by British researchers, who turned their attention to some peculiarities of the behavior of a Pieridae butterfly before the moment of take-off. <br><br>  How an unassuming butterfly helped to make a genuine energy breakthrough in solar energy and what plans the authors of the invention will have for the near future in our article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecd/f34/7da/ecdf347da6fb259f28e860f900a2ad97.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Efficient use of photovoltaic energy associated with the deployment of a wide array of solar panels.  Researchers at the University of Exeter (UK) - entomologist Richard French-Constant with a group of colleagues led by Tapas Mallika asked a logical question: what should be done in order to increase their effectiveness not by 2-5%, but in the most drastic way, while reducing weight designs and expanding its scope.

      As it turned out, the answer to this fundamental question lay on the surface, but, as they say, the modest butterfly, known to many of us as the Belyanka ordinary, waited in the wings and was helped by its resolution.  As stated by the results of the experiments, French-Constant: "Our study showed that the unassuming white cabbage soup is not just a pest threatening the crop, but also a real expert in the field of collecting solar energy and using it for its own needs." <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Idea</font> </h2><br>  As is known, butterflies, like other insects, are not warm-blooded.  Accordingly, the functioning of the systems of the body responsible for the movement - the flight becomes possible only after a preliminary heating of the responsible groups of motor muscles.  Since the most accessible natural source of heat in nature is the sun's rays, the methods of collecting solar energy vital for an insect can be considered optimal. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Why Pieridae?</font> </h2><br>  The next logical step was to find a candidate for the role of the best ‚Äúoptimizer of solar energy‚Äù.  Since the group of scientists was a professional specialist entomologist, the kingdom of butterflies became a zone of special attention.  And here the most interesting detail came to light: the cabbage soup of the Pieridae family wakes up and appears in free flight much earlier than the others, which is especially noticeable on an overcast day when the sun is hiding behind the clouds.  Perhaps in thousands of similar situations this fact could be considered pure coincidence, but not in the case of the Mallika-French-Constant group.  So the desired object for further research was identified, and with their choice, as shown by the results of experiments, scientists were not mistaken. <br><br>  The main thing remained: to find that cherished key, which allowed Belyanka ordinary to transform the maximum amount of solar energy, demonstrating enviable activity while the rest of the family slept deeply.  A group of physicists led by Mallick suggested that the answer should be sought in the wings of a butterfly, or rather, in their structure and mutual arrangement. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">results</font> </h2><br>  The research results led to the conclusion that a pair of butterfly wings is a complex interconnected system that performs not only the function of supporting the possibility of flight.  A thin layer of rather large (compared to the size of the wing) cells of various purposes and orientations are concentrated on their surface, giving the wing certain optical properties.  Another interesting observation was the fact that such cells in separate places can be located in several layers. <br><br>  One of the most important goals of the study is the need to confirm the assumption that even a single layer of cells on the wing surface is capable of providing a reflective ability sufficient to fulfill its function.  At the same time, the wings of a large Whitehouse must necessarily be located at such an angle that the amount of useful energy reflected from them is necessary for heating the muscles of the butterfly, which are responsible for the flight, to be maximal. <br><br>  Perfectly illustrates the key idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe experiment, the thermal analysis diagram of a butterfly's body with fully opened wings and wings, opened at an optimal angle of 17 ¬∞ after 10 and 35 seconds of exposure.  Pictures taken with an infrared camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2de/6fd/6cf/2de6fd6cf1dd5783920facdef8c8c3cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Graph of temperature versus angle of inclination of the wings relative to the vertical axis with an exposure of 10 and 35 seconds <br>  It can be seen that, at an angle of inclination of 17 ¬∞, the temperature of the butterfly's chest increased by 7.3 ¬∞ C more than when the wings were opened at an unfolded angle for the same duration of the experiment. <br><br>  Experimentally confirming the above assumptions, the scientists were able not only to prove the highest efficiency of the natural mechanism for the accumulation of useful energy, but also theoretically to substantiate the possibility of creating concentrators for solar cells capable of reflecting the maximum amount of luminous energy on photovoltaics.  This, in turn, makes it possible to convert and give to the consumer 42.3% - 50% more energy than in existing solar batteries analogues.  At the same time, the weight of the useful design of the bulky concentrator is reduced by 17 times, which greatly expands the possibilities of using a solar panel!  Thus, the principle of collecting useful energy laid down in the wings of the ‚ÄúGreat White‚Äù by nature itself laid the foundation for the new technology. <br><br>  The results of the experiments also confirmed that a single layer of cells with truly unique reflectivity has the potential to perform its function. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Alternative to existing hubs</font> </h2><br>  Despite the obvious advantages and benefits, the existing hubs of lenses and mirrors, exciting the light flux and redirecting it to the surface of photovoltaic plates continue to be cumbersome, heavyweight structures, which significantly limits their use.  A lightweight version of the design of the hub of plastic mirrors with reflective film when applied to a complex surface often loses its reflectivity.  Specific requirements for the form of the design imposes a hub made of polymer.  As an alternative to existing solutions with the listed limitations, a group of scientists from Exeter proposed a lightweight version of a concentrator with a cellular coating similar in structure to the natural reflective layer of the Belyanki wing. <br><br>  The maximum reflectivity is created not only due to the optimum angle of inclination of the wings, but also due to the nano-balls - so-called.  ‚ÄúPterinovyh beads‚Äù, distributed over the structure of the wing in a strictly certain way.  When they are extracted, the reflection index decreases by 1/3. <br><br><img src="http://www.nature.com/article-assets/npg/srep/2015/150731/srep12267/images_hires/m685/srep12267-f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The big white butterfly, like the prototype of the perfect solar hub</i> <br><br>  An infrared camera was used in the experiment.  At an angle of inclination of 17 ¬∞, the temperature of the butterfly's chest increased by 7.3 ¬∞ C more than when the wings were opened at an angle of 90 ¬∞ to the vertical for the same duration of the experiment. <br><br>  In order to determine which butterfly wings could be suitable as a possible prototype film for a hub, French-Constant suggested selecting three butterflies from the Pieridae family.  The maximum reflection coefficient was recorded for the front wings of the Great White Butterfly.  At the same time, the characteristics of the reflected light are optimally combined with the features of the crystal lattice of silicon (over the entire range of 400‚Äì950 nm, a reflectance of more than 78.9% is achieved). <br><br>  In another experiment, the wings of the Big White Butterfly were fixed above a fragment of monocrystalline silicon measuring 1 cm x 1 cm.  Measurements showed that the power output increased by 42.3% from 16.8 to 23.9 mW.  In this case, the weight of the standard reflective film, in comparison with the wings of the Big White, turned out to be in the ratio of 17: 1. <br><br><img src="http://www.nature.com/article-assets/npg/srep/2015/150731/srep12267/images_hires/m685/srep12267-f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Voltage change (in mv) and power / weight after ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù to the Big White butterfly wings scheme</i> <br><br>  Mallik and the group are confident: the achieved level of understanding of the principles laid down in the basis of the considered natural phenomenon will allow creating a light film ‚Äî an artificial analogue of the Big White wing with even more impressive reflective characteristics. <br><br>  We wish them success and we hope that already in the near future the available solar electricity in our homes will be enough not only to <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/xtorm_yu_solar_charger_am115_universalnoe_zaryadnoe_ustroystvo_s_solnechnoy_panelyu_gray/">charge the gadget</a> , but also to ensure the viability of the entire home infrastructure, and possibly share with a neighbor.) <br><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !
