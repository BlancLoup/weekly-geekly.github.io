If you look closely, there is a lot of useful information on it, but there is absolutely no spirit of friendliness and at least some minimal aesthetics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a24/e46/71e/a24e4671ebe047249e329e51f21550e3.jpg"><br><br>  In this case, the check takes with each of our customers, and it is simply silly not to use.  As well as it is worth adding a piece of paper a bit of utility. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
    <h4>  Meta </h4><br>  At the top of the check to the word "Sale" there is metadata that is required.  Legal entity, data on the device, date and time, who broke through and so on.  Excess there, of course, ‚ÄúWelcome!‚Äù Is an example of a text that is once scored in the CMC, and is always printed there.  Cut out. <br><br>  Metadata has a problem.  If you have ever looked for a check in the pile, because you need it, then you knew that finding a company on a legal entity is not a trivial task.  That is, finding a check at home is a difficult task of recognizing not the check itself, but the specific purchase in it.  And matching with the store. <br><br>  Just see how this part is incredibly cool implemented by Tiffany in the USA: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49d/d30/d33/49dd30d330f34d278e65d25d9084ad55.jpeg"><br><br>  Technically, we can do this too.  Another thing is that we rest against the features of the firmware of a number of devices used in the network: we want to make the check more beautiful, and not at the same time devise total refactoring associated with costs.  Therefore, it turns out that all the iron supports printing on top of the picture.  That is, the cap will remain strangely composed, but the main problem - recognition - we will solve. <br><br>  Yes, when saving data in the header, you can write anything there before them - no need to think that the area is fixed. <br><br><h4>  Sale </h4><br>  Further in the check there is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe specific transaction.  This is a list of positions with names, their number in the check, the amount and discount.  She that at us that in Africa looks approximately equally ugly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8af/c00/65e/8afc0065eed948b9821d2a2a47a5b427.jpg"><br><br>  The main problem is hyphenation and extra decimal places after the point.  Here we asked the lawyer whether it is necessary to write 2.000 pieces and 150.00 rubles.  It turned out that it is not even necessary.  But it turned out that the firmware of our oldest devices on the network is such that we cannot change it, even if we really want to.  Alas, it is impossible to climb into this part. <br><br>  Next fiscal mark, everything in it is visually normal. <br><br><h4>  More meta </h4><br>  You can also write different things from the bottom of the check.  After the fiscal mark, the contents of the check are also not regulated, and anything can be entered there.  Only the text will turn off in the center.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/df4/d8d/d21df4d8d43b4b329398d851c704939a.jpeg"><br><br>  Or here is a much more utilitarian application - the recharge card in Norway on the check: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e20/ee1/18a/e20ee118a04b4c2d99577deccb841cde.jpg"><br><br><h4>  More features </h4><br>  Here are adult boys allocate the total amount of discounts for the buyer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/110/1d7/913/1101d79132704be892e97586dcecef99.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Nice to know how much you saved, agree</sup> <br><br>  This is where the guys print the return terms and the barcode to immediately navigate through it and make a return in a matter of seconds (without looking for the order by hand): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b8/55b/423/9b855b42334044899826f041eb247eda.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is a whole lottery ticket on the check: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb5/4eb/b0f/eb54ebb0f3b34ebbb183a454b49c3f9f.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>In the end, we thought that the check wanted:</b> <br><ul><li>  Provide recognizability and simplify search in a heap - logo on top. </li><li>  To improve what is possible in the technical part (but we are limited by the firmware) </li><li>  Leave on the check the phone of the shop, the phone of the main one in the region. </li><li>  Add a bit of advertising, still almost like a flyer. </li><li>  The check is most often needed when returning.  It is logical to write the return policy directly on it to simplify.  Less misunderstanding. </li><li>  In addition, our customers often ask us about when the next discount threshold will be on their savings card.  Since we do not send SMS to our customers, it is logical to print the data on the check. </li><li>  Another moment came to light here - the check can be an anonymous discount card for those who do not want to leave their details.  Directly on it you can give a discount on the next purchase in this situation. </li></ul><br>  Here is a prototype at an early stage (colors, of course, should not be): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cf/9a3/3f8/0cf9a33f8d254ca49bade5f16009a9ef.png"><br><br>  And here is the result, adapted for the oldest firmware.  He is a bit vyrviglazen, but already much better than option number 1.  "Welcome" just did not go anywhere, but I believe we will win it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0c/c76/6af/a0cc766af2454c57bc7a391b2d4fb009.jpg"><br>  <sup>There is also added a fiscal mark, it is not on the test</sup> <br><br>  Theoretically, you can print everything between the logo and the transaction, below the total.  But after the tests, it turns out that it threatens to dance with a tambourine, so in this version we raise everything up.  We run on one store, we test the week, we detect bugs.  The main point is that all the firmware should be given text in letters, not a picture: this greatly speeds up the printing of a check.  Now the updated version is tested in 5 different stores on different devices. <br><br>  The result - on the check appeared useful information that really helps the buyer.  Plus, he himself became at least a little, but better. <br><br>  Another key point is that the check has become dynamic.  It shows the current status of the discount and answers the basic questions of the buyer at the time of sale. <br><br><h4>  What else can be done if the firmware does not allow? </h4><br>  On the way to the adaptation to the simplest devices, we considered two more options of information with a check.  Perhaps they will be useful to you: <br><ol><li>  You can print on the cash tape from the back.  So do some supermarkets.  There is simply a picture that is regularly repeated.  You can enter the terms of return, regional senior and other static information.  With dynamics, alas, a bummer.  But it is cheap and angry. </li><li>  Dear shops put a check in a book, which can be quite a lot of advertising.  The operation is done by hand, books update easier and easier than the tape.  If you bought a children's product - you can attach a check with a stapler to the ‚Äúcrust‚Äù with recommendations for children's products, if an adult is with adults and so on. </li></ol><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  A check may contain useful information.  On the check, you can draw pictures.  The check can be interactive: change from any status in the database from discount level to personal recommendations.  On the check, you can make a mini-FAQ of what is important to your customers.  And a check is advertising material that people throw away less frequently than others.  All this can be used. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232189/</a></p>
