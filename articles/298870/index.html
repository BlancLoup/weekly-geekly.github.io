  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dmitry Medvedev signed two resolutions on subsidies and reimbursement of costs to Russian manufacturers of IT equipment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The state will provide subsidies to Russian electronics manufacturers.  It proposes to reimburse them interest on loans received in Russian banks for projects to create a technological and production base, or pay annually compensation. <br><br>  However, the state needs guarantees from manufacturers for this - serial production and distribution of electronics throughout the country. <br><br>  The relevant resolutions on compensation and subsidies have already been signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. <br>  The decrees concern enterprises working in the field of radio electronics, telecom equipment, computer technology.  The compensation is determined at the rate of 0.7 of the size of the organization‚Äôs costs for paying interest on loans or 0.7 of the size of the key interest rate of the Central Bank if the interest rate on the loan is equal to or greater than the key.

      The second decree establishes the procedure for payment of compensation (200-400 million rubles per year for one company) for "creating a scientific and technical reserve for the development of basic technologies for the production of priority electronic components and electronic equipment". <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Subsidies will be allocated at competitions held by the Ministry of Industry and Trade twice a year for projects with a implementation period of not more than five years.  The total cost of the project applying for state support should be no more than 1-2.5 billion rubles, depending on the type of project, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2922788">reports</a> with reference to the resolutions. <br><br>  Subsidies for manufacturers of IT equipment have already been provided for by the state program ‚ÄúDevelopment of the electronic and electronic industry for 2013-2015‚Äù.  According to the <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects">version of</a> 2016, the amount of budget funds for the implementation of this program is 14.1 billion rubles in 2016 and 13 billion rubles in 2017.  By 2025, the state plans to increase the share of Russian electronic products on the domestic market to 60%. <br><br>  Not all experts believe that the industry will be able to reach the stated level.  Even if manufacturers manage to produce electronics in the required volumes, the underdeveloped sales market in Russia will make it difficult to distribute products throughout the country.  In January, the Ministry of Industry and Trade set a task for Russian manufacturers to occupy 60% of the domestic market until 2025, but now it‚Äôs only 35%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa project approach to allocating subsidies seems to be theoretically correct, in our country commercialization of development has always been a weak point.  On the other hand, in order for the project approach to work, it is necessary to have a powerful mechanism to support Russian manufacturers in shaping the market for them, ‚ÄùSvetlana Appolonova, chairman of the board of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Association</a> of Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers, told Kommersant. <br><br>  In her opinion, the proposed project approach with the subsidy mechanism could work for large corporations.  ‚ÄúFor small and medium-sized businesses, such an approach, taking into account penalties for non-compliance with the implementation plan and the lack of a support mechanism, is too risky, and cooperation between large businesses and small ones leaves much to be desired,‚Äù the expert notes. <br><br>  A representative <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%2598%25D0%259C%25D0%25AD_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">of NIIME and Micron,</a> Alexei Dianov, doubts that Micron will be able to take advantage of the subsidies: ‚ÄúMicroelectronics is now considered the most expensive branch in terms of creating infrastructure.  So, our project with Rosnano to create microchip production using 90 nm technology cost more than 16 billion rubles, and the maximum loan amount for which it is proposed to receive subsidies according to the issued resolution is only 2.5 billion rubles. ‚Äù <br><br>  Now high interest rates - from 15 to 20% per annum and compensation for them is very necessary, agrees with him the deputy director of the company <a href="http://www.t-platforms.ru/">"T-platforms"</a> (owns 75% of the developer of microprocessors "Baikal Electronics") Elena Churakova.  According to her, subsidies for research and development are necessary, because without them, enterprises are not able to quickly launch a large number of products on the market. <br><br>  "T-platforms" plan to participate in competitions of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in personal and server computing technology.  In addition, the Moscow Center for SPARC Technologies (MCST), the Elbrus microprocessor developer, has such plans, the assistant to its general director for marketing Konstantin Trushkin <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/11/23/617874-otechestvennuyu-radioelektroniku-prostimuliruyut-nizkim-protsentom">told</a> Vedomosti. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298870/</a></p>
