I immediately write it down and then often leaf through old notebooks to find fresh ideas or make sure that I did not miss anything.  I would advise all young people entering life to have a notebook with them.  This is a good habit, and you should be addicted to it. <br><br>  <i>Richard Branson, Virgin Creator, Billionaire</i> </blockquote><br>  I carry a simple notebook with me everywhere.  I write everything down there: ideas, thoughts, money expenses, my actions during the day (timekeeping).  I do not use either electronic gadgets or a mobile phone, although there are such opportunities. <br><br><img src="http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/984/fulldbdd72c4da7f7a97a74.png">

      And now 2 years, as they are with me, these simple notebooks.  And only recently wondered: and, strictly speaking, why do they need me?  And it turned out that there are a number of important points provided by paper notebooks that make life much better and more productive.  Having highlighted these moments for myself, I want to share them, perhaps it will be useful to someone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Benefits of using </h3><br><ul><li>  Availability; </li><li>  Reliability; </li><li>  Convenience. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  disadvantages </h3><br><ul><li>  The difficulty of making changes; </li><li>  High cost per unit of information; </li><li>  Slow search in the archive. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  How do notebooks help me? </h3><br><ul><li>  <strong>Cache for the brain.</strong>  As you know, no more than 7 + -2 objects can be held simultaneously in consciousness.  Personally, I start having problems with four simultaneous entities.  Writing on paper, visualization, fixing data helps to abstract from the details and see the whole picture;  or, on the contrary, by fixing the overall picture on paper, you can work well with the details.  It helps in everything - from scheduling tasks for a month to developing the architecture of a large application. </li><li>  <strong>Time management.</strong>  I write a plan for the day in a notebook (page in half, on the left, on the right, on the right, timekeeping).  The plan for the month is stored in a notebook, and so on.  And then, there is an opinion that when you write on paper with a hand, you have a good influence on the subconscious. </li><li>  <strong>Record income / expenses.</strong>  On the day - the arrival, plan, expense. </li><li>  <strong>Record thoughts.</strong>  It is very useful when the thought, as they say, turns on the language, take it and write it on paper, turn it like this, and formulate it completely. </li><li>  <strong>Record ideas.</strong>  How many ideas I missed, because I was distracted for a second - and I forgot.  Now, having grasped the idea by the tail, I hold it, take out a notebook, write it down - and everything is ready. </li><li>  <strong>Record conversations.</strong>  During the negotiations I keep a summary of the conversation.  It helps a lot to outline a plan of action, remembering the main points without much difficulty. </li><li>  <strong>Worker Records.</strong>  You communicate with someone, and suddenly you have it, or a person, the need to draw / write - you take out a notebook, which is right there, and everything - mutual understanding is found. </li><li>  <strong>Album for drawing.</strong>  Sometimes it's interesting to draw something beautiful, it's very convenient to do on paper. </li><li>  <strong>Address Book.</strong>  Write down the phone that you dictate on the other side of the tube, much faster on paper (faster only the voice recorder).  And not: Contacts -&gt; New -&gt; Add -&gt; Phone -&gt; Mobile -&gt; (number input), like, for example, I had on Nokia.  Then in quiet mode, the number is entered by me in the phone's notebook. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  The use of paper notebooks is a rather controversial idea, in this age of high technology.  However, having started using paper notebooks, I was not used to either the iPhone, or the Nokia organizer, or to various online notebooks.  Something traditional and reliable is in a small notebook, which is always at hand, and at home, and at work, and on the road. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89572/</a></p>
