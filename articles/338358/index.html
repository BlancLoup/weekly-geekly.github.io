We know that it is not easy, but our article is a direct light of hope for mutual understanding and forgiveness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/51d/e66/582/51de665823f04d8fa25173ec9dc0a410.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today we are waiting for a difficult conversation about how a recruiter to become his friend among strangers, where to get knowledge, how not to fail an interview.  And ... how not to be bothersome. <br><br>  We know that this material will be read not only by HR'y and recruiters who want to pump their skills and knowledge in IT, but also by the developers themselves and just the guys who are fumbling well in technology.  Do not swear and help those who come for help.  Well, or just <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/potok">come to us to work</a> and we will make a cool and smart product for the selection.

People laugh merrily at them in chat rooms and channels.  They are reluctant to respond by sending letters to the basket.  In short, cause quite a lot of pain. <br><br><h3>  Is there a reason for this? </h3><br>  <i>Definitely.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b2/8f9/8b1/3b28f98b1a714f83ab5198e992eb01fe.png"><br><br><h4>  Reason # 1 = Lack of knowledge </h4><br>  We don‚Äôt want to blame colleagues who are horrified to break into Java chats of developers and are looking for those who are willing to work with SQL (URGENTLY !!!) or those who believe that Java and JavaScript are one and the same. <br><br>  <b>Tru story from Ani Atroshkina from INDEX, which the developer told her 1C:</b> <br><br>  A vacancy comes to him C, he is surprised and sends it to the basket. <br>  The recruiter calls back and clarifies whether it turned out to consider the vacancy. <br>  - To which the surprised programmer answers that he is not a C developer, but 1C. <br>  - So what? <br>  - Well, at least what C writes in English, and 1C in Russian. <br>  - And we have English courses. <br><br>  <i>Don't be like this recruiter.</i>  Before you throw a vacancy, check whether you understand what it is about.  Lack of knowledge - just the pit that we ourselves are digging.  And to start it gradually fall asleep back, you need to learn.  Here is an action plan that can help you open the era of IT education: <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to smart blogs</b> <br>  Here is a selection of blogs and books directly about IT and about IT-recruitment, explaining the basic concepts and saving face from falling into the dirt: <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/FDHn8q">Blog Stackoverflow:</a> probably the most intelligent blog about how to communicate and not mess with terms and approaches. <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr:</a> because if you have a question, there‚Äôs definitely an answer to it <br>  <a href="https://devskiller.wpengine.com/blog/">Blog Devskiller</a> : great blog about search, we read it all the time <br>  <a href="http://readly.ru/author/22005/">Joel Spolsky</a> 's <a href="http://readly.ru/author/22005/">books</a> on programming and selecting developers <br>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/138437220/">The book ‚ÄúPerfect code.</a>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/138437220/">Master Class by Steve McConnell:</a> because even if it seems that it is outdated, it is still more useful than a heap of other benefits <br>  <a href="https://amazinghiring.com/blog/">Amazing Hiring blog:</a> guys know what they are doing <br><br>  + <br>  <a href="https://devskiller.com/31-must-follow-blogs-for-tech-recruiters-in-2016/">And another 31 blogs for tech recruiters (grab and run)</a> <br><br>  <b>Tackle a good developer who does not hurt</b> <br>  This is an option for those who want to have basic concepts laid out for him.  In short, we invite an IT-coach to the studio!  : D If you are HR in the company, call your IT team for coffee and ask to answer the questions that you have. <br><br>  <b>Attend recruitment events</b> <br>  Those who have learned the basics of communication with IT-specialists, organize meetings, conferences, sell courses.  Not all of them are equally useful and worth it.  Collect reviews, look for them, do not hesitate to bother with questions about speakers, information, logistics, which will be at the event. <br><br>  <b>Attend events about IT</b> <br>  Industry events are also for you.  We categorically do not share the position of the IT community "to recruiters here is not the place."  Both sides win: experts pump their skills and ... other experts also pump skills and get to know the audience better.  Usually such meetings are free and can, of course, be classified (OH GOD WHY).  And for this you need to be constantly aware of what is happening in the market and in the community of developers with whom you work. <br><br>  <b>Find the very sources</b> <br>  It‚Äôs not a sin to hunt developers on Stackoverflow.  You just need to do it wisely.  And first there must be a mind, and then a hunting.  So without knowledge, you can really really mess there and lose and so shaky confidence in yourself. <br><br>  <b>View these jobs</b> <br>  Did you see that someone in a chat dropped a similar job?  Well, let's run to read, what will the developers answer to this, what additional questions will they ask?  There is no ideal job submission format, but you can search for it.  Ideally, if after you find the optimal format for a job story, you will go to a developer who does not hurt and show him what you wrote. <br><br>  <b>Understand the internal processes of the company (‚ÄúI knew, but forgot‚Äù)</b> <br>  Project architecture?  Bug tracker?  Where are the developers?  Is it an open-air project? <br><br>  Understand what your company does and how processes are organized.  Otherwise, you will end up in an endless series of awkward situations at the interviews.  Get acquainted with the tools that your it-team uses, find out where the data is stored, who is responsible for what tasks and how it spreads around, what they plan for, why exactly this technology stack. <br><br>  The bottom line is that the interview is a dialogue.  And everyone should get what they came for.  You are furious when candidates are not ready for interviews, and candidates are perplexed when they can no longer answer the simplest questions at one of the first selection stages. <br><br>  <b>Remember domestic issues</b> <br>  There are candidates who love themselves and all the questions about VHI, food, recreation area and the gym will be asked.  And there are those who just do not think about it.  And your job, including reporting whether you have parking, a coffee machine, an office sleeping room, vacations, bonuses, a schedule that will suit everyone.  You can write a straightforward FAQ and always refer to it, or just throw a link to candidates. <br><br><h4>  Reason # 2 = Misunderstanding who is who </h4><br>  Understanding the roles of development is as important as understanding technologies.  And here we recently stumbled upon a fairly clear description, see: <br><br>  ‚ÄúJunior - does what they say, re-checks everything after him <br>  Middle - he already understands what he is doing and offers his options <br>  Senior - offers what to do, he makes and cleans the ends for the first two <br>  CTO - controls all processes and swears ‚Äù <br><br>  In each company, everyone has their own tasks and this is how an understanding of the employee‚Äôs specific tasks can become just a gold mine.  Require a detailed description of the vacancy at the customer - with specific data you have more chances for quick closure. <br><br><h4>  Reason number 3 = Inattention </h4><br>  <b>Do you have enough time and a lot of vacancies?</b>  <b>Of course, the best way to start writing everyone!</b> <br>  Bad joke, but about real cases. <br><br>  Inattentive attitude to the candidate‚Äôs resume does not lead to the offer, but to where you regret the time spent, and the developer tends stories about a recruiter from the company ‚ÄúN‚Äù (and you can understand it). <br><br>  Found suitable candidates - not screening for 6 seconds, at 6 minutes, specifying if he exactly fits on the stack of technology you need, what is the probability that he will want to change the location, what he most likely was doing at the last job (how much and whether I could grow) - collect references. <br><br>  The same social networks will help to get more information from the resume, and another call to the former employer.  Attention to detail will greatly reduce the time for screening and save the reputation and time of the person to whom you came with an irrelevant proposal. <br><br><h4>  Reason # 4 = Lack of personal approach </h4><br>  This reason from the second is very similar.  And it‚Äôs just about the fact that you need to learn how to establish a connection between a person and a person, and not, please, come-work is a god (and we understand who is who in this case). <br><br>  <b>There are some simple rules that generally should work not only in IT-recruitment.</b> <br><br>  - The rule ‚Äúpersonal letters - clear conscience‚Äù: <br>  The subject of the letter should not be defiant or irrelevant - we know, sometimes in the search you can lose the line between reasonable and not so.  Contact applicants by name, use the details of the resume in the letter, try to prioritize and feel in the shoes of the person to whom you are writing.  Then he will not close it instantly. <br><br>  - It just so happens that you are not choosing a communication channel, and the candidate is normal to meet.  And if he wrote that it is convenient for him to communicate in Viber - so be it. <br><br>  - Communicate simply and without tediousness.  This does not contradict the fact that writing using class terminology is correct.  But from ‚Äúfor the purpose of testing as part of the selection process for the vacancy, BLABAOLAABA‚Äù - we will leave it for those candidates who are close to this.  It is unlikely that it-specialists - this is the audience. <br><br>  - Recruiting ethics says: ‚Äúdo not call him if you see that he is busy at his current job or that he is at work in his present, because there is no need to put the potential applicant in an awkward position‚Äù. <br><br>  - Always throw a card and instructions on how to find your office in an invitation letter for an interview.  This is a simple rule of friendly communication. <br><br>  - Late - candidate lost (and himself to blame). <br><br>  - The search radar for the specialists works for you, but the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù radar for everyone is completely broken.  Tell the candidates why refuse and always track the reasons for their refusals.  You will understand that in the selection process you are doing wrong.  Maybe not there looking for, for example. <br><br><h3>  What to do so that all live happily ever after </h3><br>  <i>Start with yourself and review the selection process.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/df7/02b/305/df702b305a6f4a5992c2962f7a958790.png"><br><br>  <b>* And also come to the <a href="http://www.index-tech.ru/">INDEX TECH</a> conference, where developers will be in the right-hand corner of the market, and IT recruiters will be in the left-hand corner.</b>  <b>No fight, just an attempt to figure out how to assemble a technical team without suffering and how to find a common language.</b>  <b>Let's listen to what both sides think *</b> <br><br>  1. Create a mind-map with terms that will be used in the selection (for this you can read all the vacancies in it, which you will find laid out in channels / chats) <br><br>  2. Talk to someone today who is good at the topic.  Stop being afraid to ask stupid questions.  It's bad not to know, but even worse - not to admit it.  And if it seems that today nobody is demanding this from you and you can handle it and so, you know, it will be painful when the ideal candidate refuses to see you as incompetent as a company representative. <br><br>  3. Subscribe to newsletters that may be useful to you.  There is no other area in which knowledge is so rapidly becoming obsolete, so that one-time training will not help here. <br><br>  If the time to look for useful life hacking is categorically not enough, let the information fall directly into the mailbox.  Mailing summaries of candidates, mailing articles about new technologies, channels in Telegram, in which developers share pain (this is a sacred source of data for you), groups on FB, conversations on forums and in open chat rooms in Slack. <br><br>  4. Collect literate Boolean search and X-ray after you deal with the job.  For each job directly pick up every time, add, if you see that some parts of the request are outdated.  If you suddenly decided to look not only in Moscow, but throughout the country, for example. <br><br>  5. Test pads.  Skype can be for php, Telegram for ios'nikov, and Moscow for expensive developers, shhhhh.  Try Instagram, try Odnoklassniki!  Directly analyze new tools and sources, refusing for a week from something - ‚Äúeverything, a week no gihaba!‚Äù.  Hold on?  How many of the funnel candidates will they fail?  How many do not fall off along the way?  Without analytics, you‚Äôll poke your finger at the sky all the time, and the good guys who create CRMs for recruitment do not suffer for you to read the analyst in a notebook. <br><br>  6. Do not violate ethics and personal space.  Joking about a closed sysadmin is not fashionable for 10 years already, but in every joke there is some truth.  There are a lot of introverts and people who do not like it when you break their personal space.  And they always have a lot of offers and you are not the only recruiter who has found a candidate.  Personal is personal.  And although social networks erase boundaries, the sediment remains.  Look at what time they most often respond when answering letters - this time (+ - at the hospital) will be a good interval for making contact. <br><br>  7. Remember that even if you were able to tell everything correctly, answered questions, were not confused in languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies, these guys know their work better than you.  You cannot test them 100%, so always contact your corporate technical defense and ask them to further evaluate the candidate. <br><br>  <b>Pos.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338358/</a></p>
