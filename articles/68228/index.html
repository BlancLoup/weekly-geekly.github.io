But more recently another category of users has begun to grow, which until recently was not given much attention - these are enthusiasts and overclockers.  It is pleasant to note that now the situation has changed for the better, and products for gaming enthusiasts now produce not only specialized shops, but also large companies like <b>ASUS</b> . <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/aresthumbv.jpg"><br><br>  Traffic !!! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Article written for the site <b><a href="http://www.trendclub.ru/">TrendClub.ru</a></b>

    <img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6454.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While the impressive building of the Ares gaming station was in our office for testing, our guests were visited by two beautiful young ladies from the female e-sports team <b>ForZe</b> , <b>Pachella</b> and <b>Svetaska</b> .  It is clear that the girls, like other professional cybersportsmen, have quite specific gaming hardware requirements, but the young ladies easily set up <b>Counter Strike</b> and conducted test battles, noting the convenience of a special mouse and rug supplied in the <b>ASUS Ares</b> kit.  The following is a detailed review of this gaming station, but it is already clear that it has received the approval of professionals - and this is very valuable. <br><br>  <b>Ares</b> is a product of the <b>ASUS RoG</b> series, intended primarily for experienced players, but at the same time offering a lot of space for fantasy enthusiasts.  So, welcome - <b>ASUS Ares</b> ! <br><br>  Due to the huge amount of material that I would like to talk about, we have divided the article into two parts.  In the first we talk about the appearance and other features, and in the second we play <b>Crysis</b> . <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6473aaa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>RoG</b> stands for ‚Äú <b>Republic of Gamers</b> ‚Äù, which means ‚Äú <b>Republic of players</b> ‚Äù in Russian.  Under this sound label, Asus promotes all kinds of gaming components and devices that differ from the usual high-performance, gaming "sharpening" and good overclocking potential. <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  The box is just huge, but this is not surprising, because inside are: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6679.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Game computer <b>Asus Ares CG6155</b> ; <br>  - <b>Asus</b> gaming keyboard ( <b>BTC</b> ) <b>Cheetah</b> ; <br>  - Laser gaming mouse <b>Asus</b> ( <b>Logitech</b> ) <b>G9</b> - review already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67048/">done</a> ; <br>  * A set of weights for the mouse; <br>  * Removable panel for the mouse; <br>  - Gaming mouse pad; <br>  - Headphones <b>Asus</b> ( <b>SteelSeries</b> ) <b>Siberia</b> ; <br>  * Clip on the wire with a microphone; <br>  * Wire extension with volume control; <br>  * Adapter Jack 3.5 Stereo&gt; Jack 6.3 Stereo <br>  - Wires and adapters: <br>  - Two network wires <br>  - Adapter S-Video&gt; Compontent; <br>  - Adapter DVI&gt; HDMI; <br>  - Adapter VGA&gt; DVI; <br>  - Box with discs and instruction manual. <br><br>  The box with the discs and the manual has been made quite original, but those who have ever bought any anthologies from several discs will hardly be surprised.  Imagine: a black and red box the size of a VHS cassette, but a little longer.  The cover is removed - only the expandable box remains.  It unfolds three times and, with complete decomposition, offers: 8 disks distributed over the entire surface and hidden in the ‚Äúpocket‚Äù manual on the computer.  Disks - 6 black CD-R (52x!) Discs with ASUS and RoG logos;  one Support CD, one Recovery DVD (Windows Vista Home Premium SP1);  game Alone in the dark. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6756.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The manual itself - a book of 170+ pages, where in four languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, Russian, Polish and Dutch) you can learn a lot of interesting things.  All this is supported by color pictures, which is rare nowadays. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6764.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  I'll start not so much with the appearance, as with the weight of the device.  Ares decently weighs about 45 kg!  Just pulling a computer out of the box can bring a lot of impressions - in my opinion, the system unit is simply doomed to stationarity.  Therefore, as soon as I put the computer on the table, I decided not to do powerlifting anymore and left everything as it was. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6399.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The body is truly a monster, gorgeous-unique.  It consists of removable plastic parts that have clearly defined lines and carbon texture.  Perhaps, by the way, this is carbon fiber, but none of us has yet decided to say for sure.  In any case, it is lightweight and very durable plastic, the only thing is that it is somewhat soiled, but this is not so critical in this case. <br>  The appearance is very aggressive, which is facilitated by the red-black coloring (gray-black color of the body and red light) - as a result, something turns out to be common between ancient armor and modern combat vehicles.  Fearfully?  Still would! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/animation550.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front side of the gaming station below is a special protective mask of "carbon" and plastic under metallic. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6487.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the details of the mask is a fingerprint scanner and a glowing red ornament around.  Slightly above, in the form of a glowing hexagon, is the touch button on the computer.  Elements begin to glow immediately after the discovery of power in the network. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6469.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even higher ‚Äî a folding carbon helmet with a glowing RoG shield logo, behind which is a BluRay drive, a device for reading flash cards (miniSD / SD / SDHS / MS / MS Duo / CF / MD / MMC) and a pair of ports - 2xUSB (2.0), one FireWire and two connectors for headphones and microphone.  There are a couple of free 5.25 "compartments, but behind them lies a reservoir for a liquid cooling system.  The protective panel opens very smoothly, closes the same way, snapping on the magnetic lock.  Under the plastic hides a metal structure, claims to which I did not have. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6492.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the sides are carbon triangles with slots and plastic inserts.  Behind them are the luminous modules that provide a smooth frosted glow - they begin to glow immediately after switching on. <br>  Behind all this are parallel metal rails placed on top of the ventilation grid.  These slats converge in the back, forming a single skeleton, which gives the body impressiveness.  An analogy to kendo Japanese martial art can be cited, whose mask of fighters inspired Ares designers to create such grace. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6499.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at Ares from the back side, then you can see quite a lot of different connectors behind the skeleton, but you can get full access to them only after disconnecting the grille.  This is done simply - snapping off two locks. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6517.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the connectors on the rear panel: for connecting the keyboard (PS / 2), 6xUSB 2.0, 2 gigabit RJ-45, 2xSATA, coaxial and optical S / PDIF and 1xFireWire.  It is impossible not to mention the CMOS reset button outside - in case the computer freezes due to overclocking. <br>  Another of the functional elements - standard sound card jacks;  on video cards - 4xDVI, 2xS-Video;  on the switch on the power supply. <br><br><h3>  Inside </h3><br>  It would seem that the construction is monolithic and non-separable, which means that it does not have any potential for upgrade.  But this impression is deceptive.  The case is quite scalable, understands a couple of "clicks", and, well, without a screwdriver! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_65461.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First you need to unfasten the grille on the back.  Next you need to pull the lock on the right wall, after which it is easily removed, providing full access to the insides.  They can still hinder, perhaps, the side panel with the fan installed, but it can also be dismantled without problems.  Everything! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6555.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I would like to dwell in more detail on the elements of the case. <br>  On the inside of the door, which is a large matt metal sheet, there are 4 contacts, which, when interacting with the contact area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe case, provide the side wall luminescence. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6532.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6540.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accordingly, you can remove the side wall without any special experiences. <br>  This metal sheet is held on a dozen of screws - everything is carefully adjusted, without any discrepancies, backlashes, etc.!  Also, not least, metal parts do not have burrs, chipping and other irregularities that many manufacturers are used to sinning with. <br>  A standard Molex fits to the contact area inside the side wall, which feeds the entire lighting system.  Unscrewing the screws, the platform behind which the Molex is mounted, you can pull out the contact pad itself.  After that, the metal sheet can be completely removed and we immediately get access to the insides of the side cover. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6535.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, inside was quite an interesting design!  I thought that a smooth frosted glow on the side walls of the case is achieved using two long neon lamps, the scattered light from which goes beyond the opaque part of the outer "carbon" - this solution would be the easiest to implement.  But more complicated and more elegant: hundreds of diodes are located on textolite strips, firmly fixed on the body parts.  The light from the diodes falls on a matte thick film that does its dissipative business.  Modders, shake a mustache! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6548.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_6538.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fingerprint scanner works well - it recognizes a finger even with a fairly fast movement.  With it, you can log in to the operating system, encrypt data, and so on. <br><br>  Judging by the fact that absolutely everything works and is calculated to the millimeter, you can make an intermediate conclusion - ASUS really got serious about the matter.  By the way, as a person who was fond of modding at one time, I want to note - in this particular case, everything is done more than carefully, difficultly, but at the same time it looks very beautiful.  Serial rarity - praise and respect for the designers of Ares! <br><br>  Further - the second part of the review, in which we will talk about system performance. <br><br><h3>  History reference </h3><br>  <b>Ares</b> - in ancient Greek mythology - the god of war. <br><br>  One name of Ares caused horror among the Greeks, although in the guise of a god who bore him, there was nothing disgusting about him.  It was disgusting that Ares hated Eirena, the goddess of the world, and was inseparable from Eris, the malicious goddess of contention, in a rage rejecting that other Eridu honored by people who made them compete not in battles, but in peaceful labor.  Gods and men despised this cruel and fierce god of battle.  And he was so different from other celestials, wise and prudent, that his origin was controversial, and Thrace, a country with a harsh climate and no less harsh people, was considered the birthplace. <br><br>  The gods liked to look, watching the battles of mortals.  Sometimes they came down to the ground to help their pets.  For Ares, war was the raison d'etre, and he never thought about whether it was fair or not.  Distraught at the sight of blood, Ares killed indiscriminately, right and wrong.  The constant companion of the god of war was the goddess Enio, bringing turmoil on the battlefield. <br><br>  Sometimes Ares, mingling on the battlefield with the combatants, uttered a howl-like cry that escaped from the chest of ten thousand husbands.  Hearing this, the warriors came to a frenzy and killed everyone who came their way: old men, women, children.  They even forgot that the life of enemies, their wives and children has a price, that they can be sold into slavery or made their slaves.  I came across a warhorse or a pet - a donkey or a dog, and they were not given mercy.  Hearing the cry of Ares, the fighting ceased to be warriors, becoming killers. <br><br>  It is not surprising that mortals considered Ares to be the culprit of all his troubles, and the thought occurred to them that they could not get rid of them until Ares was pacified.  But how to cope with the powerful and besides still invisible god?  People could not do it, and they turned to the two giants.  They are not easily grabbed Ares, tied him up and threw him into prison.  Ares was in captivity for thirteen months, and this number turned out to be the happiest, because during these months people have comprehended in their peaceful labors more than seven of the happiest years.  The woman, again not the gods-fashioned doll, but the stepmother of the giants, was the cause of the new misfortunes of the people.  She gave the place of imprisonment of Ares, and Hermes rescued the god of war. <br><br>  On Olympus, Ares became a secret rival of the industrious Hephaestus, the beloved of his legitimate wife Aphrodite.  The madness of war combined with the madness of love, and nothing good could be expected from it.  Deimos (Horror) and Phobos (Fear), eternal companions of wars, were born.  By the creatures of Ares attributed one of the eriny, the goddesses of bloody revenge, and the dragon, with whom the Theban hero Cadmus fought.  From communication with mortal women, Ares was born heroes, in the character of which the features of savagery and unbridled father manifested themselves. <br><br>  Ares Athena, the goddess of a fair and just war, hated most of all.  One day, she skillfully sent a spear against the hero of Diomedes, who found a place not protected by armor and punched Ares through the belly.  With a wild howl, Ares left the battlefield and flew to Olympus with a complaint against Athena.  Zeus did not even want to listen to Ares' explanations, stating that he was punished with justice and deserves to be not on Olympus, but in tartar. <br><br>  <b>Soon the second part (with characteristics, pluses and minuses, price and blackjack) - do not go far!</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68228/</a></p>
