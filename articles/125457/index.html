  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to set a task for a simple (template) site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the last week or two, I happened to see several questionnaires that torture their clients with all sorts of different studios before creating simple sample sites.  This made me extremely upset and encouraged me to propose a much more efficient and customer-oriented approach to setting the task and writing the TOR for simple websites with <b>limited time and budget.</b> <br><br>  I remember, by the way, that in the comments to the articles on design I was asked such questions as ‚ÄúWhat to do when there is no time and money for design?‚Äù.  The answer is below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Just in case, I‚Äôll clarify that I have no reason to call simple sites <b>template</b> .  Of course, I don‚Äôt have exact figures, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that 90% of simple sites on the Runet are built on the basis of designers and ready-made templates with repainting and pasting the client‚Äôs logo.  And those who do not use ready-made design templates take ready-made templates from their heads: news on the right, top image image and menu, text in the center.  Because time and budget do not allow to make a site for a specific client. <br><br><h3>  As usual, the task is set in Russian studios. </h3><br>  The most common are two options: <ul><li>  Ask the client to write the TK, </li><li>  Ask the customer to complete a standard questionnaire. </li></ul>  As for the first point, I have already spoken in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/115224/">‚ÄúHow to evaluate the task before starting the development of the site‚Äù</a> and I will not repeat.  This is just nonsense. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      <br>
      As for the second point, I will speak in some detail, because the questionnaires are used in very respected large studios, which fills my heart with sadness. <br><br><h4>  Questionnaires are evil </h4><br>  The first problem of the questionnaire lies in its nature: it requires you <b>to choose from the proposed answers</b> .  Given the qualifications of the compilers of questionnaires, the proposed options often do not allow you to choose the right option or simply do not understand the client.  For example, here are the answers to the question ‚ÄúChoose a type of design‚Äù: <ol><li>  presentation promotional site (not enough text, a lot of graphics), </li><li>  information representation (a lot of graphics and information, information in a very short form, but approximately 50% of the total content of the main page), </li><li>  informational (little graphics, a lot of text, information in detail). </li></ol>  Is that what?  How can you choose something from this, and why should the client do it?  Isn‚Äôt he hired a developer to make the right decisions, including those concerning design? <br><br>  Or it is proposed to tick this requirement: "The website should be presented with a simple and easy navigation through the pages."  What should the client answer?  "Not!  Just not convenient site navigation, I beg you! ‚Äù <br><br>  And what should the client choose in response to the question ‚ÄúChoose browsers‚Äù?  I, please, Mozilla and IE, but Opera and Chrome, probably, is not necessary.  So should the customer respond? <br><br>  The second problem is that the questionnaires are immediately aimed at determining the site specification and requirements, and <b>not on clarifying the client‚Äôs business objectives</b> .  The proposed answers actually constitute the task on the site, which <b>removes the responsibility</b> for the result <b>from the developer</b> .  Say, you yourself, dear customer, so answered.  What do you want from us now? <br><br>  I will give some examples of such questions: <ul><li>  Do you need a screensaver: Yes / No? </li><li>  Select a design pattern: Two columns / Three columns. </li><li>  Where the information field should be located: Left / Center / Right / Pop up. </li><li>  Determine the structure of the main page - this is an open question with no answers. </li></ul>  By the way, all these questions are taken by me from real questionnaires.  I was killed on the spot number 3, where there is an answer ‚ÄúPop up‚Äù.  A curtain. <br><br>  The third problem of the questionnaire is that it is often in its pure form, as the client has filled it, without any processing by a specialist, subscribes and starts up.  That is, the developer not only disclaims responsibility, but also <b>forces the client to do not his work</b> .  Both the client and you yourself will suffer. <br><br><h3>  How we recommend setting a task </h3><br><h4>  Conduct a personal interview </h4><br>  We believe that it is best to conduct a personal interview with the client, about the benefits of which I have already spoken in the above-mentioned article on setting the task.  Let me remind you the key points: <ol><li>  The interview demonstrates your <b>reverent attitude to the client</b> : you are ready to listen to him, and not to get back with the questionnaire;  you are ready for personal contact;  the client is an individuality for you, questionnaires are not applicable to him.  This is true.  And if you think that this is not the case, then you have no place in this business. </li><li>  The interview allows you to get much <b>more useful information</b> due to the fact that you can clarify them or ask additional questions, and also receive information not only in text, but also paraverbally - see the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/113363/">‚ÄúThree Frequent Errors in Communication with a Client‚Äù</a> . </li><li>  The client can tell you about something unexpected that you would not even have thought to ask. </li><li>  An interview allows you to get <b>first-hand information</b> .  Questioning does not give such a guarantee, because the questionnaire can be commissioned to fill in the secretary, who does not understand the belmes in this. </li></ol>  I foresee a question about how to conduct an interview if there is no access to the client‚Äôs body.  For this there is Skype and cheap IP-telephony. <br><br><h4>  Interview plan </h4><br>  What, in fact, you need to ask.  We propose to consider an interview plan for the most common type of site - corporate representation.  Tasks of this interview: <ol><li>  Clearly state what tasks the site should solve. </li><li>  Learn more about the client. </li><li>  Understand what information should be on the site: in what form and volume it should / can be presented. </li><li>  Understand how we will personalize * the site - adjust it to the client. </li></ol>  * I‚Äôll clarify that by personalization I understand all the actions that the developer performs, so that the website from the designer and the set of templates is uniquely identified with the client - that is, not only the functionality change, but also the work with the style and content. <table><tbody><tr><th>  What you need to know </th><th>  Questions </th></tr><tr><td>  What tasks the site should solve </td><td>  Let's define why you need a website, what tasks it should solve. </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  <b>About client / business</b> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">  Customer information </td><td>  1. Tell us about what you / your company is doing: what services or products you offer. </td></tr><tr><td>  2. Tell about your clients: about her needs, behavioral peculiarities, how they rate you. </td></tr><tr><td>  3. How do you sell your services / products to your customers?  Describe the sales process: what you focus on, what are your advantages over competitors. </td></tr><tr><td>  4. Who are your competitors? </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  <b>About the site</b> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  What information should be on the site;  in what form and volume it should / can be represented </td><td>  1. What information - about you, your products / services - in your opinion should be on the site?  (just information, not structure!). </td></tr><tr><td>  2. How and in what detail will we describe the goods / services?  Provide examples describing your products / services. </td></tr><tr><td>  3. What do you have of this, and what will you need to create?  Can you provide us with sample content? </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">  Refine personalization character </td><td>  1. Do you have a corporate identity? </td></tr><tr><td>  2. If not, what are the wishes for registration? </td></tr><tr><td>  3. Show examples of sites that you like. </td></tr></tbody></table>  So, the main <b>task of</b> such an interview is to find out the client‚Äôs tasks, understand his business and, as a result, suggest the best way to present information about him on the site for his target audience. <br><br><h4>  Make a technical assignment </h4><br>  The terms of reference based on this interview should contain the following information: <ol><li>  Site tasks </li><li>  Business Description </li><li>  Description of CA, </li><li>  Competitor information </li><li>  Site style requirements </li><li>  Site content requirements </li><li>  Site Specification. </li></ol>  For convenience, we post <a href="http://studiolounge.ru/media/File/Site-Specification-Example.pdf">an example of a real Technical Specification</a> (PDF, 170 KB), filled in according to this template. <br><br>  You make the first 6 points of the list on the basis of an interview with a client and let him approve this document.  After he approves these points, you proceed to the creation of a site specification - a detailed description of the functions and structure: <ol><li>  Feature list; </li><li>  Information structure of the site, the composition of the main menu; </li><li>  What information is in each section / page and how it is presented; </li><li>  The presence and composition of contextual blocks on different pages. </li></ol>  This specification must be approved once again with the client and you can begin to create the site. <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  Never ask a client to fill out a questionnaire and, even more so, to draw up TK independently.  This is a felony. <br><br>  Independently determine the needs and tasks of the client, design the structure of the site - functional and informational.  You are a professional developer.  You must take responsibility for the result, and not transfer it to the client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125457/</a></p>
