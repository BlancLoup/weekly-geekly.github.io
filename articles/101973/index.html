  <section class="page js-page"><h1>B / In Ukraine, using scrap, destroyed the database of quality certificates for all types of products</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The electronic certification database of UkrSEPRO has been destroyed, the first deputy general director of the state-owned enterprise, Ukrainian Research and Training Center for Standardization, Certification and Quality, said Sergey Dorotich. <br><br>  According to the head of the legal department of the state-owned enterprise, Bogdan Lavrenyuk, on Wednesday, August 11, a commission headed by an acting member.  Director General of the UkrNIUC Vladimir Stuley in the presence of the head of the State Consumer Standard Oleg Povolotsky (dismissed by government decree on the same day - ed.) opened the server room in which the main server of the certification system UkrSEPRO was located, after which unknown people worked with the equipment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúThe strangers arrived at 11:00.  In the presence of Povolotsky, they blocked the floor, removed the employees.  After that, unknown persons opened the door of the server room with the help of a grinder, a scrap, carried out some operations with the server, connected equipment to it, disconnected components, ‚Äùnoted the head of the provision sector with strict reporting forms of UkrSEPRO, who was present at the events.

      By evening, the room was sealed with the seal number 3.  All employees sent home.  In the morning the same room was sealed with signet no. 4.  What was done with the equipment at night is unknown, but the next day the server was no longer functioning, "the official added. <br><br>  At the same time, he stressed that both Stulei, who heads the commission, and the deputy general director for legal issues of UkrSEPRO, Yuri Radchenko, who participates in the opening of the server room, were appointed to their posts by the leadership of the State Standard Committee on the eve of the events. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are not allowed into the center building.  But yesterday I spoke with an officer of the Security Service of Ukraine, who is conducting an investigation.  He informed me that the UkrSEPRO database was physically destroyed, ‚Äùsaid Dorovich. <br><br>  At the same time, he clarified that the database contained information on all quality certificates issued for all types of products over the past years.  ‚ÄúNow it is impossible to check on the basis of what a particular certificate was issued, whether it is valid.  This is not to mention the fact that the information was a commercial secret, ‚Äùhe stressed. <br><br>  According to Dorotich, on August 13, Gospotrebstandart introduced a new procedure for issuing quality conformance certificates, in which documents are issued by regional offices without being fixed in an electronic database. <br><br>  On August 11, the Cabinet of Ministers relieved Oleg Povolotsky of the duties of the head of the State Committee for Technical Regulation and Consumer Policy (Gospotrehstandard). <br><br>  <a href="http://econo.com.ua/%3Fp%3D2724">A source</a> <br><br>  Consequences are well described by habraiser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/stalkers/" class="user_link">stalkers</a> <br><br>  1. Officially stated that there is no base.  This means that now anyone, even the most petty checks about the quality control of products (especially at the border), are untied.  The list of products subject to certification is rather extensive (http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=z0466-05).  How much money will flow to the left is hard to imagine. <br>  2. The very fact of such a hack.  At the moment, the only way to quickly verify any information is to store it in electronic form.  And if the records disappear?  And if you want them to disappear?  It's simple - a couple of guys with crowbars, open the server, take out the server / servers.  As if this is not included in the practice.  And it may well be if this case remains without consequences and real deadlines for someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101973/</a></p>
