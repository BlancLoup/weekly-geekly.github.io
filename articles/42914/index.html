  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Browser weapon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Immediately after the Christmas weekend, Bill Gates silently entered the Microsoft meeting room and took his seat. <br>  ‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù said the founder of Microsoft, ‚Äúour intelligence has reported that Google is developing its own browser.‚Äù  This is very bad news.  Soon we will lose our advantages in browser technologies, which are already hopelessly outdated.  Even despite the seventh version of the explorer.  What are the suggestions? <br>  There was silence.  Apparently, all those present at the meeting did not know what to say. <br>  ‚ÄúMoreover,‚Äù continued Bill Gates, breaking the silence, ‚Äúwe continue to be attacked by these red terrorists ‚Äî Firefox and Opera.  They are still weak, but the number of their users is increasing.  And Google is actively helping them in this.  Our Internet Explorer fights bravely, but without sufficient support its days are numbered. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  - May prohibit the use of these browsers in Windows?  Said Paul Allen thoughtfully.  - Or will we introduce an anti-competitive patch, as it was done in Windows 95? <br>  - And what is the anti-competitive patch?  - asked someone from those present. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, in general this is secret information of course ...‚Äù Paul Allen smiled mysteriously.  - In general, the essence is as follows: earlier in Windows, any program that was not written by Microsoft worked with errors and constantly produced a blue screen of death.  True, something did not work there, and as a result, our applications were also hit.  Including Windows itself ... Therefore, I had to refuse later. <br>  - Not, Paul, nepropret.  - Gates shook his head, - Google will again fill us with lawsuits in the style of "Show us your secret code, please."  And yet, it will finally kill the faith of people in our democracy.  And democracy should be.  Everyone must decide for himself which version of our products to use. <br>  ‚ÄúOkay, we can't do anything with them yet.‚Äù  - Allen thought for a while, - And Apple with their Safari? <br>  - On these aliens can not pay attention. <br>  - And Konqueror? <br>  - On third world systems too.  They do not get to us soon. <br>  - Then ... - Paul looked at the ceiling, - Maybe try to go to the third world?  Make Internet Explorer under Linux! <br>  - No, they will not even install it.  - Gates dismissed, - Well, except that so ... neighing. <br>  ‚ÄúSo we won't be able to do anything with this Google browser ...‚Äù summed Paul Allen.  - Soon, each company will have its own browser weapons ... It is necessary to urgently create new browser technologies, so that at least not to fall behind.  By the way, who on the line after Google has enough capacity to create a browser? <br>  ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù someone from the audience gave a vote, ‚Äúaccording to our data, this is Yahoo.‚Äù <br>  - That's good.  - Bill Gates said, - So, we are urgently starting the development of Internet Explorer 8. And buy this Yahoo after all.  Just in case. </div>
