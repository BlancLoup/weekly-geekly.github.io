There will be a question. This is the most important part of the topic).</font> <br><br>  I am deeply convinced that freelancing is a development deadlock for a programmer.  There are a lot of reasons, I will not describe them now, but they all come from the same root cause - the lack of professional growth. <br>  Under prof.  by growth, in this case, I mean specifically programming skills.  Self-organization, etc.  I‚Äôll go round because without the ability to program it is still of little use (for a programmer). <br><br>  The main reason why a freelance programmer cannot develop is the lack of necessary experience.  The more experienced a person is, the more complex tasks correspond to his experience and the more complex tasks are necessary for this experience to be enhanced.

      Consequently, not having in the orders of complex and large-scale projects, the freelancer in any case will stagnate on the spot professionally (and even degrade, forgetting what he had learned while working at the company on large projects, if such experience was). <br><br>  Are there any such projects? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is.  But such an insignificant amount that it can be said that in general there are practically none.  This is of course my opinion, there are people who hold the opposite opinion.  To determine and was created this post. <br><br>  If you know the projects (large and large-scale) that were created by freelancers, then give them links in the comments (preferably with an indication of who the project did. It is possible without names, if it is a secret).  Your links may confirm the idea that the freelancer has a chance to develop, that he can, if he wishes, engage in large projects and increase his experience. <br>  Clarification - we are talking about web projects and web programmers. <br><br>  What, in my understanding, is a serious and large project: <br><br>  1. The project is of course visited.  I think that a small percentage that is still in development or not yet promoted can be skipped.  All the same, freelancing is not living the first year. <br><br>  2. The project has a certain complexity. <br><br>  a) Large file load (for example, photo sites, file hosting sites, banner networks and systems) with distribution to several servers and attendance of tens or hundreds of thousands of hosts per day (in the case of a banner network with unscrambled more than 20 million per day). <br>  b) The project uses some tricky algorithms developed by the authors of the project, the necessary non-standard solutions, etc. <br><br>  c) Elements characteristic of loaded projects: sharding, multilevel caching, optimization denormalization of the database, etc. <br><br>  3. The project is made for the order (or the creator of the project after creation continued to engage in projects to order, ie, did not leave the freelancing) <br><br>  I think that the presence of paragraph 1 and at least 2 elements from paragraph 2 speaks about the project as serious.  If there are other criteria that you think are important or you disagree with some point, justify your point of view and I will correct the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26810/</a></p>
