      - Something is wrong here ... they do not finish something ... <br><br>  Looking through the eyes of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia Petrovich found the required shelf and opened the massive glass door of the rightmost bookcase.  For the TSB slender next, in growth, were all sorts of dictionaries. <br><br>  It was already 9 in the evening, Petrovich swept the yard and the playground back at 7, so that the citizens returning from work would be met with soothing cleanliness in front of the house.  Therefore, until 4 in the morning, he could afford to read and think.  At this age, insomnia already thoroughly made itself felt. <br><br>  Petrovich began to sort out the dictionaries in order. <br><br>  <b>Explanatory Dictionary Ushakov.</b>  <b>D.N.</b>  <b>Ushakov.</b>  <b>1935-1940.</b> <br><h6>  PIRATE, pirate, husband.

So ... in all four cases, the first definition indicates a robber.  Let's see what a robber is.  - quietly muttered Petrovich to himself. <br><br>  He picked up a few more dictionaries from the shelf and, with his armpit books, moved into a soft comfortable chair.  On the table next to it was already cooled tea in a glass with a carved cup holder.  Petrovich loved old dishes.  This tea glass was still remembered by Petrovich‚Äôs grandmother, and he himself reminded him of a crazy rural childhood, without televisions, internet, and at first even without a radio.  At that time, men had a certain ritual to read the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù one-month-old newspaper full of dignity, and the children stuck to this group ‚Äúdignity‚Äù and eagerly listened to what was happening in the big world, in the capital and on the outskirts, and tried to see in black boxes on yellowish fragile paper pronounced last names and titles.  Read, as a rule, the guys learned very early.  It was embarrassing to be uneducated in front of peers, they could be a shame to tease or even hurt, or even not take a cowberry over the Far Hill. <br>  But Petrovich was too absorbed in his research and completely forgot about tea. <br><br>  <b>Great Dictionary of Russian language.</b>  <b>- 1st ed.: SPb .: Norint.</b>  <b>S.A.

Talk  joke <br>  Tomboy, daredevil. <br>  - And tell me, please, the whole class of robbers consisted of daredevils, but, you know, they were generous!  Chekhov, on the eve of fasting. </h6><br><br>  ‚ÄúEvono is like ... robbed the rich and handed out money to the poor ... Hmm ...‚Äù <br><br>  Petrovich closed the book and stared at the TV off.  Petrovich reproachfully watched from the TV his muddy reflection, sitting hunchy in an armchair and covered with piles of books. <br><br>  - How does that happen?  - thought Petrovich.  - After all, the books have long been written.  After all, you just need to take from the shelf and read. <br><br>  Petrovich never had a computer and he paid his bills for an apartment as always through the window at the Savings Bank, bypassing the payment terminals with caution.  He received his pension and janitor‚Äôs salary in the window.  And it was Petrovich easy and convenient.  Only the vile expression on the face of a bank employee grieved when he approached the window for his pennies. <br><br>  But even without a computer, Petrovich was well aware that the pirate was stealing first and foremost for his own gain.  And the one who steals for the sake of donating the loot to the poor, according to the books read by Petrovich, has been called Robin Hood since the days of King Richard.  But Robin Hood, though he was a robber, but was a noble robber, he was a hero. <br><br>  Petrovich thought.  - And what is so valuable about the fact that the Internet pirate steals and transfers to others? <br><br>  It turned out that the only value is information, knowledge.  Whether it is an audio or text book, a movie or a music album, in any case, the person who became the owner of this information will be a little smarter from what he read, what he saw or heard. <br>  And who wins in this process?  Who is enriched?  Only the people themselves.  People enriched spiritually!  Nobody has any money here! <br><br>  Petrovich leaned back in his chair.  He felt uncomfortable and chilly at the conclusions he himself made.  But common sense was inexorable.  Petrovich recalled that long before the development of the Internet, markets, transitions and just sidewalks were so full of hawkers with video cassettes, and then with DVDs, that there was no where to spit.  But it was all counterfeit! <br>  And where are they now!  Where are they, those who really amassed their wealth by selling illegal products - real pirates, robbers ?!  No them!  Their business has become unprofitable.  Why all?  And because there is no point in paying for a counterfeit disk when you can download the same movie, album or book on the Internet. <br><br>  - Hmm ... - thought Petrovich.  - And what about the free download?  It seems to be good, like information that makes a person smarter, better, more perfect and should be distributed freely.  And the state seems to be interested in the high IQ of its people.  On the other hand, it seems that the information producer must pay, because he tried, wrote, composed.  Although, the grandson seemed to say that you have to pay for Internet traffic in any case, regardless of whether it is legal or not. <br>  ‚Ä¶ Vicious circle. <br><br>  Petrovich put the book down from his knees, got up from his chair, and went to the window.  The dawn began. <br>  He has an ambivalent feeling of reflection.  On the one hand, he could understand what to pay for in a beautiful cinema with a large screen, comfortable seating and surround sound.  On the other hand, the payment of a clashed copy of the film with embedded Chinese hardsub and a deaf track was in no way linked to common sense.  In this and in another case, I wanted to pay only to the author of the work in an amount proportional to the artistic value of the product, but not to the owner of the distribution rights. <br><br>  Petrovich walked away from the window and looked at his watch.  His age ended.  Probably, he no longer has to witness the global triumph of copyright and Internet censorship, which is so important to everyone and which he had never seen before.  And this is not so bad. <br>  For some reason, Petrovich remembered a picture from the latest Crocodile magazine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a39/c6c/f8b/a39c6cf8bc3d84cc052a1c36d040aeee.jpg"><br>  Petrovich grunted and took a glass of tea. <br>  - Hmm ... Need to brew a new one.  - and Petrovich slowly walked to the kitchen, quietly shuffling his noble old age. <br>  Soon he would have to go to work so that sleepy and gloomy citizens, before another hard working day, would meet at the door with a soothing cleanliness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188626/</a></p>
