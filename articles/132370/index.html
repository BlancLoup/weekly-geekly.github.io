  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knowledge management in IT companies, is it necessary?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Knowledge management is a far from established and relatively young area in world science.  If management is tied to management, then the concept is considered alongside innovation, and therefore something new.  If you focus on knowledge, then you can go down to the boom of expert systems of the late 90s, which is also not very far away.  Interest in the topic in the global community arises in waves: either empty or thick, but if you take into account the increasing information congestion, sooner or later it will arise again. <br><br><h5>  Multiple definitions </h5><br>  Definition of knowledge from the field of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence: <br>  <i>Knowledge is the laws of the subject area (principles, relationships, laws) obtained as a result of practical activity and professional experience, allowing specialists to set and solve problems in this area.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Which ignores the knowledge itself and is now more to the ear: <br>  <i>In the KMS (knowledge management systems), knowledge refers to all types of information (including manuals, letters, news, customer information, competitor information, and technology accumulated during the development process).</i> <br>  Often in the phrase ‚Äúknowledge management‚Äù they have in mind precisely this definition, as a result of which everything slips into management in an enterprise that does not codify information <br><br>  It is also important not to forget that in the term ‚Äúknowledge management‚Äù you can operate with such concepts as intellectual capital, intellectual assets.  This is also a component of management.

    <h5>  Meanwhile </h5><br>  Meanwhile, if you look at Habr, then the tag ‚Äúknowledge management‚Äù records extremely small.  Only clearly traced references to knowledge management in articles on new solutions in the field of collaborative work (it should be noted, both commercial and not).  And usually for this responsible screwed wiki engine.  And well, if it will be with elements of semantics.  Who knows, maybe they are looking at the root and soon this item will become a key one in corporate systems.  The rest is already more or less able or know how to do it. <br><br>  However, there are positive examples.  Use of microformats by search engines.  We are looking for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dmicrodata%26target_type%3Dposts">microdata</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dschema.org%26target_type%3Dposts">schema.org</a> .  And this is already a good step towards semantics, on the road to knowledge and with examples that can be touched and which are successfully used. <br><br><h5>  What am i talking about </h5><br>  The introduction was delayed.  The rest will save.  Now in the case. <br><br>  In general, I became interested in the topic of knowledge management, in particular in software companies, and even chose the appropriate diploma theme: ‚Äúmodels and methods for forming a corporate knowledge base of software companies‚Äù.  I would like to hear from the community.  How things are, do you think it is necessary or may be completely useless.  Prepared a small <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdGF3VDlTZDRUcGpXRzhaemFyZUlxZlE6MQ">questionnaire</a> to help clarify this.  Please take some time and fill it. <br>  The area is interesting.  Remember the work situation.  What was missing, for example, when only got a job?  or when digging in someone else's code?  or with a thousand explanations to managers and marketers of obvious things.  about the use of a technology in the project, etc.  There are a lot of questions that can come into contact with knowledge. <br><br>  Separately, I would like to draw your attention to mental models.  The questionnaire will be a separate question on them.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Mind map</a> in the wiki and <a href="http://www.mindomo.com/view.htm%3Fm%3D76d48cf19a284262bb7ffb7977449560">an example of use</a> in i-Free. <br><br>  The number of completed questionnaires will become a kind of indicator of interest. <br><br>  And of course, thanks for participating.  If the study proves constructive, I undertake to present the interim results to the public. <br><br>  And once again the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdGF3VDlTZDRUcGpXRzhaemFyZUlxZlE6MQ">questionnaire</a> to fill. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132370/</a></p>
