      When they say ‚Äúleave emotions at home,‚Äù they mean something completely different. <br>  If you need to solve a problem - you need to turn off emotions.  Yes, this is more than correct. <br><br>  But if you need to ignite people - ‚ÄúTake your emotions with you.  The maximum amount you can bring. <br><br>  You, the manager, do not need to be very smart. <br>  You are a manager, not because you are a smart guy.  This is not your main feature.  For this you have people who are much smarter than you (do you have them?). <br>  You have become a manager because you have developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</a> . <br><br>  Think about it. <br>  Motivation and Emotions (E-motions) have the same root.  Motions. <br>  Emotions, this movement, this life. <br><br>  Read other people's emotions.  Respond to other people's emotions. <br>  Empathize with people, rejoice with them, be sad with them.  Be sincere in this. <br><br>  Usually they talk a lot about people's motives.  I often talk about this.  Motives are functional behavior.  But any person often does not function.  Often we act emotionally.  Any person, after a certain level and number of problems, switches to a mode when his emotions control him.  Notice the emotions of other people.  And when you see emotions in another person - you should not react functionally, you need to realize the emotions of another person and respond to them correctly (for example, empathize, help relieve stress, soothe). <br><br>  Do not be the leader who ‚ÄúNever praises.  There are no emotions in it.  And the only thing that can be heard from him is how I did everything badly. ‚Äù  Do the opposite.  Be emotional.  Praise always and for any little thing, for any, albeit a small success.  It costs you so little, and so much means to another person.  Point out the flaws gently and indirectly. <br><br>  How can we use it? <br>  By definition, words motive and emotions - to motivate people. <br>  Connect positive emotions with what you want, and negative with what you do not want. <br><br>  For example.  Tell people how cool it will be when you release your new wonderful project.  Just do not try to do it if you yourself do not believe it.  If something works, then only your sincerity and honesty. <br><br>  Relax and imagine this DAY. <br>  What will it be in a day? <br>  What are you going to do. <br>  How will you feel. <br><br>  The day you hit the Send button and the build goes into release. <br>  Imagine how QA Lead Sasha will run for champagne to the nearest stall to celebrate your success. And this will be the only emergency task that you will need to solve on that day. <br><br>  Imagine how you will be proud of yourself when your Allods Online, in the eyes of players, the press, in your own eyes, will be, if not better than World of Warcraft, then at least, well at least, in some elements are comparable with him. <br><br>  When tomorrow morning you go to work.  Look at yourself in the mirror.  Smile to yourself.  And take emotions with you. <br><br>  There will be a DAY when critics understand how badly they are wrong.  But for you, it will not matter anymore, you will sunbathe somewhere in a warm place, and with a cold beer in your hands think about what the next goal is worthy of you.  Live THIS DAY, it will be the day of your SUCCESS, it will be the day when you will be HAPPY. <br><br>  Denis, <br>  Especially for friends in Nival Online. <br><br>  PS They say that you can read more about emotions here: <br>  - Lazarus (1994) ‚ÄúPassion and Reason‚Äù, Oxford University Press, New York <br>  - Plutchik (1980) ‚ÄúEmotion: Theory, research, and experience‚Äù, New York: Academic <br><br>  PS2.
