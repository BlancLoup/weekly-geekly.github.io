    <h5>  As it usually happens </h5><br><br>  After another screening of wagons on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> , <a href="http://www.xing.com/">XING</a> , and other sources of business leads, fighting off all kinds of LiONs, open networkers and other social networks cockroaches, a MIRACLE suddenly happens - someone answers your next request for contact information " <i>yes, I'm thinking about to do something, and maybe I will need your help</i> . "  A long and tedious pre-sale begins.  And then the difficulties begin - the client does not know what he wants, but you do not know what to offer him and bomb him with the abbreviations NET, PHP, OOP / OOD, JDBC, and many others that you have in a special Word document.  Somehow, the exchange of emails is not shaky, and the customer‚Äôs contacts are safely buried somewhere in the depths of CRM with the note ‚Äúwrite in half a year, find out if he has an RFP‚Äù.  Familiar?  I exaggerate specially! <br><br>  Okay, let's assume that your management cuts a piece and for each qualified lead gives you PMA-analyst all the same to find out <s>if</s> the client is dreaming about this monumental.  Omitting the fact that they usually dream about the killer of Facebook, YouTube, and other successful projects <s>quickly and in a thousand bucks</s> and imagine that the client has a coherent business goal, and he wants to realize it.  For example, to launch (by the way, to <i>launch</i> , and not to develop) a portal for multiplayer Flash games.  And here he goes and communicates with vendors to stir up something like that. <br><br>  And now, armed with a phone, Skype, outlook, pen and paper, PM starts an even more painful hilling process by finding out, first of all, for himself what the client wants and how to meet his needs, earning for the company the following stop oats. <br><br><blockquote><h5>  Wait, why PM? </h5><br>  Because PM in our realities is a jack of all trades, who knows how to set up mod_dav_svn as an Apache and how to explain to the client in his language why the notorious triangle once again interferes with the rainbow flow of consciousness that generates another <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%2592%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">vunderv√§lflu</a> .  And the task at the stage of presale is to convince the client that you know what he wants, and you know how to do it.  And this usually includes not only and not so much the construction of a hierarchy of requirements, but also the normal, at the analyst level, understanding of the applied area in which we are floundering, and even the ability to plan at the feature level, to evaluate all this in the conditions of lack of information, and available in English by phone. <br></blockquote><br><br>  So, the contract is signed, work begins.  The team consists of competent boys who know when to NOT use functional programming, and a tech lead that can scrum, stand-up meetings, whiteboard planning, continuous integration and a lot of everything else.  In general, a silent enlightened team works for a client.  Requirements are detailed, user-story is generated, iterations are planned, builds are released.  The client is satisfied, the team is also happy (still, we are doing something real, someone needed, and understandable to everyone), the top management is happy, because  bills are paid on time and on time. <br><br>  Days, weeks and months pass, and the PM becomes quite self-contained in the topic and is already starting to give advice to the customer what can be added / corrected / improved in the system to achieve a better result.  One, two, three - all recommendations go bang and are included in the backlog.  The customer arrives and imbues himself with a team atmosphere, and just falls in love with PM. <br><br>  And now - the project is completed, transferred to maintenance tim, bills paid.  Someone wrote himself another successful project in his portfolio, someone put half of his pocket in his pocket from the stop ots.  Yes, that's just the PM for some reason melancholic sips in the tavern Calvados. <br><br><h5>  And where does the motivation? </h5><br><br>  And why, if the vendor‚Äôs profit depends on the PMA‚Äôs actions and the success of the customer‚Äôs business, is he not motivated by all this?  Why he sits on his X thousand dollars, and Sale gets %% from sales, although his role is to send reports once a month (and don‚Äôt talk about the relationship building! The best relationship building is the real work on the project, not a discussion of football or dogs).  Ask yourself these questions and you will understand that there are problems with outsourcing. <br><br><h5>  Problems </h5><br><br>  As a person who has passed through the furnace of an outsourcing from junior to a director, I will undertake to voice the following problems, as I see myself: <br><br><ul><li>  The role of middle managers in IT outsourcing business is underestimated </li><li>  Enlightened managers leave because they understand their true role in everything </li><li>  And the process of forging such a manager is not for you to send a certification programmer.  Long and expensive </li></ul><br><br>  And what to do with them - everyone decides for himself.  Personally, I decided for myself - the people responsible for the profit are always in proportion.  Discuss? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51010/</a></p>
