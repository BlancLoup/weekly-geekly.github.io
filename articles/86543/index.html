  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I restored the mailbox on mail.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear habrareyudi!  I want to share with you the history of recovering passwords from a mailbox on mail.ru.  Personally, after this incident, I decided to completely switch to gmail.  Maybe someone will be interested. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6a/97a/ec3/e6a97aec387523d8c4e5af0de19864a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started, oddly enough, with reinstalling the system.  A couple of days after installing fresh Windows 7, access to the mailbox was lost.  Unfortunately, these couple of days were absolutely emergency and there was not enough time to put the antivirus ... What I regret so far (although it may not matter in the virus, but in the mail.ru password recovery system) <br><br>  The mailbox nuru***@mail.ru is my first mailbox after my appearance on the Internet ... Probably that is why I still used it.  It seemed that everything was fine, although there were a lot of jambs then, about 6-7 years ago.  For the same reason, quite a lot of things were registered on this e-mail (ICQ, some domains and other trivialities such as twitter and contact).  Gradually, it all moved to gmail's mail, but somehow it did not reach the hands to transfer everything entirely.  For which I eventually paid. <br><br>  After losing access to the e-mail, I immediately tried to restore it in the recovery section.  Before that, there were already a couple of similar stories; it was restored somehow very simply and quickly.  I even remember the girl's password was restored to completely trivial questions (which, by the way, gives quite a lot of room for hackers, perhaps this is how my e-mail was taken away).  In my own history, it turned out that the mailbox was sent for deletion (who does not know, mail.ru doesn‚Äôt delete the mailbox at once, finally it seems only after 2 months).

      Filled out a request for restoration, sent.  Instead of the usual answer on the same day, they answered only the next day in the late afternoon.  It turned out that data is needed in more detail.  The standard set was sent to the question ‚ÄúWhat else is necessary?‚Äù, Which I tried to fill in the first letter (except for the control question and the answer to it, I unfortunately forgot it ...), and the answer came another day or so ... By that time, the attacker already recovered passwords from domains registered to this e-mail, collected the harvest so to speak.  Mail.ru was not in a hurry ... In the following query I indicated everything I remembered, made a photo of a student and a credit card in my name.  I sent them ... But that didn‚Äôt satisfy the all-powerful mail.ru.  To the question what else they lack, another silence ... To be honest, I don‚Äôt know what to do next.  Tell me, can anyone come across? <br><br>  What is the conclusion of all this?  The conclusion is that if you don‚Äôt want problems with password recovery in the future and want security, use something else ... <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Sent a letter to the marketing department and their director.</b>  <b>Let's see what will change.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86543/</a></p>
