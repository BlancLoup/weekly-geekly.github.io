  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Almost the entire truth about fans and memory for Cisco 2821/2851</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the past few years, my residential network (12 computers and a dozen Wi-Fi devices) faithfully served cisco 2651XM.  Telephony (12FXS and 4FXO on the NM-HDA) and two ISPs of 30 Mbit unlimited Internet from each.  Before the active use of torrents by all members of the family, she coped perfectly well, but when the user was running, on more than one computer, the 2651XM was completely bent.  Having spent a month on optimization and not finding worthy compromises, the piece of iron was sent to a well-deserved retirement (on komok.com, where for mere pennies she immediately found herself a new owner ...), and cisco 2821 got up to combat duty. toad on ext.  I will miss the $ 700 home network investment ... As it should be, the piece of hardware was taken by Yuzana, with a minimum memory of 256M and already with very noisy fans, on which the piece of hardware was actively swearing, annoyingly reporting a periodic stop of one of the fans and low speed two others.  Opening the cleaning and lubrication of the fans solved the problem, alas, only partially.  One of the fans completely "resurrect" in the end did not succeed, too late, alas!  He worked for too long in the dust and without lubrication, for this though he started spinning and even stopped making noise, he no longer gives the proper turnovers.  Have to change!  :( Running through the fuck, I saw their minimum price of $ 22, which didn‚Äôt inspire me! 700r for the fan, and a couple of weeks of waiting! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I had to look for more affordable counterparts in the homeland.  First, I found out the main characteristics of the fan.  If someone has the same problem, but for a different brand cisco, then it is solved by hammering in the Google search phrases cisco XXXX fan and clicking on the pictures.  From the options we choose a seller with positive reviews, etc.  We increase the picture of the fan they offer, write off its name and find all the necessary parameters by name. <br>  The parameters for the cisco 2821 fan were as follows: <br>  - Size 80 * 80 * 25mm. <br>  - Power supply 12V (DC) <br>  - Current consumption up to 0.3-0.4 amps. <br>  - The number of revolutions 4000 (although it is quite suitable and manufactured fans with RPM equal to 4600 and above). <br>  - And most importantly, this is the presence of the output S (that is, three wires go from the fan), this is the output from the tachometer to control the actual speed of the fan.  It is usually referred to as TAC OUT.  Here it is that gives us the main difficulty in finding! <br>  For example, the following models will be suitable: MNB 3110KL, AFB0812VHB (It is 10mm thinner, but it is structurally suitable without any problems). <br>  Alas, the search for such glands in Moscow was not an easy task.  To my great surprise, nothing of the kind was found either in Chip and Dipe, or in Platan, or even in Nix, although in the latter, with some compromises, you can still buy the required fan.  There is a 2800RPM fan for only 130r.  Model ZALMAN &lt;ZM-F1 Plus&gt;. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a7/520/5fa/2a75205fa3820c951575c123a6dec7f2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More details here: <a href="http://www.nix.ru/autocatalog/zalman/coolers/ZALMAN_ZMF1_Plus_Fan_tower_80x80x25mm_2032_17002800_76510.html">www.nix.ru/autocatalog/zalman/coolers/ZALMAN_ZMF1_Plus_Fan_tower_80x80x25mm_2032_17002800_76510.html</a> .  The most optimal option is to buy a model: Spire SP08025S3H3 / 4

Issue price 130-250r.  depending on the greed of the store. <br>  And so, as if they figured out the fans, everything works and does not buzz, now let's take over the memory.  By and large, for my tasks there is enough reserve and 256M available with IOS 12.4, but this is at least not sporty, so let's add some memory and we will set 15.2!  the good with the licenses there the same turned out to be simple. <br>  The maximum amount of memory that can be installed in this model is 1024 megabytes.  A set of such a memory with ebaya will cost us $ 50 with delivery.  Or even 40, if through slow mail Shipito.  We need two strips of 512 megabytes.  This model uses 184-pin DIMM memory modules.  ECC at 400 MHz, that is, PC-3200, supply voltage 2.6V, number of wounds - 2 (I did not try to install memory with a different number of wounds, but I suspect that it will work with one wound, if someone has already tried, please give know).  For example, you can put the modules Kingston KVR400X72C3A / 512.  Although, as practice shows, the use of memory with ECC support for this model is completely unnecessary, in 2821 memory will work without ECC.  For example, the model KVR400X64C25 / 512 is suitable, the price for a new 350R.  But working on a lump can be found much cheaper if you have time.  With the memory of Flash in this model, everything is simple!  Absolutely any Compact Flash module with a memory capacity of no more than 2 GB.  Well, that seems to be all, all a successful upgrade and repair. <br><br>  UPD.  Judging by the commentary, they probably suspected me of hidden advertising.  Alas, I didn‚Äôt have a similar goal, because, above all, I‚Äôm missing the motives!  I haven‚Äôt sold anything for more than two years and haven‚Äôt engaged in any commercial activity, but you can‚Äôt argue with the public, apparently there are still some advertising notes in the article, because at one time I really traded in tsiska, and about ten years.  For the house, I used this piece of iron, as it is not strange, really, first of all because of saving!  Yes, yes, it is out of savings, nothing worthwhile to do cheaper even on household PCs will not work, since I still have full telephony on it.  12 FXS ports, 1 FXO + IP telephony port with SIP account. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142338/</a></p>
