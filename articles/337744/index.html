New features iOS 11, discussion of Apple Special Event and competition from Avito</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  We all know that almost every iOS developer would like to be on the evening of September 12 at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino.  Instead of tricks with teleportation and the materialization of invitations to this event, we organized the Avito Special iOS Event. </p><br><p>  First, we will listen to short thematic reports from iOS developers from leading Russian companies, and then there will be a joint viewing of the Apple conference.  Especially for Habr, we will conduct live video broadcast here of the part that with the reports, we have in Avito, and then - the text broadcast from California.  To make it even more fun, we have prepared a contest for those who are able to foresee the future. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/94f/e4b/5bf/94fe4b5bfff3421aa920c8712790bc0c.jpg"></p><br><p>  So, under the cut: </p><br><ul><li>  Live broadcast of reports about new features of iOS 11 (mainly about Drag and Drop), ARKit, Vision;  ( <strong>UPD: completed - uploaded video</strong> ) </li><li>  slides of reports; </li><li>  competition for users of Habr (from 18:00 to 20:00, 12.09 Moscow time - <strong>completed, the results are inside</strong> ); </li><li>  text translation of the conference (starting at 20:00 12.09 Moscow time); </li><li>  Fresh pictures with Tim Cook. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="konkurs-zavershyon">  Competition <strong>(completed)</strong> </h1><br><p>  All the big Apple events are surrounded by mystery.  Everyone is trying to guess what they will tell and show at the conference.  We suggest you make your bets in <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/xp18zKXOO2wdZ3i82">this form</a> .  Each answer has its own weight in points.  We will give a souvenir from Avito to those (or those) who have the most developed intuition / foresight / etc.  We‚Äôll finish answering with the start of the Apple conference broadcast. </p><br><p>  UPD from 09/13: We summed up the draw.  Here is the screencast: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwCre8tJW5E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Congratulations to the top three to which Avito souvenirs will go! <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zenfire/" class="user_link">zenfire</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/shamil/" class="user_link">shamil</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/otbivnoe/" class="user_link">otbivnoe</a> </p><br><p>  You will be contacted by our blog editor.  Separately, I will say that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zenfire/" class="user_link">zenfire</a> scored maximum points - all his assumptions turned out to be correct. </p><br><p>  Now - to the reports. </p><br><h1 id="doklady">  Reports </h1><br><p>  So, as soon as possible we plunge into the brave new world of iOS 11. We invited experts from Rabler &amp; Co, Avito and App in the Air to the mitap.  Today's stories are about the practical experience of implementing new features of iOS 11. Even if you haven‚Äôt been following the updates so much, after this post you will clearly know what your applications are missing to become fully iOS 11-compatible. </p><br><h2 id="translyaciya-iz-ofisa-avito-na-youtube-zavershena-video-dostupno">  Broadcast from the Avito office to YouTube (completed, video available) </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/To53BYMI6xA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="arkit-v-prilozhenii-afisha-restorany-samvel-medzhlumyan-dmitriy-antyshev-ramblerco">  ARKit in the app Poster Restaurants.

In addition to the ton of HYIP, video-democrat and the Gattner curve, much attention is paid to the issues of algorithms for calculating the position of points in space and building routes.  If you still doubt that ARKit can be built into your application, it‚Äôs the experience of the guys that can help you change your mind. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AvitoTech/arkit-ramblerco"><strong>Slides</strong></a> </p><br><h3 id="anonimizaciya-foto-s-pomoschyu-vision-timofey-homutnikov-avito">  Anonymize photos using Vision.  Timofey Khomutnikov, Avito </h3><br><p>  Avito has a well-developed tradition of internal hakatons, which we already wrote about in our blog.  On one of them, the mobile developers team decided to have a known pain of users - when they post ads, they try to hide the faces and numbers of the machines in all possible ways.  Someone puts on packages, someone covers with their hands, the most advanced do it in a graphic editor, but the essence remains - to ensure confidentiality, people spend too much effort. </p><br><p>  Timofey Khomutnikov talks about how this problem was solved with the help of the new Vision framework and a set of crutches.  And so that the report does not boil down to a simple use of the system SDK, Timofey conducts educational campaign on the existing methods and algorithms for determining license plates. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AvitoTech/vision-avito"><strong>Slides</strong></a> </p><br><h3 id="ios-11-v-app-in-the-air-sergey-pronin-app-in-the-air">  iOS 11 in App in the Air.  Sergey Pronin, App in the Air </h3><br><p>  The developers of App in the Air are known for each year being one of the first to implement all the new buns from the iOS update ‚Äî and no matter how relevant the application seems to be at first glance, it turns out steadily cool.  This year is no exception.  Sergey Pronin, CTO of the company, talks about the key functionality implemented by the team before the release of iOS 11. It includes Drag and Drop, iMessage Live Messages, ARKit, SiriKit and Notifications Privacy. </p><br><p>  Sergey pays special attention to the report Drag and Drop.  And using the example of a case from my application, it shows that it is quite simple to embed it and customize it for your needs. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AvitoTech/ios-11-app-in-the-air-app-in-the-air"><strong>Slides</strong></a> </p><br><h1 id="kupertino-live">  Cupertino live </h1><br><p>  The text translation from the <a href="https://t.me/tolstoylive">Tolstoy Live</a> telegram channel will be updated here too: </p><br><p>  ‚Ä¢ 1:50 PM <br>  Hello!
