  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the information war</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently made my modest contribution to the "first blogger" as I <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2008/08/13/blogs/">wrote to</a> Lenta.ru, describing <a href="https://habr.com/politics/georgian_ossetian_conflict_russian_morality/">my opinion</a> in English to the best of my ability.  Information confrontation - akin to rhetoric and rap.  Serious men from the headquarters of the armed forces naturally spat on public opinion, because the main thing for them is to control their actions.  And in vain, because it can not only limit their capabilities, but also affect the morale (as it was during the first world war with communist leaflets, for example). <br>  Seven types of propaganda: <br><ol><li>  <strong>Emotional appeal</strong> .  It is necessary to create a sense of security, love, happiness in a person, for example, using photographs of such people using the product;  show courage and concern for the people </li><li>  <strong>Motto</strong>  Use the short catchy phrase, slogan, slogan.  We remember both corporate ‚Äúconnecting people‚Äù and ‚Äúwet the toilet‚Äù. </li><li>  <strong>Recognition</strong>  Take a celebrity, Vakhtang Kikabidze, for example, so that he would support the idea or become the face of a revolution / product / idea. </li><li>  <strong>Bus musicians</strong> .  Create a feeling that everyone is doing so - restore territorial integrity or protect their citizens. <br></li><li>  <strong>Cause and effect</strong> .  Drop all other factors and say that - only thanks to this product did you become smarter;  once the skyscraper was blown up, only the terrorists are to blame. </li><li>  <strong>Comparison of opportunities</strong> .  When combined with emotional appeal - a great example when comparing a ‚Äúbad‚Äù detergent powder with a good one.  In our case, it can increase the difference in the strength of armies, in the number of casualties and so on. <br></li><li>  <strong>Character</strong> .  As a rule, a graphic sign or character causing an obvious association, such as in religions. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Psi operations </h3><br>  They pay attention to the thinking processes - it makes you think and get up to a certain point of view not so much on the actual, but on the psychological situation.  The goal is the opinion of leaders and public organizations.  In other words, this is <strong>propaganda</strong> , in fact - an information attack with the ‚Äúright‚Äù entourage. <br>  The role of "TV presenter" in the hostilities of Georgia was carried out directly by Saakashvili <br>  and this is a plus, whereas from the Russian side it was Medvedev, then <br>  Putin, then Lavrov, the military, or Kokoity with Bagapsh, which is natural <br>  made a mess.  Important political speeches should be addressed by addressing the people on the screen, preferably on a stylish background, and not in the office of another minister or at the Echo of Moscow press conference.  In the USA, this is ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù with a glamorous background, even in Estonia there is ‚ÄúStenbocki maja‚Äù. <br>  Georgia mainly focused on the psychological component, while Russia focused on the actual one.  Later there were rumors about Georgia <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2008/08/13/praces/index.htm">using a</a> Belgian PR agency. <br><table width="681"><tbody><tr><td>  Georgia </td><td>  Russia </td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>  Relations with senior officials of different countries </li><li>  Direct contact with CNN, BBC and interviews in English </li><li>  In direct circulation - flags of friendly countries in the background </li><li>  Rally in Tbilisi with loud phrases and popular support <br></li><li>  Support (in words) of Ukraine, the Baltic States, Poland; <br>  Loss of support for Israel, Australia <br></li></ul><br></td><td><ul><li>  UN emergency meeting </li><li>  Losses of more than 1,000 civilians, peacekeepers attacked </li><li>  Support Cuba, Belarus, Kazakhstan </li><li>  Putin spoke about the double standards of the United States </li><li>  Numerous cartoons of Saakashvili and the bear </li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Independent military journalists and operators should not adhere to one or another party to the conflict and should like a red cross <br>  search for the truth and help the victims in the true coverage of events, while not giving out military information about the movements and size of troops, otherwise there is a temptation in falsifying materials or killing people.  Russia lacked this picture significantly, although this resulted in a powerful and swift response. <br><br><h3>  Counter propaganda </h3><br>  Protective actions to refute false, mitigate or neutralize enemy propaganda to reduce the effect on the minds of allies and create the foundations for a response info attack. <br><table width="678"><tbody><tr><td>  Georgia </td><td>  Russia </td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>  The first attack on Tskhinvali was quickly forgotten, and in the Western press the first day got there in the words of Saakashvili as ‚Äúlarge-scale Russian aggression‚Äù <br></li><li>  In response to the genocide, the Ossetians appeared genocide and stripping the Georgians <br></li><li>  Cowardice video of Saakashvili for western audience looked partly proof of the bombing </li><li>  Georgia did not interfere with foreign journalists, while Russia did not let them in - this in turn provided an opportunity for criticism from the Baltic </li><li>  The United States introduced doubt in the objectives of Russia, reducing it to the desire to change the regime of Saakashvili <br></li><li>  The lie about the bombing of the pipeline, about the occupation of Gori, about the movement of a column of tanks on Tbilisi and the Russian shelling of Tskhinvali which he "saw with his own eyes" also gave a psychological edge <br></li></ul><br></td><td><ul><li>  Disproved information on the loss of aircraft, bombing or occupation of cities or ports </li><li>  Human Rights spoke about disinformation </li><li>  Revealing that Saakashvili is lying, including a cease-fire <br></li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãattacks </h3><br>  Sabotage actions to disable the sources of information of the enemy or to intentionally falsify the data transmitted through it <br><table width="677"><tbody><tr><td>  Georgia </td><td>  Russia </td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>  Blocking of all Russian television and .ru domains for the local population </li><li>  Closing an administrative map on Google maps </li><li>  Silencing the connection of the military and replacing them with your own data to entangle the enemy </li><li>  <a href="http://russiatoday.com/news/news/28835">Attack on RussiaToday</a> </li></ul><br></td><td><ul><li>  The attacks on the sites of the President and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia forced those to move to the blogs of Google </li><li>  A flash mob to a CNN poll with a vote of 90% that the operation is peacekeeping </li></ul><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br>  <a href="http://kurapov.name/pholosophica/info_warfare/">Original photo</a>
