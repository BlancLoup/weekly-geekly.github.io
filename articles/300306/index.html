    <h1>  Suggest what you need! </h1><br>  There is always the temptation to offer the buyer the goods "in the load."  Those dear readers who happened to live in the Soviet Union can remember how those who wished to buy the desired ticket to the Mariinsky Theater could offer it only with a ticket for a matinee in a state-of-the-art cultural center, and 56 kilograms of buckwheat for a scarce kilogram  necessarily attached to a ruble or two of old cookies, Friendship cheeses or something else stale. <br><br>  In modern Russia, strange accompanying goods in the online store are more often caused not by the stern intent to free the warehouse from the useless, but by the lack of analytics and the poor imagination of marketers.  Take, for example, a chandelier in a quite nice store of all electrics 220-volt.ru: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d0/7f6/3ae/0d07f63ae42a4575a4c330b5471ee98f.png"><br><br>  And now let's take a look at what is offered to us as related products for it just below on the same page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/038/ca0/362/038ca03625094901b0055bf0da81d7e2.png"><br><br>  Are you kidding?  With one chandelier most often buy other chandeliers, just a little different in design?  Anything can happen (for example, when purchasing goods of a similar design to an apartment during repairs), but here is another block of information below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa0/26d/5b7/fa026d5b754d49149c5489d1fe4041d1.png"><br><br>  Strictly speaking, to me, as a chandelier buyer, this information is useful.  I can think and decide that the chandelier I have chosen is not good enough, to change my mind and buy another one.  The question is, is it profitable for the store?  After all, I can change my mind and choose a cheaper chandelier :) <br><br>  What is really not enough here - these are really useful related products, which an inexperienced buyer might not think about (and then regret it, but could be grateful to the store for good advice).  What goods can be offered along with such a chandelier?  Offer consumables: halogen lamps (you can‚Äôt buy them in a stall around the corner, and buying spares is a reasonable step), fixing to the ceiling (for example, dowels for drywall), wires, a chain (to hang nicely), etc. <br><br>  You remember the anecdote about the genius seller, to whom the man came for a hygienic tampon, and left, buying not only tampons, but also a fishing rod, all other tackles for fishing, suitable equipment and waders, and even a new SUV?  It is important not just to sell what the buyer wants now, it is important to guess why he needed it, and what else might be useful in the near future. <br><br>  Here is an example more complicated: I buy diet food for cats suffering from urolithiasis.  What should I offer instead of the typical related products that almost any online store will show? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ca/ca5/84a/3caca584a5a940939bfeb8859bc19234.png"><br><br>  The canned food option is theoretically not bad if you don‚Äôt take into account that veterinarians do not recommend feeding the pet with food from different manufacturers at the same time, and here it is better to offer canned food of the same brand and model as the dry food. <br><br>  However, a truly cunning seller would suggest this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a5/69d/730/6a569d730f484418b894f33ddee96096.png"><br><br>  Why?  And because if a cat is fed with such a medical food, then the owner often has to collect and carry her urine analysis to the clinic so that the veterinarian can correct the diet in time. <br><br>  What you need to guess about this option?  In principle, it is enough to imagine yourself in the place of the buyer (or live with a cat, which at least once found sand in the bladder).  Conversion of such an offer into purchases could be quite high, since not all cat owners know that such convenient sets have long existed. <br><br>  A good store does not give the buyer unnecessary, a good store unobtrusively advises that he may actually need it.  A large supermarket can build good guesses about useful products for customers based on statistics; a small niche store can outperform it due to better knowledge of customer needs in its niche. <br><br><h1>  Be an expert! </h1><br>  The buyer is often worse than the seller is aware of all the nuances of using what he needed.  For example, earlier in the online store lapsi.ru there was no section ‚Äúwith this product being bought‚Äù at all (and ‚Äúthis will work well for this‚Äù). <br><br>  Now everything is good there, but only 4 years ago, when I bought a lot of things there for a newborn daughter, I was dismayed and perplexed on almost every page. <br><br>  Imagine that a person buys a baby bed for the first time in his life.  Obviously, he needs to immediately offer blankets, pillows and bedding suitable for this particular bed.  And it is clear to the seller that 155x70 is almost the same as 180x75, and one will do the other.  The young father, who must quickly choose a bunch of things for a newborn, and who has never done this, must help with a choice. <br><br><h2>  How a store loses money on unproposed related products </h2><br><br>  I then had to RIDE at Lapsi to talk to the seller personally and understand what to buy.  I spent 4 hours of time, the seller - at least an hour, renting a trading floor also cost the store owners a pretty penny, but all I had to offer on the site was a suitable accompanying product. <br><br>  This would drastically reduce all costs and raise turnover, as it would be easier for people who want to order goods online, and more buyers could be attracted to the sales area, as the seller would not be busy explaining elementary things to young parents. <br><br>  The sales hall would serve more people, the unit cost of goods would decrease, which means prices could be reduced more often during all kinds of actions, and ultimately Lapsi could serve and please many more people and take an even better position in the market. <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  1) It is necessary to offer related products. <br>  2) A related product is something that is beneficial to the customer if he buys the main product.  Spare part, installation tool, necessary accessory or addition (such as bed linen). <br><br>  Please offer related products to help the buyer in his life situation.  Products sell precisely for this, and not because you live on profits from sales.  You can live well only on profits from sales of goods and services that are really necessary for people.  Look on facebook if you don't believe :) <br><br><h1>  Bonus to all who read: offer an instant typical purchase </h1><br>  Example: hvalwaters.ru <br><br>  Great site, everything is super, sells almost the only product: water "Khvalovskaya Premium".  Need exactly one button on the main "Repeat order".  In order not to be mistaken, ask the site developer to use a cookie in order to instantly identify a regular customer.  This is the case when the store always orders the same thing, but at an unpredictable time (unlike cat food, the consumption of which is about the same). <br><br>  Now, to repeat an order on hvalwaters.ru, you just need to re-order, and if there was a button ‚Äúrepeat the previous order‚Äù, there would be no price for such an online store. <br><br><h1>  See you later! </h1><br>  In the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25872/">next article</a> - about how and why minimize communication (or how to spam so that they say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgo to hell!‚Äù) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300306/</a></p>
