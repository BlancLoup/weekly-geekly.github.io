Today we are faced with another feature when registering with this new social network, which must also be taken into account if you do not want your account to be blocked. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Responsibly choose a name.</b> <br><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Oh, how many articles have already been written on the topic of the expediency of reducing the number of required fields in the registration form.  The same is written about how people fill in similar fields with all sorts of special characters or foreign phrases, just because these fields must be filled.  It happened this time.

      Half a year ago, after another problem with The Bat !, I advised my girlfriend to take a closer look at gmail.  She really liked google mail and she decided to register.  In the profile it was necessary to enter the name and surname.  In order not to reveal her real surname, my friend decided to enter just the symbol <b>*</b> .  In sum, the combination of first and last names is <b>Sasha *</b> .  Google is quite satisfied, and even more so.  And the friend joyfully began to comprehend all the possibilities of gmail. <br><br>  Recently, I finally received an invite to a new brainchild of the corporation of good: google + (special thanks for the invites to the tunelix <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/tunelix/" class="user_link">tunelix</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/greenhedgehog/" class="user_link">greenhedgehog</a> ) and I began a thorough study. <br><br>  In general, I have many friends who are far from the IT community, but who are actively interested in modern technology.  Therefore, we really liked the development of google "+1" and its integration into search results.  The idea is remarkable: to somehow highlight in the search results sites that your friends liked.  For example, if you are looking for information about "OOP", then you will surely choose a site that your fellow programmer liked.  It was interesting to learn how google selects such "approved" sites.  We decided to check out by experience. <br><br>  So, we launched the English version of google (in the Russian version, the +1 system is not yet integrated into the search results, at least here), entered a phrase of interest and saw the familiar +1 icon.  Noted several sites. <br><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201107/1a91f8b8ca8daeb2c4cd3a9f159d9ba2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now moved to the account of my girlfriend.  Go to Google and see that absolutely nothing has changed.  Hmm, why?  Perhaps because she has not yet registered with either google + or +1, and therefore has not added me to her ‚Äúcircles‚Äù.  Well, she is already in my ‚Äúcircles‚Äù, so if she puts some +1 on some sites, can then this somehow affect my issue?  We push +1, the standard window about registration necessity gets out.  Well, sign up. <br><br><h4>  And here it all begins. </h4><br>  When registering, google complains about a not quite correct name.  But at the same time, ‚Äúdelicately‚Äù asks if we want to leave the name as such.  Unfortunately, all this happens in the English version of the site, and we, not expecting a dirty trick and freely translating the google warning, agree to continue to use this name.  After that, google simply blocks our account.  Fortunately, blocking does not occur for the entire google account, but only for those services where the profile is actively used.  Mail, documents, calendar remained available.  Google + page now looks much easier than before <br><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201107/44d7da3a5395a5f3caba5ad0c7884420.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It displays a message about blocking the account and a link to the profile. <br><br><img src="http://hostingkartinok.com/image/01201107/30c24dba9f09e8017f84cf545cbb52d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The profile explains that the name violates the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D107107">rules of the community</a> . <br>  Visible this: <br><br><blockquote>  Display Name <br>  In the fight against spam and fake profiles, we recommend using the name that friends, relatives and colleagues usually call you.  For example, if your full name is Alexander Ivanov, abbreviations Sasha and Shurik are also acceptable. <br></blockquote><br><br>  The only strange thing is that they do not prohibit the use of such names, but simply ‚Äú <b>recommend</b> using a name that friends usually call you‚Äù, but they act so harshly.  It is good that there is an opportunity to enter a new name and send a request for verification.  We sent the request today around 15-00, so far there‚Äôs no reaction from google. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The conclusion is very simple: it is necessary to read not only the agreements that you sign, but also the agreements that you accept.  And of course, do everything with what you agreed and signed. <br>  I hope this will help someone not to get into a similar situation.  It is possible when registering at google + itself (and not in the +1 system), everything is different, but we haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, we don‚Äôt have time for invites. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> In the evening, google considered a new name and unlocked an account, further registration with google + went without any problems! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123943/</a></p>
