  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ASC scenario as the basis of timeliness and harmony in business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/348882/">previous article</a> we talked about the market as a stereotype, with respect to a segment, need, and proposal.  An example in this article was the actions of various organizations leading them to the top of the business.  We will return to this conversation, and today we will talk about the timeliness of certain actions. <br><br>  According to the theory of social design, absolutely all social communities (whole industries, business organizations, political parties and even family) that can be presented systemically, pass at least once during their life, through three phases (see fig.) Conventionally called: Morphogenesis, Action, Behavior.  In terms of this process (cycles) is called the ASC scenario ( <i><b>Anthropo-socio-cultural scenario</b></i> ).  Why ASK?  Here we rely on the concepts and works of the American sociologist, <i>Pitirim Sorokin</i> , of Russian origin, the founder of the sociological department of Harvard.  He argued that whenever we are dealing with a social object, we need to think about three subsystems: <b><i>man, culture and structures</i> e.</b> They, interacting in a complex way, generate a completely natural course of events.  The understanding of these cycles, the correct diagnosis of the current situation on this ‚Äúloop of life‚Äù, allows us to apply (develop) timely and adequate steps and strategies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/dw/hd/zadwhddpmgr-liwnkmvfndlxxgi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Anthropo-socio-cultural scenario of life cycles of organizations</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The ASC scenario has three phases: <i>Morphogenesis, Action, Behavior.</i>  In turn, each phase has its own dynamic expression in the form of several stages.

      <u><b>Phase morphogenesis</b></u> <br><br>  The phase is characterized by two stages: <br><br>  <b>Stage 1. <i>Transcendental destruction of the social form</i></b> .  The emergence of new social forms, or the transcendental degeneration of old (degrading) forms and the prospect of the degeneration of the social system.  Proactive people have a clear intention to change their lives, to improve the world, or the understanding that ‚Äúyou cannot continue living like this‚Äù, or ... a dream to get to Mars.  Changes, revolution, reforms - such names will later be given by the history of these events.  Often, as <i>M. Weber</i> showed, the presence of a special will inside an individual can trigger these processes, infecting others.  <i>Karl Marx</i> also spoke about this: <i>‚Äú... the material force must be overturned by the material force;</i>  <i>but theory also becomes a material force as soon as it takes possession of the masses. ‚Äù</i>  To the second stage of this phase we will return ‚Äúas usual‚Äù. <br><br>  <u><b>Phase Action</b></u> <br><br>  Transformation of the transcendental "act" in the "enterprise". <br><br>  Two stages: <br><br>  <b>Step 2. <i>Creation of symbols and meanings</i></b> for the environment, which give meaning to the new, ensuring the birth of a strategic plan and the conquest of supporters.  It was at this stage that <i>Steve Jobs</i> told famous words to <i>PepsiCo</i> president <i>John Scully</i> : <i>‚ÄúDo you want to sell sweetened water all your life or do you want to come with me and try to change the world?‚Äù</i>  <i>Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry</i> gave the best and absolutely accurate description of the necessary actions for this stage <i>:</i> <i><i>‚ÄúIf you want to build a ship, do not encourage people to gather wood, divide labor and give orders, instead, first teach me to yearn for the vast and endless sea.‚Äù</i></i> <br><br>  <b>Stage 3. <i>Action.</i></b>  At this stage, the "case" is developing dynamically.  A strategy is born, the first structures emerge, often spontaneously, not explicitly designed.  Here, as a rule, all founding friends are equal, there is still no clear hierarchy. <br><br>  <u><b>Phase morphogenesis</b></u> <br><br>  <b>Stage 4. <i><i>Morphodesign</i> .</i></b>  The ‚Äúreverse‚Äù stage is the active formation of hidden social forms (‚Äúwithout human participation‚Äù) or the explicit introduction of new forms and structures by the person himself.  Organizational structures created, regulations, organization's culture help it to live and work effectively.  At this stage, common sense works, unnecessary and inefficient regulations, meetings, can be canceled, and the structures are simplified or vice versa, everything is ‚Äúin the mind‚Äù.  At this stage, it seems to the founding fathers that they have found the right form and content, and this will work forever!  But the next phase is inevitable. <br><br>  <u><b>Phase Behavior</b></u> <br><br>  <b>Stage 5 <i>Stagnation</i></b> .  The causes of its occurrence are different, for example, the leader‚Äôs care or fatigue, or his ‚Äústar disease‚Äù.  Or, in the end, people have a long way behind their backs and they want to take a breath, to live peacefully because everything they create works effectively.  Just a couple of years ago, meetings at which important issues of effective work were addressed turned into routine and ritual.  At this stage, the form dominates the content, the strategy is replaced by planning.  Stage difficult for innovations.  Even if a wise strategist noticed and realized this stage and understands what the next stage will be. <br><br>  <b>Stage 6 <i>Degradation</i> .</b>  Through the value crisis, the system is degraded.  The stage is fraught with hasty, and incompetent actions associated with changes, especially to bring everything back, to reanimate old meanings.  It is possible to ‚Äúslip through‚Äù the stage wisely, even at the previous stage having realized what is going on, to say out loud that if we continue, we will suffer a disaster.  But such wisdom is rare.  From here two ways.  The first is to ‚Äúspin‚Äù in the <i>Behavior</i> phase or perform the <i>Transcendental destruction of the social form,</i> giving the organization a second life. <br><br>  It is worth making a small digression.  Life is difficult, and therefore a classic, consistent ‚Äújourney‚Äù along this loop from stage 1 to stage 6 may be rare.  Perhaps conditionally infinite, "wandering" in the <i>phase of behavior</i> or in the <i>phase of</i> <i>action.</i> <br><br>  The most common in our fatherland leap from the 1st stage to the 4th.  For example, we want to change some area of ‚Äã‚Äãour life, starting stage 1 - the <i>Transcendental destruction of the social form</i> .  Next, we ‚Äúskip‚Äù stages 2, 3 and even 4, completely importing them.  Usually this is called ‚Äúusing the experience of civilized countries‚Äù.  But the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, claimed in the last century: ‚Äústructures cannot be imported‚Äù.  But we, as often happens, will know everything on our own experience.  And then it turns out that ‚Äútheir‚Äù experience, for some reason, does not work with us and the situation ‚Äúmoves away‚Äù to the stage of stagnation and degradation. <br><br>  Thus, a full-fledged social system (in our case, an organization) of the 2nd and 3 stages is a necessary condition for its long-term and successful development.  And after going through the whole "loop" and escaping to the second round, the organization becomes a "bat", for which, as you know, "two not broken give." <br><br>  Literature. <br><br>  1.
