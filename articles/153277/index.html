      <i><b>A day later we received answers from the general director of free-lance.ru</b></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Good morning, afternoon, evening. <br><br>  Your decision to change the rules of the project of October 2, 2012 caused a wide public response.  And the audience of the site for the most part asks questions, what exactly this was caused by, and what the administration of the project, headed by V. Voropayev, is counting on, going to such measures. <br><br>  I would like to hear the official position of the administration on a number of questions that are listed below, so that people would have the answers and confidence in choosing their future actions.  The response of the administration will be published in the relevant topic on the site habrahabr.ru and will be presented to its audience, the one in which we hope, Free-lance.ru is also interested. <br><br>  <b>1. Question one.</b>  Of course, such a measure was considered and thought out by the administration of the project.  And certainly it was assumed that the introduction of new rules will cause discontent and outflow of visitors from the site.  Does the company intend to interest the "developed" specialists in using the services of free-lance.ru and how? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> Naturally, we are interested in all those who "left" or left with Free-lance.ru returned.  We want to try to do this by customers.  If we succeed, I will be glad to see everyone again. <br><br>  <b>2. The second question is directly related to the first.</b>  New tough restrictions in the eyes of the majority look like ‚Äúextortion‚Äù on the part of the administration of the project.  Including thanks to the comment of the CEO on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vasily.voropaev.9/posts/391076897630482">facebook</a> page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93c/91b/fb1/93c91bfb140bd0c97c62575d8c79abdb.png" alt="image">  . <br><br>  What is actually happening and what caused such tightening of the rules? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> Arrange in the order it seems to you to be correct: <br>  but.  We want a different (not the same as before October 2) Free-Market market in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet; <br>  b.  We want to earn in this market. <br><br>  <b>3. The third question.</b>  Your statement in the pop-up modal window that ‚Äúall messages will be moderated‚Äù does not go in any way contrary to the articles of the constitution on the right to private correspondence ( <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-4.htm">article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation</a> )? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V.:</b> I am not a lawyer.  Not ready to comment on this issue with the details that you seem to want.  Since we did it, it means that our lawyers said that it does not go to the angle. <br><br>  <b>4. The next question.</b>  The introduction of such measures was approved by the Board of Shareholders or were these actions of Vasopayev Vasily? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> I will not comment on our internal kitchen, apparently, someone else can do it for me. <br><br>  All shareholders knew and know what we are doing, how we are doing and why we are doing, and also why we are doing it now, and not a year ago.  I admit that some details of this or that service could have been missed / unaware / unwilling to know / others, but they knew everything globally, maintained the general line and even tried to advise how to do better or worse. <br><br>  On my application, if this does not suit you, work this way and not, I was told no, we continue to work with you. <br><br>  <b>5. Another question after the previous one.</b>  In February 2012, at the initiation of A. Mazhirin, the board of shareholders of Free-lance.ru was convened at which the initiator raised questions on a number of actions by the current CEO, asking him to reconsider his powers in view of a number of circumstances set out in the meeting agenda ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153085/">link</a> ).  The opinion was born today that the tightening of rules was caused by the desire of the current CEO to collect funds before quarterly payments to acquire a controlling stake in the company.  Do these guesses have anything to do with reality?  Or, according to the other half of the audience, are these actions directed by shareholders against the current CEO? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> No, they have no such guesswork (I would call it a different, tougher word, but ok ...) nothing in common with reality. <br><br>  If the second question sounds like that SD was intended to dislodge me from the DG.  My opinion is yes. <br><br>  <b>6. Such a question.</b>  In the light of changes in the free-lance.ru policy, the IT community is actively discussing possible places to earn money outside of your company.  At the moment, competitors are already responding (for example, Elance.com plans to Russify its interface to attract Russian-speaking audiences) and even start-ups are emerging (for example, the website <a href="http://www.freelansim.ru/">www.freelansim.ru</a> launched by Thematic Media).  What does the project administration think about this and what will be its actions? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> I am very glad that we have attracted so much attention to the market of Free-Lance.  If someone succeeds in doing something better than us, for the market it will be only a big plus.  I am for competition.  If we do not survive in this competition, it means a penny for us. <br><br>  <b>7. Seventh question.</b>  According to the initial reaction of users and their actions (in the last 24 hours, many accounts have become unavailable), the administration of Free-lance.ru can already predict some indicators of future conversions.  How optimistic are these figures for your company's calculations and will any adjustments be made to the stated policy based on this initial reaction? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> Forecasts, so far, are not ready to give any.  Adjustments to processes, including business processes, are being introduced continuously and we will continue to enter.  Everything you see is not the latest / final version of the product. <br><br>  <b>8. The question is somewhat technical and legal.</b>  Using simple utilities, you can ignore the pop-up window with the requirement to accept the new rules and continue to use the site.  Anyway, for now.  That is, from a legal point of view, the user did not consent to the moderation of his private messages.  In this case, is the moderation of the messages of users who do not agree with the new conditions?  If so, what is the rationale for these actions?  And will more serious technical measures be introduced to restrict users to use the resource? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V.:</b> Yes, the moderation is carried out all the content, but not personal messages, and the service, which allows you to discuss the project.  Justification - PS.Pro more serious methods ... If you're talking about how to bypass the system - of course.  If you are talking about the introduction of some new revolutionary ideas / services / something else, then in the near future, there will be no such thing.  Only the development of the service of the RRF and other services on Free-lance.ru. <br><br>  <b>9. Question</b> .  After the information that the CEO with the old version of the rules received 600 thousand salaries per month (and by the way, rubles or dollars?), What would be his salary with the new version of the rules?  Because in the eyes of freelancers, the amount of 600 thousand even rubles is a very substantial amount, which 5-7 cool programmers can work for a month, which can contribute to the development of the project quite significantly.  Hence the question, if the actions of the project administration are aimed at extracting greater benefits, to which it will be redistributed?  In the improvement of services or in the salary of the CEO? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> Thank you for your question, but I will leave it without comments.  Since someone‚Äôs salary is not a public matter, in this company, and in the improvement of services we reinvest 100 percent of our profits. <br><br>  <b>10. Serious question.</b>  As a service Free-lance.ru with its official right to read private correspondence, it can guarantee project users that confidential data on business correspondence received by moderators, administrators and other staff will not be used for other purposes.  For example, to create competitive offers to customers from studios or industries owned by the administration or shareholders of the company?  For the forced regulation of price policy (using manipulations with service percentages or price dumping)? <br><br>  <b>Voropaev V .:</b> Guaranteed by a contract that each user has signed with Free-lance.ru. <br><br>  <b>11. Another question</b> .  How can your company guarantee the integrity of all transactions taking place within your exchange?  After all, the company's arbitration operates within a commercial, rather than a state structure.  And according to the constitution of the Russian Federation, only the state judicial machinery can make regulatory decisions in contentious situations.  On what legal grounds, like pillars, will the company rely on in rendering verdicts on disputes between the customer and the performer, assuming the role of judges and to what extent is this reasoned and supported (licensed) from a legal point of view? <br><br>  <b>Voropayev V .:</b> We do not assume the role of judges. <br><br>  <b>12. And the last question:</b> Does your company plan to toughen any other measures to work with your services and which ones? <br><br>  <b>Voropaev V.:</b> In the near (yes, it seems, and not in the near) time, no. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD 10:14 3.10.12</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  After sending the application, letters come from them and you can correspond. <br>  Just sent them this message: <br><blockquote> Thank you for accepting the application. <br>  We, in turn, would like to receive answers to the questions posed. <br>  And we rightly believe that since you are interested in us as employers, it would be a good thing to inform us on your part. <br><br>  Link to the open publication of the interview.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153277/">habrahabr.ru/post/153277/#comments</a> <br>  Material received from you will be stated "as is" without corrections. </blockquote></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD 16:04 03.10.12</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Vasily Voropayev's statement is not for us <br>  <a href="http://www.roem.ru/2012/10/03/addednews55046/%3Fc">www.roem.ru/2012/10/03/addednews55046/?c#message143901</a> <blockquote>  Yesterday, October 2, we completely changed the market of free-lance in Russia, making it stable and safe.  Naturally, we expected the reaction of our users, including the negative one.  Any fundamental changes always cause fear and distrust. <br><br>  However, even I was surprised by the close attention to updates both from the media, bloggers, users of social networks, and from former friends and partners.  Yesterday our site traffic went off scale, and it was subjected to the strongest ddos ‚Äã‚Äãattack.  Our account on habrahabr was hacked by someone, as a result of which a letter appeared on the network by Anton Mazhirin, which he sent to the shareholders of Free-lance.ru in February of this year.  I do not want to discuss the motives that prompted Anton to write this letter then, and the fact and the reasons for his appearance on the network now.  It‚Äôs wrong to mix business and personal relationships, I learned this lesson a long time ago. <br><br>  Despite all the difficulties that we have encountered and continue to face, the new business model Free-lance.ru and the new model of the relationship of free-lancers and customers in Russia have already shown themselves as successful.  The site constantly concludes new ‚ÄúTransactions Without Risk‚Äù, and their number is growing.  I am sincerely convinced that many of the users who are now outraged by the innovations will return to the site within a month and will work comfortably, comfortably and safely. <br><br>  Vasily Voropaev </blockquote><br><br>  <i><b>From the answer given by Voropayev V. we see several answers to questions.</b></i>  <i><b>But as usual, not all.</b></i>  <i><b>And judging by the fact that the working day is nearing its end, we are unlikely to be honored with an answer.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>Special thanks, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/donkeyhot/" class="user_link">DonkeyHot</a> who found this stuff.</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> </div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD 18:00 03.10.12</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Apparently this is the only answer we will get.  The general director of free-lance.ru has unsubscribed on his project as follows: <blockquote>  I see on the network a lot of questions and requests to me personally. <br><br>  Naturally, I am not ready to give answers somewhere, and, moreover, I am not ready to give answers to anonymous authors. <br><br>  Therefore, I propose respectfully (it is this resource that we are building for all 7 years) that treats each other and ask me your question here. <br><br>  Please, before asking a question, read our answers here: Answers to frequently asked questions about the new ‚ÄúDeal Without Risk‚Äù <br><br>  As for the further development of the company, the SBR was our priority, which means that we will continue to develop the company (Free-lance.ru website) without scams and is transparent in this direction.  In the near future we do not plan any fundamental and fundamental changes in the development of the site - we will follow the intended path and improve the quality of the RRF. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/commune/klanyi/1008/nash-nekorporativnyiy-blog/2364019/otvetyi.html">www.free-lance.ru/commune/klanyi/1008/nash-nekorporativnyiy-blog/2364019/otvetyi.html</a> <br><br>  For example, a question from one of the users: <blockquote>  1. Will ‚Äústrong payment‚Äù accounts be introduced by freelancers and employers in whom contacts would be visible?  If yes - when? <br><br>  2. Will open the official.  representative offices of "Vahan" in the CIS countries, in particular, in Ukraine?  If yes - when? <br><br>  3. As a customer, to give me a link to a style sample, in which an illustration or a site is required BEFORE SBR to understand.  will we work at all, because links are prohibited?  Attach is not always possible. <br><br>  Sincerely, Larissa. </blockquote><br>  And Basil's answer: <blockquote>  1. Not ready to answer this question.  We are discussing different options for development. <br><br>  2. We think about it.  No deadlines. <br><br>  3. It is possible and passes moderation. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>Total.</b>  <b>We won't get any specifics.</b>  <b>In this topic there are questions akin to "but will there be any specifics."</b>  <b>Vasily bypasses such questions.</b> </div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD 21:47 10/03/12</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  No serious question, as expected Voropayev did not give an answer.  Uncomfortable questions for him, he did not notice.  But nevertheless he gave answers to some questions, though extremely blurry.  But as it is now accepted to say "they characterize, as it were." <br><br>  <b>Dialogue between free-lance users and V. Voropayev</b> <br><br>  Further presentation in the form of a dialogue: <br><br>  <b>User:</b> As already mentioned, it is far from always possible to discuss with the customer everything in writing to decide on cooperation, many of them are not used to express their thoughts in writing, especially when it comes to a field that is far from them.  Then the decision on cooperation is made after telephone conversations.  Now, in order to be able to fully and comprehensively discuss the transaction, both parties must pretend that they are already cooperating and the customer is obliged to pay the entire amount for this project.  But often it is at the stage of telephone conversations that it turns out that it is not worth taking on a project, but what about the new rules?  If after, when communicating in Skype, phone, mail, it turns out that the project is much more complicated or confusing than the customer stated at the beginning and he himself at that time did not know about it?  The contractor is now obliged to work out or you can back up and after the decision of the arbitration the customer can finally get their money?  Outraged by the resource, the performer and in general?) <br>  <b>Voropaev V.:</b> a.  We conclude a deal for a minimum and change contacts;  b.  there will be video and audio in the "Discussions";  at.  we understand right now what else we can offer to solve this moment;  d. The Contractor may refuse the RRF at any step and the Customer will receive their money back; <br>  P .: a.  We conclude a deal for a minimum and change contacts; <br>  Those.  Did you now allow gray work schemes with this message? <br>  Well, it has the right to exist ... <br><br>  <i><b>No answer...</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Personal messages are no longer personal, but a place to discuss projects.  But at the same time, the freelancer with the freelancer continues to be friends outside of work, because they are not connected by business relations.  And the time comes when you want with a new friend to go on Skype, soap, and not only.  But now it is impossible.  Do you plan to somehow eliminate this side effect and restore justice? <br>  W . <b>:</b> This effect is resolved to us by Facebook and VKontakte; <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> New conditions of the RRF are a wonderful innovation, while the elimination of contacts caused a real storm of emotions.  Customers coming from the side and far from our site, who, without going into details, searched for the executor and left (and these were often the most expensive and serious customers), are now forced to learn the rules, deal with the interface, experience some inconvenience of technical and pay for it 7%.  Or, alternatively, look for the performer you like through search engines, spending the extra 5 minutes, and making a deal with him in the old fashioned way. <br>  The performers themselves, who worked for many years in free flight, are also not morally ready for change, especially since they will clearly reduce the number of customers.  But, by leaving contacts alone and removing recommendations, it was possible to make a new SBR a hit of the season.  First, the simplicity of its use would invariably serve all those who came after the elimination of reviews, a smart tool for promotion and would save them from scammers.  Starting with small orders, they would gradually gain solid ratings and recommendations, pushing the current TOP.  And we, the inhabitants of the first pages, after them would have to take up the SBR, so as not to give up the position.  And the number of reviews is a gambling and competitive business :)) To whom such a scheme would prevent to live?  We have thousands of offended users who are robbed of their usual working rhythm, well-established way of life and who once again show that they are a dummy whose opinion is not taken into account.  Once came to the site, if you please eat what they give)) Of course, paying a resource is sacred.  But to expect that 10% of the profits will go to the site's piggy bank for each transaction is ridiculous, because customers will quickly adjust, if they wish, under the RRF, as they are able to contact the executor on the test project, and then prefer to conduct business outside the site.  Why not listen to the voice of the people, which this time will definitely not subside, as before? <br>  W . <b>:</b> We will not remove previously supplied reviews.  Such a thought was never.  We discussed a lot of developments, but focused on the experience of our English-speaking colleagues. <br><br>  <b>P.:</b> How does a text in a profile like ‚ÄúYou will easily find me on the Internet by my name‚Äù violates the new rules of the site? <br>  <b>W .:</b> We prohibit this text.  If literally this is not in the rules, then we will fix it. <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> I feel that we mean our answers, not our questions and their answers.  The administration continues to be silent.  Why then was to create another topic? <br>  W . <b>: I will</b> personally comment on you so that you do not doubt. <br><br>  <i><b>But the author did not get the answer.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Will ‚Äústrong payment‚Äù accounts be introduced by freelancers and employers who would see contacts?  If yes - when? <br>  <b>W .:</b> Not ready to answer this question.  We are discussing different options for development. <br><br>  <i><b>That is, we kind of hint.</b></i>  <i><b>Spin dough does not end there.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Will there be any officers open?  representative offices of "Vahan" in the CIS countries, in particular, in Ukraine?  If yes - when? <br>  W . <b>:</b> We think about it.  No deadlines. <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> As a customer, give me a link to a style sample, in which you need an illustration or a site BEFORE SBR to understand.  will we work at all, because links are prohibited?  Attach is not always possible. <br>  W . <b>:</b> This is possible and passes moderation. <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Is there a feeling that reading personal information on the site violates not only the laws of the Russian Federation, but from a purely ethical point of view is simply ugly?  Although, I understand, otherwise, according to your scheme for transfer to the RRF, Vasily, another option is impossible. <br>  W . <b>:</b> answered below. <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> How do you explain the violation of the constitutions of the Russian Federation and Ukraine about the secret of correspondence? !!!  And in fact, the correspondence between the customer and the performer is a commercial secret! <br>  W . <b>:</b> We do not have personal correspondence, we have two tools so that you can discuss the project with the customer.  One is inside the project, the other is in the Message service. <br>  <b>P .:</b> Does business correspondence need no privacy? <br><br>  <i><b>No answer</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .: To</b> what extent is such a rigid transfer of users to the white scheme? <br>  <b>W .:</b> Marina, I do not understand the question.  What does it mean "how much is due."  Rephrase, please. <br><br>  <i><b>I do not understand what's incomprehensible.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> When considering conflicts over the RRF, there is an arbitration commission, but, as one user responded, the composition of the arbitration commission was not disclosed.  In this case, isn‚Äôt the propaganda transparency of work broken by you?  Who confirms the qualification of arbitration?  Simply put, who will check the verifier? <br>  <b>W .:</b> Well, yes, I am not ready to provide full name and passport data, even my own.  In the same way, I am not ready to disclose any data of people who work with me. <br>  <b>P .:</b> Passport information is not needed, but if you get access to the name of the artist and the customer, do you not have the right to know who is on the arbitration commission?  Or, let's say, who can guarantee the professionalism and competence of the commission? <br><br>  <i><b>Again without an answer</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Is it planned to reduce the percentage of the SBS?  10% is a high percentage. <br>  <b>B.: The</b> percentage of the Employer - 7, the percentage of the Contractor from 3, depending on the method of withdrawal. <br><br>  <i><b>He pretended not to understand the question.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Quote: <br>  Naturally, I am not ready to give answers somewhere, and, moreover, I am not ready to give answers to anonymous authors. <br>  Why natural?  You are confused only by the anonymity of users who ask questions, or just prefer to play only by their own rules and on their territory? <br>  <b>W .:</b> For one reason only.  Here I see with whom I speak.  If I could see it in another territory - approx. <br><br>  <i>IMHO: Because Vasya can ban you here.</i>  <i>Because here Vasya is sure that he is not from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</i>  <i>Because here Vasya if suddenly that, he can correct his answers or even (!) Questions.</i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Freelance became a fully paid project. <br>  For the publication of the project "in the office" was paid <br>  Contacts are hidden, it is not convenient to communicate only on freelance!  you do not have video and audio communications, everyone has Skype as well as mail with a cell phone.  In vain you have banned the publication of contact information.  This way you will give even more chances to scammers! <br>  not everyone will agree to work through the Security Service since you do not take a small percentage, but everyone always wants cheaper. <br>  <b>W .:</b> If you want to work with a scammer, yes, we will not succeed. <br>  Video, audio will be.  What to do with contacts - we think.  Right now, contacts can be exchanged, concluding the RRF at a minimum <br><br>  <b>P.:</b> Why, sorry for the naive question, I cannot give a colleague a link to a useful resource that does not compete with this exchange? <br>  How can a freelancer understand if he should start a specific project without first discussing the details?  You know perfectly well that many customers are in the habit of showing a link and saying ‚ÄúI want it here.‚Äù <br>  And don't you really care that the Free-Lan team has become a Zonder team ??? <br>  <b>W .:</b> Elena, if the link is required to discuss the project - it is being moderated. <br><br>  <i><b>And again Vasya pretended not to understand the question.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P.:</b> Vasily, why did you allow information on your salary to come up on the net?  I didn‚Äôt want to count other people's money.  And they impose on me.  Here it is. <br>  But seriously, how will contests be held now?  If, according to the SBS systems, then it is necessary to demand the RESERVATION on the website of the entire prize fund from the customer immediately after the TK contest is attached, and this fund is obtained, at least partially, to someone.  Warranties - so guarantees, but not snot on a plate. <br>  <b>W .:</b> Unfortunately, I do not control the head of other people, so this information has surfaced. <br>  Contests will be through the SBR.  Do not have time to October 2. <br><br>  <i><b>Unfortunately!?..</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Suppose ... I organized the RRF.  All agreed, the funds froze, etc.  The performer in the middle says: ‚ÄúI'm tired, I'm leaving.  I can not do anything.  I will sign everything.  Your truth.  Sorry. " <br>  Two questions: <br>  1. How to quickly get my money back? <br>  2. Commission already lost? <br>  Thank! <br>  <b>V.:</b> 1. According to the contract, there are all the terms.  As I recall, this is the next day, after the performer signed a ‚Äúwaiver‚Äù. <br>  2. We will take the percentage of the Employer in any case.  This is a payment for working with the RRF service.  Including the guarantee of the refund of your money to you. <br><br>  <i><b>Basil, you were told that you are very greedy?</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> ‚ÄúVasily Voropayev, CEO of Free-lance.ru, is ready to answer all your questions personally.‚Äù <br>  Why did you not answer so one question?  Why is Ira Kotova [Djeid] responsible for you, and not you personally? <br>  Specifically the question: What can you answer about: ‚Äú2.  Everyone has the right to confidentiality of correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other communications.  Restriction of this right is allowed only on the basis of a court decision. ‚ÄùI wrote this question to the support service yesterday, but no one answered me so. <br>  Dear Vasily Voropayev, I am waiting for an answer personally from you.  Ignoring the issue will mean as false information provided by the administration and not the ability to keep their promises. <br>  <b>W .:</b> Mikhail, try changing the tone and not setting a condition.  If Ira answers any questions, it means that she is easier and faster to do it.  I subscribe to each of her letters. <br>  I just for the right that you write.  I do not climb into your correspondence and so on, we have a discussion of the conditions of the projects.  We do not have a social network, but a professional resource. <br>  <b>P .:</b> In contacts there can be any information related to my professional activity. <br>  I do not understand your example, comparison with the social.  network, what was it all about? <br>  You openly violate the laws of Russia, not only violating the ‚Äúsecret of correspondence‚Äù, but consider yourself entitled to moderate them. <br>  <b>P .:</b> Vasily, the secret of business correspondence is also protected by law, which does not specify the nature of this correspondence itself.  ANY correspondence is not subject to review by third parties without the consent of the parties.  And some actions can be qualified as coercion to consent, after which consent can be considered invalid (as given under duress). <br>  <b>P .:</b> I agree with Mikhail, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt climb into your correspondence‚Äù you personally do not have any questions, but the moderators climb, I don‚Äôt want my personal messages to read, because  there may be information that should not be shown to third parties, you are violating the law on correspondence. <br>  Article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation <br>  1. Everyone has the right to privacy, personal and family secrets, protection of his honor and good name. <br>  2. Everyone has the right to confidentiality of correspondence, telephone conversations, <br>  postal, telegraph and other messages.  Restriction of this right <br>  allowed only on the basis of a court decision. <br><br>  <i><b>No answer...</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> Will there be a high-paying ‚Äúwhite account‚Äù with contacts? <br>  Provided, if the user provides data on the state registration of IP, or LLC for example? <br>  <b>W .:</b> We just now understand what to do with this moment.  That's right super-pro with contacts - not sure.  But we will do something.  This is a development.  The closest. <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> What should be done if the project cost estimate is impossible without personal contact with the customer?  Examples can cite a lot.  In some implementations, this is in principle not realistic (landscape design, for example, requires orientation to the terrain BEFORE project evaluation in 100% of cases). <br>  <b>B.:</b> If the TK requires a link - you can give it and it will pass moderation.  b.  You can conclude the RRF for a minimum amount and exchange contacts inside. <br><br>  <i><b>Money, money, money ... Vasya had a loft torn off on the basis of money.</b></i>  <i><b>Sorry for the metaphors.</b></i> <br><br>  <b>P .:</b> How do you intend to guarantee customers the preservation of their trade secrets?  As you generally explain to the customer (serious, large, you are oriented towards them), that he must place confidential information on display to unidentified persons.           ?     ? <br> <b>.:</b>    ,   .
