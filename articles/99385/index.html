  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two stories about bank cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now I have two cars.  Two only for the reason that the process of repairing a car at the expense of an insurance company is not the greatest pleasure for an insurance company.  Probably even the biggest displeasure, since the contract stipulates that the time period for consideration of an application in a CASCO case is twenty working days from the date of the last document. <br><br>  Only when I heard this, I realized that I had to get out: it was necessary to deliver the goods, the goods often weigh a lot.  That bought an old Volkswagen Golf - for a half thousand killed raccoons.  Second car  Unscrew. <br><br>  But the story acquired another shade when I requested to compensate me for the evacuation of the car from the scene of the accident - more than 400 kilometers from Moscow.  True, not the entire amount, but only part of it - in the amount established by the contract.  Well, let it be, I thought, and agreed to part of the amount.  The manager pulled another sheet of paper out of the printer.  It turned out that it is necessary to fill out a questionnaire from a pile of points for issuing a bank card. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then I thought: what will happen next? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suppose I now take the time to fill out this form.  Somewhere in the shadow of the questionnaire there is an agreement with a bank in which anything can be written.  And this ‚Äúanything‚Äù can then emerge and emerge at the wrong moment.  Plus, for sure the bank will demand in one way or another a percentage of the cashing in the amount. <br><br>  In general, I said that I want cash.  Then another piece of paper appeared.  This time under the heading "Statement".  Cash withdrawal application.  I also refused to fill it, already a little oshalev from what is happening.  Like, getting money is my right.  Insurance must satisfy my right.  Moreover, the insurance has no right to oblige me to get involved with unnecessary organizations, be it banks or anyone else.  And since it is not stipulated in the contract that I have to fill out an application, I will not.  "As you wish, but you must give me the money, but how is your business." <br><br>  Another manager emerged from the depths of the office and did not start me in the most polite way, saying that I did not take a bank card, was causing a lot of problems, and it was established by law that I should take the card.  ‚ÄúShow me such a law,‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúThen I will believe.‚Äù  There was no law at hand, and I went home. <br><br>  Two weeks later they called me and said that I could drive up and pick up the money.  Since I had to go in that direction anyway, I agreed and took the money.  Until now, I am wondering what would have happened if I had rested and requested to deliver money to me at a convenient time for me? <br><br>  In the evening, I remembered another story.  This time related to salary. <br><br>  Several years ago I worked at the institute as a teacher at half the rate.  Conducted higher mathematics and received a small, but still money in the cash register of the institute in cash.  Suddenly, something at the top tensed up, scratched and decided to introduce payroll cards. <br><br>  Cards issued to all, promising zero percent when receiving money.  A month passed, the salary was credited to the card.  I went to the ATM, inserted the card and looked at the amount.  He took off a couple of thousand, then looked again at the amount, on the check, again on the amount.  Like a bull on a red rag. <br><br>  It was easy for me to calculate in my mind that tsiferki do not add up.  However, on the check issued by the ‚Äúsmart machine‚Äù was written ‚ÄúPercentage: 0‚Äù. <br><br>  I went to the bank, expressed displeasure, made a statement, set forth a demand to return the taken dishonestly, then another statement - that I refuse the card. <br><br>  It cost me half an hour to return to the department, rode a delegate from the top.  He said that he was thinking about me.  I, who had nothing to lose, politely expressed once again the desire to receive an envelope with my name on it as before. <br><br>  At the evening seating of the department with teas and bagels told the story to the other teachers.  Those, too, are not completely bogus, and are more familiar with math than mine ‚Äî they were stunned. <br><br>  A month later, at the checkout, familiar envelopes were already being issued - the rank and no commission. <br><br>  And now, I think, why do we need these cards at all?  When you go, say, abroad, the map is, of course, convenient to have.  But not instead of cash, but in addition to it.  As the equivalent of "traveller's check" or "nyski for a rainy day."  But why do we need maps in the situations I have mentioned?  Is that so that our money, transferring them from the real to the virtual state, someone could profit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99385/</a></p>
