  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Installing vmware tools for debian 8 in a virtual machine [manual]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With a full debian installation in VMWare, I had a constant confusion because  I have never had a vmware tools installed without a file until the end.  Maybe my hands are not the same, I will not argue - with Linux, I'm still not on you.  Recently a new version of debian was released and, on the second day after the official release, I made an willful decision to transfer my virtual servers organizing FTP / SFTP servers from WindowsXP to Linux.  Then a new version of VMWare 11, a new version of tools, debian 8 testing, was used by the people for a long time, and I decided that everything should be smooth and I would have to try and understand the proftpd settings.  After installing and configuring debian 8, I decided to install the vmware tools and thus complete the initial phase - the preparation of the base machine.  And what do you think?  VMware tools got crooked ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This blatant fact did not leave me indifferent. So how much is already possible?  For example, I started Gnome3 on debian 7 only in an alternative mode and it didn‚Äôt work to properly install drivers for video and / or enable 3D support.  I remember some time spent on finding solutions and testing proposals for self-assembly, but it did not bring me success, and I abandoned this case, especially since it did not interfere with my work.  But there was a feeling of incomplete work. <br><br>  And here, again something is not right.  GUI earned initially normal.  I even really liked Gnome3 after setting (setting via gnome-tweak-tool + extension: Lock keys, Remove dropdown arrows).  Tulsa put almost normal.  But ultimately, we do not get support for Shared Folders.  It's sad because  Such a mechanism is convenient: we connect folders in the virtual settings, they are automatically mounted in / mnt / hgfs /.  And do not bother with sharing folders on the network in the host machine.  But after installing the tools, we get a non-working module vmhgfs.  I did not find a solution in runet, but I remember I found how to solve the problem in some English-speaking forum.  All this action took place on April 26-28.  I was surprised when yesterday an acquaintance contacted me and complained that I could not configure the Vmvarov network in the virtual machine with the new debian.  And I decided to write a manual to a friend, having issued it in the form of an article on Habr√© - suddenly someone else will come in handy! <br><br>  So how to install the tools. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      To begin with, we install the necessary packages for assembling tools (this stretches from prehistoric times, otherwise there is a risk that nothing will normally gather): <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) make gcc</code> </pre> <br><br>  If you further perform the installation of standard tools from the delivery of VMWare: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">mount the VMware tools cdrom and install VMware Tools sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom tar xvzf /media/cdrom/VMwareTools-9.9.2-2496486.tar.gz <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> vmware-tools-distrib sudo ./vmware-install.pl -d</code> </pre><br><br>  Then after rebooting, we get a non-working vmhgfs module.  I quote the end of the installation log: <br><br><blockquote>  /usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-4-common/scripts/Makefile.build:262: Recipe execution error for the target "/tmp/modconfig-zqp0EX/vmhgfs-only/inode.o" <br>  make [4]: ‚Äã‚Äã*** [/tmp/modconfig-zqp0EX/vmhgfs-only/inode.o] Error 1 <br>  make [4]: ‚Äã‚Äã*** Waiting for task completion ... <br>  /usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-4-common/Makefile:1350: Recipe execution error for target "_module_ / tmp / modconfig-zqp0EX / vmhgfs-only" <br>  make [3]: *** [_module_ / tmp / modconfig-zqp0EX / vmhgfs-only] Error 2 <br>  Makefile: 181: recipe execution error for sub-make target <br>  make [2]: *** [sub-make] Error 2 <br>  Makefile: 8: recipe execution error for "all" target <br>  make [1]: *** [all] Error 2 <br>  make [1]: exit directory "/usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-4-amd64" <br>  Makefile: 120: Recipe runtime error for vmhgfs.ko target <br>  make: *** [vmhgfs.ko] Error 2 <br>  make: exit from the / tmp / modconfig-zqp0EX / vmhgfs-only directory <br><br>  The filesystem driver (vmhgfs module) is used only for the shared folder <br>  feature.  VMware Tools is designed to work <br>  independently of this feature. <br><br>  You can install the driver by feature <br>  running vmware-config-tools.pl again after making sure that gcc, binutils, make <br>  sources for your running kernel are installed on your machine. <br>  These packages are available on your distribution CD installation. </blockquote><br><br>  To eliminate this sad problem, you need to perform a series of actions to replace d_alias with d_u.d_alias in the vmhgfs package: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/bin/sh -x cd /usr/lib/vmware-tools/modules/source tar xf vmhgfs.tar grep -q d_u.d_alias vmhgfs-only/inode.c &amp;&amp; echo "already patched" &amp;&amp; exit 0 sed -i -es/d_alias/d_u.d_alias/ vmhgfs-only/inode.c cp -p vmhgfs.tar vmhgfs.tar.orig tar cf vmhgfs.tar vmhgfs-only vmware-config-tools.pl -d -m</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  After that, the Shared Folders functionality from VMWare will start to work normally - the connected folders will appear in the virtual machine settings in the / mnt / ngfs folder. <br>  NOTE: this method is incompatible with earlier versions of the kernel (below 3.13.0-45) !!! <br><br>  After these corrections, I collected the tools back into the archive, from which you can now install tuzles without bothering with additional steps to replace d_alias with d_u.d_alias.  If someone needs me, I can upload a file.  Just tell me where, the file weighs 178Mb, I would like to upload it to some kind of file hosting without registration and other troubles, so that he would lie there for a year or two at least. <br><br>  For the sake of justice, I think it should be noted that not only on the tools from vmware did the light come together.  There is a wonderful <a href="https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools">open-vm-tools</a> project.  The package, however, has not been updated for a long time, but at one time I was quite successful with them and everything always worked right there.  Also open. <br><br>  Also kind people suggest that there is still a convenient set of <a href="https://github.com/rasa/vmware-tools-patches">vmware-tools-patches</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259749/</a></p>
