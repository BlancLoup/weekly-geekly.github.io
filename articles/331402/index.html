One of the promises of the article: "This is something very boring and very scary." <br><br>  For me, as an entrepreneur, it is important to solve 2 tasks with the help of an accountant: to ensure correct processing of financial documents and to minimize taxation. <br><br>  For the second task, I tried several times to get an accountant to answer the question: what amount do I need to put in the contract price (for example, to develop the site), so that there would be 6% for USN allocations?  Given that the variation in the number of contracts and their values ‚Äã‚Äãmay change during the year.

      In the end, after an hour of conversation, I was faced with an absolute lack of understanding of the essence of my question.  Those.  people just didn‚Äôt drive in what I‚Äôm asking, although the only time they gave me a sensible answer was that it‚Äôs a management accounting task, not an accounting department. <br><br>  In my opinion, this is the wrong answer.  A good specialist should have knowledge beyond the scope of his profession.  For example, a designer must know the basics of typesetting in order to make work with his layout comfortable for his colleague. <br><br>  The same should be with accounting.  Consultations on cost minimization should be!  Let's return to the sites of accounting services companies. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This concerns not only the accounting department, but also the service sector as a whole, where a large role is played by the qualifications of the company and its employees.  For example, websites about Internet advertising in the total mass in terms of quality and simplicity are noticeably better than those of the same accounting services.  Because the owners of this business teach their managers to speak in a simple language that the client understands.  Without specific terms, translating from advertising language to human. <br><br>  What prevents accounting companies on the fingers to explain why you should contact this company?  Show that here you will be met not by ‚Äúwomen in years, retrogrades‚Äù, but by modern people who will help you solve your problems. <br><br>  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  For our existing clients, in some cases, specialists were able to reduce the amount of taxes by 15% with white methods; </li><li>  When calculating the total amount saved, we got about 10,000,000 over 3 years of work; </li><li>  Trial period first month - 50% of the full cost of the service is taken; </li><li>  Check the accounting of the previous artist - free of charge for the current year; </li><li>  We ourselves communicate with tax and extrabudgetary funds and ‚Äútake a hit‚Äù so that our players do their work, and not with paperwork; </li><li>  Transparent pricing and clear tariff plans, which take into account the number of documents processed; </li><li>  Perform urgent work for new customers; </li><li>  Finally, the calculator calculating the USN. </li></ul><br>  About the calculator it makes sense to say separately.  In the issuance of mass sites on request " <a href="https://yandex.ru/search/%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%2520%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%26lr%3D213">calculator usn</a> ." <br><br>  And the demand for this information is also noticeable (which means that such a tool will give additional traffic for the site): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f60/a5a/889/f60a5a889e274f5791fa88c628b00730.png"><br><br>  What came up to me, I found <a href="http://www.buh4biz.ru/calc-usn">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4d4/f20/d31/4d4f20d314b3438ea15ae6af6037912c.png"><br><br>  Spent about 30 minutes searching.  It was possible, of course, to write oneself, but I wanted to check what percentage of accounting companies were really ready to turn to face the client.  The bottom line is hardly one in 10. <br><br>  Sometimes it is enough to be in the "skin" of the client and give him what he wants in a simple way. <br><br>  Do you develop your knowledge in related professions to work with clients? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331402/</a></p>
