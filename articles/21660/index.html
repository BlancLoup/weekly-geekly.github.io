In reasonable of course, limits.  You can now take your guitar and raise / lower any strings at random (just gently, do not drag the strings - they can just break, and then you will scold me ..).  Play around  Try again.  Well, how?  Who knows ... maybe now you have created an excellent system in which you will be pleased to play further, and you do not go back to the previous one. <br><br>  Consider a few ‚Äústandard‚Äù tuning for the guitar.  Yes, yes, you heard right, a few standard pieces, not just one.  Another thing is that among them is the most standard.

      <strong>Standard Tuning: eBGDAE</strong> <br><br>  It is the most suitable for any guitar (except guitar-baritone and other experiments), it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is electro or acoustic, bass or ordinary guitar.  The guitar itself is basically sharpened specifically for this system.  The absolute majority of musicians play in it and play at the same time remarkably.  When this is not further specified, it is precisely this system that is implied in any notes and tablature. <br><br>  Range: From the 7th octave [if the guitar has 22 frets] to E 3th octave. <br><br>  <strong>Drop-D: eBGDAD</strong> <br><br>  It is so called because we ‚Äúdrop‚Äù the 6th string by one tone, up to D. All other strings remain unchanged.  If you have a guitar with a conventional, that is, not a Floyd Rose-shaped bridge, then you can easily tune into this system without any problems. <br><br>  What is the trick?  Expand by a whole tone the range of the guitar.  And in the lower spectrum, which is very significant.  Now there are 2 new notes that can be learned from your guitar.  Agree, already a lot!  Secondly, the game of quint-chords becomes much easier and more harmonious, especially at a high pace.  Take a look: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9d7/c87/347/9d7c873478c613f62aa2172898c261e7.jpg" width="394" height="183" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Here is a typical motif in Drop-D, set the rhythm yourself (Fig. 1.) In the usual setting, we need 3 or 2 fingers, while in the Drop-D we need only one (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).  It is easier to take other intricate chords (Fig. 4). <br><br>  Honestly, I can not remember a single musician who constantly plays in such a system, usually musicians use this setting for individual songs.  Although, I remembered one group, this is Lost Prophets. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Half-step Down or Down S step: [eb Bb Gb Db Ab Eb]</strong> <br><br>  All strings drop half a tone.  It would seem nothing complicated, but believe me - this is one of the most radical changes that you can come up with.  In fact, playing the same as you usually get a completely different sound, and the interval in half-tones makes ordinary notes intermediate (flat and sharp).  This is especially evident when using open chords.  On the whole, the return from the instrument is quite different, which is explained by a serious weakening of the string tension.  So you can put strings thicker.  So did the coolest guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan playing on 13 strings in this system.  In this structure, played by Jimi Hendrix.  In addition, a similar system is popular in the grunge and garage rock: Kurt Cobain lowered the guitar by half a tone, now the Subways band plays amazing songs in Half-step Down. <br><br>  <strong>Open-A [eDbAEAE] and Open-G [dBGDGD]</strong> <br><br>  Open settings.  They are called so, because the open strings themselves form a chord.  Accordingly: open-A is Amaj, open G is Gmaj.  Such settings are very convenient when playing a rhythm game, especially if you sing at the same time.  You can, and even need to use the slide.  All this makes Jack White of the White Stripes.  Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones also likes open settings. <br><br>  Be sure to try them - unusual sensations. <br><br>  Thanks to all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21660/</a></p>
