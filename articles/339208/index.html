  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uneducated youth. The teacher‚Äôs response</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  On September 30, user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aleshqqa1337/" class="user_link">aleshqqa1337</a> published a sincere and, in general, correct post <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339022/">"Uneducated youth</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339022/">"</a>  I realized that I can not answer.  He wrote a comment, wrote ... And finally decided to write a post. </p><br><p>  Briefly about yourself (this is important): I work as a programmer-researcher in the field of information security.  Now in a large Russian company, before that in two banks, even before this in a small innovative information security company.  I have been teaching at MSTU named after Bauman for more than three years ... And I also saw a lot. </p><br><p>  Nevertheless, the "angle of view" <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aleshqqa1337/" class="user_link">aleshqqa1337</a> in my opinion is a little wrong.  This article is not written for criticism, but rather to complete the picture of what is happening in general with technical education in Russia. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="nachnyom-izdaleka">  Let's start from afar </h2><br><p>  I do not want to agitate anyone for Soviet power, this is not about politics, but in the USSR: </p><br><ol><li>  It was, though in many ways miserable, but more independent economy </li><li>  This economy required a large number of personnel, including intellectuals. </li></ol><br><p>  This does not mean that in modern Russia everything is bad.  Just a lot of sectors of the economy, including technical, have sunk.  In Baumanka there are so many departments that are <em>objectively</em> not economically in great demand.  What to do with teachers?  Dismiss?  Retrain?  This is a sick and not idle question ... </p><br><p>  And what about Russian IT?  In the dashing 90s, few people from IT went to teaching.  Even now, if they go, then either because there is no other place to go;  either because of the combination of science and education ("knights of science") or, like me, people from the industry who read students once a week and sow good and eternal in the evenings. </p><br><p>  So, there are three types of teachers: </p><br><ol><li>  "Knights of Science" - they are very few, but they are still there.  Including among the young.  They need to be recorded in the red book and take care </li><li>  full-time teachers.  - unfortunately their level falls heavily and heavily.  This is a <strong>system</strong> problem. </li><li>  teachers part-timers.  - they are, but there is no policy of their attraction and retention (more on this below). </li></ol><br><h2 id="o-zarplatah">  About salaries </h2><br><p>  Suppose that someone really wants to teach. </p><br><p>  See it.  I work at 0.1 rate and get 2000 rubles.  Consequently, if I would have worked for the full, I would have received 20,000. If I am not a Muscovite and I need to rent an apartment for the conditional 35,000, then in order to live and eat buckwheat cereal I need to work at two rates.  Therefore, without the title of Ph.D.  to live at all is not possible.  Hence, another problem is the subsidence of domestic science, since  95% of the candidate's works are simply terrible (the figure is not taken from the head. Only 1/20 is really at least something of itself).  And everyone closes their eyes to this.  Hence the ordinary cynicism of the so-called "people of science" (not to be confused with the "knights of science") </p><br><p>  I understand that not with bread alone is a man full.  But for everything there are limits.  If the stomach sticks to the ribs - not to teaching </p><br><h2 id="o-metode-finansirovaniya">  About financing method </h2><br><p>  We return to the country of councils.  Previously allocated money <strong>to flow</strong> .  Thus, when deducting a student, no one needed to reduce the premiums.  In modern Russia, money is allocated to a student.  And very good, depending on the university, and the department is 50-150 tons. </p><br><p>  That is why the deduction is an extreme measure, even at MSTU ... As a result, subsidence of education. </p><br><h2 id="o-politike-k-prepodavatelyam-sovmestitelyam">  About politics to part-time teachers </h2><br><p>  But she is not!  Well, not at all.  For example, I have been teaching for three years now and I regularly put couples somewhere at one o'clock.  I go to the department (asking for leave from work) and ask to change.  With a scratch, scandals - change.  And it goes on from year to year.  Why do so?  A friend of mine, a successful startup, just tired and waved his hand.  As a result, the department has lost a talented person from the industry, who has ‚Äúbrought people into people‚Äù. </p><br><p>  They say that the new university of the <a href="http://mospolytech.ru/">Moscow Polytechnic</a> University is supposedly a different policy.  I do not know - wait and see. </p><br><h2 id="o-rycaryah-nauki">  About the Knights of Science </h2><br><p>  It is these people who give a fundamental education.  Guys, believe me - you need it.  But if you are a student, not now.  At first you will be a juna, then a middle one ... And then it turns out that without fundamental knowledge you will be an eternal middle one ... </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, this kind of people, as I already wrote, is vanishingly small.  Most of the Ph.D.  - charlatans, they are "stifling" and, let us, without pharisaism, hate talented, capable young scientists.  Just like Karl Marx - class enemies. </p><br><h2 id="o-byurokratii">  About bureaucracy </h2><br><p>  On the example of MSTU.  Since the retirement of I. B. Fedorov from the post of Rector of MSTU, "bureaucratic processes" have been taking place in Baumanka.  You can write a book about this, but speaking with your fingers the bureaucrats simply squeeze the "knights of science" to the side of the road.  Objectively, to understand this process from the outside is impossible - and there the candidate of technical sciences and here the candidate of technical science. </p><br><p>  Comes to ridiculous.  If 5 years ago it was possible to go into the audience and to gather students on bird rights and hold an additional seminar, now we need to coordinate everything and everywhere.  It seems that it is right.  But in practice, it just turns into a mournful masquerade and I have already accepted it.  Talented students just call to visit me at work, or we meet in a cafe - and we work. </p><br><p>  In other universities, ah differently?  I will answer in Stanislavski: "I do not believe!" </p><br><h2 id="ob-unizhenii-rycarey-nauki">  On the humiliation of the knights of science </h2><br><p>  To raise the wisdom of life (now it is fashionable to call soft skills), he repeatedly visited bureaucratic formal gatherings.  They were systematically and regularly humiliated the "knights of science."  They said that they teach incorrectly, conduct examinations incorrectly, underestimate grades, are demanding of excellent students, etc.  etc.  In practice, this is simply regular smart-ass hounding, in order to reduce the level of power of the "knights of science" to zero and thereby strengthen the power of "bureaucracy." </p><br><p>  Does it have anything to do with the educational process?  No, it does.  This is a backstage.  And it is the ‚Äúbureaucracy‚Äù that forms the policy. </p><br><h2 id="poterya-kultury">  Loss of culture </h2><br><p>  Long thought, to write this paragraph or not ... I drank coffee and decided to write.  I understand that many readers will meet my point of view "in hostility", but still - we are gradually losing culture, including in IT. </p><br><p>  For example, we substitute Russian words for foreign ones where it is not needed.  I am not against the word "monitoring" or the word "mitap", since  There are no analogues to them.  Not even against the words "June" and "Middle", although they can find an analogue.  But a week ago I heard "multi-thread programming" instead of "multi-threaded" and a little depressed ... </p><br><p>  We have come to terms with the introduction of the expressions ‚Äúraise skills‚Äù, ‚Äúpush commit‚Äù, ‚Äúpatch-play module‚Äù, ‚Äúhard-to-use prog‚Äù, etc. into the Russian language. </p><br><p>  There is a point of view that speech does not affect the professional level.  Personally, I think it is not. </p><br><h2 id="chto-delat">  What to do? </h2><br><p>  Let us omit the question "who is to blame" - let us leave it to historians and sociologists and ask a more important question for the future of the country: what to do? </p><br><p>  I will express my (of course subjective) point of view. </p><br><p>  The future is for the following types of interaction: </p><br><ol><li>  Schools from companies.  For example <a href="https://yandexdataschool.ru/">ShAD Yandex</a> </li><li>  Non-profit educational organizations.  For example <a href="http://www.moscowpython.ru/">MoscowPython</a> </li><li>  System as in Star Wars: master -&gt; padawan.  The teacher is a student. </li><li>  Free sites for educational and / or professional content.  For example Habr </li></ol><br><p>  What will happen to the classical education?  What is very important (voenka, for example) will surely survive and remain.  The rest will change a lot and in fact will become a vinaigrette from the above four points, only at the state expense. </p><br><h2 id="chto-delat-studentam">  What should students do? </h2><br><blockquote>  Salvation of drowning people is the work of drowning people. </blockquote><p>  Cruel, I agree. </p><br><p>  But nothing else.  Self-education, reading good books;  meet with experts;  visit meet-ups </p><br><p>  Nobody, anywhere, will teach you anything.  No one will take you as a piece of raw clay and make you a vase.  You yourself must learn, you must look for where, what and from whom you can get useful. </p><br><p>  Logging into IT is difficult - but possible.  All in your hands. <br>  Good luck to you guys! </p></div>
