      A video report is also available: <br><video>  http://video.yandex.ru/users/sqadays/view/8 </video><br><br>  and presentation: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/VLDCORP/ss-21928819">www.slideshare.net/VLDCORP/ss-21928819</a> <br><br>  My topic is useful analytic skills and aims to show you professional development opportunities in the field of business analysis. <br><br>  <b>Briefly about yourself</b> <br><br>  Maria Bondarenko, director of the Belarusian-German-Russian company GP software for developing software in the field of tourism;  has been working in IT for more than 10 years <br>  Sergey Bondarenko, works in the company Itransition (almost 1000 people), is engaged in management tasks (including in the divisions of analytics) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/046/9d5/d56/0469d5d567a477f94d79aa59e744ae5a.png"><br><br>  <b>Objectives of the report</b> <br><br>  What do you want to show and tell in the report: <br>  For beginners (analytics experience less than a year) - to give a general understanding of the industry, what skills may be needed and what are the development horizons <br>  For experienced analysts: open unknown horizons that you could not see in the context of your tasks, and also show the power and breadth of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness analysis <br><br><h5>  Where do analysts come from? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b63/429/7b7/b634297b7c5b363e470cb6225bd36490.png"><br><br>  To the question ‚ÄúWhich of the analysts received professional education?‚Äù Only a few of those present at the conference answered positively. <br>  Much more came from testing and development.  Some even came from a linguistic university. <br>  In general, the field of business analysis is now quite young. <br>  And not so much receive vocational education in this area.  And just as it turns out, it becomes so: there is such a vacancy, you decide ‚Äúwhy not try it?‚Äù And now your business analyst career begins. <br><br><h5>  How are analysts developing? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c40/33a/eda/c4033aedacf176b69096a64f6387233a.png"><br><br>  What happens next?  Then you start to work, perform some tasks and walk up the career ladder within the company.  But your range of tasks is usually limited to only those projects that this company performs.  Accordingly, if you come to one company and ask: ‚ÄúThere are business analysts here, and what are you doing?  And what is business analysis? ‚ÄùOr you will come to another company and ask,‚Äú What is business analysis, ‚Äùyou can get 2 completely different answers. <br>  In order to somehow improve this situation, you are trying to read books, read information on the Internet and type this experience somehow, but, nevertheless, again this all happens rather chaotically.  Accordingly, such a hodgepodge occurs in your head, you are boiling in your own juice and lacking a comprehensive understanding of the business analysis context. <br><br><h5>  What can this lead to? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/81a/b1d/71481ab1dcc3c4e5ce0ca2f2cdb0ce78.png"><br><br>  I repeatedly saw at interviews when specialists came to me to get a job (and in our company the position in which the project manager and analyst are combined) was spread and the guys said: ‚ÄúIn general, I already know everything in business analysis, now I want to try myself in field of management.  In general, they come to the fact that seeing only some subdomain of business analysis, they conclude that this is all that can be.  The second possible reaction is that you do not know where to go next, you feel sad, you are not efficient enough on your projects and you may not even know that there are any means to increase this efficiency to increase the context of understanding this area. <br>  Next, we proceed to this. <br><br><h5>  Maybe better? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccc/881/355/ccc88135598cd2044af2b44299d295b0.png"><br><br>  I would like to show you the possible roles of a business analyst in projects, possible areas of activity and the necessary skills, personal characteristics and tools that may be useful to you.  Below, I will outline what may be needed, because  For each of them, you can arrange a separate report or a separate training, so further I recommend that you dive into areas that you find interesting for yourself. <br><br><h5>  What is an analyst? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc2/46f/38d/cc246f38d102d1cfefb484194e6c6b57.png"><br><br>  In the process of preparing the report, it turned out to highlight several areas in which business analysts work: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements Management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Research &amp; Analysis (Research and data analysis) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Processes Engineering (Process Modeling) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Modeling &amp; Design (IP Design) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Delivery (Implementation) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Consulting (Consulting) <br><br><h6>  Requirements Management </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43a/a03/c42/43aa03c426f04fef2deb9e3b91fae674.png"><br><br>  The most obvious is <b>requirements management</b> .  This is a person who collects requirements, who analyzes them, manages changes and who ensures that all project participants are aware of current requirements, that they are communicated correctly to the development team and that the result of the work corresponds to the wishes that the client originally had .  But that's not all. <br><br><h6>  Research and data analysis </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbd/3a3/0ae/bbd3a30ae415766aae81629ed3160736.png"><br><br>  There are about 6 areas that analysts do.  The next area is <b>data research and analysis</b> : a common task of working with data.  Analyze which systems are already on the market with similar functionality, find these systems, compare them, provide information which one is better suited for the current project tasks.  The second cut of the analyst‚Äôs role is the analysis of the system‚Äôs performance and the development of certain conclusions.  Those.  general analytical tasks. <br><br><h6>  Process modeling </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28d/781/050/28d781050c2a075d679d66e4698393dc.png"><br><br>  The next possible role of analytics on projects is the area <b>of process modeling</b> .  Not always business analysts who work in IT and are directly involved in developing and managing requirements and designing systems, know that, in general, the primary sources of their tasks lie in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness processes, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãclient business.  The client somehow performs these or those operations now and the software is not required by him now.  But in the process of analyzing our current situation, we can conclude that the processes are not optimal, that they need to be reorganized and, accordingly, the task is to develop software.  Here, actually, who will help the client look at his business processes, describe and transform them into a more optimal state?  This is also a business analyst task. <br><br><h6>  IP design </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50f/436/b87/50f436b87b5fde396311d7be5d7cf331.png"><br><br>  The next area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness analyst activity is the <b>design of information systems</b> .  And the design is different.  And depending on the skills of analysts, you can dig deeper into this area or less.  For example, the simplest level of system design is to sketch mockups or prototypes of screens and then transfer this to usability specialists or designers so that they can work out in more detail.  On the other hand, if you have a deeper knowledge of these skills, for example, usability, for ease of use, you can combine the role of usability specialist.  Those.  In principle, this may be part of the business analyst‚Äôs work. <br><br><h6>  Software implementation </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/528/259/d57/528259d577b2019f888588ff73c80885.png"><br><br>  The next possible area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity for analysts is <b>software implementation</b> , in particular, when a product is already developed, this product needs to be implemented, it is necessary to customize it at the client (if we are talking about large systems).  This is a field of activity that requires special skills and abilities. <br><br><h6>  Consulting </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/931/c09/232931c09bed88e60d05e2ca1561ba87.png"><br><br>  And <b>consulting</b> .  The deeper you work in the industry, the better and higher the practical skills, the more complex tasks you can assign and the more you can act as an expert in the eyes of the client, and not just a conductor of his requirements to the developers.  Moreover, consulting may not even be directly related to the implementation of the project.  Just consult the client on technology issues on business issues.  This is also the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness analyst activity. <br><br><h5>  Hard &amp; Soft Skills </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/101/969/b26/101969b26fb0fb75332e68bb8946a28c.png"><br><br>  In connection with this range of possible tasks, certain skills are highlighted that allow you to perform them more professionally.  The classic division of skills is hard and soft.  Hard skills are knowledge of tools, technologies, techniques or notations, or what you can learn.  Soft skills are personal and interpersonal characteristics that are given to him from birth, but they also develop and they can also be trained and according to them there are methods of development. <br>  Within these skills and the cut of possible roles of analyst on projects, the following dependencies can be identified (see table). <br><br><h5>  1. Hard skills </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94f/79b/e02/94f79be02bc6a9bad5a6804a0814842f.png"><br><br>  For convenience, we have divided all skills from the hard skills group into 7 groups: basic competencies, theory and analysis techniques, business fundamentals, knowledge of IP development, documentation, additional competencies, foreign languages.  At the intersections of roles and competencies, it is indicated for which tasks the analyst needs certain skills. <br>  In foreign languages: question marks are because, in principle, can be a smart analyst, to work in the local market and it will be enough for him only the Russian language to perform their work.  But given that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness analysis is quite young and there are not so many literatures, forums and communities in Russian in which you can learn information, of course, knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill allow you to develop better and get more professional knowledge than you know only 1 language . <br>  As for soft-skills, they were divided into several groups and criteria were defined, for which roles certain soft-skills are most important. <br>  Below we will tell you more about all the hard and soft skills listed. <br><br>  We describe hard-skills that involve purely technical skills.  They are the easiest to train and are important enough, because  underlie the effective work of the analyst. <br><br><h6>  1.1 Basic Competences </h6><br><br>  What are the core competencies? <br>  This is a series of things that you must learn before you begin to step into the field of business analysis.  They will allow your thoughts to clothe in a certain form.  These are fairly simple things, but basic ones that no one will teach you separately.  It is understood that you should have this. <br><br>  <b>a.</b>  <b>Business ethics</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/262/b5e/5f4/262b5e5f4826a7a634fba484d5640abf.png"><br><br>  First, general business ethics, telephone communication skills, written correspondence skills.  Namely, such tasks as: how to write a letter (start with a greeting, at the end put the final phrase, prompting the client to action, and signature), how to communicate with the client by phone.  This, of course, must be known to you in advance.  Why am I talking about this ‚Äî I personally saw situations when analysts came to the project and the letters looked like this: ‚ÄúCan you send us the actual documentation on the project?‚Äù Neither ‚Äúhello‚Äù, nor ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù.  It's just not beautiful.  This is a basic skill that you should have and about which you don‚Äôt even need to speak. <br><br>  <b>b.</b>  <b>Internet skills</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/410/16d/ad6/41016dad62f875db722e7b8de098b7d4.png"><br><br>  The next skill is the ability to work on the Internet, to work with instant messengers (Skype, for example, is very popular now).  Due to them, you reduce the distance and the client can contact you online.  In Skype, you can form a group discussion, the entire team to connect to communicate with the client and then questions about the project are resolved faster.  You should also know what a screen demonstration is, how to send files, etc. <br><br>  <b>c.</b>  <b>Teamwork</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/c3e/bb4/613c3ebb4268e4d46859cb92b40b0bef.png"><br><br>  The next block is the ability to work together.  Knowledge of tools like Google Drive will help you. <br>  Goggle Drive is an affordable, free tool through which it is possible to exchange documents with the client and the development team.  If you don‚Äôt have a collaboration tool installed in your company, this is the easiest choice to give customers access to documents.  And what is more important - you can simultaneously and jointly work on the same document.  We use this technique - we open with the client a document with requirements and discuss what and in what order should be implemented.  You change the priorities in your document and the client sees it on your screen in a couple of seconds. <br><br>  <b>d.</b>  <b>Online conferences</b> <br><br>  In the same group - tools for online conferences.  It is very useful when the analyst does not just send documents to the client, but demonstrates, in particular, intermediate versions of the system's operability, shows prototypes.  For this you will need some kind of playground.  Of course, there is an option that you come to the client, if he is in the same country and city.  But often we work with western customers or remote teams.  These online conferencing tools include GoTo Meeting and GoTo Webinar (these are from one series), WebEx and others.  And they can be useful not only for the presentation of results, but also for collecting requirements. <br><br>  <b>e.</b>  <b>Wiki storage</b> <br><br>  Another tool like MediaWiki may be useful.  This is an online library, like the well-known Wikipedia, which you can locally deploy to your client and the whole team with the help of your administrator.  It is possible to keep records in it and it‚Äôs good that you don‚Äôt need to save files to the repository to keep track of versions, send to colleagues, you can‚Äôt forget the file - the actual content is always available.  For example, a user manual or specifications can be written in MediaWiki. <br><br>  <b>f.</b>  <b>Read and print speed</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/665/31f/230/66531f2302be013b85662caade64d042.png"><br><br>  Another block of basic competencies of hard-skills is speed reading and typing (although there may be disputes whether this can be attributed to soft-skills). <br>  Analytics need to process a lot of information: on the one hand, read a lot (study and reflect), and on the other, write a lot (record results), so you will be extremely useful in your professional career if you train these 2 skills.  For example, you can compare - the average typing skill is 100 characters per minute, I type at a speed of 400 characters per minute.  If everything is clear what to write in the document and you just need to fix the agreement in words, write the protocol of the agreement with the client, then you can imagine - it takes 4 times less time for me than the average specialist.  Accordingly, by increasing this skill in yourself, you make yourself more efficient and save time on your projects. <br><br>  <b>g.</b>  <b>Office tools</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52b/6b4/ed8/52b6b4ed83e68fe2883efe4c81b82076.png"><br><br>  Also within the framework of basic skills, I would like to point out a number of tools, such as office tools (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Visio), which allow you to present the results of your work in a high-quality and visual manner.  If you know how to open a Word document and know how to type text there, but you do not know how to customize the styles of headings and tables, arrange notes, use templates and properties of the document.  Or you can open an Excel document and know what a spreadsheet is, but do not own formulas, macros, conditional formatting, then believe me, you still have where to dig within these tools.  Just for the sake of interest, you can open a certificate about the program or some kind of test for this program, and you will learn a lot that, it turns out, you didn‚Äôt know before.  Accordingly, there is always room for development. <br><br>  <b>h.</b>  <b>Visualization</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/aec/a57/0edaeca575b1626670afa0771093d32b.png"><br><br>  The next tool is MindManager.  It is also quite a useful program that relates to basic skills and allows you to structure information in the form of a mind map. <br><br>  <b>i.</b>  <b>Graphic editor</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/083/1ba/2c6/0831ba2c6e6cad7b1317a1ff83b3ce4e.png"><br><br>  Analysts can also be useful and graphic editors - not only complex Photoshop, but also, for example, the classic Paint.  There is an even more powerful program - SNAGIT - I recommend. <br><br>  <b>j.</b>  <b>Multimedia Editors</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cce/312/119/cce312119b409b9a9071f55fedcb7b07.png"><br><br>  Of course, you can use PowerPoint for presentations, but in a modern environment the Prezi tool is becoming quite popular.  Presentations in it are more interesting and interactive.  Plus, if you master the creation of video clips, in particular, the program Camtasia Studio, which allows you to record a video series of applications demonstration, it will be useful in terms of what the client can not always give you time now, but you can provide him with video -file, and the client is more likely to look at it than if he would independently click on the buttons of the system. <br><br><h6>  1.2 Theories and techniques of business analysis </h6><br><br>  The next block is theories and techniques of business analysis.  These are the skills that help you become a business analyst directly. <br>  In this context, knowledge and skills in the areas of: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Requirements Management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Change management <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development of project artifacts <br>  ‚Ä¢ Appropriate toolkit <br><br>  <b>a.</b>  <b>Requirements Management</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/189/2c2/48a/1892c248a8eb9e1ef1beda63f1b74017.png"><br><br>  The first block of knowledge is requirements management.  Here it is important to know how to identify sources and how to identify requirements, and what to do with them after that: analyze, specify (document), check. <br><br>  <b>b.</b>  <b>Change management</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e00/a15/d3c/e00a15d3c3a132fb31e28384d2ef41f5.png"><br><br>  This is a requirements management subunit, but I carried it out separately to sharpen your attention on it.  The fact is that it is very important to understand traces (there is a <a href="http://analystdays.ru/talk.sdf/analystdays/analystdays2/talks/7981">separate report</a> on this topic at the conference).  It is important to know how to manage the scale of the project. <br><br>  <b>a.</b>  <b>Project Artifacts</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d31/d76/7b8/d31d767b8b58e1e889735735471a8131.png"><br><br>  Next - the ability to describe the Vision, Software Requirements Specification, prepare a user manual.  Sometimes I heard the opinion that the analyst should not write user guides, that this is the work of a technical writer.  I think this is quite a narrow view of the world, because, in general, the task of the analyst is to contribute to the creation of a product that will be successful and useful, and the technical writer is not always selected in the team.  Those.  No need to "outweigh the dogs" on each other.  The analyst can write instructions for working with the system and user documentation most effectively.

Analysts write documents and they (documents) must be literate from the point of view of language, the correct use of technical style, competent writing, and from the point of view of design. This factor is determined by how nice it is to take your document in your hands, how neatly and uniformly it is designed, how well prepared it is for printing. This, by the way, is a very important point - 90% of the documents that external analysts send me when trying to print (especially Excel tables) are displayed on 10 sheets in a chaotic manner. Then you have to manually try to collect them, which is almost impossible. But the fact is that Excel by default does not format the page for printing. Analysts should know that there are special settings for the structure and appearance of the page,in which the format of printing, the order of pages, their numbering is set. Pay attention to this - have prepared a document, then printed out and saw if it is convenient to use it or if you need to put the document in order.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">b.

Whichever project you start doing, specify in which domain it will be executed - it could be finance, insurance, tourism - and carefully read this subject area. Of course, in terms of overall development, it is impractical to grasp all areas, since There are a lot of them, and it is useful to dive into the domain in which you run the project.</font></font><br><br>  <b>c.</b> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Applied expertise</font></font></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/9af/8b1/2809af8b1a7e68f97a3a7660df397f92.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As an additional competence, applied expertise is important. Moreover, a different application area may be important from project to project. For example, if the project is carried out in the field of tourism, then knowledge of the "traveling salesman problem" in graph theory, which is studied in applied mathematics, would be useful. Namely, you need to understand how to deliver tourists from the airport to hotels, provided that the team is a national team and hotels are located in 10 points of the city. With this expertise, the analyst will be able to offer a more competent solution than he will not be in the subject. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">d.

For example, you found what you like and saved it to disk or asked the designer to draw. In this case, it will be easier then to prepare the documents and draw prototypes using these elements (i.e., you will not look for the design, where to get or where to draw - the images will look nice and neat). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also helps analysts letter templates and functional patterns. Where do they come from? After completing previous projects, save the results (best practices) to your knowledge base. Thus, from project to project, you will accumulate not only experience in your head, but also a good base of ready-made developments that can be used in future projects for better efficiency.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Also a good source of knowledge is analytical materials (for example, market reviews). </font></font><br><br><h6><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 3.2 Objective assessment of reality </font></font></h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/576/8ee/f2c/5768eef2c089d8014d17553ba5bb0008.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the second clue that can increase your efficiency is an objective assessment of yourself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You need to understand how well you own certain analyst skills (you can use the above list to test your hard and soft skills). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This test will allow you to understand where to go next.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In life there are a lot of examples of when people consider themselves cool, but they are not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most often, self-esteem is overstated. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But when an analyst believes that he is cool, he cannot work more efficiently. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember the words of Socrates, "I know that I do not know anything," and their continuation: "But others do not even know this." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If a person believes that he is already at the top, then you will not climb further up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, with regards to MS Word, 90% say they own it ‚Äúfreely,‚Äù although they do not know how to use either fields or macros.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 4.

Then you should put a weight in front of each skill - how much for you (and / or for the company - depends on the level at which the plan is built) a particular skill is important.  You can use a scale from 0 to 5 or from 0 to 100 (in the example, a scale of 0..5 is used).  In principle, the same classification can be used in your career. <br>  Our company uses gradation into 3 levels of specialists - Junior, Specialist, Expert - and inside them there is a division into 3 steps from R1 to R3.  For each of these levels, certain criteria are introduced, what skills they need and at what level of proficiency. <br>  As recommendations: the plan should take into account both the skills of wide application. And highly specialized skills.  But it is worth considering everything.  And you should also add to the table those additional skills that, although not fundamental in the work of the analyst, however, simplify life and make its work more efficient. <br>  Also, when drawing up a plan, the following criteria should be taken into account: individuality, binding to the certification system, concreteness, measurability, consistency with management. <br>  As a result, on the basis of this classification, you can not just make a personal development plan, but at the same time determine which career opportunities you have arising from the development of certain skills. <br><br><h5>  Dilemma of choice </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/4f5/67a/a464f567a151010956ef2775996a9810.png"><br><br>  When drafting such a development plan, the question arises - speaking of analysts and requirements for them, is it correct to mix analysts engaged in various tasks or not?  And is it worth to be sprayed on everything or to concentrate on some narrow field of activity?  The question is quite philosophical, and everyone answers it independently.  For example, there are personal preferences for modeling business processes and therefore I want to study this area most deeply - no one will prevent you from doing this.  Or someone would like to explore various areas of business analysis more widely, which will also have a good effect on your career, because  You will understand where and what techniques can be used, be able to flexibly select them depending on the characteristics of your project. <br>  And I would like to cite a few points, which can be useful for analysts with a <b>broad</b> outlook. <br>  The fact is that with such a plan there is practically no limit.  Most likely, the whole life will not be enough to master the entire width of the topic from and to.  All the same, you will concentrate on some of its subsets.  However, the already studied subset is valuable for the market and you just have to go and coordinate it with your employer. <br>  Those.  wide horizon of skills - it is useful, interesting, profitable. <br><br><h5>  2. Assess current skill level </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc4/881/a30/fc4881a301766c248291be114e1478d6.png"><br><br>  After determining the weights, you should determine what current level of skills and knowledge of technologies and tools you have.  One of the fairly convenient methods of assessment is the analogue of the assessment of knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(from Basic to Intermediate and Advanced).  Each of these levels is assigned its own score from 0 to 5. Then you calculate the total amount of points as the sum of weighted scores. <br><br><h5>  3. Defining Development Goals </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/280/090/ad2/280090ad25f3274a434ac403918506d5.png"><br><br>  Then you fill in 2 more columns in the table of the plan - what level of knowledge and skills you expect in your home in a year and a month.  This approach is somewhat close to the current trend of unification, when you subordinate your development to numerical measurements (in fact, you accumulate points).  There is still room for development, how this table can be optimized, which ‚Äúbuns‚Äù can be presented to yourself for achieving one or another level. <br><br><h5>  4. Definition of ways to achieve </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eda/54b/4d9/eda54b4d99b02567c50c717915b2768b.png"><br><br>  After that, you determine how to achieve the goal.  For each item you plan to improve, you define literature, trainings, conferences, etc.  You must have a clear understanding of what you are planning to do in the coming month and next year in order to develop in business analysis. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/886/825/7a9/8868257a9e3229900bb3154308820a9c.png"><br><br>  So, business analysts can have a lot of skills and knowledge, they can be different, they can be applied in different forms on your current projects.  But if you feel that you have already reached the ceiling and that you know everything in the framework of the work that you are doing right now on projects, do not despair in any way - try to recall today's report, try to look more broadly at the world and think that I still do not know and where I can still develop, where I can go.  Definitely, it will be useful to you from a career point of view, and your employer will also appreciate it.  Which means you will be more successful as a professional in your IT career. <br><br><h5>  Question 1 </h5><br> <code>     ?       ?</code> <br> <br>  We should start by agreeing with a team of analysts on the equal representation of the quality of work among all members.  For example, for me, one of the criteria for analyst work (not the main one) is the quality of the documents they provide.  At the same time it is important for me that the document be beautifully designed, meaningfully and logically structured so that there are no jumps from section to section, etc.  Accordingly, we take this particular atomic unit and with the analyst we argue that the quality of the document should be such, and he answers you that he did not even think about it.  For example, there is no page numbering, okay.  He thought the main thing was to write the text.  Thus, having sat down together and having spoken these moments with him, we come to a common understanding of the quality of the document. <br>  Accordingly, it is necessary to go through all the steps of the analyst‚Äôs work and talk through the quality criteria. <br>  By assessment, I can say the following: we undergo periodic certification (1-2 times a year), the assessment for which consists of several criteria.  Analysts are, first of all, communicators, i.e.  they receive information from customers and pass it on to developers.  A very important evaluation criterion is what the client thinks about interaction with the analyst: how quickly he responds to requests, how clear and understandable information he provides to the client, and how effective he is in interacting with the client.  This questionnaire is completed by the client.  A similar questionnaire is filled in by the developers (i.e., the project implementation team): how available is the analyst to them, how much do they understand the documents provided to them, how comfortable is it for them to work with this analyst on the project. <br>  This is one of the point of evaluation of analysts, and very important, because  he is a translator between the client and the developer, and if there is a weak link at this stage, then no matter how cool he writes and writes, he has not achieved his goals. <br>  The second point is the effectiveness of the project.  Of course, not only the analyst is taken into account here, but, nevertheless, we make an assessment of the entire team as a whole.  But since the analyst was a translator of requirements and, together with the team, he formed what the product should do, this is also a rather important characteristic. <br>  The third point - if possible, this is an expert assessment of the documents, requirements that the analyst makes.  For example, within six months he wrote the requirements, but some of them did not include in the basic requirements or forgot about them.  Or in relation to specifications - as far as they are clear, specific, consistent.  This way you can expertly evaluate these documents.  Not always the opportunity.  Usually only the customer or the development team can say something about him. <br><br>  Why are domain knowledge related to additional competencies?  As I see it, this is the main thing: the analyst may draw bad diagrams, but he must understand what he is doing.  There are a lot of people who draw beautiful graphics and UML diagrams, and those who do not understand the essence of the work and do stupid things are the majority. <br>  Agree with this position.  However, Sergei and I in the process of preparing the presentation argued quite a lot about the grouping of skills for ease of presentation and understanding by analysts.  The same basic skills are the foundation that does not allow to become an analyst, it only allows to start understanding in this industry.  Therefore, it may not be domain expertise.  Of course, for the successful implementation of projects without it absolutely nowhere. <br><br><h5>  Question 2 </h5><br> <code>       ,     ,        ( ).   ,    ,        .      ,   -, , -, ,  ,     -  ,  .  ,    (,      ),        .      -        ,      .</code> <br> <br>  I started my career just as a technical writer, so everything is very close to me, I understand very clearly what you are talking about.  According to my feelings and the way I performed my analytical functions, having a technical writing base, and comparing it with analysts who do not have this base, I still think that analysts should have the skills to write technical documentation.  This makes you more professional. <br>  On the fact that something can be divided and outsourced, my entire report can be broken into pieces and say, for example, that the design of business processes should be given to a specialist in business process modeling (I have met such a specialist who did which none of my business analysts could do).  But this is just proof that the better you delve into those areas that are indicated in the report, the better your result will be and the more you will cause a wow-reaction of everyone around you. <br><br>  <b>Ps</b> .  Meet Maria with Sergey is also possible at future <a href="http://analystdays.com/">Analyst Days</a> conference series. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219667/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219667/</a></p>
