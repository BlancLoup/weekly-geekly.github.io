      At first, a bunch of niche services appear that allow you to conveniently find each other client and end user, rating systems and automatic quality assessment are pumped through, and then services begin to grow larger and merge with social networks.  Something will grow as an application on the existing social network, and some services, on the contrary, will create a larger network with themselves than the current ones and overcome market share. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Stendalon sites - are dying out. <br>  Already, many fairly large businesses are doing everything inside the FB, and the stores keep it there. <br><br>  High-speed wireless Internet covers the entire planet. <br>  Internet is cheap, often free. <br>  Telephony died, video communication over the Internet. <br><br>  It is possible the disintegration of the Internet into segments, there has long been a great Chinese firewall and it really works.  From China you can, if you wish, seep into the ordinary Internet, but practically ordinary Chinese do not do this, they have their own Chinese Internet there for a long time. <br>  Russia seems to choose this course too. <br>  The authorities will try to pupate their citizens, to control what they read, what electronic money they use. <br><br>  If before there were independent Internet mega projects, now the authorities are beginning to press them under themselves and put them in the service of the state. <br>  Russia has VKontakte and Mailru.  The United States - Google, Microsoft Facebook. <br>  In China, Baidu and Kuku. <br><br>  The states have already gained control over local large Internet projects, but have not yet mastered it fully. <br>  If citizens of a small country use web services controlled by another country, they will increasingly fall under the influence of the owner of the media resource.  The actual role of small, formally independent states will continue to decline. <br><br>  States will continue to merge with corporations. <br>  Public policy has long been just a show, really big business drives, and there the owners are not re-elected. <br><br>  The states that do not have their own social networks and a separate language will inevitably be absorbed by the large, but this is still a matter of a more distant future. <br><br>  As a result, each major block of ‚Äústates‚Äù will have its own social network, and an ordinary citizen will only visit this one site and its applications. <br>  But there will be everything, including video calling, movies, music, online shopping, real time 3D games, money transfers, banking services, search for all <br>  services from the services described above and so forth. <br><br>  Robots will do all the routine work. <br>  Online supermarkets of all, with a remote selection of goods, products and very fast automatic delivery. <br>  Copters, driving and running robots, and then pneumomail. <br><br>  There will be new smart cities. <br>  These will be commercial projects. <br>  As a big-big shopping center with a bunch of services, internal infrastructure and apartments on the territory. <br>  There, everything will be initially automated. <br>  In the beginning, they will be focused on the more prosperous part of the population, but will quickly develop and the entire population will spill over into them. <br>  These cities will be expanded not by separate buildings, but by larger units, a new wound will be immediately built with all the infrastructure, built-in transport, services and when opened will connect to the rest, have ‚Äúplugs‚Äù for connecting the following pieces. <br>  Robots will obviously build all of this, initially under the control of people, but the farther away the fewer people will be required. <br><br>  Robots dopilat so that they were self-reproducible. <br>  The frameworks will be written for all parts of the cycle from mining to production, repair and secondary recycling. <br><br>  Smart cities will be almost closed systems that consume mostly energy. <br>  Food will be grown in them, all waste products will be recycled. <br>  In fact, after minor modifications, these cities can be used on other planets, and under water, anywhere. <br>  Only a source of energy is needed. <br><br>  Thermonuclear fusion will inevitably be mastered in the next 10 years. <br>  It is extremely necessary, there is a theoretical base, it‚Äôs all just an engineering solution. <br><br>  Socialist trends will remain. <br>  The state will give citizens a minimum social ration, sufficient for existence. <br>  Want more - work.  In the west it has already happened. <br><br>  The most valuable resource will be people's attention.  This is a clear trend. <br>  Initially, all fill up with spam.  Then systems of electronic secretaries will be introduced. <br>  and incoming from unfamiliar subscribers will be paid for the initiator of communication. <br><br>  Product placement will only gain momentum. <br><br>  Horizon.  ~ 2052 year <br><br>  After the full realization of the self-replicating robots and the development of thermonuclear fusion - a real way out into space. <br>  The development of robots will merge with genetics and panning into one new discipline. <br>  Actually 1 programmer who has 1 such robot and all libraries can very quickly <br>  though a death star gash down even the whole of Mars with palaces and build it with apple trees. <br><br>  The one who first masters the technology can do a lot. <br>  But if humanity is not destroyed, then sooner or later more than one player will own this technology. <br>  Here it will become faster and faster now than in star wars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222417/</a></p>
