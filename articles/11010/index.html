    <blockquote>  The appearance of the term Web 2.0 is usually associated with the article ‚ÄúTim O Reilly - What Is Web 2.0‚Äù dated September 30, 2005, first published in Russian in the journal ‚ÄúComputerra‚Äù (nos. 37 (609) and 38 (610) from 11 and 18 October 2005, respectively) and then posted under the heading ‚ÄúWhat is Web 2.0‚Äù by the Computerra Online website.  In this article, Tim O'Reilly linked the appearance of a large number of sites, united by some general principles, with the general trend of the Internet community, and called this phenomenon Web 2.0., As opposed to the ‚Äúold‚Äù Web 1.0.  Despite the fact that the meaning of this term is still the subject of much controversy, those researchers who recognize the existence of Web 2.0 highlight several main aspects of this phenomenon. </blockquote><br><br>  This quote from Wikipedia quite vaguely describes the emergence of the term as such and highlights certain aspects that make up the essence of Web 2.0.  Here they are: <br><ul><li>  Web services </li><li>  AJAX </li><li>  Web syndication </li><li>  Mash-up </li><li>  Tags (tags) </li><li>  Socialization </li></ul><br><br>  I will not literally give a description, it can be read in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">article</a> , I will try to consider them from the point of view of the developer and user. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0">Web services</a></strong> <br>  Thank you <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sirkorg/" class="user_link">sirkorg</a> <br><br>  <strong>Web applications</strong> <br>  In my humble opinion, web services are a major aspect of Web 2.0.  Why?  Because at the moment there are more and more platform-independent, independent services that provide certain services, for the use of which you need only a browser.  These are online editors of pictures / texts / code, various validators, analyzers, text generators, operating systems in the end. <br>  A user who visits such a site actually gets what they are interested in immediately, without going into details or filtering tons of unnecessary information.  It is good and convenient. <br>  I will not go into predictions, but it seems to me that such a network organization is the future.  Naturally, after a while some of the services that will be useless or unclaimed will sink into oblivion, but this is a natural process, the strongest survives. <br><br>  <strong>AJAX</strong> <br>  AJAX is a term in itself that causes discussions, and it seems to me that it is still not one of the main aspects of Web 2.0, but the very fact of using this mixture of technologies in order to reduce the time for inquiry and response and update data on a page without reloading it completely , is an undoubted advantage and, at least, concern for the user. <br><br>  <strong>Web syndication</strong> <br>  Popularly known as RSS feeds.  The undoubted part of Web 2.0.  Using RSS, there are notification of updates, the transfer of content or part of it from one resource to another, which, coupled with AJAX, provides ample opportunities for generating content upon user request.  At the output - a network of dependent services integrated with these technologies.  That in itself is <strong>mash-up</strong> 'om. <br><br>  <strong>Tags (tags)</strong> <br>  A non-key aspect that completely or partially replaces categories known to all.  In fact - tezhe eggs, only in profile.  Tag clouds, which shine on countless sites, give a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich topics are touched more often on a particular resource, but no more. <br><br>  <strong>Socialization</strong> <br>  You can talk about socialization for hours, write reports and build graphs, which many do.  Socialization of the Web as a whole is in my opinion a slightly more global aspect than one of the criteria for Web 2.0.  You all are familiar with examples of excellent sites / communities / social networks that are mostly created by users.  This trend began in the long run of Web 2.0, and it personifies the reflection of human society on the Web. <br><br>  <strong>Design</strong> <br>  This aspect is not mentioned in the Wikipedia article, but in my opinion is also important.  On the one hand, the design on many Web 2.0 ‚Äúformat‚Äù sites is replete with icons, heavy graphics, bright colors, which are not to everyone‚Äôs taste.  But on the other hand, in many thoughtful projects, the design at the end of something began to perform its main function - underlining and highlighting of content, assistance in its perception and visual separation. <br>  The main sectors are separated by color schemes, large and clear icons indicate the main ‚Äúchips‚Äù of the service and its connection with other services, large contrasted texts allow you to quickly grab the essence and go to the main point, and much more.  Friendly interfaces are a trump card for sites that want to succeed. <br><br>  In general, I would like to note that in addition to the mass use of the term Web 2.0 to the place and out of place, the tendency to revise and develop many aspects of the Network carries positive goals and develops the very structure of the Internet.  Information becomes more accessible, the user's capabilities are growing, marketing is booming, natural selection is taking place - progress is on the face. <br><br>  Long live Web 2.0, the slogan leading us forward. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.webmakerslounge.com/news/redefining-web-2/">Original article</a> on my blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11010/</a></p>
