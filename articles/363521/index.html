Perhaps, not everyone has heard about TIO, so at the same time, in a nutshell, we will explain what's what. <br><br>  Caution!  Under the cut a lot of photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The TIO platform is a modular solution designed primarily for corporate users.  It consists of a 23-inch monitor (with an adjustable height and the ability to rotate around a vertical axis of the foot) with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, equipped with a slot built into the case, and a nettop, which is installed in this slot.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b7/fa8/29d/7b7fa829da66480c9dc08277cbae4023.jpg"><br><br>  The platform has a second slot for installing an optional optical drive.  The platform can work without a nettop installed in it as a normal monitor.  Those.  we have a universal flexible solution with the possibility of upgrading the system with the lowest cost, and all the advantages of a monoblock. <br><br>  The computer is installed on top, and then with one simple movement of a special unit with three interface connectors is connected to the TIO platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ce/440/2a2/0ce4402a2633433b9bdc5978ca4011f6.jpg"><br><br>  An optical drive is available as an option.  By the way, both the drive and the nettop can be closed in their designated slots using the Kensington lock, which may be useful for the TIO customer in some cases.  The lock hole is located on the lid of the optical drive compartment: this way, at the same time, the possibility of opening the drive compartment is blocked and the block with connectors for connecting a nettop to the platform is fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/b3f/393/ff0b3f393d034718b1457e834fb75aa7.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the platform can work without a nettop installed in it as a normal monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/d60/114/12bd60114dc64aecb6234c105ee9ac62.jpg"><br><br>  On the front side of the TIO, under the screen on the right are two USB 3.0 connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bc/87b/e20/4bc87be205de4c049c782022dacd9d68.jpg"><br><br>  And on the right side there are two more USB 2.0.  It is convenient to connect a keyboard and a mouse through them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac5/085/8b7/ac50858b7a3948ae96c9c22fe02d0b27.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage that the ThinkCentre Tiny-in-One platform gives the company is flexibility.  It is no secret that the service life of the monitor is noticeably longer than that of any electronic "stuffing", especially when it comes to the usual office PC.  This factor is one of the main arguments against the use of candy bars in the corporate segment.  The TIO platform eliminates the disadvantage: the monitor needs to be purchased only once, and then, if necessary, it remains only to replace the nettop or its internal components.  Both mass and partial upgrade are much easier to implement due to the modular design.  At the same time, all the advantages of a monoblock remain - the lack of wires and workplace savings. <br><br>  This is also convenient for system administrators: if there is a problem with the computer and it cannot be solved remotely, then you just need to remove the lightweight and compact nettop from the slot on the back of the monitor.  So that an employee doesn‚Äôt sit idle while the problem is solved, you can connect a backup ThinkCentre Tiny with its pre-installed set of necessary office programs to its monitor. <br><br>  Well, about such obvious things as saving work space for the employee, universalization of cords and accessories, low power consumption of nettops, we do not even speak.  All this together is almost synonymous with the cost cutting process that is so topical now. <br><br>  All Tiny nettop models have the same housing and the same connector layout, making them fully compatible with the TIO platform.  To date, we have four modifications that cover the entire range of customer needs, from the most inexpensive to professional, productive, secure solutions with the possibility of remote administration.  These are Tiny M53, M73, M83 and M93p. <br><br>  Based on the tasks assigned, it is enough for the administrator‚Äôs employee to select and install a nettop of the appropriate configuration into the platform.  The installation itself takes much less time than unpacking the device.  No tools are required, even a simple screwdriver is needed. <br><br>  Well, except that if you want to disassemble directly nettop itself and change something inside.  Let us demonstrate this by the example of the model M73.  This is how the computer looks like outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/773/113/114/7731131146e241e5b689fa6612b6b871.jpg"><br><br>  But all the connectors on its case.  Three, as we wrote above, are needed to connect to the TIO: this is the power connector, Display Port and USB.  Four more remain: two USB (i.e., there are only 6 of them available to the user), VGA and Ethernet.  Plus thread for mounting the antenna, significantly improves the reception of Wi-Fi signal.  On some models of nettops it may not be - it depends on the configuration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27b/5ba/71d/27b5ba71df224fef891b38bf084fcac9.jpg"><br><br>  Among the connectors you can also see one screw.  We unscrew it, shift the lid to the side, and - voila: all the "insides" are in full view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a15/db4/d6f/a15db4d6f04f44dbac1acbaff924e25e.jpg"><br><br>  Next is a matter of technology.  Is that after the previous photo may be a question about how to add memory here.  It is also very simple - two DDR3 connectors are hidden under the hard drive, which is held by two more exactly the same screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f9/dee/f9b/6f9deef9b65d41c2b0ebe541f3bd5126.jpg"><br><br>  We will not load you with detailed specifications - you can look <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/">at</a> them <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/">on our website</a> , but let's say that now it is really more convenient to choose.  The lineup includes all Intel processors up to i7, there is the possibility of expanding DDR3 RAM up to 16 GB, you can use HDD with 500 GB with SSHD or 1 TB of memory, or SSD with up to 256 GB. <br><br>  By the way, using the example of the same M73 you can see the nettop delivery kit.  It includes the computer itself, a keyboard, a mouse, a stand, a power supply and an antenna.  Of course, if the nettop does not work by itself, but being connected to the monitor, then you do not need to connect both devices to the power supply at the same time, just one power supply unit from the monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc5/0de/96b/fc50de96ba7f469ab8529ea936e98ef8.jpg"><br><br>  In Russia, the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny-in-One system will appear in distributors' warehouses from January 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/005/f6e/05d005f6e5104af0968e412bec3c22cf.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363521/</a></p>
