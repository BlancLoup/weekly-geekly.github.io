It's time to decide on the type of recreation - in a hotel, a tent or at the cottage - and collect things, download <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/223347/">useful applications</a> , buy <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/226835/">all sorts of gadgets</a> .  And in order not to be bored on the road, you need to attend to some kind of entertainment and food for the mind.  For example, take along an <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/253244/">interesting book</a> .  But sometimes you want a break from reading and rest your brain.  Usually, here the hand stretches to launch the next series or the full-length movie, but still do not rush: the light did not converge on the cinema.  There is another genre that can give no less pleasure - anime. <br><br>  Fans do not need to explain what it is.  But if you are now twisted and remembered "Sailor Moon" and "Pokemon", then do not rush to condemn: the anime is as diverse as the cinema.  In this genre there are both very deep and serious full-length films and serials, as well as completely stupid and passable crafts.  Just on TV it is almost impossible to watch good and high-quality anime, so many have formed a prejudice regarding Japanese animation.  And yet we recommend to get acquainted with this genre on the way to hot countries, to the mountains or to the village. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The vast majority of footage annually removed anime constitute serials.  There are a lot of noteworthy things here, but perhaps people who are not familiar with anime should start with full lengths.  You can start with the films of Hayao Miyazaki and in general all the products of the studio <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Ghibli</a> (read like <i>Dziburi</i> ; do not be surprised, the mysterious Japanese soul and the peculiarities of the phonetics inherent in the language) are to blame.  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/person/446569_hayao_miyazaki/movies/">Films of this studio are</a> equally interesting to watch with the whole family.  But, unlike Disney films, the Ghibli tapes are not child-oriented, these are really stories for all ages, where both children and adults will be passionate about the plot.  First of all, we can recommend:

A young warrior who won a monster in battle and brought a curse upon himself sets out in search of a means that can save his life.  On the way, he meets a girl who lives in the forest with local animals - Princess Mononoke. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OiMOHRDs14%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjJDl8Pu9d_cweYfFiQRXkxUoy0Aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/425512_moj_sosed_totoro/">My Neighbor Totoro</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/157/edf/4db/157edf4db9104a05811394bdf43fa076.jpg"><br><br>  This is a very kind and bright tale of two sisters who came with their parents to the village and found that there is an amazing large and plump creature - Totoro - in the forest.  Something like a forest spirit invisible to adults.  He is not the only one, the girls met with other forest dwellers, including with the bus, a completely enchanting character.  It is literally a cross between a huge cat and a bus.  The adventures of girls in that magical summer are told in this film. <br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/508321_navsikaja_iz_doliny_vetrov/">Navskaya from the Valley of the Winds</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/cb5/005/bf0cb5005b2248059c2534a90c796bb0.jpg"><br><br>  Someone likes Japanese pronunciation more: Nausika.  In the distant future, after a devastating war, humanity is very few, and most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Earth has become unsuitable for life because of poisonous plants and fungi, richly covering everything around and emitting lethal substances and spores for humans.  And thickets continue to attack, taking away all new territories from people.  Young Navsikaya, the daughter of the ruler of one of the settlements, is trying to understand what is happening with the world. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aasYJcvHhj0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyZnFWhBZ3mgSOyoTAwCSwwW_Hew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/485977_unesennye_prizrakami/">Spirited Away</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/131/688/7f7/1316887f79044b29a9648203d5944ebf.jpg"><br><br>  A wonderful tale about a girl, Tikhir√≥, who found herself in a parallel world inhabited by ghosts.

Initially, it was a series, the plot of which is shrunk to the size of a full-length movie.  The plot tells the story of a motley company of space mercenaries engaged in catching criminals.  The action takes place on Mars in 2071.  Here are mixed battles, humor, love line, heroism and razdolbaystvo, seasoned with a dashing life of adventure seekers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nLcjvroVllU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjL5pHF7103wllX2CQpL36CWdzjew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/711873_prizrak_v_dospehah/">Ghost in armor</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f0/8af/bed/6f08afbedec58bc9c79286760dd06881.jpg"><br><br>  Fans of high technology and cool militants can be advised "Ghost in the Shell."  The film is quite old, but it looks very cheerful.  ‚ÄúThe Ghost‚Äù in its time became in the anime a peculiar standard of history on the subject of human cyborgization.  In the near future, the world has changed very much geopolitically.  In the Ministry of Public Security of Japan, there is a special group of cyborg agents specializing in high-tech tasks.  The film tells about the search for an elusive cybercriminal acting under the nickname Puppeteer. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvBVDibOrgs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQywuHpcptoEzZxaTU2IgEXwC-Pw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/cinema/movies/619767_devochka_pokorivshaja_vremja/">Girl who conquered time</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3c/c4f/aa5/a3cc4faa51b243a4a4d9587d5e9163e2.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe girl who won the time‚Äù is a story about a very active schoolgirl who once ran into a young guy from the future.  By chance, she also gained the ability to move in time and began to use it to improve her life.

Here it is told that in the near future, androids, indistinguishable from people, will enter our lives.  They will be used everywhere, but more often as domestic servants.  The plot revolves around the idea that androids can feel in their own way, that is, it raises the philosophical question about the possibility of consciousness in robots. <br><br><h1>  <a href="https://afisha.mail.ru/series_774521_pirati_chernoi_laguni/">Pirates of the Black Lagoon</a> </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b91/33e/800/b9133e800d5f4f77bf1e35d9e6afa32d.jpg"><br><br>  From the TV series for the first time, we can recommend, for example, ‚ÄúPirates of the‚Äú Black Lagoon ‚Äù.‚Äù  This is a story about the adventures of an international detachment of pirates smugglers.
