There are many photos under the cut, the author of most of them is Alexei Baturin.  Many of them depicted simpatishnye ladies-employee of the company.  There will also be a video there, unfortunately not of the best quality, but very interesting in content. <br><br>  I will say that this is not an attempt to promote a communication operator, since in my opinion Megafon has a lot of problems, but only a glance behind the scenes of what is happening by the number +79282 million. <br><br>  The places in Kislovodsk are quite <a href="">picturesque</a> , and the climate is very mild, resort.  People from all over Russia come here to relax, so working here is all the more pleasant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50c/11d/144/50c11d14443d096fc2fbecc7339436cc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Glass corridor, causing associations with the Matrix.  On both sides of it are the entrances to the "aquariums" - the halls in which the operators operate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a33/6c7/31e/a336c731eb15e6b54f1e3f12d2c00f4f.jpg"><br><br>  For <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/136341/">some, the</a> situation may seem a bit dull =) But please note that this office is located in the region, far from Nerizinovaya.

Amir <a href="http://amkadr.livejournal.com/">amkadr</a> invited as a blogger, see how it works.  KC is, if in simple terms, a place where girls from the service stopitsot 0500 sit. When you have problems with communication, or you just blunted, you call this number and get to them. <br>  120 people work ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù (not all at once).  They sit for 12 hours, listen to the idiots of subscribers.  About 17000 calls arrive to the CC on a day.  The guys and I decided that wonderful wives were being brought up there, because  they do not drip onto the brain after work, and generally love to keep quiet.  :) We were warmly welcomed, led around the premises, given to listen to the questions of subscribers. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00a/cdd/25e/00acdd25e7fd3cd3ec4cc467e39ffe59.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  The incoming call to the operator is not accidental.  In the process of how you dial, the place where you call is determined, what is your status as a client (vip / regular subscriber).  When a girl picks up the phone, she already roughly represents what to expect from the subscriber.  They say (s), 10 men still work there, but I have not seen them.  To get a job in KC, according to the director of the commercial service, is not at all easy.  A potential employee is selected according to many criteria, even the timbre of the voice is taken into account. <br>  As I have already said, there was an opportunity to listen to the real questions of subscribers, they even offered to participate in the answer: take the call, search together with the operator for the answer.  But no one dared to such feats.  But in our case there was a case when a weakly Russian-speaking person from the republic was interested in the operator: <i>‚Äúeszy, classmates do not work, eh‚Äù</i> . </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/825/167/ea2/825167ea2eb8e147f258ded56fa0c64c.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the typical place of work for the operator.  The main thing in it is a special black phone with a headset, to which all calls from subscribers are received.  The display shows the number of the subscriber and his priority (yes, there are VIPs and they are served outside the general queue).  On the computer, the consultant searches for reference information on a special reference portal for operators and manages subscriber accounts through special software.  There is no direct interaction between the special means of communication and the operator‚Äôs computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bf/2ed/389/6bf2ed389140ab6315d30d81dc51b75f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b06/1f5/261/b061f52612e89a84e367d9ffcc7f5893.jpg"><br><br>  Another blogger <a href="http://inghost.livejournal.com/">inghost</a> says: <br><blockquote>  At first glance it may seem that the work is very simple: answer the call, advise, connect / disconnect the service.  But it is not.  First, the call center serves the entire NCFD and the flow of calls is endless.  At least I have not seen a single employee who would "go about their business."  Imagine a few hours of talking in non-stop mode. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0c/2a4/99e/c0c2a499e26b80b0cf311334d7aa74b4.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  The third problem is the technical illiteracy of many subscribers.  They can ask anything, even if it is from the field of some science fiction. <br><br>  The fourth and probably the most unpleasant is inadequacy.  It does not matter if this is a problem on the side of the subscriber, or a problem with MegaFon - it can be obscene, tell about the actions of a sexual nature with the operator's mother, etc., for any reason.  And even so you can not send back.  First, politely (!) Ask the subscriber to communicate normally, and if it does not help, again, politely say goodbye and break the connection. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c8/ed8/ee7/0c8ed8ee73fccbb7e97b8fa8a03c845b.jpg"><br><br><blockquote> There are many calls, and if 8 years ago there were several operators and they had to know everything, then now the smart system redirects subscribers to those employees who can give the most qualified answer to the most frequent questions of this subscriber.  In general, everything is difficult :) <br><br>  It was a pleasant surprise for me when I learned that psychologists work with call-center employees who help to overcome such stresses.  Regular conduct of relevant classes is the norm. <br><br>  In the process of communication, another point was also found out: the call center is a real forge of personnel.  Talented employees do not stay long there for a long time, and usually go up to other departments. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7a/3f1/f50/e7a3f1f50fd7be0558bf933055d21dde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55b/be9/0b3/55bbe90b39352167fd064802170a031a.jpg"><br><br>  The very presence of several recreation areas and a kitchen, all the more so spacious - for workplaces in the Stavropol Territory is a rarity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/294/c56/12e/294c5612ea933c421a2cede6f1d8ea10.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e0/233/8a0/1e02338a0ec34b1a22b3c5a1410973eb.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://me.smkteam.net/photos/20111224_Megafon/IMG_8476.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://me.smkteam.net/photos/20111224_Megafon/IMG_8477.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://me.smkteam.net/photos/20111224_Megafon/IMG_8480.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/257/432/8e0/2574328e0e8d566c258d295cb13c2880.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e98/549/bad/e98549bad82e099e6fd0af0da0c1210d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8da/781/9a0/8da7819a0b7c604766fe015623200a24.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/449/448/365/4494483652a2affddb57c4e91158ec86.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/186/d3d/6d7/186d3d6d7722159dedbdc3fe1822473a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5d/f94/275/b5df9427530a9e6c9212ce693601234d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1c/279/467/a1c279467278ee31e3f09758105cb2dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/59c/17f/f6f/59c17ff6ffa2f35fc139091b9425f3ce.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef9/f5a/3e5/ef9f5a3e5badf471d76c8d68f50028d4.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136341/</a></p>
