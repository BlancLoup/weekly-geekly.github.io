Keep decisions secret, and then state them majestically and unexpectedly. </li><li>  Spread false information about what, why and how will change in the organization, do not talk about the consequences of change, and even better do not give any information at all.  Be silent or speak clearly.  Do not discuss with people involved in change, the need for utility, and the positive effects of change.  Take care that people do not consider the program of change important. </li><li>  Create an atmosphere of fear and distrust.  Stimulate egoism and continue to work in the old ways and methods, use the old rules. </li><li>  You all know better than others and want it to be so.  Information is power, isn't it?  So take care that no one knows more than you.  Do not share your knowledge with others and forbid other employees to do this.  Encourage them to invent a bicycle over and over again.  Use the principle of "divide and conquer." </li><li>  Do not pay attention to the development of your employees the skills they need in the new environment.  Let them think about themselves.  Take care that people do not know how the organization functions and how to satisfy the wishes of customers.  Do not give them the opportunity to make decisions about the processes for which they are responsible. </li><li>  Punish and scold people who have come up with good ideas.  Allow workers to criticize each other.  Swear at them and in no case do not praise. </li><li>  Do not show softness, do not take into account the personal ambitions of employees during the change.  Their preferences and interests are irrelevant.  They should take care of themselves. </li><li>  Do not forgive mistakes, even small ones.  Swear at people who have made mistakes and throw them first.  Make it clear that they can be dismissed for mistakes, transferred to another position or otherwise punished. </li><li>  Ignore people who resist change or criticize it.  Insist on your own suggestions and push them through, despite resistance. </li><li>  Immediately begin large-scale changes with solving the most difficult problems. </li></ol></div>
