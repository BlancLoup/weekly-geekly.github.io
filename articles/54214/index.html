Many probably had to act as an IT service provider, you also saw and analyzed how competitors sell IT services, but do you know how it all looks on the other side of the mirror?  The most interesting thing is that before that I worked on the vendor‚Äôs side, i.e.  seller, engaged in competitive strategy, analysis of competitive advantages and the formation of an osprey product and many things on the part of the customer and the seller look different.  A lot of observations have accumulated, some of them got into the article <a href="http://tools4cio.ru/index.php/2008/10/erp_selection/">‚ÄúHow not to make a mistake when choosing a new information business system?‚Äù</a> , Something got into the report <a href="http://tools4cio.ru/index.php/2008/10/erp_selection-2/">‚ÄúChoosing an ERP system, what should be the focus today?‚Äù</a> , Which I did at the Cnews conference in the fall 2008, well, and other materials in this blog. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But life turned so that a friend asked me to help him find artists to create an Internet portal.  Well, there is time, come on, I think I will help.  There is time, choosing IT contractors is easy, it's my job :)

      To help in a standard way - to recommend friends and joyfully, then drink beer with a friend?  Well, I think not, you need to hold a competition. <br><h2>  All grown up </h2><br><ul><li>  We do TZ </li><li>  Make the requirements for the answer to the task (tender documentation) </li><li>  Announce a contest </li><li>  We form a "short list" </li><li>  We choose the winner and make a small prepayment. </li></ul><br><h2>  Go? </h2><br>  Technical Assignment agreed, written, read.  Everything seems normal.  While the price of the issue is not known, I want a lot, which is normal, I guess.  While it is absolutely not clear what kind of functionality is required.  Well, nothing, looked at the competitors, gathered a fantasy into a fist and described in detail what, in our understanding, should be on the Internet portal. <br><h3>  Announce a contest </h3><br>  Thank God that this is an Internet portal and you need to find web developers, of which there are a lot of.  Chose a site with freelancers, as the budget is limited.  The project is funded by an individual and the profitability of the project is very vague. <br><blockquote><h3>  Website creation - portal for finding tutors </h3><br>  colleagues, in the attachment you can see TK.  The essence of the project is very simple - namely, to help users find a tutor by criteria.  It turns out something remotely resembled an online store. <br>  In TZ all this is written, pliz look.  If something is not clear, then you can ask a question in ICQ 69040211 <br>  Design is already being developed in this budget is not included (separately) and will be provided.  Layout is included in this project and in this budget. <br>  Now attention! <br>  In response, I would like to see your proposal, indicating the following: <br>  1. What platform do you plan to use (engine), just the words PHP is not needed here.  Encode from a blank sheet of budget is not enough. <br>  2. The breakdown of complexity and cost of functionality, i.e.  block of work with questionnaires - 1000 hours = 50.000 bucks.  This is necessary so that the customer can once again evaluate how much or other functionality he needs. <br>  3. Deadline <br>  4. Examples of works and happy customers so that I would believe you and be able to give a tiny advance payment. </blockquote><br><h2>  Have you arrived? </h2><br>  In ICQ, a person probably knocked at the first hour, probably 50. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to bring all the dialogues, but here are some examples <br><h3>  Example number 1.  I really want to eat, and there is nowhere to spend the night. </h3><br><blockquote><br>  <strong>Megavolt (12:31):</strong> <br>  good day <br>  <strong>Megavolt (12:34):</strong> <br>  Is the offer still relevant? <br>  <strong>Nemax (12:41):</strong> <br>  good day.  yes actually <br>  <strong>Megavolt (12:42):</strong> <br>  only trouble - I do not have a portfolio .. <br>  <strong>Nemax (12:43):</strong> <br>  How can you convince me of your qualifications? <br>  <strong>Megavolt (13:16):</strong> <br>  do not want me to cooperate with you? <br>  <strong>Nemax (13:17):</strong> <br>  why with you? <br>  <strong>Megavolt (13:25):</strong> <br>  Well, I can also add, fourthly ... in a crisis, you have to feed your family somehow .. <br></blockquote><br>  The argument is just damning, there is no portfolio, experience ... is doubtful, but the children are already there.  Jokes jokes, but the situation is not hopeless, if the guy already knows how to program in the web, then the portfolio can be made from projects where he participated and honestly indicate what role he had there. <br><h3>  Here is an example number 2.  Sales Manager. </h3><br><blockquote>  <strong>narkoman112 (17:17):</strong> <br>  Hello <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:19):</strong> <br>  good day <br>  <strong>narkoman112 (17:20):</strong> <br>  Is your project to create a portal for finding tutors relevant? <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:20):</strong> <br>  Yes <br>  <strong>narkoman112 (17:21):</strong> <br>  And you only accept the answer in the form described there?  )) <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:21):</strong> <br>  not.  the decision will be made after counting the pages of flooding in ICQ <br>  <strong>narkoman112 (17:22):</strong> <br>  clear <br>  Yes, I'm just not a programmer and I don‚Äôt know more than half of the words there, I‚Äôm just a client search manager.  Let me give you a chef ICQ, you talk to him, and he will tell you everything? <br></blockquote><br>  Oddly enough, but this is a TYPICAL sales manager.  I saw these very often.  Many of them are beginning to actively make friends.  Directly with all the fibers of their soul they show interest in the project, in the budget and demonstrate a desire to communicate, drink coffee, beer together, talk about ‚Äúa proposal that may be interesting to you personally,‚Äù etc. <br><h3>  Another example to give? </h3><br><blockquote>  <strong>Ilya-SMKvision.ru (12:50):</strong> <br>  Good day, I am on the creation of the portal <br>  <strong>Nemax (12:53):</strong> <br>  OK <br>  <strong>Ilya-SMKvision.ru (17:34):</strong> <br>  Have you decided on a performer? <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:34):</strong> <br>  not <br>  <strong>Ilya-SMKvision.ru (17:35):</strong> <br>  Our candidacy has already been considered? <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:36):</strong> <br>  not <br>  <strong>Nemax (17:36):</strong> <br>  and you wrote something? <br></blockquote><br>  Findings?  Yes, everything is simple - do not hesitate to sell yourself.  No need to hope that the client already knows you.  I think that it would be so correct, probably, to write to the studios of Artyom Lebedev.  Type (imposingly so) You considered us? <br><h2>  How correct? </h2><br>  Of these 50 references, 2-3 were very sensible, and they really liked it.  Put here?  Well, now there is a crisis, there are no customers, employers are playing short.  Yes, and then it will not go in store until the initiation procedure is followed. <br>  See the original on my site tools4cio.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54214/</a></p>
