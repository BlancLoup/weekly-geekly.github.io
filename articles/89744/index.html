Therefore, the whole day of April 1 was devoted to this event.  Below are my impressions of him.

      Registration was closed, invited address via e-mail participants of seminars, community work days or other events of Yandex.  There was no information in the corporate blog or in other public resources of Yandex.  Nevertheless, we managed to gather about 600 participants, who almost completely filled the conference room at the Radisson SAS Slavyanskaya hotel.  At the same time, the critical mass of SEOs and other parasites was avoided. <br><br>  But it should be noted that so far none of the high-tech companies have coped with the queue for registration :) <br><br><h4>  What happened </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. There were reports and presentations from Segalovich, Bakharevskaya, Sadovsky and others.  Reports are fun, not tiring.  But somehow more about love.  About the love of these people to Yandex.  They wanted to share this love with the audience. <br><br>  2. There were the stands of the School of Data Analysis and the Internship Program of Yandex, where you could communicate with people in charge of these areas, learn more about the programs and ask a lot of questions. <br><br>  3. There was an improvised computer class where a mini-cup on search and an assessor tournament were held during the breaks. <br><br>  4. There were a sufficient number of breaks, during which one could not only have a good snack, but also communicate informally with well-known media people from Yandex, who were abundant on that day.  They are Lena Kolmanovskaya, Roman Ivanov and Grigory Bakunov, as well as Anton Volnukhin, Andrei Sebrant, Ilya Segalovich and other stars.  And this part seems to me the most interesting and useful.  Because the interlocutors are all excellent.  And they create the image of the company as a possible future place of work, much better than various reports, presentations and new services. <br><br><h4>  What would you like to </h4><br><br>  Less pointers on hiring.  In addition to the message ‚ÄúIt is cool to work with us‚Äù, there were also accompanying messages.  You can boast your success, there is nothing bad in it.  But it would be nice to tell a little more about beautifully solved problems, as well as about unsolved problems. <br><br>  It remains unclear to me what people who will want to go to work with Yandex will do, what tasks they will solve.  And behind this incomprehensibility arises the idea that at first they will be engaged in not at all interesting things: layout, auxiliary functions, moderation, process support, and so on. <br><br>  That is a little less common words on the topic, how cool is Yandex, a little more formulas, a little more specifics about the development trends of Internet technologies, about the vision of the future.  After all, the audience was educated and greedy for the new.  So that people who are not going to go to work in this wonderful company, could draw interesting ideas and thoughts for independent projects. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/asebrant/album/95890/">Photos A. Sebranta</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">Hash tag on Twitter</a> </li></ul><br>  Slides and videos promised to post. <br><br>  But the conference was lively and interesting.  And honestly, you can say thank you for this opportunity to communicate with great people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89744/</a></p>
