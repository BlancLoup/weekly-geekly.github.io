Someone collects them manually, someone buys ready-made solutions, someone modifies ready-made solutions, but we all are very happy when the copter soars into the sky again and moves on our team, but air development is a very new experience, not like on the "earthly games", so you need to follow many different rules and strictly follow them to reduce the likelihood of repetition of my sad experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60a/2e6/a02/60a2e6a024c0d2350d1b2422691bdcb3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Naturally, it is extremely interesting to see what the quadrocopter sees and therefore more and more often you can notice different cameras on them, and for the picture to be stable, gyroscopic suspensions are added. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the <a href="https://toprater.com/">service of choice</a> based on reviews has not yet been launched, so the assembly was chosen as follows: <br>  <b>1. Quadcopter</b> <a href="https://dronk.ru/copter/37-dji-phantom-1">DJI Phantom</a> (popularly "candy wrapper") <br>  <b>2. Suspension</b> Tarot T-2D (special thanks to the guys who installed it) <br>  <b>3.</b> GoPro Hero 3 BE <b>Camera</b>

      And a month ago I was immensely happy when I found <a href="http://radiocopter.ru/">guys from Moscow State University in Moscow</a> , from whom I bought a new kopter at a price cheaper than from China, and when I got to their office, I saw all kinds of kopteris and realized that I found friends in spirit - so and it turned out.  I had a detailed guide, but alas, my attention was riveted on the device flying around the room and I probably missed a lot and even less asked, but in vain ... <br><br>  With the new flying machine, I headed for 1500 km to shoot a film about <a href="http://huskygo.karelia.ru/">dog sledding</a> , I have such a hobby - action-camera films to shoot and of course I was counting on a huge amount of new perspectives with my candy wrapper. <br><br>  Upon arrival in Kalevala, just throwing things in the room, I went to set up the kopter for flying to a new place and of course flying a bit.  It was a dark night in the yard, and the wind slightly prevented me from walking, but the desire to launch the copter was stronger, so after passing 10 meters from the hotel entrance, right in the parking lot, I set up a compass, caught all the satellites, checked the position of the toggle switches ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dce/b76/884/dceb768848ae2c19ed0ed8864003ec61.jpg"><br><br>  and took off ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60a/2e6/a02/60a2e6a024c0d2350d1b2422691bdcb3.jpg"><br><br>  Red-green lights against the black sky is certainly a stunner and I wanted to fly higher and higher, and at the top the wind intensified and the copter turned into a red-green dot than excited me a lot, but I still managed to lose altitude, not lost sight, and the copter successfully coped with the wind and returned to me. <br><br>  Immediately I will say that the candy wrapper has a function, which I, by my stupidity, did not know in advance - if the compass is set correctly, then switching the console to the desired position - you can pull the lever on the console towards you and the copter will fly back exactly where he is currently in the ass.  It is a very useful function if the copter has turned to a point and it is not known which way to steer in order for it to return. <br><br>  So, delighted with the first successful flight in complicated conditions, I felt that I was the god of piloting and went to bed calmly.  There were 2 days left before the races and for these 2 days I planned to bring my new skill to perfection ... but how wrong I was ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd9/1c5/067/cd91c5067da2591f3a61a355d2cd620d.jpg"><br><br>  The next day, the weather was cloudy, but more or less calm, so I managed to make several sorties, but one battery on the phantom was enough for 7 minutes, and I had only 2 batteries, so the training was limited to 14 minutes, which of course was not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56f/997/c3d/56f997c3d0cd5b5c490ba6881456e16d.jpg"><br><br>  The day before the races, the wind romped very actively and it was decided to cancel the flights, but the driver was lying in the car and closer to dinner there was a desire to fly at a level of 2-3 meters above the trees among the trees.  I flew 1.5 batteries and was already returning to the car when one friend asked me to show the copter at work and I could not refuse him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/035/495/fd8035495ab04b6492e55c73996352e4.jpg"><br><br>  Being sure, like an elephant, in my flight capabilities, I did not wait for all the satellites to catch and did not even pay attention to the position of all toggle switches on the console (here is an idiot) and took off.  I wanted to fly over the trees and fly over the lake, but then the wind came into play, and the kopter soared up into the sky, which literally after a couple of moments turned into a point that was quickly moving away from me. <br><br>  I ran in his direction and for a moment, from behind the trees, lost him from visibility.  Either he flew into low clouds, or the point became quite small, or he flew in the opposite direction ... but <b>from that moment I never saw him again</b> ... like my gopro hero 3 and tarot suspension ... and tomorrow the races began ... but this a completely different story ... <br><br>  <b>Errors that I made:</b> <br>  1. Decided to fly in inappropriate weather. <br>  2. I decided to fly with the camera, although I did not plan to shoot anything. <br>  3. I didn't wait for the copter to find all the satellites. <br>  4. I have not studied in detail the instructions and capabilities of the copter <br>  5. Took off on a weakened battery (in this state it can resist the wind even worse) <br>  ... <br>  the list goes on, but the most important thing is that I learned the main lesson for myself: <br>  - <b>It is necessary to approach piloting very seriously, and before each flight to conduct a thorough inspection of the equipment and be ready to cancel flights according to weather conditions</b> <br><br>  ps While I was running behind the copter, stumbling and looking at the sky, I accidentally switched both toggle switches on the remote, that is, keep in mind that they switch very easily and you need to somehow monitor them. <br>  pps In the GTA, I hated the school of pilots, where I had to perform various tricks on an airplane, but I had to go through it and now I can fly quite decently.  What a pity that I did not have a school of pilots for a quadcopter. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, a movie about dog sledding, which I still shot: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kyu2PuZ2Jgg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj1ZBKZX3X72Tz7okqIqIURhqyGUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Our other publications:</b> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270698/">Overview of the powerful tablet Chuwi Hi10 on a full Win10 for $ 180</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270254/">15 little things from heaven about which you would like to know</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">15 cool little things for the geek from the Middle Kingdom.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">Part 2</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269722/">Classes of quadcopters - which are and are used for</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270618/">Seven current copters up to $ 20, which can be put in your pocket</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269498/">Our little joy or budget than to please yourself on February 23?</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Xiaomi company.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Cheaper without damage to quality is no longer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/267722/">Chuwi Ilife V5 - a $ 99 robot vacuum cleaner or how to turn daily cleaning into entertainment</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/266778/">NEJE engraver laser overview or promising business model</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216791/</a></p>
