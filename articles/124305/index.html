  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Create an email newsletter that sells</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would risk appearing banal, but I will say: the ultimate goal of any commercial letter is the sale.  Sale of goods, services, brand - is not the point.  Consequently, the letter that you send to your customers must be compiled according to the rules and canons of the selling text.  <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru">UniSender</a> will help you understand exactly what the text should be in your newsletter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/17371d08/6500c34c/8539337b/3d607939.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, it is necessary to understand: the most successful outcome of most letters is to be read.  And this is the best.  In other cases, the letter gets into the read automatically or in general in the "Spam" folder.  An active web user is daily confronted with a huge array of heterogeneous information and is simply forced to pay attention only to the most important.  It remains to convince him that your letter is this "important".  :) <br><br><h2>  Show your respect and attention to the addressee </h2><br>  <i>Pious Great Sovereign King and</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Grand Prince John Vasilyevich Vseya</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Rusii message in all of his Great Rosii</i> <i><br></i>  <i>state on the criminals prince</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Andrei Mikhailovich Kurbsky with comrades</i> <i><br></i>  <i>about their treason</i>

      Very often mailings are a dry, addressless letter written only to inform potential customers about services.  I will say right away - this is wrong.  The addressee should receive a letter addressed to him.  Therefore, you should, if possible, find out the names of all the recipients and use them in the first sentence of the text-distribution. <br><br>  Do not try to start a letter with the appeal ‚ÄúDear Name!‚Äù  The word ‚Äúrespected‚Äù is found everywhere and everywhere so often that it managed to practically lose its semantic coloring and turned into an interjection.  :) The ‚ÄúDear‚Äù letter will not stand out from hundreds of similar ones and will be skipped. <br><br>  Try to break out of the usual series.  Depending on the target audience of the letter, you can use appeals from neutral ‚ÄúDear‚Äù to provocative ‚ÄúNative our‚Äù.  Naturally, you should not overdo it.  :) But if the addressee is attracted by the first offer, then we won.  It remains to keep his attention until the very end. <br><br>  But what if the names of the recipients are unknown?  Even in this case, the appeal must be present.  The simple word "Friends" (or "Colleagues") will give you the necessary bridge of emotional connection with the client. <br><br><h2>  Do not be a petitioner </h2><br>  <i>Hello dear,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Supplement day for you please</i> <i><br></i>  <i>forgive me if I interfere with your</i> <i><br></i>  <i>privacy, my name is Riassa Keita, 23 years old,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I am the only daughter of my parents. Late.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Mr / Mrs Frederick Keita from the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire</i> <i><br></i>  <i>in west Africa, my father was a tycoon and politician.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I noticed you are an important person before I</i> <i><br></i>  <i>decided to contact you.</i> <br><br>  One of the most common mistakes of letters-mailings can be called begging.  What is it about?  About texts like "Allow you to offer ...".  In this case, the author of the letter puts himself in the initially disadvantaged position of the petitioner, surrendering to the recipient's power. <br><br>  I think everyone somehow came across beggars on the subway, subways or just on the streets.  Sad characters sadly ask to pay attention to them and help with some amount of money.  So here. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAllow me to offer‚Äù is a beggar who hopes for the grace of passersby.  Will he succeed?  Perhaps and yes.  But do you want to be perceived as that character?  The question is rhetorical. <br><br>  Business is not charity.  The subjects of business cooperation are full-fledged partners, one of which satisfies an existing need for a service or product, and the other receives well-deserved money. <br><br>  You are not a petitioner.  You are a friend, a partner who has discovered a need in a client and offers to satisfy it.  Why should you ask the client for permission to help him? <br><br>  In a letter to an equal partner, you must explain to him that cooperation with you is more profitable than with competitors.  It turns out - your client.  In order to make a competent letter, put yourself in the place of a client and force them to answer five magic questions. <br><br><h2>  Come up with a shock header </h2><br>  <i>The life and amazing adventures of Robinson Crusoe,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>sailor from york who lived twenty eight years in</i> <i><br></i>  <i>total solitude on a desert island off the coast</i> <i><br></i>  <i>America, near the mouth of the Orinoco River, where he was thrown</i> <i><br></i>  <i>shipwreck during which the entire crew</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the ship except him died;</i>  <i>outlining his unexpected</i> <i><br></i>  <i>release by pirates, written by him.</i> <br><br>  So, we have only a few seconds to attract the attention of the recipient.  According to statistics, no more than eight.  How to force him to open our letter from an endless stream?  Definitely a catchy headline. <br><br>  The title should convince the addressee that he needs to read the letter.  And for this it is important that in the header the reader should already see the benefit that your offer carries. <br><br>  The art of writing ‚Äúkiller headlines‚Äù is quite difficult and not available to everyone.  But there is a general recommendation: the heading is a squeeze from the text.  Shorten your text by removing all irrelevant details.  Reduce it again and again, edit it in the direction of maximum information.  Sooner or later, the entire text should fit into a sentence of 4-6 words.  This is your headline.  :) <br><br><h2>  "We, Nicholas the Second ..." </h2><br>  <i>ABOUT!</i>  <i>I do not like to joke.</i>  <i>I asked them all ostrasku.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The Council of State itself fears me.</i>  <i>So what</i> <i><br></i>  <i>really?</i>  <i>I am so!</i>  <i>I will not look at anyone ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I say to everyone: ‚ÄúI know myself, myself.‚Äù I am everywhere, everywhere.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I go to the palace every day.</i>  <i>Tomorrow I will be produced now in field marsh ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Khlestakov</i> <br><br>  Imagine that you received a letter in which a distant acquaintance talks about his trip to his grandmother and about domestic anxieties and joys.  What reaction will this letter cause?  Some bewilderment.  Why do you need this information?  That's right, no need. <br><br>  Similarly, in the mailing lists.  If you talk about yourself, how great you are and how much you can do, what a wonderful team you have (and an individual approach to every client :), the client will shrug and forget.  Is he up to you? <br><br>  Let's go back to why we are writing a letter?  To offer the client a solution to his problem.  Well, then talk about it.  Tell us not about how good you are, but how the addressee will receive this and that with your help.  Show him that cooperation with you is beneficial and beneficial for the client himself. <br>  Just do not need ritual rituals on the topic of "a wide range of services", "an individual approach to each client" and "rich experience in this market."  These phrases more and more bring you closer to the stream of identical letters that go to the basket every day.  The sentence should be simple, clear and specific. <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúHi, Zhenyok!  And you, Nikolai Ivanovich, hello! " </h2><br>  <i>Dear madam, so be kind,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>would you please take a ride with me on</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Avenue, and how ebnu now on the head ...</i> <br><br>  When composing a text for mailing you need to be very clear about each of his readers.  Among your clients there are completely different companies and completely different people.  So why should they receive the same email? <br><br>  It is necessary to understand and take into account the needs of each audience and for each of them to prepare their own letter of distribution.  What can be acceptable and interesting for young people from a startup is not at all suitable for a bank clerk.  And vice versa. <br><br>  In order for the distribution to be as effective as possible, it is necessary to clearly divide the audience into segments and speak with each segment in their language.  It is clear that one or another part of the letter can be repeated.  But a completely neutral letter will leave the entire audience indifferent.  We don't want that, right? <br><br><h2>  "Fifteenth, you will get" </h2><br>  Yes, I believe that your company is the most wonderful and most versatile.  Therefore, you can do almost anything.  And quite naturally you want the client to know about all your services. <br><br>  Very often I have to deal with a sheet of text that lists even the smallest services that can be provided.  Tell me, will any of you be interested in reading a list of 30-40 points? <br><br>  Best of all, if the letter will talk about a single service (in extreme cases, a few, closely interrelated).  This will allow you to tell in detail about the benefits received by the client. <br><br>  Otherwise, you get ugly texts of 5-7 pages, which, naturally, no one in their right mind would even open it.  So, all the work invested in these pages will be wasted. <br>  Be concise.  Try to keep the text no more than three or four thousand characters.  At the same time, focus not on abstract benefits, but on concrete ones, supported by eloquent facts and figures.  The client loves the expression ‚Äúyour sales will grow by 67%‚Äù more than ‚Äúyour sales will rise by two thirds‚Äù. <br><br>  True concrete calculations of the benefits of a client are much more convincing than a sheet listing an impressive list of services. <br><br><h2>  Beautiful packaging is not important, the essence is important </h2><br>  Nonsense!  And we will prove it now.  Suppose you are a potential customer.  You receive two letters from competing companies, one of which is arranged according to all the rules, and the other - in plain text.  Which of the proposals will attract more attention?  Naturally one that is easier to read.  Including, due to registration. <br><br>  Do everything so that the client's eye, without stopping on anything, quietly slid over the text.  Let's rest by using bulleted lists, headings, sub-headings, epigraphs, paragraphs between spaces, and so on. <br><br>  Avoid dangling lines, water paragraphs and other debris.  It should be pleasant to look at the issued letter. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  We specifically tried to deviate as much as possible from the specific words and expressions that you could use in your newsletter.  The text of the newsletter must be the result of creative work, subject to general laws.  Like any result of creativity, the distribution will bear the imprint of the individuality of its creator, and therefore will stand out among the rest, written on the textbook templates. <br><br>  Write your customers letters.  And you will succeed.  And <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru">UniSender</a> will make your letters reach the destination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124305/</a></p>
