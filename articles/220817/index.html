Probably, many of you have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/220553/">heard</a> that we are starting to provide mobile services.  Moreover, we will become the fourth federal mobile operator.  At the moment, you can become a user of the Yota operator in the territory of Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as their areas in the mode of limited commercial operation.  At the same time, residents of these regions will be able to use the services of the fourth federal operator Yota throughout Russia, as well as in international roaming.  In the future, Yota plans to launch in all regions of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Our mobile services are primarily intended for users of smartphones and tablets, for whom it is important to be constantly online and who are accustomed to using mobile Internet without restrictions. <br><br>  We offer our customers: <br>  ‚Ä¢ federal 2G / 3G / 4G coverage based on Scartel and MegaFon networks; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 100% unlimited internet for smartphones; <br>  ‚Ä¢ unlimited calls Yota-Yota; <br>  ‚Ä¢ non-roaming space throughout Russia; <br>  ‚Ä¢ unlimited SMS messages; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the number of voice minutes to numbers of other operators and landline numbers the user can choose; <br>  ‚Ä¢ federal mobile numbers of the format +7 999. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We do not offer tariff plans in the usual sense.  During the period of limited commercial operation for users of the Moscow region and the Leningrad region, the subscription fee includes 300 minutes of voice communication for calls to numbers of other operators, unlimited Internet, SMS and calls within the Yota network.  In the future, you yourself can select the required number of voice minutes for calls to numbers of other mobile operators and city phones.

      We also abandoned traditional sales channels and ways to support users.  You can order a Yota SIM card via the website <a href="http://www.yota.ru/voice">www.yota.ru/voice</a> or a mobile application, after which it will be delivered by courier or to your chosen point of issue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31f/d4f/d36/31fd4fd36e4750cdfd4659424b6cd823.jpg"><br><br>  Our customers will be supported primarily on the site and in the mobile application to help the call center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/d2e/bf8/132d2ebf828b6565a04030d01eb9473b.jpg"><br><br>  Management of all services will be available through the mobile application and call center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a1/372/bf1/6a1372bf1a7f2fa5c935f843386b3a52.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/102/88d/b18/10288db184ccdcd05b173115397db5e6.jpg"><br><br>  Another advantage for our users is a universal SIM card.  It is broken out of the original packaging in the size you need - regular, microSIM and nanoSIM, - due to which it can be used in any smartphone or tablet. <br><br>  We invite our current customers, customers and everyone who wants to become the first users of the new federal mobile operator Yota.  You can leave a request for connection on the website: <a href="http://www.yota.ru/voice">http://www.yota.ru/voice</a> . <br><br>  We will inform you about the start of sales of SIM-cards in other regions. <br><br><h3>  Additions and clarifications </h3><br><br>  In connection with the large number of questions that arose after the publication of the message, we decided to supplement the post with information on the most vital details: <br><br>  <b>About "tariffs"</b> <br>  As we have said, we do not offer ‚Äútariffs‚Äù in the classic sense.  Instead, we immediately offer the best package of services.  For the period of limited commercial exploitation, a package offer is available, which includes: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ unlimited Internet <br>  ‚Ä¢ unlimited SMS <br>  ‚Ä¢ free calls within the Yota network throughout Russia <br>  ‚Ä¢ free incoming calls from all operators <br>  ‚Ä¢ 300 minutes for outgoing calls within the Russian Federation <br><br>  All components of the package operate in roaming in Russia. <br><br>  By the time of a wide commercial launch, it will be possible to design a package for yourself, choosing the number of minutes, connecting additional services, etc.  The cost of services will appear as they become available. <br><br>  Separately, we want to clarify the concept of "base rate".  It is worth considering it as the state of a SIM card when a user has run out of a package, until the moment of charging the subscription fee for the next billing period.  This tariff was introduced in order not to leave subscribers without communication until the moment of account replenishment and renewal of the main package.  It is for this period that the paid inbound outside the home region is indicated. <br><br>  It is for these two cases that the paid inboxes outside the home region are indicated. <br><br>  By limited commercial exploitation is meant that for the time being only users of Moscow, St. Petersburg and relevant areas can become users of the Yota operator.  If you live in one of these cities, or in the Moscow region, or in the Leningrad region, then you can place a pre-order for connection. <br><br>  Currently, only one package of services is available, here you can read in detail what is included in it. <br>  Upon completion of the limited commercial operation period, residents of all other regions of Russia will be able to become users of the Yota operator.  At the same time, the range of services offered will be expanded. <br><br>  <b>About unlimited</b> <br><br>  Our goal is to provide the best quality of the Internet on smartphones and tablets for all users, therefore, if untargeted use of the SIM card, we reserve the right to reduce the speed to 32 kbps: <br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwill be reduced to 32 kbps <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ when using a sim card in modems and routers <br>  ‚Ä¢ when using p2p networks <br><br>  <b>Pro service management</b> <br><br>  According to updated information, you can manage services only through a mobile application or by contacting customer support.  So far, for iOS users, there is only an option to leave a request for an alert on the <a href="http://yota.ru/voice/">yota.ru/voice</a> website, as soon as it appears, you will immediately know about it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220817/</a></p>
