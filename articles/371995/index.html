But let's face it - many people miss this moment, in the depths of their hearts hoping that everything will work out and nothing will happen to your data carrier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/5aa/3e5/8415aa3e56214d7193057fea23f79b9e.png"><br><br>  And when something happens due to different circumstances (either from your fault, or from the hosting provider, or natural disaster), it remains only to clutch at the head and regret that you did not save your information in advance.  Conclusion one, sadly, but only you are to blame. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/558/8c6/4125588c6ff940ddad7e0974e41c6eaf.png">

      Here are some Backblaze statistics: 2000 users were polled, they were asked how often they backed up their valuable information.  Indicators can be terrifying: 25% of respondents said that they never make backup copies, 39% make backups once a year, and only 8% make backups once a day, 9% - once a week.  It turns out that 64% of the respondents are at risk of losing months of accumulated information, tens of hundreds of photos, invoices, valuable documents, files, all this can lead to downtime and not only (nerve cells are not restored). <br><br>  Who does not risk - he does not drink champagne!  But in this case it is inappropriate.  Where is the guarantee that your data carrier will not be among the "lucky ones" and will not fall. <br><br>  After all, you can store photos in iCloud, letters - in the Hosted Exchange system, automatically create backup copies online every day.  You can also save data to another external hard drive.  It is recommended to ideally generally use two methods of backup. <br><br>  Few of those who once lost data continues to also lightly refers to backups. <br><br>  If you do not want to pay for the backup service, then this information is for you. <br><br><h3>  Top 5 Free Backup Services </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fd/675/df8/1fd675df8e1d4c1fa8537b8abecfc75f.png"><br><br>  <b>1. <a href="https://www.idrive.com/">IDrive</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/550/7da/d9a/5507dad9a23346e3a4868415b783c932.png"><br>  Pros: high security, 20 GB disk quota, <br>  Minus: free. <br><br>  IDrive tops this list, the proposed functionality will pleasantly surprise you.  You automatically get 5 GB of free space with the ability to increase it further to 20 GB.  A free subscription to IDrive gives you access to a large number of functions, including both local backup, archiving, and connecting to a NAS.  You can directly download files from Facebook and Instagram. <br><br>  In case, if 20GB is not enough, you can upgrade to one of the paid IDrive packages, the price of which starts from $ 3.75 per month for 1TB of disk space. <br><br>  <b>2. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/acc/cd6/0f1acccd6bee486990b78677d0d4ab9c.png"><br><br>  Pros: up to 18GB of available disk space. <br>  Cons: free. <br><br>  One of the most famous providers on the market, Dropbox offers quite a few to its users.  As they say, Dropbox works the way you want.  You can automatically save backup copies of documents, photos and open them anywhere and on any device. <br><br>  You are given 2GB of space, and inviting friends can increase this figure to 18 GB, for a successful campaign of one of your friends, you get 500MB.  You can also earn a few more GB by advertising Dropbox on a repost on Twitter or Facebook. <br><br>  This service is practical and convenient, easy to use. <br><br>  But the service cannot boast a high security indicator, the confidentiality of your data is still questionable (ask this question before registering). <br><br>  If Dropbox is suitable for you in all respects and you need more space, you can buy 1TB for $ 11 per month. <br><br>  <b>3. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive">Google Drive</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/4cf/939/9254cf939ffb4f24a8ea033fe36a2644.png"><br><br>  Pros: up to 15 GB of disk space, sharing files and folders. <br>  Cons: very much all sharpened by Google. <br><br>  Google Drive offers a flexible service, you can create and edit documents online.  If you are looking for an alternative to MS Office and you like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpermanent automatic saving, this service is for you. <br><br>  Google Drive provides 15 GB of free disk space, but there is also an added bonus - files created using Google‚Äôs services (for example, documents, spreadsheets and slides) are not counted.  You can even convert files created in other formats to google.  Backup files are stored in the cloud service.  But still confidentiality remains in question.  Before downloading important documents, take care of protecting them with a password, one of the ways is to create an encrypted archive. <br><br>  If you still have insufficient space, you can upgrade to a paid package from $ 100 per month for 100GB, or get 30TB for $ 299.99 / month. <br><br>  <b>4. <a href="http://www.memopal.com/">Memopal</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd1/796/419/cd17964195c4450082234749ace706da.png"><br><br>  Pros: up to 13 GB of free space, easy to use. <br>  Cons: lame security. <br><br>  Italian backup service Memopal provides 3Gb of free space for storing your data, you can increase the space to 10GB by ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù inviting friends. <br><br>  You can use the full range of Memopal features, including useful options such as backup, archiving.  Although the disadvantage of this service is security, or rather its not quite high level.  The software is simple, the service is clear and accessible to the user. <br><br>  If you decide to upgrade your account, it will cost you $ 7 / month for 500MB. <br><br>  <b>5. <a href="https://www.syncplicity.com/">Syncplicity</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a78/b5e/af3/a78b5eaf30e748dcb96ce64d6d3833a2.png"><br><br>  Pros: up to 10GB of disk space, simple and easy to use. <br>  Cons: complicated in the settings, a little extra functionality. <br><br>  10GB of free disk space, easy to use, offers the ability to share files, upload and download data is simple.  Due to this, this service is in the list of the top 5.  The main functionality necessary for backing up your data is present and works well. <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt have enough free space of 10 GB, you can purchase 100 GB for $ 5 per month. <br><br>  The top five services were selected not only those that offered more free gigabytes of space, they also took into account the quality of the product provided, ease of use, reliability. <br><br><h3>  5 best backup services (non-free) under Windows </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/242/f14/30d/242f1430d85d4711907555e31789e1ac.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.code42.com/crashplan/%3FAID%3D11645451%26PID%3D6220120%26utm_source%3DCJ%26utm_medium%3DAffiliate%26utm_campaign%3DCJ_Affiliate">1.
