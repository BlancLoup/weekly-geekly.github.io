I give% ^ th to the clipping that you also did it.  But when the wrong words appear in your resume, it makes it lame. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And these are not the variations of the three-letter word.  These are literary words.  They are generally accepted.  They may stain your resume with the catchphrase phrase "no good."  <i>Hiring managers can identify these slop words in seconds, making your hard work on your resume useless.</i>

      How to write a wonderful resume without verbal sediment in it?  How to turn words from wrong to right?  In order for you to receive invitations for an interview, further, <i>I will show how to turn 6 slop words into skills that will speak for you</i> . <br><br><h4>  1. Responsibilities </h4><br>  My lips clench and frown in readiness to make a deep sound "fu-oo-oo-oo-oo" when I read the section "Responsibilities" in the summary.  Of course, you are responsible for something.  But how big is your responsibility?  How long have you been responsible for this?  What?  Where?  When?  Instead of forcing the hiring manager to read a vague list of your responsibilities, be specific and <a href="http://www.squawkfox.com/2008/11/18/10-ways-to-build-a-resume-like-a-professional-resume-writer-the-dos/">state the qualitative and quantitative indicators of</a> your activity that prove your skills and achievements. <br><br>  <b>Employers want to see numbers and facts</b> .  Write interest, amounts, and other numbers that best demonstrate your achievements.  Prove that you have something to show you are hired. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  Was responsible for creating instructions for users before submitting the project. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Wrote six instructions for 15,000 users two weeks before project delivery. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad:</b> <br>  He was responsible for managing the cost of production. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Reduced the cost of production by 15 percent within three months. </blockquote><br><br>  A resume that avoids the vagueness of the ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù clause, and instead focuses attention on the details of growth, cost reductions, the number of employees you control, budget size, sales and profits, is sure to win an invitation for an interview. <br><br><h4>  2. Skills and experience </h4><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_Experienced%253F_(song)">Are you experienced?</a>  This is cool.  But, instead of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DW4yZXb4aD2Q">quoting Jimi Hendrix</a> on your resume, please tell us what your experience consists of.  Just saying that you are experienced in something and showing the facts of your experience are two completely different approaches. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  PHP development experience </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Developed an electronic shopping cart for the company Fortune 500 for PHP </blockquote><br><br>  <i>Recruitment managers want to know in detail what kind of experience, skills and qualifications you offer.</i>  Tell it to them without uttering the phrase ‚ÄúExperience with ...‚Äù <br><br><h4>  3. Excellent writing skills </h4><br>  Yes, I understand that this is not one word, but rather a whole phrase.  And this phrase should die.  Is she yours <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  I have excellent writing skills </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Wrote contextual help on the application, and thereby achieved a reduction in the number of calls to customer support by 50 percent. </blockquote><br><br>  If you have written communication skills, write about how you communicated.  Did you communicate with customers by email, or prepare marketing materials or create documentation for users?  Did you work with legal documentation, business plans, or make offers for potential clients?  But so that you do not write, do not forget to specify specific details. <br><br><h4>  4. Team player </h4><br>  Did you come here to play basketball?  If you do not want to sit on the bench with other unemployed ‚Äúteam players‚Äù, then do not forget to include facts from your past activities. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  I work well in a team in large and small teams. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  He worked with clients, developers, technical writers and user interface designers to complete a financial reporting project three months before the planned delivery date. </blockquote><br><br>  If you want to ‚Äúthrow the ball in the basket‚Äù, then clearly indicate the facts of your teamwork. <br><br><h4>  5. Pedantic </h4><br><br>  What does your pedantry mean?  Tell in detail about the details that you observe.  Concentrate your reader on the details. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  Professional promotion, able to give attention to the details. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Created various press releases sent to 25 news agencies across Europe. </blockquote><br><br>  <i>If you have specifics in your hands, share it with the hiring manager.</i>  Show the facts, numbers, deadlines, sums of money and all the data that will help sell your skills and outrun competitors. <br><br><h4>  6. Success </h4><br>  I hope that you have listed only success in your resume.  So if everything is a success, so why mention this word once more?  Stick to showing your successes through concrete examples of what you have done to be successful. <br>  Let your skills, qualifications and achievements speak for you. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Bad example:</b> <br>  Successfully sold the product. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Good:</b> <br>  Increased organic chocolate sales by 32 percent </blockquote><br><br>  When it comes to your success, please do not hesitate.  Show yourself from the best side, sing praises to yourself and sell your skills. <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br><br>  Now you know about them.  About the six most lame words and phrases that can be found in your resume today.  Focusing on the facts, detailing the details in detail, detailing your qualifications, you dramatically increase your chances of getting an invitation for an interview. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dmitry_zhariy/" class="user_link">Dmitry_Zhariy</a> says: <br>  <b>Read this text in English!</b> <br><img src="http://k.min.us/ilPp06.png" align="left">  Try to read the text of this article in English in order to improve your skills and goodness. <br>  The following link leads to a bilingual (mixed, English and Russian) version of this article.
