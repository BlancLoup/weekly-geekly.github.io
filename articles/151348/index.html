  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meet ePayService MasterCard¬Æ</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  This is our first post <s>and, hopefully, not the last</s> in the corporate blog, so, in order not to waste time, let's get straight to the point.  Today we want to introduce you to one of our key products, our white-label - ePayService MasterCard card program <sup></sup>  . <br><br><h5>  What are ePayService payment cards? </h5><br>  EPayService cards are registered debit dollar cards of MasterCard class <sup></sup>  Standard.  This means that this card is suitable for paying for purchases in offline stores, as well as on the Internet.  Do not be confused by the fact that the card is a dollar card - you can withdraw funds from the card worldwide in any national currency loaded into an ATM.  And you can be sure that the losses during the conversion will be minimal, and the exchange rate is as close as possible to the MasterCard rate. <sup></sup>  . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  How are ePayService cards different from those on the market? </h5><br>  It's simple.  Among all the more or less known programs, only ours can boast of the lowest tariffs on the market and high daily / monthly limits.  Judge for yourself: <br>  1. The maximum withdrawal limit is up to 10,000 USD per day and up to 300,000 USD per month. <br>  2. One withdrawal at an ATM costs exactly 1.5 USD, without interest.  For our part, we do not charge a cent more.  However, be careful: in some countries (for example, in Ukraine), banks can install their add.  commission, while in Russia and Europe, banks do not charge additional interest. <br>  3. Replenishment of the card from your USD-account in ePayService is absolutely free. <br>  4. Shopping on the Internet and offline stores are not subject to additional commission. <br>  5. The card is also issued for free.

      Total: ePayService MasterCard <sup></sup>  - This is a universal card with high limits and low tariffs, which can be replenished at any time, from anywhere in the civilized world, without limiting yourself to a source of replenishment: it can be a Google Adsense check, a transfer from Amazon or your partner from Europe. <br><br><h5>  How to recharge ePayService card? </h5><br>  The ePayService card is replenished directly from a USD account in our payment system.  Replenishment occurs instantly in automatic mode.  There is a counter question: how to replenish the USD account in ePayService?  Our system is used by professionals, not housewives.  These are mainly: international IT companies, gamedev studios, affiliate programs and freelancers.  Accordingly, the methods of account replenishment in ePayService are mostly highly professional: <br>  1. Cashing a bank check in your name (in USD) or in the name of our company (in EUR, CAD, GBP). <br>  2. Acceptance of international wire transfer Wire Transfer to the details of our company with the data of your account number in ePayService, including from third parties. <br>  3. Acceptance of ACH / DirectDeposit from payers from the USA (Hi, Amazon!). <br>  4. Instant replenishment of a USD-account with a WMZ-transfer through a merchant from the WebMoney Transfer system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecd/d18/166/ecdd1816633f357dfda0dbfb0f3895ad.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Nice bonuses </h5><br>  Oh yes, they are!  And always will be, because we do not stand still and are constantly evolving. <br>  This is how we can make you happy: <br>  1. You can link an ePayService card to PayPal to make purchases.  A painful problem for the countries of the former USSR may be a thing of the past. <br>  2. Available mobile applications for Android and iOS to work with your account (top-up cards, transfers between other users of the system, sending Wire Transfer and checks).  Applications are available for download on <a href="http://goo.gl/MjD6h">Google Play</a> and the <a href="http://goo.gl/5LY7O">Apple App Store</a> . <br>  3. At your service is a convenient SMS service for replenishing your card from a USD account in ePayService - just one SMS.  Fans of old phone models tremble. <br>  4. It is possible to accept payments from Google AdSense, Amazon, Apple, COPEAC, CCBill and other Western giants of the Internet and offline business. <br><br>  And most importantly: we are open for cooperation.  Affiliate program, small studio, IT giant?  Welcome!  Among our customers are already listed companies such as: Alawar Entertainment Inc, Gaijin Entertainment Inc, AdvancedHosters Ltd, eBayToday.ru and many others.  We hope your name will add to this list. <br><br>  If you have read this far, it means that our product has interested you and it is time to tell who we are.  Our team has been involved in finance on the Global Web for at least 6 years.  During this time, a small service for cashing checks from Google AdSense (and other Western companies) gradually grew into a serious business with insurance, social packages, annual audits, regular renewal of licenses and other implications.
