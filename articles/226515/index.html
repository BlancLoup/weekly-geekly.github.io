  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Benefits of Jelastic pricing over Amazon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Jelastic is often compared with Amazon Web Services, as these two clouds have a lot in common: simplifying cloud computing, a web interface for creating and managing environments, a wide choice of software stacks and full control over servers, with the ability to use all the necessary settings and much more. <br><br>  In this article, we would like to draw attention to one very significant difference between <a href="http://jelastic.com/">Jelastic</a> and Amazon EC2 - the pricing system. <br><br><h2>  <b>Price policy</b> </h2><br>  The main idea behind Amazon EC2 pricing is that you use a predetermined amount of resources for adding servers.  To get some extra resources, you will have to purchase a server <a href="http://alestic.com/2011/02/ec2-change-type">twice as much as</a> already used.  As a result, this leads to a significant increase in cost, if necessary, only slightly increase the amount of resources.  Even if your application consumes less resources than is available on one Amazon server, you still have to pay for all of its volume.  Moreover, if you just want to resize the current server, without transferring data you will have to use EBS, which costs significantly more than non-EBS AMI.

Also, users can change the size of the server without transferring data and additional settings.  Moreover, due to the automatic vertical scaling, there is no charge for unused resources. <br><br>  <a href="http://docs.jelastic.com/pricing-model">The universal price model</a> Jelastic allows you to choose between flexible, fixed or hybrid pricing (a combination of the first two).  Thus, you pay only for the actual consumption of resources. <br><br>  Jelastic also provides automatic volume discounts, i.e.  the more resources you use, the cheaper the unit costs.  The appropriate discount amount is automatically selected when the amount of resources used increases.  Thus, the flexibility and agility of the pricing policy of Jelastic provides favorable conditions for various types of applications. <br><br><h2>  <b>Automatic scaling for price optimization</b> </h2><br>  Jelastic and Amazon EC2 provide an excellent opportunity to scale resources to optimize the price, making it more acceptable to the user.  However, the implementation of this functionality is completely different in these clouds.  Therefore, the impact of scaling on the price is different.  Amazon supports <b>horizontal</b> scaling, while Jelastic provides both <b>horizontal</b> and <b>vertical</b> scaling. <br><br><h3>  Amazon EC2 </h3><br>  When an application hosted on Amazon is growing, it becomes necessary to switch to a larger server in order to get additional resources - you cannot simply <b>scale them up</b> .  Also, instead of starting a new server and setting it up ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, you can try changing the size of the server being used by moving it to more suitable equipment.  To do this, you will have to use EBS, which will cause new technical difficulties and increased costs.  Moving from a small server to a large one requires switching the disk from one virtual machine to another, which can lead to downtime for some time. <br><br>  For production applications, it is possible to use <b>horizontal scaling</b> .  Amazon EC2 allows you to automatically scale the resources you use, depending on the conditions you define.  You need to specify how many servers to add if resource consumption grows.  Sometimes you have to reserve even more than you actually need, simply because it is impossible to accurately predict the needs of your application. <br><br><h3>  Jelastic </h3><br>  In turn, Jelastic provides <b>automatic vertical scaling of</b> processor power and RAM (cloudlet = 128 MB of RAM and 200 MHz CPU).  You simply set the maximum limit for resource consumption, and Jelastic automatically allocates only the really necessary amount of resources for your application. <br><br>  Accordingly, with Jelastic you get excellent granulation when scaling.  Unlike Amazon, adding resources to Jelastic is done automatically and in small quantities (according to the size of the <a href="http://docs.jelastic.com/cloudlet">cloudlet</a> ).  If you need to extend fixed scaling limits, you can do it manually, without having to reboot the virtual machine or move to another server (which is a prerequisite for Amazon). <br><br>  You can also reserve a certain amount of Jelastic resources if you are sure that your application uses them.  Such reserved keys cost less.  As a result, you save even more by not using unsolicited resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc9/ac0/f70/cc9ac0f706e3e9b0c9e873e3c0bd5771.png" alt="automatic vertical scaling"><br><br>  In addition, you can easily scale the application <b>horizontally</b> by adding additional servers.  Horizontal scaling can be performed manually via the control panel or automatically, using the Jelastic API.  In the near future, this process will become even more flexible and automated - you can customize the triggers to initialize automatic horizontal scaling. <br><br><h2>  <b>Cost comparison for real applications</b> </h2><br>  Let's analyze the real projects.  Below we will present the actual resource consumption sizes with real applications and compare the costs of these resources for Jelastic and Amazon EC2. <br><br>  As an example, we will look at four applications deployed on the Jelastic platform.  They represent different areas of business, and also differ in geographical location: <br>  services for tourists in South America <a href="http://onde.ir/">http://onde.ir</a> <br>  game studio in South America <a href="http://murastudio.com/">http://murastudio.com</a> <br>  Foundation for the Development of Internet Initiatives in Russia (IIDF) <a href="http://iidf.ru/">http://iidf.ru</a> <br>  Higher School website in the USA <a href="http://saprigrat.whelastic.net/">http://saprigrat.whelastic.net</a> <br><br>  For fair comparison, we‚Äôll use the appropriate Amazon prices in these regions. <br><br><blockquote>  It is also interesting to note that the hardware settings of the hosting service providers <br>  Jelastic correspond at least to the settings of m1. * On Amazon (it depends on the provider).  In addition, they are configured for fast I / O operations and are optimized through the use of SAN arrays with high-performance SSD and SAS data stores, which corresponds to m3., C3.  or i2. * Amazon servers. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  Hosting in South America </h3><br>  The first two applications of our examples ( <a href="http://onde.ir/">tourist services</a> and a <a href="http://murastudio.com/">game studio</a> ) are located in <b>South America</b> ( <a href="https://app.jelasticlw.com.br/">Locaweb</a> ).  Both are deployed in environments with an application server and a database. <br><br>  For normal performance of a <a href="http://onde.ir/">travel application</a> on Amazon, you must select the <b>m1.medium</b> EC2 server type for the database, and the <b>m1.large</b> server type for the application server.  These are 3.7 GB and 7.5 GB of RAM, respectively.  Thus, the cost of hosting for the year is approximately <b>$ 1,025</b> for the use of the database and <b>$ 2,549</b> for the application server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/990/090/6c0/9900906c00d9c7d6a078e1d5a284d3f7.png" alt="amazon south america hosting"><br><br>  The initial price of Jelastic and Amazon resources is very close, but it must be borne in mind that with Jelastic you can not reserve resources that you do not need using automatic vertical scaling, and also receive a wide range of discounts, which significantly reduces the final amount to be paid. <br><br>  Therefore, with all the features of Jelastic, hosting such an application as <a href="http://onde.ir/">Onde.ir</a> costs <b>$ 444</b> per database and <b>$ 621</b> per application server per year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1a/e54/56f/b1ae5456f7df09c030cfb9d2376439a9.png" alt="locaweb pricing"><br><br>  Comparing the pricing of Jelastic and Amazon EC2, it can be noted that the annual cost savings with Jelastic is <b>52%</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/498/1bf/8e2/4981bf8e278f615172d573da9710364f.png" alt="Jelastic vs Amazon South America pricing"><br><br><h4>  <b>Let's take a look at what makes Jelastic pricing profitable for the user.</b> </h4><br>  Automatic vertical scaling in Jelastic is a unique technology that allows you to significantly reduce costs, because you only pay for what you use.  No need to reserve resources (more than you really need).  Just set the maximum limit, and Jelastic will automatically use only the necessary amount of resources. <br><br>  The only reason why you should reserve resources in Jelastic is additional discounts, because our hosting providers charge a fee for reserved keyboard at a reduced price.  You can reserve a minimum amount of resources and save even more. <br><br>  Providers of Jelastic hosting services (including Locaweb from South America) also offer discounts based on the amount of resources consumed - the more you use, the lower the cost.  The advantages of this pricing model can be seen on the example of our next application - <a href="http://www.murastudio.com/">murastudio.com</a> <br><br>  With Amazon, this application will need an <b>m1.small</b> virtual machine (1.7 GB) for the application server and <b>m1.medium</b> (3.7 GB) for the database.  Thus, in the year you will have to allocate about <b>$ 1,533</b> of your budget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/a66/59a/467a6659aa1c32f9f46d4e68225c9840.png" alt="amazon price per year"><br><br>  At the same time, Jelastic hosting providers (in this case, Locaweb) provide a flexible discount system that will help you to reduce costs.  With Jelastic you will pay approximately <b>$ 1,153</b> for the consumption of the above resources per year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f92/6c7/6a2/f926c76a262e7b203fee5a531969c39b.png" alt="jelastic hosting pricing in south america"><br><br>  This is about 25% savings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27f/f34/bb1/27ff34bb1e3e53d03e5b3d61d80a0d40.png" alt="save 25%"><br><br><h3>  Hosting in Russia </h3><br>  To compare the costs of hosting applications in Europe, we will consider an application for <a href="http://iidf.ru/">the Internet Initiatives Development Fund</a> , located on <a href="https://app.jelastic.regruhosting.ru/">REG.RU</a> (Russia).  This application is deployed in an environment with multiple application servers. <br><br>  To cover the needs of this application in Amazon, we need several virtual machines like <b>m1.large</b> for application servers (7.5 GB each).  For these resources you will have to pay <b>$ 6676</b> per year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bca/399/6da/bca3996da18749a37ddc2482f8c845eb.png" alt="amazon hosting in Ireland"><br><br>  At the same time, with Jelastic you will pay only <b>$ 3,283</b> per year.  This is the result of automatic vertical scaling and discounts based on the size of consumption implemented in our system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60e/bb2/6dc/60ebb26dc0caff69c18ee89731392aff.png" alt="jelastic hosting in Russia"><br><br><blockquote>  It is noteworthy that at least the hourly price in Jelastic and higher, the total amount payable is 50% less than in Amazon. </blockquote><br>  If you used 50% of the resources, you only pay for them - a penny more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c50/475/71f/c5047571fc70f49d63b5dc3a8edbf172.png" alt="save 50%"><br><br><h3>  US Hosting </h3><br>  Finally, let's compare Amazon and Jelastic in the USA.  The object of this experiment will be a <a href="http://saprigrat.whelastic.net/">high school</a> application deployed on <a href="https://app.whelastic.net/">Webhosting.net</a> , with one application server and the Maven build node. <br><br>  With Amazon, we need <b>m1.small</b> virtual machine (1.7 GB) for the application server and <b>t1.micro</b> (0.615 GB) for Maven.  Price per year at Amazon will be <b>$ 632</b> . <br><br><blockquote>  Please note that we do not select <b>t1.micro</b> for the server, because it has very low disk I / O performance and cannot be used for production.  That is why we preferred the more powerful <b>m1.small</b> , which is the simplest option from the <b>list</b> of suitable ones. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eea/bf3/bcc/eeabf3bcc79c1726c6f4b51f80eee170.png" alt="amazon hosting in usa"><br><br>  Meanwhile, with Jelastic this application does not consume even the minimum amount of resources requested by Amazon.  And, using Jelastic's automatic vertical scaling and pricing based on consumption volumes, the owners of this application save a huge amount of money.  The price per year with Jelastic cloud is <b>$ 155</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/438/053/d0343805340887560fea853469850c0d.png" alt="jelastic hosting in usa"><br><br>  As a result, you get almost 73% savings every year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/c1e/a74/6e0c1ea74bfdd702cc9ea31cb1bad3fd.png" alt="save 73%"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  In conclusion, let's summarize the pricing policies of Amazon and Jelastic: advantages and disadvantages, costs and savings. <br><br>  <b>Amazon EC2</b> <br><ul><li>  Offers only servers with fixed consumption limits. </li><li>  Each next server type is usually 2 times larger and 2 times more expensive than the previous one. </li><li>  You always pay the maximum cost, regardless of the amount of resources consumed by the application. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt just add more resources for one server in case of load peaks: you need to use more servers or add additional ones and, accordingly, pay extra for it </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Jelastic</b> <br><ul><li>  The application is scaled by conventional units of resources, each of which is equal to 200 MHz of processor power and 128 MB of RAM </li><li>  You can reserve the minimum amount of resources needed for your application to get a discount, and also set a maximum limit in case the application needs more resources. </li><li>  Your application is charged hourly based on actual resource consumption thanks to automatic vertical scaling technology. </li><li>  Thanks to automatic discounts, the more resources are consumed, the cheaper they are. </li><li>  Granular vertical scaling solves the problem with load peaks </li></ul><br><br>  We hope that our examples have clarified the price differences between Amazon and Jelastic.  Which platform and geographic location of the hosting to choose, which will be better and more profitable for your application - the decision is yours.  You can test the Jelastic platform during the <a href="http://jelastic.com/connect/free-trial/">14-day free trial</a> and learn more about how much such hosting will cost you. <br><br>  To get even more details, watch the pricing video in Jelastic. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/46rr9GerA7s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjOilK_WfE7E_RHXUWNUhDNVzJFwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226515/</a></p>
