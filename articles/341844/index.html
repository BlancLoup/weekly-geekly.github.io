  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We implement address storage in a warehouse: what software is suitable and why</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a successful company, the sales, accounting, logistics and warehouse functions harmoniously.  If at least one link sags in this chain, you can forget about loyalty of regular customers.  Who would want to risk their own business if a partner does not adhere to the deadlines, completes orders for a long time, and sometimes even completely ships the chicken skin instead of fillets? <br><br>  Companies that have implemented address storage in a warehouse receive a competitive advantage in the market.  On the warehouse space - the order, the goods are marked and taken into account - the search and order picking take a minimum of time.  Sounds good, isn't it?  And you would know how this increases productivity and profits, if thousands of goods are stored in the warehouse. <br><br><blockquote>  Today we will talk about the mechanisms of address storage and how it will help increase profits. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Keep 10-20 items in stock? Do not bother with address storage" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/os/fw/mjosfwlpzvnookibszz03nq2r8w.jpeg" alt="    ,      "></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Static storage: you can't hang everything on one nail </h2><br>  Until recently, only static address storage was practiced in warehouses.  The territory was divided into sections, each of which was assigned a certain product group.  The warehouse worker placed the received goods strictly in the cells allocated for the goods, which further simplified his search and order picking.  But there is a reverse side to this medal. <br><blockquote>  Example.  Under product group A, 20 pallets were allocated, and group B, 40. For some reason, 25 pallets of group A were brought to the warehouse. Now the warehouse employee must manually pick up the excess standard area for storing five ‚Äúextra‚Äù pallets until the desired location will be released. </blockquote><br>  Static address storage is the easiest way to place a product in stock.  Even new employees can easily operate with products, forming an order.  But to talk about the uniform distribution of goods, alas, is not necessary.  Some of the shelves are regularly empty, and the system does not allow them to be used, as this will confuse the work.

Static address storage is your option!" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/yl/zn/jqylznuhkfcw59zofjq0hd1eagc.jpeg" alt="      ,          "></div><br><h2>  Dynamic address storage: and you are in ladies! </h2><br>  Given the shortage of vacant space, few entrepreneurs can deliberately allow themselves the luxury of empty pallets.  Dynamic address storage takes into account this requirement ‚Äî it is more flexible, mobile, and efficient. <br><br>  The product enters the reception area and is entered into the information base.  Then under it in the warehouse is allocated free space, which is assigned the number of the party.  The system monitors multiple incoming and outgoing operations on numbered cells.  Warehouse areas are used as efficiently as possible.  Inventory can be carried out in stages - by sector, and not immediately in the entire warehouse. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Dynamic address storage is chosen by those who expect the best from life and business." src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uq/bv/a2/uqbva2ffzkyffy4__kf4c2gnx5m.jpeg" alt=" :  ,  ¬´¬ª,   ,  "></div><br><h2>  What changes await you after the introduction of address storage </h2><br><ol><li>  Every square meter is beneficial (read: profit), because no cell is idle without work.  In conditions of limited space, this is especially noticeable. </li><li>  Collecting orders takes much less time: operators are no longer looking for positions in the list manually.  It is enough for them to turn to a system that tells and guides.  In warehouses with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseveral thousand square meters, saving time is several hours per day. </li><li>  Employees no longer trot between racks looking for the right box.  They clearly understand what actions and in what sequence to perform to complete the order, so they work calmly and quickly. </li><li>  Errors due to the human factor in identifying goods and storage cells are rare.  Is that the system will fail! </li></ol><br><h2>  And if the address storage is also dynamic </h2><br>  Then the responsibility of the operator is generally minimized, and the list of his direct duties requires only mechanical actions.  The warehouse worker no longer analyzes the turnover of goods in order to plan the number of pallets for each product group.  All this is done for him by the system.  Besides: <br><br><ul><li>  acceptance and placement of goods are much faster; </li><li>  the inventory is simplified by the fact that it can be carried out in several stages - alternately in each group of cells. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1UdTzoS_nSk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Is it difficult to implement address storage in a warehouse? </h2><br>  The implementation process is really complicated, but structured.  The main thing - to break it into 4 stages and alternately perform the planned actions. <br><br>  <b><u>1st stage - to divide the storage room into areas - the zone of acceptance, storage and shipment.</u></b> <br><br>  They, in turn, are divided into functional subzones.  You must admit that it is illogical to place large-scale pallets on one site, requiring the participation of stackers or loaders, and small boxes that will only be ‚Äúunderfoot‚Äù.  But if the products in the warehouse are of the same type, you should not complicate them. <br><br>  <b><u>Stage 2 - assign addresses to storage areas.</u></b> <br><br>  Cells barcoded and labeled.  If there are several warehouses or within one territory there are many zones, for convenience, they are marked with letters, and the cells - with numbers.  It is advisable not to use similar characters, otherwise there will be confusion.  Instead of ‚Äúdoubtful‚Äù O or Z (do you think these are letters or numbers?), It‚Äôs better to take more harmless V, N, K. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Each cell in the warehouse acquires a &quot;full name&quot; in accordance with the adopted encoding" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/bd/q9/lrbdq9yebi1splzbcegh-wfkpd4.jpeg" alt="          ,   "></div><br><br>  <u><b>The third stage is to introduce dynamic targeted storage in the warehouse management system.</b></u> <br><br>  The functionality of the typical 1C program in terms of address storage is very limited: in different configurations, you can assign identifiers and even set up dynamic address storage, but little can be done to automatically control the flow of goods without specialized software. <br><br>  <b><u>Stage 4 - take care of hardware and software for TSD.</u></b> <br><br>  Data collection terminals will be needed, with their help, operators will receive tasks from the system, scan the identifiers of products and cells.  Special software required, such as DataMobile, will make this process as flexible and easy as possible. <br><br><h2>  What are the prospects for using DataMobile? </h2><br>  Using <b><a href="http://scanport.ru/company/blog/po-datamobile/">DataMobile software, you</a></b> can organize static or dynamic address storage.  Versions of the application work equally effectively on the basis of Windows and Android. <br>  The functionality of the program is wide enough and satisfies all the requirements put forward by modern warehouse complexes.  The app covers: <br><br><ul><li>  product labeling; </li><li>  acceptance, shipment, internal movements; </li><li>  inventory; </li><li>  accounting by series and serial numbers; </li><li>  work with packing lists and much more. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Got a username and password? Ready to work in DataMobile!" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/ih/vi/ziihvi-zxuhozvnnnl-24_bvim0.jpeg" alt="   DataMobile       "></div><br><h2>  What if the 1c configuration does not support dynamic address storage? </h2><br>  Dynamic storage is supported only by new typical 1C configurations - Trade Management 11, Comprehensive Automation 2 and ERP 2. For other typical 1C configurations that are commonly used for inventory accounting, this functionality is not available, for example, Trade Management 10, Comprehensive Automation 1, Manufacturing Enterprise Management one. <br><br><blockquote> The transition to a new configuration of 1C is associated with enormous labor costs and a substantial budget, especially if the current configuration has been used for a long time and has been considerably modified to meet the company's objectives.  But what to do if dynamic address storage functionality is required? </blockquote><br>  For such a task, <b><a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/">DataMobile</a></b> has a separate dynamic address storage module for 1C configuration.  This module, like the rest of the functionality of the DataMobile software, does not affect typical objects in the 1C configuration, i.e.  it can be updated in terms of standard operating mechanisms. <br><br>  Using the module, you can mark warehouse cells, enter addressable accounting documents, and generate reports on the movement and remnants of inventories in the context of cells.  In conjunction with the information about each employee‚Äôs action, which is provided by <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>DataMobile software</b></a> , the dynamic address storage module will quickly take into account all warehouse operations and each such operation will have its own responsible one.  But that's not all!  If there is a problem of batching or expiration dates in conjunction with address storage, then the dynamic address storage module for <b><a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/">DataMobile software</a></b> will allow it to solve. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Implement address storage in stock and save" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/48/ju/nt48juuxfmapzm4d-dfdqsh5kcu.png" alt="      DataMobile        1"></div><br><h2>  Good news </h2><br>  To work with the <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>software DataMobile</b></a> does not need programming skills.  Parameters are configured by selecting from the list, "checkboxes".  But that's not all.  To integrate the program in 1C, intermediate configurations and databases are not needed - everything is much simpler. <br><br><blockquote>  Many companies use <b><a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/">DataMobile software</a></b> to organize address storage.  If done correctly, the result will not be long in coming.  Efficient storage is a seven-mile step to growing your business.
