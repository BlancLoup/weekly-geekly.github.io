They took people in time, because they could not extinguish the fire, and the settlement was exposed to fire.  50 houses burned down, one of which belonged to local resident James O'Reilly.  At the same time, James had to be worse than others - he watched his house burn in real-time mode thanks to the smart camera installed inside the dwelling. <br><br>  He posted the video of the incident on YouTube.  Watching all this is difficult even from the side - we see a cozy room with an aquarium, which is gradually filled with smoke and begins to burn.  At the same time, a smoke detector is triggered, but there is no sense in it, since there is no one to extinguish the house.  Shortly before the camera burned itself, it began to show a black and white image instead of a color one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The length of the video is about 20 minutes - shortly before the fire, James and his wife were still at home, but for obvious reasons, they had to leave quickly.  They did not manage to take away many important documents and memorabilia from home, which the former owners of the house still regret.  But the worst thing is that in the house there was an aquarium with fish, which, of course, did not survive.

The house, as far as can be understood, was insured, so that soon the family will receive a new dwelling.  Now the family lives in its "motor home", on which they had to leave during a forest fire. <br><br>  Well, it remains only to wish the family to get a new home as quickly as possible, and I would like to hope that the new housing will be located at a distance from possible sources of ignition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372213/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372213/</a></p>
