  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the "Rambler" search from Fast?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.rambler.ru/">Rambler Internet Holding</a> will use the search technology of the Norwegian developer <a href="http://www.fastsearch.com/">Fast Search &amp; Transfer</a> in its services.  The company <a href="http://www.fastsearch.com/news.aspx%3Fm%3D329%26amid%3D5600">has acquired a</a> license for the FAST Enterprise Search Platform (FAST ESP) product, under which it will pay the fees to the manufacturer.  The amount of the contract is not disclosed. <br><br>  As reported <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/">by Vedomosti</a> , it‚Äôs not about replacing Rambler with your own search engine.  Denis Kalinin, the company's general director, told the newspaper that Fast technologies will be used to build new search products, in particular, vertical and multimedia services.  ‚ÄúThe company chose to buy a ready-made solution rather than develop it independently,‚Äù he added.  In which projects it will be used is still unknown. <br><br>  Igor Ashmanov, managing partner and CEO of <a href="http://www.ashmanov.com/">Ashmanov &amp; Partners</a> , gave Habrahabr a detailed comment on the topic.  According to one of Igor's assumptions, the Fast technology was purchased to replace the main search engine: ‚ÄúFirst, there is an objective drop in the share of Rambler in the total volume of search queries.  Bottom quite tightly presses <a href="http://www.google.ru/">"Google"</a> , there are even emissions in the press that "Google" overtook the "Rambler".  I personally think that this is not a matter of search quality - the search there is now good, on some topics cleaner than <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> , which is the main target of doorwayers.  But in general, the quality of marketing - the portal is moving sluggishly and indistinctly.  But the company may have other opinions on this issue, intrigue, and the bosses may be dissatisfied with the technicians ‚Äù.

      ‚ÄúSecondly,‚Äù says Igor Ashmanov, ‚Äúthis is generally a common story, when guys from a global company come to the most important dude and say:‚Äú Listen, it's time to make a real business decision.  Do not listen to your pathetic programmers, they have their own interests, and you should understand that such things should be taken from a global company.  How much you can do your own, on your knee - now there are other times;  you are a hostage of your technical department, but everything will be according to the agreement, as it should be. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúI once participated in the‚Äú Rambler ‚Äùin two such plays.  At first they tried to sell us Google instead of the main search engine.  It turned out that it is impossible to properly configure, Russify, you can not touch the results at all, etc.  And besides, the monthly cost of the service is about <nobr>3-4</nobr> times higher than the cost of developing your own search.  Secondly, we were offered not to build our server platforms, but to move to the data center from Cable &amp; Wireless.  Again, it turned out that the benefits are imaginary, and the cost is five times higher. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut often the circuit works.  Among other things, there is an argument that Google or Fast is a global base, and our local search engines are only looking for Runet.  Remember how Mail.ru spun exactly this ‚Äúpoint of differentiation‚Äù? <br><br>  My personal opinion, this is a bad detuning, because, although the base is global, you have to simultaneously explain to the public why it should go to the exact clone of the western search engine, say, Google, instead of going to Google itself.  If you have everything else, why are you needed? ‚Äù <br><br>  Igor has another version of the explanation of the Rambler initiative - buying a search engine with databases: ‚ÄúIn fact, having your own search engine in hand, it is much easier to set it up for any private projects.  The cost and terms of implementation is much lower.  Except for the case when an alien search engine is supplied with ready-made databases, where the issues of collecting and delivering complex data, copyright issues, etc. are resolved.  For example, if Fast'a has databases with maps or music, where all legal issues are resolved, then this may have a direct meaning.  It saves time.  By the way, the dump among the portals can start at all with the cards, because this is a good business, and now the official restrictions on the accuracy of the maps in the Russian Federation are about to be lifted. ‚Äù <br><br>  Returning directly to the Fast technology, it is worth noting that it is mainly bought by enterprises for the needs of a search in internal bases.  Among the company's customers are IBM, America Online, <nobr>Daimler-Chrysler</nobr> , Nissan, Reuters, Overture.  Fast systems also use projects sharpened specifically for searching - AltaVista, AllTheWeb.  In Russia, Lycos had experience in handling Norwegian developments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4386/</a></p>
