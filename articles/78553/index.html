Reboot "part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db3/a56/b7f/db3a56b7fc281ab6078913747b4fd4c9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The SEO public has been actively discussing the Yandex update over the past 24 hours, and ordinary Belarusians simply continue to use a search engine without even realizing that Snezhinsk has come to us with unprecedented frosts.  Next will be a few words and photos about the second day of the SEO conference ‚ÄúWebsite promotion in the Belarusian Internet.  Reboot. <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://i011.radikal.ru/0912/34/6229916ac804.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The second day began with reports on contextual advertising.  In the half-empty congress hall, representatives of Google, Yandex and a runner took turns.  Ales Kosmach, a Belarusian who arrived from Dublin, told about how well advertised in Adwords was.  Unfortunately, not all issues with the payment procedure are resolved, but they are aware of the problem and are working on it.  Following her, Natalya Kovaleva told about how easy and simple it is to advertise in Direct, that the volume of the Belarusian market grew by 680% over the year, as well as differences in male and female psychology.  After the performance of the three main systems, Sergey Dovedova gave a report from blonde.ru. This is a kind of setting that allows you to work in the same interface with all systems.  Well, after him again, the report of Natalia Kovaleva on post-click`e. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9e/be0/7e5/b9ebe07e52aa173a4bcbea7e57819fb9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After the coffee break, USABILITYLAB Director Dmitry Satin spoke about how usability affects the conversion of advertising traffic.  One example was a website commissioned by stars for corporate events.  We saw how hard it was to order Garik Kharlamov on one site and how easy and easy it is to order Julia Savicheva on the other (without looking up from watching a clip with a star). <br><img src="http://i012.radikal.ru/0912/71/e993db001863.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And again a report from faraway Ireland: Alesya Kosmach told about using Google Analitics. <br><br>  The director of Red Graphic spoke about the specifics of advertising and public relations in social networks.  In short, the users of classmates on VKontakte consider their profile to be their private little house, in which there is no place for the usual advertising.  The examples in the report largely repeated the examples from the CI report. <br><img src="http://i023.radikal.ru/0912/39/43d01cbc853b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After lunch, Leonid Andrianov spoke about the development of Yandex multimedia search.  Every day Yandex is becoming tougher and tougher for duplicates.  Leonid almost always answered questions from the audience with an eye to Alexander Sadovsky, who was sitting in the 3rd row, sometimes when answering Alexander supplemented Leonid.  From this report and the answers to the questions, it became clear that in the future, Yandex will treat video and photo copy-paste as well as textual.  This is not a matter of principle, but a matter of time and technology. <br><br>  Konstantin Leonovich from sape.ru conducted an educational campaign on link trading, said that some web sites spend about a thousand on links a month, and the most successful webmasters make money on sap up to 1700. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/619/6fd/38d/6196fd38d6b7c05ebc845eaa5a2174c7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And what about the second thread?  And I do not know, I did not make my way there.  The audience on the 5th floor was unable to accommodate everyone.  It is noteworthy that most of the participants were two days, and not comrades who paid only master classes.  At the end of the day, the organizers decided to stop this disgrace and the section on AGS-17 was combined with a round table, at which Sadovsky and everyone else were present.  Why is that?  Because most of the questions were addressed to him.  From the round table, visitors carried a lot of interesting useless information.  For example, Sadovsky for work has to watch a lot of porn ochchen.  The host of the table, Denis Guryev, tried to joke and put pity on him.  But if jokes often passed, then the attempt to bargain for Yandex‚Äôs preferences ended in failure.  It became clear that in this confrontation, the eastern neighbor looks at Belarus not only through the scope of the milk-gas pipe, but also through the AGS sight. <br><img src="http://i055.radikal.ru/0912/b9/15e9f73e3083.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Pour bitterness from failure in an attempt to knock out benefits for webmasters of the crystal vessel participants were invited to the reception in the lobby.  <s>As usual, the guests got drunk and fought</s> .  As expected, the good triumphed over evil - the Belarusian Neo beat his feet and the sword of the local Smith agents.  And for dessert we got a piece of sweet wonder buttons.  The button design was borrowed from the Lavrov-Clinton craft.  The only difference is that the Americans had PEREGRUZKA, and we have RESET. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e30/621/11f/e3062111f333bf549e4a662564aa247e.jpg" alt="image">

I will only add that I personally liked the conference very much.  I liked not only and not so much the obligatory reports, but also the backstage communication.  All speakers were open for communication.  Representatives of Direct and Adwords after the reports patiently listened to questions of particular curious and tried to answer them during the breaks.  The representative of sape.ru despite the aircraft also answered questions in the lobby.  Dmitry Satin just tore to pieces.  Taking the opportunity to consult usability gurus received about a dozen participants.  Someone asked general questions, someone downloaded his report on a USB flash drive, someone opened his website on a laptop and asked for ratings and tips.  And of course Sadovsky.  If in the first half of the day he calmly sat in the third row, only occasionally being distracted by questions of particularly arrogant participants and commenting on rumors about the situation with the mail.ru, then in the evening he was literally being torn to pieces.  At the reception, the people surrounded him from all sides.  Alexander patiently answered ‚Äúover 9000‚Äù questions while his comrade failed to pull him out of the crowd. <br><img src="http://i081.radikal.ru/0912/ba/b283be0bc528.jpg" alt="image"><br>  PS The comrade who managed to lose his wallet was very lucky - he returned the purse with Webcom contents safe and sound.  So, if in the contract they promise to return the funds in case of failure, they will definitely return :) <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/bynet/77232/">The first day</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78553/</a></p>
