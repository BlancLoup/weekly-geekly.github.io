Audi recently reported a performance of 80% higher during the Le Mans advertising campaign using mobile video creatives.  The advertising budgets of many brands, including NBC, AT &amp; T and Target, are confidently moving towards the mobile, and by next year mobile advertising will account for more than 50% of all digital advertising. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, many obstacles remain when it comes to advertising through this resource.  For example, more than 80% of the time in a mobile device is spent in applications.  This creates difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of campaigns, because applications inherently form a database.  In addition, mobile advertising often has side effects on other channels, while at the same time calculating the effectiveness of investments is even more difficult.  Below are a few tips on how to achieve KPI when using mobile programmatic and mobile video advertising. <br><br>  <b>The transition to marketing people</b>

      2014 was a year of views.  Advertisers have requested that impressions be counted only when the ad was actually viewed and was not the object of the bots action.  This year, the sphere of advertising technologies is observing new demand: advertisers want not only to see their ads, but also want to know who watched it.  Every show.  This transition to ‚Äúmarketing people‚Äù will affect marketers' focus on a new set of KPIs, which goes along with standard displays. <br><br>  Marketing about people means that KPIs are always attached to real people, regardless of the device of use, and their quantity during the entire advertising campaign.  This means that the need for cookies, as identifiers, disappears, since they cannot provide accurate data about a person on several devices at once.  With the help of cookies, the effectiveness of advertising campaigns is often overestimated, because people who use multiple devices are not associated only with one set of cookies on one device. <br><br>  The meaning of marketing about people is that the consumer is the main achievement: each consumer has his own personal profile and receives personalized messages.  Using this strategy also means combining ad impressions with additional points of contact, such as primary data such as email and phone number.  Data is then mapped for online and offline communications (loyalty cards, coupons, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Data-based mediation</b> <br><br>  Today, advertisers want impression level information.  Today, advertising agencies have to analyze a huge mass of data to optimize CPM, CTR, mobile video, etc.  Technology programmatika certifies that the bidding takes place in the most efficient way, and that advertising costs are optimally distributed among the demand with the greatest efficiency. <br><br>  But until recently, the mobile was badly lacking critical information about the audience for advertising.  Despite the fact that smartphones are the most personal devices, marketers and advertisers are still forced to fight for the quality of the data provided.  The transition to marketing people keeps pace with the development of new technologies, which, ultimately, should close this gap.  Most of all, mobile video advertising will benefit from this, because dollars from TV advertising flow to mobile devices. <br><br>  <b>Reduced time between information gathering and results</b> <br><br>  Companies collect more data than ever.  Stationary computers, email, social networks and mobile provide their information flows, which are not always easy to combine.  Improvements in data flow are the first step towards optimizing advertising campaigns in real time.  To achieve immediate results, you need to reduce the time between the collection of information and its distribution.  A specialist in data processing and analysis should make great efforts in this direction. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295310/</a></p>
