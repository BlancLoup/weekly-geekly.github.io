Of course, come on, what can happen? <br>  Admin: You see, everything works fine.  And you payayatnitsa, veeeecher ... <br>  CIO: Come here. <br>  Admin: What? <br>  CIO: Go-go.  Read it. <br>  Admin: Connection Fault.  Well, something fell off.  Whose console is this? <br>  CIO: This is a production server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Terminal: Piiiii.  Piiiii.  Piiiii. <br>  CIO: Let's roll back your shit. <br>  Admin furiously clicks buttons. <br>  The bell rings. <br>  CIO picks up the phone, looks at the wall with the world clock and cheerfully begins: Good morning! .. Yes, hello, Bgdazhvan Mhartchandr.  Yes, there is a small technical problem.  Yes, I am glad that your support program from the manufacturer requires your help in such situations.  Of course, connect. <br>  Waving his hands to the admin and whispering: Vova, get out of the channel, the Hindu connects. <br>  Router: Bzhzhzh ... Hrrrrr! <br>  Terminal: Piiiii.  Piiiii.  Piiiii. <br>  CIO: Mr. Bgdazhvan Mhartchandr, my dear colleague, have you mixed up anything? <br>  From here it seems to me that you just turned off our backup data center.  Perhaps the fact is that your IP routers differ by one, isn't it, dear colleague? .. Aah, call back, okay. <br>  Terminal: Piiiii.  Piiiii.  Piiiii.

      The director looks in at the door. <br>  Admin: Hello, Boris Ignatievich! <br>  CEO: What is it wrong? <br>  Admin: Now we will fix everything, Boris Ignatievich. <br>  CEO: Spree. <br>  CIO: Vova is right, now we'll fix it, Boris Ignatich. <br>  CEO slamming the door: Kill. <br>  Admin, shuddering - semi-solid: Kill? <br>  CIO: And you think, where did the last admin go?  In the Maldives, sunbathes?  Let me remember.  So, Mikhail, at the time of reporting, we de-energized the accounting department.  Then there was Alexander - he just hid the backup when moving, and he found his tax.  Then Benya - this one kept to the last, but he did not give the password under a soldering iron to competitors.  Honor his memory, was a serious man.  Then, in fact, Dmitry - he managed to escape - and now you are. <br>  Admin: Ik ... Chief, but at the interview you didn‚Äôt tell me this ... <br>  CIO: So the demo was.  All the trial is over.  Let's raise. <br><br>  The phone is ringing again. <br><br>  CIO picks up the phone, habitually looks at the wall with a world clock and in a cheerful, cheerful voice begins: Hello, dear Bgdazhvan Mhartchandr!  Yes, I am very glad that you are engaged in our support ... How is the day off?  We have the same SLA 24/7, RTO 4. What does it mean, ‚Äúthe problem is on your side‚Äù? .. Goat! <br>  Admin: Is that you him now? <br>  CIO: No, he already put the phone down. <br>  Admin: And why? <br>  CIO: He says the problem is in the gland. <br>  Admin: Is it in a router or something? <br>  CIO: Well, yes. <br>  Admin: So he, too, his production. <br>  CIO: Not, Vova.  It is manufactured by Most.  Just these - they bought ‚ÄúMost‚Äù, and the plant for them is another division.  Forbidden territory, such as for us a warehouse of fuel. <br>  Admin: And what now? <br>  CIO: Call us in global support, we will connect them. <br><br>  Vova opens a drawer of the table, a piece of paper with a phone of global support is glued on the bottom.  Dials the number. <br>  Admin: Hello, dear colleagues.  We had a technical trouble here ... Yes, yes, with your production router ... How did the support end yesterday?  He stands on the extended!  What does it mean on Michael?  Wait ... Call me back?  Good. <br>  CIO: So what? <br>  Admin: They say lifelong extended support.  On Michael framed. <br>  CIO: Your colleague.  Former. <br>  Admin: ... and? <br>  CIO: Well, everything that has to be done is out of support. <br>  Admin: They promised to call back. <br>  CIO: They have no determinant there.  Well, that is, there is, but L1 does not see the numbers. <br>  Admin: So where will they call you back? <br>  CIO: Now you understand what politeness is.  You have to pick yourself. <br><br>  A shaggy eniky in a hippo coat peeks in at the door. <br>  Enikey: Men ... <br>  Admin: What? <br>  Enikey: I dropped the network as I went.  And another computing center.  Two.  But I'll fix everything now! <br>  Admin: Yes? <br>  Eniky: Yes, yes, we are now both de-energized, and there the emergency network routes will be connected and the diesel will be powered. <br>  Admin: Well, try it. <br>  CIO: Did you do your best? <br>  Admin: And what, are you going to release it now with your hands to roll out the EC?  This now everything on the state before the firmware from the backup will raise.  Probably. <br><br>  Flashing light. <br>  Terminal: Piiiii.  Piiiii.  Piiiii. <br><br>  Admin: Earned? <br>  CIO: Yes.  Well, thank God. <br>  Admin, relaxed: Good.  Come on.  Give or Italy? <br>  The director looks in at the door. <br>  CEO: Assault. <br>  Admin: Yes, comrade general director. <br><br>  The phone is ringing again. <br><br>  CIO picks up the phone, habitually looks at the wall with a world clock and cheerfully begins: Hello, dear Bgdazhvan Mhartchandr!  What, ahem, sorry?  Yes, yes, thank you.  We are pleased to work with your company and with you.  You are an expert ... Goat! <br>  Admin: Is that you him now? <br>  CIO: Yes. <br>  Admin: What does he say? <br>  CIO: He says he solved the problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306720/</a></p>
