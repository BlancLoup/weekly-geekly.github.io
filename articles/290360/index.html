      PS .: Frankly, while I was writing the main text, thoughts were swarming in my head, and I wanted to bring everything to one post.  But then, after a little thought, I decided to bring to the readers a slightly sad-positive article.  You decide.  And forgive me if something goes wrong, I am writing for the first time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  "Brevity is the sister of talent", or Very briefly about yourself </h4><br>  And we will begin it simply with a simple acquaintance.  As said above, my name is Sergey, I am a system administrator and ‚Äúelectronics‚Äù in a small state organization.  The town is small, so there is nowhere to accelerate in terms of work (and even that‚Äôs not very desirable).  26 years old, sociable, polite, single.  I like to read books very much, the main genre is science and technology, programming, various kinds of historical journalism.  For all the time I changed 2 jobs (about this - a little bit lower).  From the hobby you can highlight hunting and fishing, traveling around the country. <br><br><h4>  Job </h4><br>  As already said above - I work as a system administrator and electronics.  Since the work is closely related to the provision of services to the population, the basic composition of the technology is quite extensive - these are fiscal registrars, and readers of bank plastic cards, and various barcode scanners - in general, all technology cannot be counted.  All this needs to be maintained in working condition and constantly monitor performance and routinely carry out maintenance.  There is also a network from the computer park, although a small one, but uniting the whole area.  All of this, too, needs to be monitored and controlled, plus the maintenance of the network and the exchange of data with the central database.  This all takes a lot of time and energy. <br><br>  Referring to the introductory part, I made a reservation that I had already changed 2 jobs.  Yes, it is harsh, but true.  Looking back, and comparing previous jobs with the current one, I understand - these were only part-time jobs and random enikeystvo in the network of commercial firms, although I worked out ‚Äúfrom call to call‚Äù.  Low wages, constant indication of what to do and how, negligent attitude towards company employees, constant ‚Äúleft‚Äù work not related to the main activity ‚Äî all these and many other factors left their imprint on the decision to change something in their life, to assert themselves work plan and improve their work skills. <br><br>  Since staying with the team, where everyone is for himself and is ready to literally tear to pieces his colleague, to climb up the career ladder himself, did not make sense, the decision was unequivocal - to quit and find the job you were dreaming about.  At that time I was not strong either in administration or in electronics. Therefore, the job search began to drag on.  Understanding that the best years of life are passing by, and I still have not established myself in my work, I had to sit at the desk ‚Äî begin to intensively grasp the basics and then deepen my knowledge in the field of administration.  Everything was clouded by the fact that, in fact, higher education was required everywhere, and without him it‚Äôs simply impossible to get a job ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few words about my attitude to higher education ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Just want to make a reservation - this is purely my opinion, and I do not impose it on anyone else.  And the most convincing request to forgive me, if my opinion of someone hurt a living and offended.  As they say, it was not part of my plans, and if you are not interested in what is written in the line below, then I ask you to skip this text ... <br><br>  What can I say about higher education.  Among my friends there are a lot of people who have already graduated from universities and got a job.  However, a great many acquaintances work ... not in their specialty.  But why?  Let's try to figure it out.  During the initial training (1-2 years) and communication with friends I noticed positive statements about the direction in which they learn.  For example, the scope of the IT industry.  Friends tell them how they solve problems there, sort out situations, what knowledge they got there, and, unwittingly, you begin to be proud of your colleagues, what sensible they will be and how high they will go in their field, how lucky they will be and that lucky boss and company in which they will work. <br><br>  And you start to feel sorry - ‚ÄúWell, why am I so stupid, why I cannot enter the tower and also learn how to be an expert in my field, so that everyone would be proud and did not point with a finger, a SSUZ, tatarabanil there 4.5 years and left an unnecessary specialist, and even proud of it ... But his friend entered the university, unlearn, and became a specialist, who is called for all work and offer a salary of 6-7 digits currency ... "And, worst of all, such thoughts are constantly pursued - in moments of meeting with friends, in m  cops to communicate with them by Skype / phone, and just at the mention of their name ... <br><br>  But everything comes to an end.  A friend learned, got a diploma, got a job on his specialization.  It seems everything is okay, everything is cool, a friend is happy, everyone is happy, friends, acquaintances, relatives - everyone is proud of him.  Now let's switch to a specialist. <br><br>  The first disappointment comes when you are left alone and do not work in a team, where everyone can support you, and with whom you can discuss working problems that have arisen.  You are a specialist who graduated from a university, and having a diploma of completion, it means that you must and must solve these problems yourself.  And what to do here, you don‚Äôt know, they didn‚Äôt teach you this, you had situations programmed in the curriculum, but with instructor‚Äôs hints and collective intelligence you solved them in courses.  They taught strictly according to the program, which was compiled in 90-00 years.  Since then, technology has gone far, appeared, and to this day, new programs, devices, the whole world is changing.  Without a craving for learning, a specialist begins to quickly lose all of his knowledge acquired during 5 years of hard brain drain.  As a result, a bunch of problems grows, grows like a parasite, starts to eat you from the inside. <br><br>  There is irritability, the desire to go to work goes nowhere, a person is torn between problems, trying to somehow escape from their captivity, and as a result he has no choice but to give up and resign or surrender his rights to someone else, rejoicing only to the fact that at least they did not dismiss from work, but changed the direction of your activity ... <br><br>  Unfortunately, most of the friends have lost their status as a specialist and the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and occupy good positions.  Many were broken by the training program itself and the tasks that were required of them.  I understand that I did not fully disclose the question, if it can be called disclosure at all, but those who have encountered such a situation will understand me deep down. <br><br>  Well, okay, let's not talk about sad things, because the fasting must be bright and positive, and sad things, if there is a desire, thoughts and mood are appropriate, we can talk later. <br></div></div><br><br>
<h4>  ‚ÄúI want to get a job, but do not take it, because there is no experience.  And there is no experience, because they do not take on work.  The circle is closed!  What to do?" </h4><br>  This phrase from the well-known bash-orga (the current bash-ima). <br><br>  This is about the phrase I was pursued with the current one.  With great difficulty, I was able to persuade the head to take me on the holidays of the main employee, so to speak - "for a trial period".  I still respect and thank the boss for this decision.  In turn, I tried with full dedication to put into practice the knowledge that I could learn from the pages of search engines, various books and simply from Internet articles.  True, not everything worked out right away, I had to think about some things for quite a long time, pumping my skills of googling and logical thinking.  Examples of this are darkness, starting from laying a cable to flashing a router. <br><br>  By the time I left the employee‚Äôs leave, I could confidently work with the equipment, knew the approximate location of the key nodes and had an impressive list of problems that arise most often and how to solve them.  It is time to hand over the cases and thank the employee for the month of work he gave me.  And we had to part ... with the employee.  I took his place, and he went to another company, which he had long been interested in both in terms of career growth, and in terms of wages and social package ... <br><br>  A small digression: dear, do not think that I ‚Äúsat down‚Äù this employee, and he had to leave.  Just no, he has long wanted to leave the company, but there was no worthy replacement.  I do not consider myself to be a worthy candidate either.  I now also have some problems that sometimes have to be fought for a long time, and even for 3-4 approaches they cannot be solved due to lack of experience ... <br><br>  Continue with the unfinished dialogue <br><br>  ... first thing after getting the position, it became scary.  God, I'm ONE!  WHAT TO DO!?!  The first - and most importantly - calm down!  And do not panic. <br><br>  The first thing you wanted to do was to automate everything.  Sending the necessary data files, archives, databases - all to automate.  It was the first mistake I made, setting everything up ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù.  I regretted this when I began to receive some incorrect data and when the first nightly experience of raising a database of about 60 GB appeared.  And it happened in the first month of "single swimming".  Henceforth, I was more circumspect, and set up the exchange a little differently. <br><br>  Secondly, I have learned the phrase Zen - ‚ÄúIt works - do not touch‚Äù!  And this happened - correctly, also in the first month of independent work.  They removed one computer from the exchange system, well, and got into the mailing script, too, to remove it from the list ... That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking at, the data stopped coming.  Oh, yes, the same computer is already in my warehouse, the data from it should not come ... That is, how did the data from the whole site not come?  Hmm ... Well, I will look at the server, I can find something.  (after hours **** tstsat of picking, barely tearing through the eyes in the morning) Hello, yes, how did it burn out?  Hmm ... well, now I will find a replacement, like there is a computer in the warehouse working from the old section, we will supply you, in 4 hours you will work.  (After another 6-8 hours of dizzying action with the installation and launch of the workplace, with the transfer of information and the unification of the bases between the burned and installed computer) (I go to my exchanger) What the ... What ... Yesterday there was absolutely nothing!  What kind of information, from where ...?  What's in the logs ... Oops, and time?  Your well ... <br><br>  The third rule - "People are divided into two types - who makes backups, and who has already begun to do them" <br>  Actually, the situations with this phrase were darkness, and they pursued me for about 3-4 months. <br><br>  Briefly summarizing the above, I note that the work that I received as a result, I was completely satisfied and helped me to be realized not only as a system administrator. <br><br>  Uff ... A little tired of writing such a text in a gulp, ‚ÄúI am not a professional, I am still learning.‚Äù  Perhaps, in this place, I will interrupt, with your permission, and in the next article I will continue the narration.  What will be there?  Yes, actually, I‚Äôll write what I‚Äôm doing at the moment, tell you what interesting ideas I‚Äôm visiting, and how my ‚Äúbaptism of fire‚Äù happened in an unofficial post ‚Äúweb-developer‚Äù.  I will try for a long time not to delay with writing, and, if interested, I will write a sequel this week. <br><br>  To be continued.  And to new meetings. <br><br>  UPD: <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15244/">The second part - "I want to work"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290360/</a></p>
