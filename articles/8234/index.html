Now they also promised to switch me to the next day, but at the same time it was said that the individual date of cancellation was subs.  Fees - 11th day of each month.  I did not pay much attention to this. <br><br>  On the account I had a balance of about 300 rubles, or $ 11.  I considered that the difference in $ 2 would be removed from this balance.

      However, after midnight the connection was gone.  Everything looked logical, transferred to the new tariff.  However, usually automatic reconnection does not cause problems.  Having restarted the service with my hands, I never made my way to the network - the mail did not work, the weather was not displayed.  Only when I got into the browser, I saw a nice inscription - ‚ÄúYour access to the network is blocked‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first reaction was the call to the support.  Although I knew about the futility of this idea, but I wanted a lively human communication.  As it should be in Stream, for fifteen minutes I listened to the answering machine‚Äôs story that my call was very important and they would answer me for sure.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that the time is half past one in the morning, I never got an answer. <br><br>  Then the emotions subsided, and I realized that you can log into your personal account.  The balance on my account was ... -10 rubles, or $ 0.4.  Hm <br><br>  And only when I studied the operations on my personal account, everything became completely clear.  I was charged to the "unspent" monthly fee for May (it was about $ 20 out of the paid $ 30), and then the subscriber was charged.  fees for the new tariff, the very $ 32.  It's funny that the balance on the personal account in the amount of the balance of payment for May was not enough for just 10 rubles.  This is the payment for the month, the countdown of which began today, and the next time the money should be written off only on June 11, as it was warned. <br><br>  I was surprised only because I had not previously switched to higher tariffs.  Maybe someone this experience will be useful. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8234/</a></p>
