      <br>
      14 years ago, I got a job as a design engineer.  In addition to direct responsibilities, I had to make an application for the purchase of materials (metal, components) for what I designed.  There were blank forms in Excel, which were printed out and filled in by hand in duplicate, for the supply service and the warehouse. <br><br>  <i>Later, after 3 years, I will introduce the concept of "rational laziness."</i>  <i>This is when you do everything in order to spend less time on the task, and the result does not suffer from this.</i> <br><br>  In the neighboring building of the scientific research institute, on the territory of which we rented premises, there was a programmers department.  Returning from the dining room, I went to them and asked me to show something in which I can create a program.  So I met Delphi7.  Having asked for a book on programming from them, I began to be rationally lazy. <br><br>  <b>procedure</b> <br><br>  Hello, world!  Now I need to learn how to store data.  Suppliers, materials, quantity, units.  ‚ÄúWell, you can do it differently, you can keep it in the Registry,‚Äù elder comrades dismissed me.  This is how my first program with a register-based database appeared.  Smiled?  Form1.Print - this is how I printed out my applications, which were now stored on the computer, and their compilation was one pleasure, compared to filling in with my hands.  Then he added to the program converter units of metal.  It should be noted that the Internet then we did not have. <br><br>  Over time, when it became necessary to establish access to data from several jobs, I began to look for solutions.  The Internet has already appeared, and I became acquainted with real databases.  But the server (according to examples) did not suffice to raise the mind, so having created dbf tables and putting them into a local network, I organized a corporate web on my knee.  Applications, warehousing, time sheets. <br><br>  Moving up the career ladder and developing professionally, I developed my brainchild.  I have new responsibilities - the program has new functions.  When I realized that I no longer fit into the framework, I started all over again.  New project - and I use the opportunity to do something better than it was. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12c/1d9/298/12c1d92981a84290bdfec5dc7473cc1e.PNG"><br><br>  I learned the basics of SQL, and three years ago the program moved from shared folders to full-fledged MySQL.  Two years ago, the program learned to climb into the database 1C.  A year ago, I made friends with Android applications that send her various data from the workshop.  And many, many more.  I did and do it all alone.  Who am I now?  The answer is that today my program affects all areas of my business.  It has everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fa/9a6/b5a/4fa9a6b5a1414a509808666a87aa5b63.PNG"><br><br>  <b>end</b> <br><br>  Here we are with you and come to the most important thing.  Ask me any, the easiest programming question.  And I can not answer you.  I have no idea how the databases are organized.  I don‚Äôt even know / remember how SQL is decrypted.  How does the flow work?  Uhhhhh.  Create a class.  What is it?  And so on.  From the very beginning I did everything according to examples, experimenting with the code.  Not completely thoughtless, but also without delving into the subtleties with which you (programmers) are on a short leg with which you devote your life. <br><br>  Most recently, I asked myself a question.  Can I, at least partially, relate myself to programmers?  Or am I a pathetic wannabe?  Programmers create programs.  But after all, I also created a program, even the whole IT universe within the framework of my enterprise, which people use.  On the other hand, if you have learned how to treat a cold or determine that a person has a stroke, does this mean that you are a doctor?  Where is the line, stepping over which, a person can attribute himself to this or that professional class? <br><br>  And maybe it's in the environment?  For my colleagues, I am certainly a person with the function of a programmer.  But for you, probably not.  What is this programmer who does not know why the <b>implementation</b> string in the code?  The thing is, I don‚Äôt want to know all this. <br><br>  Who is he, a real programmer? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I do not get paid for programming, this is not my activity, I am not complaining about the hard fate of modern coders (I have no idea about what it is).  All this is a side interest, which helped me to rise higher, become more professional, make my enterprise strong and, most importantly, prove to myself that a person can do everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325350/</a></p>
