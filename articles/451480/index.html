  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why does the Ministry of Industry and Trade prohibit the storage of data on foreign equipment?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/_2/fc/9x_2fcb9n45yqot4qgi7fy7uwvg.jpeg" align="right" title="deer">  A <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/91138">draft resolution</a> on imposing a ban on the admission of software and hardware systems of data storage systems (DSS) of foreign origin for participation in procurement for state and municipal needs has been published on the Federal portal of draft regulatory acts.  It is written that in order to ensure the security of the critical information infrastructure (CII) of Russia and for national projects.  The CII includes, for example, information systems of government agencies, defense and energy enterprises, credit and financial organizations, telecom operators with a large number of subscribers.  Confirmation of the country of origin of goods is the conclusion issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  The decree must be valid for two years from the date of its entry into force. </p><br><p>  The explanatory note states that these <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/451048/">measures are aimed at protecting the domestic market</a> , developing the national economy and supporting Russian producers.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade is confident that the market for such products in Russia has been formed and represented by Russian manufacturers of computing equipment, among which are called ‚ÄúBaikal Electronics‚Äù, ‚ÄúDEPO Electronics‚Äù, ‚ÄúINEUM.  I.S.  Brooke "," KNS Group "(the company Yadro)," Kraftvey Corporation Pls "," MCST "," NIIME ", RPC" Elvis "," NCI "," T-platforms ".  These manufacturers can "ensure the appropriate quality and the necessary volumes of supplies" for state needs, they conclude in the department.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade did not receive a comment. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <strong><em>Dmitry Galushko ("Order", legal assistance in the field of communication and media):</em></strong> <br>  Russian manufacturers, having previously received a <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/p/87486">negative opinion of the Ministry of Economic Development</a> regarding changes in the Rules for storing users' messages (storage, Yarovaya package), went through the Ministry of Industry and Trade, which proposed the same condition for the production of storage systems for Spring, but only for State needs and CII facilities: additional conclusion of the Ministry of Industry and Trade About the production of storage systems only by Russian manufacturers.  In case of adoption of the draft Resolution, all telecom operators will have the right to purchase storage systems only from manufacturers who have received the opinion of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  But since the main thing in storage is the hard drive that is not made in Russia, in reality such a decree will increase the price of storage, since foreign manufacturers will not be allowed into the market, and Russian manufacturers will be gaskets between foreign manufacturers and telecom operators.  In essence, this is a way to circumvent the negative opinion on previous changes in the Government Decree No. 445, which have not been evaluated by the Ministry of Economic Development, having received a negative conclusion ... </blockquote><p>  Another expert in the field of communications drew attention to the fact that this draft resolution applies not only to telecom operators, but also to organizations involved in public procurement, including municipal ones.  It turns out even the opposite - communication operators are secondary.  A group of Russian ‚Äúproducers‚Äù is not a hoax, so skating wants to get a part of the market by force. </p><br><p>  From myself I want to add that it is necessary to clearly understand that you cannot shoot a cherry bone in the forehead of a deer and get a deer roast in a cherry sauce in a year.  Production and maintenance of hard disks cannot be created simply by saying loudly the word ‚Äúimport substitution‚Äù and pictorially drawing a magic symbol with a hand in the air.  That is, in the storage will be all the same foreign-made disks.  Perhaps the Russian assembly of varying degrees of depth.  And that is doubtful. </p></div>
