      In the new version, we focused on improving UIX, completely redesigning the administrative part of the product, added several important integrations and simplified import from Jira to one click. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is new in YouTrack 6.5? </h4><br><ol><li>  Integration with JetBrains command products </li><li>  Integration with BitBucket and GitLab </li><li>  Import from Jira in one click </li><li>  New design administrative part </li><li>  Project Creation Wizard </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Improvements </h5><br><ol><li>  Improved GitHub Integration </li><li>  New tab VCS changes </li><li>  Support brunch in TeamCity </li><li>  Improved Dashboard </li><li>  Workflow language enhancements </li><li>  Improved mailbox integration </li><li>  Bug-fix versions are now included in the Stand-alone server license. </li><li>  @username with embedded notifications </li></ol><br>  I propose to watch the five-minute video to get acquainted with the main innovations: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/unqotxEofB0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhir-j5F9ga4064cylHmq875Ml9Srg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  And now a little more </h5><br><br><h5>  Integration with JetBrains command products </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cf/f2f/39c/1cff2f39c9304a4884cbffcf01ecafbc.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/264943/">Most recently,</a> we wrote about the release of a new product Hub 1.0, an account management system and access rights, which is the single entry point for all JetBrains team products, including YouTrack, Upsource and TeamCity. <br>  YouTrack 6.5 can be connected to an external Hub (by default, YouTrack version 6 and higher comes with a built-in Hub).  Hub also allows you to connect Upsource (code review tool) to it, to get a single entry point to both products, a common base of user accounts, groups, access rights, a unified dashboard with widgets from YouTrack and Upsource, as well as integration between products , available by default. <br>  Read more about the Hub and the integration between YouTrack and Upsource <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/264943/">here</a> .  TeamCity will also soon join the team with a special plug-in, which is scheduled for release in autumn 2015.  At the moment, you can connect only the stand-alone version of YouTrack to the Hub, but we are already working on supporting the cloud version. <br><br><h5>  Integration with BitBucket and GitLab </h5><br>  Now you can set up native integration with Bitbucket or GitLab, which allows you to: <br><br><ul><li>  Apply any commands from YouTrack directly from the comment to the commit, mentioning the ID of the desired task.  All changes to the task will be applied on behalf of the author of the commit. </li><li>  Use commit hashes in YouTrack tasks to directly link to Bitbucket / GitLab commits. </li><li>  See all VCS changes related to the task in a separate tab. </li><li>  Filter tasks that contain changes to the VCS using the special <i>has: {vcs changes}</i> query. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/121/0ad/834/1210ad834dc845f190f58cce91275943.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Please note that in YouTrack 6.5 only integration with gitlab.com is available.  Integration with GitLab CE and GitLab EE will be added in one of the next minor versions. <br><br><h5>  Import from Jira in one click </h5><br>  Now you can import your projects from Jira to YouTrack with all of their history, comments, a list of observers, voices, customized fields, attachments, authors, performers, and even added one-click hours worked.  To do this, you just need to add a link to Jira and enter your username and password.  YouTrack will automatically create groups for task authors and performers from Jira, of course, if you have the necessary rights in Jira projects.  You can read more about importing from Jira in our <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/youtrack/2015/08/how-to-import-your-jira-projects-into-youtrack-6-5-in-one-click/">blog post</a> (in English).  Please note that import is supported from Jira version 5+. <br><br><h5>  New design administrative part </h5><br>  We completely reworked the UI of the administrative part of YouTrack to simplify the process of setting up and administering the tracker for new users.  For existing users, some new solutions may not seem obvious.  We welcome your feedback and comments on the new UI administration of projects, custom fields, workflow, integrations, etc. <br><br>  For example, this is how setting up integration with VCS looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ea/b53/bb5/1eab53bb5bb54a3c892ab211216ca076.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Project Creation Wizard </h5><br>  To create a project in YouTrack, you just need to fill in a couple of fields and add, if necessary, your teammates.  YouTrack will automatically create a team for your new project, add it as the value of the field Artists and give the team the necessary rights to work on the tasks in the project.  You can read more about the project team <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/YTD65/Managing%2BProject%2BTeam">here</a> (documentation in English). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a4/3cd/400/7a43cd4008af43f38bc1405b73f1088b.png" alt="image"><br>  Also note the new project list.  A search with filtering by project name, groups, etc. has been added to it. Now it is easier to edit the project, and you can add a group or an individual user to the project in one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb3/d9f/694/fb3d9f6942bf432397ec61d3fe738cf1.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Improvements </h4><br><br><h5>  GitHub Integration </h5><br>  YouTrack has long supported native integration with GitHub, similar to the new one with GitLab and Bitbucket.  In the new version, you can link one GitHub repository with several projects in YouTrack.  All changes from GitHub are also visible on a separate tab ‚ÄúVCS Changes‚Äù.  Speaking of her ... <br><br><h5>  New tab VCS changes </h5><br>  Changes from all version control systems are now visible on the special tab VCS Changes.  You can also filter all tasks into changes in VCS using the <i>has: {vcs changes}</i> query. <br><br><h5>  Improved Dashboard </h5><br>  Now you can stretch or narrow widgets, and also open widgets on the whole screen by double clicking on the widget.  We also improved the search on the Dashboard, added saved searches and tags. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/474/1e1/c5a/4741e1c5a3444052ad65ea5b3a2da364.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Support brunch in TeamCity </h5><br>  In version 6.5, support for feature branches in TeamCity has been added to YouTrack. <br><br><h5>  Workflow improvements </h5><br><ul><li>  Now you can track changes not only to tasks, but also comments to them. </li><li>  Scheduled rules or triggered by certain events are now launched on behalf of the special YouTrack Workflow user. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Improved mailbox integration </h5><br>  Using YouTrack as a helpdesk?  Then YouTrack 6.5 has something useful: <br><ul><li>  New variable $ {reply-to} has appeared. </li><li>  If the user has several email addresses, now they will be associated with one profile. </li><li>  The content of the email header in square brackets can be ignored. </li><li>  Now it is possible to disable a specific rule. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Bug-fix versions included in Stand-alone server license </h5><br>  Starting from version 6.5, all minor versions 6.5.x are included in the Stand-alone license.  That is, if your subscription was active at the time of release of version 6.5, then you will receive all minor bug-fix versions for free, even if your subscription expires at the time of their release. <br><br><h5>  @Username with embedded notifications </h5><br>  Now notifications about a mention of a user name in comments (@username) are built in system notifications.  Notifications can be configured in the user profile, and they are no longer part of a special workflow. <br><br>  Are you ready for the new YouTrack 6.5?  Then <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html">try it</a> right now.  You can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html">download a free version for 10 users</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html">register in our cloud</a> for an extended 30-day trial period of use (and then at any time switch to a free version for 10 users). <br><br>  If you already use our cloudy YouTrack, then very soon we will transfer you to the new version.  The server update has already started on Monday, August 24th.  The next batch of servers will be updated next Monday.  We plan to complete the transition to the new version within 6 weeks.  If you can not wait to try version 6.5, <a href="">write to</a> our team those.  support, and we will include you in the next upgrade. <br><br>  Before communication! <br>  Your JetBrains YouTrack Team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265265/</a></p>
