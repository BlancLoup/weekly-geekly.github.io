  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monitoring and data center management system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more information appears on the Internet about the integration of companies that are engaged in software to manage the infrastructure of the data center.  More recently, information appeared about the merger of two companies, Nlyte Software and FieldView Solutions.  DCIM has been on the market for more than 10 years and currently has over six dozen software providers for the data center.  In the near future it is planned to reduce the number of suppliers, but this decision will not affect the overall situation of the company.  More and more companies are attracted by the opportunity to make excess profits; these include both large companies and start-ups.  Vendors are in no hurry to enter the DCIM market, and gaining experience on the simple systems of monitoring and managing data center infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f38/a74/470/f38a7447053e42afb83c682a50444c0b.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Siemens Building Technology and ZNV Technology have signed an agreement on cooperation in the data center.  Their main collaborative collaboration concerns collaborative research and the promotion of smarter, safer, reliable, efficient, environmentally friendly technologies, data center solutions and solutions, namely the creation of highly efficient and professional products that simplify the operation and maintenance of building infrastructure.

      The latest DCIM update, the Sunbird dcTrack solution helps you manage your data center faster and more accurately.  Software company Sunbird Software, which specializes in developing software solutions for managing data center infrastructure, announced the availability of a new version of the DCIM solution Sunbird dcTrack.  The product with the serial number 5.1 offers data center operators ample opportunities to monitor assets and related power infrastructures.  With this product, data center operators will be able to plan and analyze the resources used, for making decisions regarding the amount of infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9d/750/ea9/a9d750ea9a004615b6de7fff2a44d031.png"><br><br>  The DCIM developers added a 3D data visualization tool to the new product, which will allow data center operators to display environmental monitoring results, receive reports on energy consumption and other data on-line, as well as reports on the volume of occupied space and weight of the equipment placed more accurate planning and asset management.  All this is available without any additional software, a standard browser is enough to work. <br><br>  Developers took care of expanding the library of 3D models, reworking the library code and making it available through the web interface, not forgetting to introduce a faster and more detailed model search mechanism.  In version 5.1, the mechanism of import and export of data on ports and structural cable systems is improved.  Also added support for configuring assets with IPv6 connectivity. <br><br>  The updated ONEView software solution with serial number 3.0 from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) will appear in the third quarter of this year.  This will allow owners of several geographically distributed data centers to view data on their entire IT infrastructure on one screen.  Improved offers for data center operators, HPE Helion CloudSystem 10 integration to simplify control of physical servers and virtual clusters, and HPE Intelligent Management Center to simplify management with network switches. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8S3EwT2D0y8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhuS5EizGc87e8XurOV23fZdmcIRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The company Panoramic Power is going to release a new product - Device Analyzer.  Device Analyzer tool can be used to monitor and optimize a variety of data center infrastructure elements: from air conditioning systems to lighting.  Based on the previously collected data, the system is also able to detect anomalies and automatically generate alerts sent to the specified pre-remote terminals. <br><br>  As you can see, the global DCIM market, which began to take shape more than a decade ago and currently consists of 6 dozen software vendors, may soon change seriously, but we should not expect dramatic changes.  The prospect of obtaining super-profits attracts new players from both ambitious start-ups and large companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243673/</a></p>
