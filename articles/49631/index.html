I would not like to use the word start-up, because it is already somehow erased from frequent use, so this is a project :) <br><br>  I think that everyone noticed that residents of cities, and especially large ones, have a pathological passion to know the weather.  First, it is a neutral topic for talking with any person, when there is nothing to talk about - ‚ÄúWell, but yesterday there was snow, did you see?  - Daaaaa - But tomorrow they promise rain?  - Uhhhhh.  And secondly, people have always tried to at least a little bit, but look into the future and be ready for it.  And on the basis of these inclinations a lot of sites appeared that deal with weather forecasts for days, weeks, and especially talented ones predict even for a month.  A small community of adherents has formed around each site, ready to prove that their idol is the most operational and reliable of all that is. <br><br>  But for some reason no one asks the question - Why this one, and not this one?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  How did </h2><br>  A small epigraph - <i>Who does not remember the past, he has no future.</i> <br><br>  A long time ago <s>, in a far distant galaxy ....</s> my parents were going to the country and asked me: <br>  - See what the weather will be for the weekend? <br>  - Ok, and what website should you look at?  - I answer. <br>  - Well, where is the most accurate forecast, of course. <br><br>  And then I thought, but how to really find out what is exact?  At that time, a cool sign hung on the pogo **. Ru site - a link to the site and a brief description, such as ‚Äúa good site with accurate forecasts‚Äù or ‚Äúnot very accurate‚Äù, etc.  But who decided why this is good, and this is not?  How reliable is the forecast given and for how many days, for example, for 3 days do they give an accurate one, but for 5 it is no longer possible to trust?  There was nothing of this. <br><br>  And then I decided to create my own website, on which anyone could see who gives a reliable forecast and who gives false information.  But how to do that?  How to check the forecast? <br><br>  The answer appeared almost instantly - if there is a forecast for something for a while, then you need to look at what it is at the same time and compare it with the forecast.  If the forecast coincides with the value (in some interval), then the forecast was correct, if not - then not. <br><br><h2>  What is it and why </h2><br>  Thus, my project <a href="http://mycli.me/">MyCli.me</a> (or <a href="http://myclime.info/">MyClime.info</a> ) appeared.  In fact, this is a small time machine that can show what the forecasts were from various sources, how they varied over time and what the actual weather was. <br><br>  For each pair of ‚Äúsource of forecasts + city‚Äù a rating is calculated for the last five days, which depends on how accurately the forecasts were made for the last 5 days and how long they were made.  No wonder to predict the weather only for tomorrow, looking periodically out the window;  make a reliable forecast for three, four days, this task is difficult and not everyone can cope with it.  So far (maybe not for now :), the rating is displayed as a percentage - 100% means there was an absolutely reliable forecast for five days, 80% only for 4 days, 60% for three, etc. <br><br>  In addition, the national statistics for the month is kept - who gave the most reliable and earliest forecast for the day, and how many such gains were made in a month. <br><br>  Thus, rating is a more stable and tangible indicator for orientation, whose prediction is trusted for the near future, while monthly statistics is a general trend ‚Äúwho is good here and who does not lie‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  What will happen next </h2><br><br>  Well, the very first and necessary thing that needs to be added is precipitation.  The evaluation has its own subtleties for testing, so I had to restrict myself to temperature so far :( <br><br>  Further there will be more cities and I think the number of sources will greatly increase. <br><br>  One of the main goals of the project is to lift the boundaries for the exchange of information and provide any person with a forecast from as many sources as possible.  Therefore, the project will be translated into other languages <s>and conquering the world</s> .  I could not find such a service neither in RuNet, nor in the world at all, so I hope it will be an Internet to many. <br><br>  So welcome - <a href="http://mycli.me/">MyCli.me</a> <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> Just to clarify - people write add my city, and here is my city or this source.  I will certainly add, but it takes some time to collect forecasts and start counting.  Therefore, cities will appear gradually. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49631/</a></p>
