We can use LinkedIn to expand our dating and create a personal brand, as well as follow the company on Instagram to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcorporate culture.  However, if you are not careful, social networks can significantly reduce your chances of getting the perfect job. <br><br>  Most applicants understand that it is not prudent to talk in a negative way about the current employer, colleagues or clients.  But there are many other, less obvious mistakes in social networks that can have disastrous consequences for finding a job. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Outdated social profile information</b> <br><br>  Do your LinkedIn and Xing profiles look modern and professional?  What about your contact details and current job title?  You underestimate yourself when you do not timely supplement your profiles with both basic information and new skills, latest projects and achievements.

      <b>The discrepancy between the resume and the profile on the Internet</b> <br><br>  Many candidates are excluded from the shortlists due to inconsistencies found between their profiles in social networks and summaries, especially if it concerns employment dates.  It is very important that the information available about you on the Internet, including LinkedIn, matches your resume.  Even if the difference is the result of a simple misunderstanding, and not an attempt to hide something, it can be regarded as insufficient attention to detail, and also form the opinion that you are prone to make mistakes. <br><br>  <b>Publication of inappropriate materials</b> <br><br>  Of course, privacy settings do exist, but it will be more cautious to provide access to all materials posted on the Internet to recruiters and hiring managers.  And if you do not want them to see it, just do not lay out. <br><br>  So, for example, recently our colleagues faced the fact that the candidate had withdrawn a job offer to the director‚Äôs position after the employer read the caustic publications she made, being dissatisfied with the poor service of the company.  The candidate used obscene language and even posted screenshots of conversations. <br><br>  On the other hand, it is possible to use social networks to create a positive personal brand.  For example, you can use Instagram to show interest in a particular sector or industry.  This may be your participation in various exhibitions, events or groups, visiting relevant places, offices or enterprises.  Through Twitter you can demonstrate your interests and experience.  For example, post a webinar that you found informative, or the development of a new industry that you are passionate about.  Of course, LinkedIn is a reflection of a significant part of your personal brand, so make useful contacts, join relevant groups, publish, respect professionalism and connections with your work / industry, and regularly update your profile.  It may also be useful to add links to your work (on GitHub, Kaggle, etc.) on your LinkedIn profile or in your resume. <br><br>  <b>Business hours publications</b> <br><br>  If you are to be interviewed, the hiring manager has full information about your current employment conditions.  It does not look good when they search social networks and see that you regularly publish during business hours.  For a number of employers, this may cast doubt on your job focus and productivity. <br><br>  <b>Premature dating</b> <br><br>  It makes sense as a preparation for the interview to get acquainted with publicly available information on social networks in order to get an idea about the education of the interviewer and his career path, the culture of the organization or read any published blogs or articles that he may have written. <br><br>  However, there is a difference between research, as a way of preparing for an interview, and the situation when they turn from an initiative to an annoying job seeker.  Sending a request for addition before being offered a job can form a false provision about you as a self-confident and too arrogant person.  After receiving an offer for a vacant position, you can join all professional networks such as LinkedIn, but up to this point, stick to business correspondence via e-mail, either directly or through your recruiter, depending on your method of communication. <br><br>  Thus, when the time comes for your next job search, make sure that social networks are your friend, not your enemy.  Do not forget to update the information in your social profile, match your resume and online profile, follow professional-business style in publications and comments, do not post messages during business hours and send requests for additions to LinkedIn to potential managers until you receive a job offer . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340016/</a></p>
