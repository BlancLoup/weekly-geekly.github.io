We reveal all the secrets. <br>  ‚ÄúI think we learned something this year.‚Äù  Why not tell about it.  I think this is something new in the industry.  I want to share this ... <br><br>  Speech in this short correspondence is about the article "12,000 rubles for the site, is there a business outside the Moscow Ring Road", which we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/136408/">published</a> exactly a year and a month ago.  After the publication of the article on the "Habr√©", the number of applications for the development of the site has doubled and has not decreased to date.  All year we worked like crazy, optimizing production, modifying the functionality of typical solutions, experimented with the project management model, worked on the software platform, spoke at conferences.  To say that it was not easy for us is to say nothing.  What have we got? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What have we got? </h4><br>  It seems to me the phrase "web-canape" has received a certain fame.  In 2012, we made more than 350 projects, received more than hundreds of feedback from customers, formed a strong team, and opened new related areas.  We built technology that allowed us to offer a high-quality product at a low cost, bringing real value to customers.  Our clients receive a complete turnkey website, adapted to their business, capable of bringing orders from day one.  We learned how to do in 5 days what we used to do in a month.  We began to imitate and even copy.  And this is all - this is our pride.  Of course, the income we receive is still far from the one we dream about.  But while the strategy and our confidence are more important.  We get grateful reviews and orders on the recommendations and this means that we are on the right track.

    <h4>  What is planned </h4><br>  We have developed Skyver and are already launching new projects on it.  This is a new version of our platform for creating and managing sites.  Thanks to the new version of the system, we plan to increase productivity by about 15-20%.  Customers receive an automatic update CMS, new modules, integration with modern third-party services.  Developers, we hope, will become more comfortable working thanks to the standardization and automation of many processes. <br><br>  We are starting to actively engage in internships and new staff training.  Over the past year we have grown by 30% (today there are 33 of us).  We very much understand the value and significance of each of the employees and want to work with us was really interesting.  We will pay great attention to the professional growth of each, the continuous improvement of our business processes, teamwork and good human relations with clients and among themselves. <br><br>  We really want to build a motivation system that would help us grow, shape our corporate culture and make working life more interesting. <br><br><h4>  What hasn't happened yet? </h4><br>  We tried to build an affiliate network, because our production capabilities allow us to do more.  This would remove our sales and product presentation functions to customers, freeing up managerial time for project work and increasing productivity.  But, as we see a year later, 25% -30% of the agency fee does not allow partners to earn enough, and therefore devote a sufficient amount of time to this.  This option is still interesting for small hosting companies or seo-studios, for which cooperation is not just income, but a source of clients for their own services.  But we are working in this direction and I am sure that we will find a suitable model. <br><br><h4>  What is ‚Äúweb-canape‚Äù now? </h4><br>  We know that small businesses need a quick result in the form of first orders.  This, as the first victory, with which everything is just beginning.  You need to feel it in time to get confirmation of your business idea and tune in to a big victory.  For this we work.  Web-canape is a service for fast promotion of small business goods and services through the Internet.  The result of our work is new customers of our customers.  Only in this way we try to measure our success. <br><br>  Already now we have something to be proud of, but the most interesting is yet to come and it depends only on us! <br><br>  Many thanks to our employees and their families, partners who believe the success of the web-canape.  Special thanks to Andrei Zaitsev, our SEO consultant, Anatoly Denisov (cmsmagazine.ru) for his trust and support.  Thanks to customers who use our services and help us to become better. <br><br>  New employees and partners, I invite you to a <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/about/team/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr">tour of the web canap√©s</a> , and I wish the existing team to continue to be professionals and confirm this with their work! <br><br>  Vasily Churanov <br>  <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr">web-canape.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169735/</a></p>
