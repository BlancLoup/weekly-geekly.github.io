Several articles have already been devoted to dogs in Google offices.  And I want to talk about living creatures in the German company Jimdo and the specially developed rules of behavior for dogs and their owners. <br><br>  It all started in April 2009, when an accounting officer brought a Jack Russell puppy to work.  Then there were only a couple of dozen people in the company, and everyone, naturally, rejoiced and was touched as children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae2/e31/546/ae2e315466f30a5a3e0b6d61f0145ace.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Gradually, new employees were hired and they, inspired by their freedom of action and corporate culture, decided to bring their pets to the office too.  Offices, it should be noted, are not quite standard.  Previously, these were production facilities, which later turned into an IT company bureau.  So, one fine day, 4 dogs settled on one floor.  Naturally, the dogs were bored during the working day.  They began to rush under the tables, sweeping away everything in their path.  When they got tired of it, toys and any objects that fell under the <s>arm of a</s> paw were used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d76/a89/365/d76a893655fb110f7d50dfcb4e17d776.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now in the office of 7 dogs.  Approximately 2 on each floor.  Some employees began to feel uncomfortable, which is perfectly understandable.  Someone is allergic, someone just comes to work to work and is not eager to fight off the harassment of playful puppies, someone even with animals on you.  Discussions began, the discussion lasted several weeks.  As a result, a list of rights and obligations for dog owners was formed. <br><br><h4>  <b>rules</b> <br></h4><br><br>  <b>The owner of the dog must</b> : <br><ul><li>  Bear full responsibility for the activities of your dog. </li><li>  Ensure that colleagues are comfortable in the company of the dog. </li><li>  If the owner of the dog has departed from the workplace, he should take care that someone should look after the dog. </li><li>  Constantly work on raising the dog and its relationship with other dogs. </li><li>  The dog must obey the owner and come to him at the first call. </li><li>  Dog can not sit on the sofas. </li><li>  The dog can not be fed from the common dishes. </li><li>  Do not leave open dog food in the refrigerator. </li><li>  A dog must not enter the kitchen due to hygienic considerations. </li><li>  If dogs play in the office, you need to make sure that they do not interfere with anyone. </li><li>  The dog must be vaccinated. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What happens if the rules are broken?</b> <br><ul><li>  The owner of the dog may be temporarily asked not to take the dog to the office, after which a probationary period will be given, during which the owner of the dog will be able to prove to all its controllability and obedience. </li><li>  If the dog is aggressive, it must leave the office immediately. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What if you are allergic to wool?</b> <br><ul><li>  Choose a workplace away from the owner of the dog. </li><li>  Warn dog owners about allergies so that they do not allow her to approach at close range. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What to do to improve communication between dogs and their owners?</b> <br><ul><li>  Take part in trainings. </li><li>  Take a joint walk during the break and after work. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What you need to do before you bring the dog to the office?</b> <br><ul><li>  Ask permission from the chefs. </li><li>  Ask permission from the entire department in which the dog will be located. </li><li>  Conduct the necessary vaccination and immunize the dog. </li><li>  The trial period for new dogs is 1 month. </li></ul><br><br>  After the adoption of these rules, the situation returned to normal, people and animals coexist well together.  Jimdo dogs are considered <a href="http://ru.jimdo.com/%25D0%25BE-jimdo/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0-jimdo/">full-fledged team members</a> and part of the corporate culture. <br><br><h6>  <b>Postscript optional for reading</b> </h6><br>  For all those who stay dogs at the workplace will seem nonsense: in Germany, a special relationship to pets.  Each dog has a registration number and it's just impossible to meet a stroller on the street.  Dogs also have a European Union passport (even I don‚Äôt have one).  Dogs not only go with their owners to work, but also ride bicycles with them, go to schools for dogs.  The owners pay taxes and insurance for them.  In order for the dog to run around the city without a leash, the owner must pass the exam and get a ‚ÄúHundef√ºhrerschein‚Äù, if translated literally, this is ‚Äúthe right to drive a dog‚Äù.  In short, the attitude to animals here is more than humane. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191928/</a></p>
