Or, maybe, it was possible to do such automation?  I am sure there are many such examples.  I also have - I throw in the piggy bank. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that you don‚Äôt have bias in reading (my article, but without bias in reading - ha ha ha) - such a short period of time is not due to the fact that Stas and I did automation.  And not in the platform matter (yes, this is 1C - what else is there to automate production in our country?).  The thing is different.  Perhaps, this experience will be useful to someone if it is possible to create similar conditions and make a project-record. <br><br>  Honestly, this experience was not useful to me.  I have never done automation so quickly in my life.  Stas - also did not.  All right, drove. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Company </h4><br>  The enterprise is a full-cycle poultry farm.  Own production of feed, its own chickens, hatching eggs (the generic herd is called), its incubators, where chickens come from eggs, their poultry houses, where chickens grow for about 40 days and become broilers, their killer, where broilers are killed, their production, where of lifeless chickens they make sausage, sausages, rolls, etc., their large freezer, where they freeze the chickens so that you have a choice in your store - to take fresh or last year's. <br><br>  The newly built pig farm, which was already producing products, went to the load.  There were sows that produced piglets, there were boars, without which piglets could not be born, there was growing those same pigs to the size of hefty pigs, there was a workshop for depriving pigs of life, and the meat was taken to produce hens. <br><br>  What I told in detail?  To convince you, from the point of view of automation, this is the real production itself.  Moreover, multi-transfer.  And then, after all, production is considered to be something related to hardware, even if it is simply the assembly of a product of ten components.  Here the accessories are much more.  There are dozens of spices alone. <br><br>  The number of employees, unfortunately, I remember poorly.  In my head there are two numbers - either 3, or 6 thousand people.  Normal such a plant, in general. <br><br><h4>  initial situation </h4><br>  I came to this company on October 4th, as head of the IT department.  In submission - Stas, 1C programmer, and two admins.  There are two tasks: routine - to manage the IT department, the main one - to transfer the plant from January to 1C 8 Manufacturing Enterprise Management (UPP). <br><br>  At that time, the information system was 1C 7.7.  I never understood anything in it, so I still don‚Äôt remember how it was precisely named - either ‚ÄúProduction + Services + Accounting‚Äù, or ‚ÄúIntegrated‚Äù.  If there are those who understand - write the difference in the comments. <br><br>  Jobs were supposed to hundreds.  Normal price tag for a factory. <br><br>  The pigsty was not automated at that time.  Everything was done on paper and in Excel, handed over to the chicken coop, there they entered data. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot - there was still the most important task.  For her, everything was started. <br><br><h4>  The Most Important Task </h4><br>  If you worked with cost automation, then you know what a cost structure is.  If you are from the world of 1C, then you know such a report as the ‚ÄúCost Structure‚Äù. <br><br>  If you do not know, I will explain.  Here is, for example, a sausage that you buy in a store.  What is sausage made of?  For example, pork, chicken, and a bunch of spices and all sorts of additives, including water.  At the first, or rather, the last redistribution, the cost structure is a flat table with the ingredients listed above.  This is a direct material cost. <br><br>  To the heap there are added the costs of, in fact, the production of sausage.  Electricity, heat, gas, workers 'wages, equipment depreciation, programmers' wages, etc.  The table becomes more terrible. <br><br>  What is pork made of?  Well, from a pig, I guess.  And chicken - from chicken.  A second level appears, and the flat table becomes a tree, with attachments.  But, as we know, sausage is made from a lifeless pig.  Make a pig of pork - also redistribution.  After all, it is necessary to cut it, at least.  The cost of completing this division is still well underway. <br><br>  A pig deprived of life, like a chicken, is created from a completely live animal.  This is also a redistribution.  Moreover, very impressive - large lines, foreign production, everything is automated.  How many levels are in our table? <br><br>  In the meantime, the chicken and the pig grew, they were fed, watered, treated for sores, heated, served chicken coops and pigsties, etc.  During the lifetime of the list of costs has accumulated very impressive. <br>  Well, etc., until the very herds of birth, "released" the egg.  The cost tree turns out to be very impressive - several levels, a bunch of lines with costs.  You can find out in detail what our sausage is made of. <br><br>  But the cost structure in the form of a tree can only watch the programmer.  And that, not to solve some practical problem, but because he himself built this tree.  Something in it is impossible to understand normally. <br><br>  For example, I want to know how many rubles of electricity in a kilogram of sausage.  To collect a figure on a tree, you have to run all over the tree, because  electricity was spent on all the redistribution - and on heating the hen, then on the incubator, on the poultry house, on all the industrial redistribution. <br><br>  Therefore, for normal people needed a flat structure, collecting the final costs of finished products.  All electricity in one line, all heat, gas, workers' salaries, office salaries, depreciation, etc.  Beautiful, small otdetik, the size of A4. <br><br>  The trouble was that the director needed this report.  He did not know anything about what 1C, but the report wanted to see consistently once a month.  He himself looked at all the figures, compared them with previous months, got to the bottom, if fermentation began in the cost structure. <br><br>  This report was in the old system, but lived on its last legs.  He was not made by Stas, but by some sensible dude, who quit a year or two ago.  There, somehow, it was done through uploading to files, then these files began to be divided into pieces, because the information volumes did not fit. <br><br>  So we decided to switch to 1C 8. It's funny how they made the decision.  They called one of the integrators, told the most important task.  He left, then returned, and showed them the cost structure that had been uploaded to Excel and formed by my report, which had long been lying on the Internet.  When I came to get settled, this Excel also showed me.  They laughed together. <br><br><h4>  Preparation for the project </h4><br>  From October to January I did only one thing for the project - I bought software and licenses.  It was the SCP itself, Salary and Human Resource Management (ZUP), and the industry-wide solution of the Management of an Agricultural Enterprise (CAP).  He is still a zoo. <br><br>  The rest of the time I was doing my favorite thing - I swore. <br><br>  The first month was ‚Äúpostpartum depression‚Äù - well, I changed my job, I need to catch up.  Moreover, it was necessary here to drive 40 km along the highway.  Although, they paid more. <br><br>  Then I tried to somehow organize the work of the system administrators, because I was infuriated if their jambs flew to me.  I made my first service desk, which no one ever used. <br><br>  Stas told me to start doing something, but I did not listen to him.  He himself knew little 1C 8 then, specialized in 7.7 more, so he just sighed sadly and continued to go about his business. <br><br>  And I seemed to be waiting for something.  Well, wait.  Came January. <br><br><h4>  vacation </h4><br>  In early January, as expected, there were holidays.  Early in the morning, on the first day of the new year, they called me from the factory and said that the video surveillance had broken.  I called the admin, he already repaired.  Never, neither before nor after, they called me from work on January 1. <br><br>  Some days I just rested.  The idea that something needs to be done on the project, I almost never left, but I drove it away.  Do not want and that's it. <br><br>  Then, around January 7, my boss called - the financial director.  He says - come to the plant, we are discussing something.  We arrived with Stas, discussed the scheme of order accounting.  She asked - how is it, everything is normal?  I say yes, of course.  We will leave, and at once everything will zakolositsya. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt do anything else on the project until I went to work.  That is, almost to the middle of January. <br><br><h4>  January </h4><br>  Well, here, as they say, rushed.  There is such an approach - extreme programming.  We had an extreme introduction. <br><br>  Naturally, from the first hour we started calling and asking where and how to enter data.  And even our server is not deployed.  Glory to the gods, even though SQL was ready. <br><br>  Okay, quickly deployed 1C.  Quickly added users - those who have already called.  And who did not call - it means not much is necessary.  The main thing is that the accounting department has not yet reached it - they are usually busy with reporting in January, and it is taken from the old system. <br><br>  Users logged into the program, and there - emptiness.  No items, no warehouses, no residues.  Half an hour they consulted where to begin - they decided that the nomenclature is more important.  Without it, nothing can be done. <br><br>  We rushed to look for some processing to transfer directories.  Found it quickly, downloaded it, tried it - it works!  Nomenclature has appeared.  Units, contractors, warehouses - also transferred.  Slightly relieved, you can at least make out the shipment. <br><br>  So did the remnants.  Found processing, downloaded, transferred.  Well yours through the yoke ... She only under the accounting records transferred the remains.  I had to urgently write processing, which created similar balances on management accounting. <br><br>  Then I can be confused with chronology, because  everything happened as in a dream.  But everything was in January. <br><br>  Then called the boss.  I thought, I - zvizdets.  No, everything is more prosaic - she decided to change the names of the nomenclature, since such a thing is the introduction of a new system.  Only trouble is - the correspondence table is very much made up. <br><br>  Well, quickly, we built a treatment to rename a nomenclature.  Completed - everything looks good.  But calls from the warehouse of the shipment began soon - they say, we have spoiled them all the documents.  Look - damn it, and the truth.  Because of the fuzzy match, there were really unacceptable substitutions. <br><br>  The nomenclature story continued in a sluggish mode for a couple of days.  Find an error, we manually correct the matching table, run, forget.  As a result, they won. <br><br>  Then they came from the accounting and said that we are assholes.  Because they did not make a key refinement - accounting in two units.  In general, in 1C accounting is carried out in one unit.  If you have pieces, then count in pieces, if kilograms, then count them.  There is a conversion from one unit to another, but it is linear, by coefficient. <br><br>  And chickens are considered to be in heads and kilograms.  There is no linear relationship.  In one house, 10 chickens can weigh more than 15 chickens in another.  We really need two fields in each document - the number in kilograms and heads. <br><br>  I tried to argue, but Stas said what to do.  Sat down, done.  Somewhere it took half a day - it was saved that in the second unit only accounting was needed, without calculating the cost price, etc. <br><br>  Here the accounting department stuck with some AWP.  At first I fought back - you will manage without an automated workplace and enter the primary organization with your hands.  But they insisted, showed their work (it's about time, yeah), and I decided to make this unfortunate AWP. <br><br>  Its essence is simple.  Chickens in poultry houses are periodically counted and weighed.  The results are written on pieces of paper and passed to the accounting department.  Here you need an AWP - you need to drive in a couple of numbers, the current number and weight of chickens, and the system must find the latest results of the same weighing, calculate the difference and issue a release document.  Release are kilograms, on them expenses are also written off. <br><br>  It immediately became clear that chickens are capricious animals, and sometimes they stop eating normally.  As a result - weight loss.  Like and don't care, but from the point of view of accounting this is a negative issue, and 1C does not know how.  I had to urgently refine. <br><br>  Providers have woken up - they, it turns out, have internal orders, when different units ask for something to buy.  There is some simple reconciliation procedure.  The suppliers themselves, of course, in the new program or in the tooth foot.  I had to quickly modify the standard internal order, and conduct training. <br><br>  The problem came from where it was not expected - offsetting the advance.  If you are not from the world of 1C, briefly explain.  If we paid a prepayment to the provider, it is an advance.  When he brought the goods, a credit card arises - we owe him money.  But we already paid an advance.  The reduction of the advance and the creditors so that the program deducts one from the other - this is the offset of the advance. <br><br>  The problem was that there was an aunt sitting on this site, who resolutely did not understand what an advance credit was.  In 1C there are normal tools that allow this operation to be carried out - but only if a person understands what he is doing at all.  But she did not understand.  And every morning she smelled like a boozer.  We had to urgently invent an automatic credit for the advance - even more automatic than the one that is already in the system. <br><br>  Along the way, we painted several printing plates, but this is so, seeds. <br><br>  Somewhere here ended January.  It was a simple month - it was enough for us to organize the operational accounting and input of primary documents.  Next month, the salary, the cost price and the Most Main Task should have been born from the primary organization. <br><br><h4>  February </h4><br>  Then my fate decided that I was too well settled, and threw a serious problem to me - my six-month-old daughter fell ill.  I ate a cauliflower from a purchased jar, and there, in the load, turned out to be a bacterium, the name of which I remembered for the rest of my life - Klebsiella oxytoca (Klebsiella oxytoc). <br><br>  Eat - and then diarrhea.  Several times a day.  Dehydration, life threatening.  My wife ran with her through the hospitals, I - with them through time.  On the introduction was already a shit.  Everything fell on the shoulders of Stas.  In the end, they put in an infectious disease, a couple of days later they fled from there.  Than just not treated, nothing helped.  As a result, they turned to a local famous professor, and somehow it coincided that it became easier by the day of the reception.  He wrote some cheap pills, but the main thing - reassured.  Daughter went to the amendment. <br><br>  I set out briefly, but this story continued throughout February, creating an unpleasant emotional background. <br><br>  My main concern is the calculation of wages for either 3, or 6 thousand people, oddly enough, was decided easily.  Maybe the smart girls got caught.  Maybe the 1Cnaya program is so good - I don't know.  But there were no problems.  Found processing, which transferred the history of charges.  They wrote processing, which was unloading data from the SCP into the ZUP - it seems, the release in the context of poultry houses, orders, something else.  The algorithm for calculating the wages of the workers was very complicated, and was not automated either before us or with us.  As the devil knew where, and continued.  In 1C got the totals of charges. <br><br>  I had to tinker with the calculation of the cost.  First, in those days, the algorithm for calculating through SLAE, known as Extended Cost Accounting Analytics (RAUS), was relatively new, and contained errors.  Now he is the height of perfection, but then we had to doubt every number. <br><br>  Secondly, the calculation was also needed in tax accounting, which I did not have to do before.  They fumbled, found a couple of errors in the code, fixed it, it seemed like something was considered. <br><br>  Thirdly, for the first time in my life I ran into a release through 40 accounts.  There is nothing particularly interesting in that, except for one thing - it worked with errors. <br><br>  Many had to tinker with setting up a distribution of costs, because  domestic services were widely used.  For example, there is some repair shop - poultry houses go and repair, if that broke.  At the end of the month they pass the papers - who they repaired.  Their costs (salary, materials) must lie flat on those poultry houses that they repaired.  Not to say that the cosmic scale is a straightforward task, but I had to tinker. <br><br>  I remember the finale of this calculation.  The boss just drove off in the UAE, but kept ICQ included.  And periodically, once in half an hour, she asked me - well, well, did he calculate the cost price?  And I told her - no, it does not count dick.  And so on all day - until it happened. <br><br>  And when it came out, I proceeded to the Most Main Task. <br><br>  In general, it is not difficult to calculate the cost structure.  The usual iterative algorithm that digs deeper and deeper, you only need to control the obsession and correctly recalculate the numbers.  The real problems begin when you do not just consider the structure, but must keep it. <br><br>  For example, this month, the cost structure is one; next, it is different.  It is necessary to store both, and not only the structures themselves, but also the remains.  The chicken lives for itself, and does not know that a large tail of hundreds of lines of the cost structure already stretches behind it.  And when the chicken will be deprived of life, and it will fall, for example, at the warehouse in the form of freezing, then next hell will be another hen, ‚Äúcreated‚Äù last month, with its cost structure. <br><br>  Options for the month went through six pieces.  That calculation is too slow, the amount of stored data exceeds all imaginable limits.  But, in the end, something happened - the algorithm met the criteria and, by the way, it existed for a long time - until the very sale of this poultry farm to another agricultural holding.  Then all of our UppA was demolished together. <br><br>  At the same time, he tried to launch an industry-wide solution for the Management of an Agricultural Enterprise (USP).  Not everything worked out.  Not everything worked - the program was designed for a person who understands what he is doing.  And I, naturally, understood poorly.  But somehow launched. <br><br>  I learned a lot of new things then.  For example, that boars are bought abroad, because in Russia there is no place.  Like, the breed was called F1.  And the process ... Mmm ... Making pigs - asynchronous.  First the boar does its job, then the sow.  They do not overlap with each other. <br>  And still the sow is the basic means, as the machine or the server.  It must be amortized.  A boar regularly produces finished products.  It is such an unpleasant word that I will not give it.  It is from this word that the pigs come later. <br><br>  In short, February ended successfully.  And our introduction is over.  We have closed the month, the accounting department has submitted its reports, including those specific to agriculture.  The director received his small report with a flat cost structure. <br><br>  I worked at this plant for another 3 months, and quit.  The last three months have become a mirror reflection of the first - I did not do a damn thing.  The main task was solved, the system was supported by Stas, we didn‚Äôt do any major modifications. <br><br>  In the first place came the task previously considered secondary - in fact, the management of the IT department, especially admins.  Those peppers were still.  Actually, because of their carelessness and my inability to manage them the way the leadership wanted, I eventually left. <br><br><h4>  The reasons </h4><br>  Now the main thing - why did you manage to start the system so quickly?  After all, taking into account the holidays, it was 1.5 months.  And if you throw out the task of calculating the cost structure, which took away almost the whole of February, then 1 month will remain (you can throw it out because no one usually solves it, especially in the context of implementation). <br><br>  Answers to the question "why did it happen?" Were already in the text.  Both direct and indirect. <br><br>  The first reason is prosaic, extreme mode.  While there was time for preparation, I kicked chicken poop, drank coffee, smoked and thought about the high.  As soon as time disappeared, we sat down and began to plow - there were no options anymore.  Of course, you don‚Äôt like it when I say that the less choice there is, the better, but in this case that‚Äôs what happened. <br><br>  What is interesting - we almost did not work overtime.  For two months I didn‚Äôt stay at the plant even longer than it was supposed to.  In February, when it was necessary to close the month, I worked a couple of evenings remotely - the family still lay in the infectious disease, and there was really nothing to do. <br><br>  Extreme mode is good because sweeps away all unnecessary.  No meetings, thinking, consideration of the many solutions.  Only a direct path, only to the goal, just what is needed.  Therefore, the system did not have any extra work done ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù. <br><br>  But extreme mode is not the main reason.  When you read the article, you noticed how I talked about meetings, discussions, swearing with users, meetings with directors, debriefing, sabotage, etc.  - In short, about everything that usually accompanies the project implementation in the factories?  Not paid attention? <br><br>  Not paid, because there was nothing of this.  Wednesday was great.  Not in the sense that there was a green meadow, it smelled of roses and birds were singing, no.  The atmosphere was very oppressive.  But people, users, their leaders - all were like from a fairy tale. <br><br>  Almost no one asked for any nonsense, as is often the case.  In general, little was asked.  Only that without which it is impossible to work right now. <br><br>  When I did something and showed to users, no one was naughty about the interface, inconvenience, etc.  Works - and great.  It does not work very well - okay, we'll finish it off with our hands.  Although, frankly, I‚Äôll say that it‚Äôs these people who want to help, to complete, to work well. <br><br>  No one, not once, did not complain to anyone.  If there is a problem, call us in the IT department.  If we sent, then it all ended.  If you strongly need, call again, and again, and again.  I was still waiting for an evil boss to rush in, as it happens in other factories, and say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt deal with us!‚Äù, But this situation never arose. <br><br>  Now the question is why?  What, at this poultry farm, some special staff is recruited?  Or feed something edakimi, as in equilibrium, to suppress emotions? <br><br>  No, everything is more prosaic.  It was the boss. <br><br>  It so happened that most of the office was subordinate to the financial director.  Accounting, economists, financiers and, oddly enough, the IT department.  That is, almost all users of the system obeyed one boss. <br><br>  And the boss was ... Strict, in short.  Very clever (real), and very strict.  Tough.  You will come to complain and dismiss snot - she will not use soft skills to justify her inability to solve real problems, as some effective managers love.  So grab that quickly run and agree with those who went to complain.  Well, so told, at least. <br><br>  As in reality, I don‚Äôt know, because I didn‚Äôt complain about anyone, and nobody complained about me.  Never.  Any question was decided among themselves.  It happened that it was impossible to come to an agreement with a specific accountant or economist, and they called the chief - and that‚Äôs what happened.  Because there are no options, there is no place above, but it is necessary to agree. <br><br>  The boss, realizing the importance of the project, first of all, for herself, decided to give me privileges.  Called and said - complain, you can!  Who interferes?  Who does not help?  To head off?  I say - do not, everything is fine. <br><br>  This conversation was repeated several times.  Seeing that I was adamant, she began to scold me.  Says - you do not use the resource.  Surely there is a slip due to someone, and you are hiding from me.  Come on, say, do not try to steer everything yourself.  But I, for some reason, and this time refused. <br><br>  That's how it was.  Extreme mode and complete understanding based on fear.  And the smart result is a simple, working system without boasting. <br><br>  As I mentioned in the introduction, I no longer had such an experience.  Of course, it was necessary to work extremely, but not on such a scale and with such responsibility ‚Äî this is a whole plant.  There was no such atmosphere anywhere else.  An environment that is just ready to achieve results, too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451702/</a></p>
