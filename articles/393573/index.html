On May 4, 2007, this amateur radio-creativeist among schoolchildren finished the earthly journey. <br><br>  I deliberately do not say "death" - after all, as Mikhail Viktorovich Bekhterev, a well-known brain researcher, said - a person does not die - he lives after death in people's memories, in those works that a person left behind. <br><br>  Victor Gavrilovich is the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Young Radio Amateur‚Äù - published in 8th editions (since 1952), and which gave impetus to the study of radio electronics by many future enthusiasts and professionals.  Among them - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dihalt/" class="user_link">DIHALT</a> - the founder of one of the most popular resources on electronics in runet (easyelectronics.ru) whose goal is "the development and promotion of electronics hobbies in the mass."

      Viktor Gavrilovich also created the foundation for organizing children's amateur radio circles - many (if not all the children‚Äôs radio circles in the Soviet Union) were engaged in his books.  Since 1976, working in the magazine "Radio", led the department for beginners. <br><br>  We give small fragments of his memories and reviews of people who read his books. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img width="200" align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/596/994/bd3/596994bd301c45c08df54bd17d63e7cf.jpg"><br>  <i>(memoirs from 1994)</i> Victor Gavrilovich: ‚ÄúI am a native Muscovite.  Born in Moscow in January 1915.  It so happened that I often had to be at the Sennoy Market (this is in Moscow) on Miusskaya Square.  This was due to the fact that I helped my father there.  So, one day some guys put up huge masts, pulled the wire and organized a queue of those who wanted to listen to the transmitting radio stations on their headphones.  The interest was huge. <br><br>  Of course, I was terribly amazed when I suddenly heard a voice and immediately captured me.  It happened again that one friend was found who helped me get the phone, helped me to make the first reel, the first receiver and get success. <br><br>  Here, strictly speaking, it was the main impetus to the fact that I got carried away quite seriously. " <br><br>  "... I was drawn and pulled not only to radio engineering, but in general to modeling, designing, and here again there were a lot of friends and friends who were also fond of various designs. So I went to work to somehow satisfy my interests, to the station young technicians. At that time, it‚Äôs true, several, perhaps, not stations were called. They were called children's technical stations, although there were usually young ones there. There I had the opportunity not only to design myself, but again there were comrades already,  about work, with some of which I am friends now, they are already at the same age as I. Helped me to study. Helped with details and lamps at that time. The lamp technique was then the main thing. A little later, it was somewhere, I don‚Äôt remember exactly a year now, but somewhere in the early 1930s, fate threw me to the Central Station of young technicians. <br><br>  It is here, perhaps, that my future and labor was defined, and call it your own, as you wish.  I found a good helper and teacher there.  Rather, I came to him.  It was Alexander Filippovich Shevtsov, one of the editors of the first amateur radio magazine. " <br><br><img align="left" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/797/586/e85797586a344fbfa366968d6a81a6df.jpg"><br>  My book came out, the first edition of the "Young radio amateur" in 1952. <br><br>  This was the first edition.  The publication, which was sold out instantly and did not have time to disperse, as the applications began to arrive in order to reprint it and re-publication began.  Just recently, about six months ago, the 8th edition of this book was published.  Book.  It is not only popular with us.  It was reprinted in a number of countries (China, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Estonia). <br>  These books, as a memory, I have on the shelf and, of course, I am pleased that the books are a success. <br><br>  Somewhat later, after the release of the first edition, I happened to work as the director of the Central Station for Young Technicians (years 5).  As a director, of course, I promoted radio circles there that developed. " <br><br>  "... the work at the Central Station once again prompted me: It is necessary to pay more attention to the elimination of such amateur radio as I have always called. It was with this mood that I came to work in Radio Magazine in 1976. I organized the beginners department. <br><br>  Work until retirement age.  Before I retired, I was looking for a deputy for myself, and then we became close to Ivan Sergeyevich Ivanov, who became my successor in Radio magazine. <br><br>  I first met Ivanov when he started writing brochures for the Detsky Mir publishing house and I had to edit his brochures.  There we met him.  So he began working in the magazine "Radio". <br><br>  Being retired, I continued to work.  He wrote, reworked "Young radio amateur", enriched these books with new materials on a modern element base. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúHere I work today [1994] in the editorial office of the magazine‚Äú Radio ‚Äù.  I try to prepare materials in the journal in such a way that they are popular, interesting and more and more attracted to amateur radio a lot of radio amateurs and, above all, the beginner boys of today's girls, those to whom I dedicated my entire working life. <br><br>  Well, here, perhaps, and everything is short. " <br><br>  <i>/ fragments from a meeting with Viktor Gavrilovich Borisov, 04/21/94 in the editorial staff of the magazine "Radio" /</i> <br><br><h5>  <b>Reviews</b> </h5><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/131/c17/43b/131c1743b273b32a25237878a177e4cf.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dihalt/" class="user_link">DIHALT</a> <br><blockquote>  Borisov‚Äôs book was the starting point for me.  She accidentally fell into my hands along with a pack of other books on electronics that my stepfather had brought.  Together with an oscilloscope, a multimeter with a "thousand holes" and a half-dozen boxes with radio components.  I was then in the third class, I read everything in a row that came to hand and then I got a taste of Borisov.  Immediately caught fire to collect something.  This is what the detector radio has become.  Fortunately, all that is needed for him was in those boxes with radio components.  And the trimmer capacitor (the same as in the picture), and the same diode, headset, capacitors and sockets.  I even wound the coil on the sleeve from the old hunting cartridge, just like in a book.  It turned out one to one.  And immediately earned.  Everything, it was impossible to stop me ... </blockquote><br>  <i>Alexey</i> <br><blockquote>  My best friend in the 7m class was fond of electronics for this book!  First, I took in the library of the old edition, the seventies, in a red cover.  Then a friend had a publication of the end of the eighties ... And she suffered ... Nostalgia. </blockquote><br>  <i>Enigman1982</i> <br><blockquote>  I also have a red cover!  I remember the whole fifth class spent in this book:) ... the detector receiver ... how happy it was to hear the radio of Russia in the antediluvian TON-2 ears :) <br></blockquote><br>  <i>Alexander</i> <br><blockquote>  I received this book for my birthday at the age of 6, which determined my future life in electronics. </blockquote><br>  <i>RK6AUI Andrey</i> <br><blockquote>  Very grateful to the author for this book.  This book was for me the alphabet in the world of electronics.  Thanks to this book, I achieved a new one.  Yes, it has schemes that are outdated, but in it the basics that will always give the foundation!  It would not have stepped forward electronics </blockquote><br><br><h5>  <b>Radio circles</b> </h5><br>  By the way, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/vv_kuznetsov/" class="user_link">vv_kuznetsov, the</a> author of publications on the simulator of electronic circuits <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%5Bqucs%5D%26target_type%3Dposts">Qucs</a> - was engaged in the radio circle according to the book of Borisov (there was one book for the whole circle). <br><br>  Of course, now radio circles are no longer so relevant - everything is evolving, but electronics has become a part of robotics - the development of which in the form of TsMITs, FabLabs, Hackspaces, etc.  - contributes to the same task - the popularization of technical creativity among schoolchildren. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there are no books on how to ‚ÄúOrganize a circle of robotics‚Äù - after all, it‚Äôs not easy - to prepare a methodology, a program, a lesson.  I will cite a fragment from VG Borisov‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Circle of Radio Engineering Design‚Äù from 1986, about the organization of the educational process in the circle, the basic principles of working with schoolchildren in teaching, have not lost their relevance even now, after 30 years. <br><br>  By the way, the book contains a program for 144 hours of work circle: <br><blockquote>  The proposed program, designed for 144 hours of work of the circle, provides for the formation of theoretical knowledge of the basics of electrical and radio engineering and practical skills of the circle members, sufficient for meaningful use of measuring devices, prototyping, mounting and adjusting transistor receivers of direct amplification of varying complexity. <br></blockquote><br>  Fragment from the book: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">General issues of conducting classes</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> The following program of classes in the circle is designed to prepare the circle members for self-design simple radio equipment.  It provides for the study of the necessary theoretical information on radio engineering and the installation, assembly and commissioning work on the manufacture of radio devices.  The content of theoretical information should be consistent with the nature of practical work on each topic of the program. <br><br>  The sequence of passing topics in a circle may differ from that indicated in the program, and some topics are cross-cutting for the entire time the circle is running.  The end-to-end for the 1st year class includes, for example, the themes ‚ÄúElements of electrical and radio engineering‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoldering and installation techniques‚Äù.  Theoretical information on each of these topics should be reported in relation to specific practical work performed on other topics.  The topic ‚ÄúSemiconductor diodes and transistors‚Äù to a large extent is also transparent, because it is directly related to almost all other topics of the program of the radio engineering design. <br><br>  The list of practical work should not be considered exhaustive;  It is quite acceptable to include in the work plan of the circle the design of instruments and devices not covered by the program, but relevant to a particular topic.  Thus, the practical work of the 1st and 2nd year classes, except receivers and amplifiers, probes and measuring devices, may include the construction of megaphones of different complexity, intercoms for a school, an out-of-school institution, a tourist or pioneer camp, - visual aids for the mug. <br><br>  As experience shows, theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired by students in radio engineering design circles turn out to be much broader, deeper, and diverse than those envisaged by the program.  This is explained by the fact that for many children, amateur radio habits are not limited to classes in the circle, but continue as independent work on the design of a device at home, in the process of reading popular radio engineering literature, and communicating with fellow members of interest.  It also affects the thirst for knowledge of the continuously changing element base of radio engineering, interest in the novelty of the circuit and design solutions of industrial and amateur radio equipment. <br><br>  Classes in a circle should not be overloaded with conversations on the fundamentals of electrical and radio engineering, device and work of parts, devices.  During the school year, no more than 25‚Äì30% of the total time budget should be allotted to the message of cognitive information; the rest of the time is devoted to practical, radio-design work.  Moreover, the design, which is the basis of all the activities of the circle, should begin as early as possible, from the third, at the latest - from the fourth lesson.  Delay in commencement of practical work may weaken the interest of the children in the circle, cause dropouts from it. <br><br>  The theoretical information is communicated to the children in the form of informative conversations lasting no more than 15 ... 20 minutes at each two-hour lesson.  It should be just conversations (not lectures) with demonstrations of details, instruments, experiments, questions and answers, circle discussions.  Most of the necessary theoretical knowledge, students receive in the analysis of the concepts planned for the manufacture of amplifiers, receivers, measuring instruments, in the process of performing practical work.  Some of the conversations can be conducted by the members of the circle themselves, choosing the appropriate literature with the help of the head of the circle.  In general, to teach radio amateurs to use technical literature, and especially reference, is one of the most important tasks facing the circle. <br><br>  Planned practical work should not be an end in itself.  Choosing, developing and assembling these or other structures, circle members should have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe principle of their operation, the purpose of individual parts and assemblies "methods of establishing, finding and troubleshooting.  Only then classes in the groups will benefit students.  Unfortunately, sometimes in pursuit of spectacular designs (for the exhibition), some members of the circle, often with the permission of the manager, take on complex radio equipment for them according to the available descriptions.  This leads to blind copying of unfamiliar structures.  The head of the circle is forced to pay more attention to the work with these guys, thereby causing damage to the main composition of the circle, sometimes he has to complete such constructions himself.  Such "amateur radio" brings harm to the whole mug.  Therefore, it is necessary to plan the manufacture of only those devices that from beginning to end can be assembled and adjusted by the students themselves, only in the conscious work on the designs circle members fully demonstrate their creative abilities. <br><br>  The radio engineering design circle should not remain aloof from socially useful activities and activities conducted by out-of-school institutions or schools in which these children study.  For example, for a field camp of an apprentice production team in a radio circle, you can mount a receiver that provides a loud enough reception at a local broadcasting station; for an amateur tourist camp, a radio center; for a military sports game Zarnitsa, radio station simulators, intercoms and much more.  Kruzhkovtsy themselves determine the degree and form of participation in an event.  The head takes an active part in the ongoing discussion, makes suggestions, but does not impose them.  The question of participation in any exhibition or in radio-sports competitions should also be decided and carried out by the circle members themselves. <br><br>  Among the circle members there are always those who want to build radio-technical devices for their personal use at home.  This desire should be encouraged, if, of course, the conceived constructions correspond or are close to the subject of the circle.  The guys will mount them in the classroom, but from their details. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393573/</a></p>
