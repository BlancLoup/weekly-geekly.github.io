The case of the device hides in itself a copper induction coil for wireless charging according to the Qi standard, which provides only 10% less energy efficiency than conventional wired chargers, but greatly simplifies the charging process compared to them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Nokia Lumia 820 is a smartphone with a removable body.  We are talking about the case, because in the process of replacing the intact, only the front part with the screen remains - this will give plenty of room for imagination to manufacturers of accessories.  However, there will also be plenty of branded cases: together with the start of sales of the device, both color and functional cases will appear with the possibility of the same wireless charging and enhanced dust and moisture protection characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/582/e81/13c/582e8113ce4dddaff37eda29030e66f0.png"><br>  <sup>Nokia Lumia 820</sup> <br><br>  The physical buttons of both devices are made of zirconia ceramics.  This material is not only extremely pleasant to the touch, but also incredibly durable.  The Nokia Lumia 920 is also made of ceramics, and the rear PureView camera is also back - we'll be back to it.  The composition of the physical buttons has remained unchanged since the days of Windows Phone 7: this is a volume rocker, a screen lock button and a camera release button.  The Windows function keys in the devices also did not change and, as before, represent the three touch buttons "back", "Windows" and "search", located under the screen. <br><br>  Above the screen of new smartphones are the speaker, sensors for ambient light and proximity, as well as the front camera.  The Nokia Lumia 920 uses a front HD camera with a resolution of 1280x960 pixels for video calls, and a Lumia 820 with a VGA camera with a resolution of 640x480 pixels. <br><br>  On the upper edge of the device is a headphone output.  The Nokia Lumia 920 also has a microSIM card tray (in the Nokia Lumia 820, the microsymbol is located under the back panel).  At the bottom of the smartphone are microUSB for charging and wired data transmission, as well as microphones for talking with noise reduction function. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The Nokia Lumia 920 uses the most advanced 4.5-inch display, made on an IPS-matrix with a resolution of 1280x768 pixels - simple arithmetic shows that the pixel density per inch of this screen is record and is 332 ppi, which is more than the iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S3.  The display uses PureMotion HD + technology, which means that the switching speed of pixels is more than 2 times higher than that of any other screen.  As a result, the picture looks clearer and smoother when viewing dynamic content.  This effect is enhanced by the use of a thinner, but more durable second-generation Gorilla Glass, which, coupled with the missing air cushion, creates the feeling that the content is located directly on the screen, and not under a thick layer of glass.  The Nokia Lumia 920 display is equipped with a new generation of ClearBlack technology: now the polarizing filter can adapt to bright light, increasing the readability of the content on the screen. <br><br>  The screen in the Nokia Lumia 820 is made by technology AMOLED.  Its dimensions are 4.3 inches, and the resolution is 800x480 pixels.  In fact, this display completely repeats the characteristics of the screen of the Nokia Lumia 900, which was the flagship until recently.  But unlike the Nokia Lumia 900, the Nokia Lumia 820 now also uses the updated ClearBlack technology for comfortable reading in very sunny weather. <br><br>  Moreover, the screens of the new Lumia devices recognize the touch not only of fingers, but also, for example, of gloves, which is especially important in countries with a climate like Russia. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-Yyuu7cAdc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhid-3E6y9OGgV8cGw1p9WZoKrZJgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This was made possible through the use of touch sensors Synaptics ClearPad 3250, located directly in the display cell: because of this arrangement, the recognition power is three times higher than that of other screens.  New Nokia Lumia can simultaneously recognize up to 10 taps on the screen, which usually equals the maximum number of fingers.  Smartphones are able to recognize the area and the nature of depression, as well as focus on the proximity sensor, so that they will not independently call random contacts from the pocket of your pants. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The flagship Nokia Lumia 920, as many expected, is indeed equipped with a PureView-camera.  However, if in Nokia 808 PureView our engineers chose to use a large sensor with a size of 1 / 1.2 inches and a huge resolution of the matrix, this time it was decided to use a 1/3 inch sensor with a normal resolution of 8.7 megapixels and a pixel size of 1.4 microns. <br><br>  The main feature of the PureView camera in the Nokia Lumia 920 is a BSI (Backside Illumination) sensor of the new generation.  The difference between BSI and the more familiar FSI (Frontside Illumination) front-illuminated sensors is that the BSI sensor makes it easier for light to enter the photodiodes of the sensor.  In the FSI-sensor, the light is forced to pass through the metal wiring and circuit elements before it hits the photosensitive elements at the base of the sensor.  The backlit sensor uses a reverse structure, in which all wiring is located at the base of the sensor, and the photosensitive surface is located immediately after the micro lenses and light filters.  As a result, more photons hit the photosensitive diodes, even in low light conditions. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/NokiaProto_15_resize.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/ab_NokiaProto_35_resize.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sup>Pictures taken by Nokia Lumia 920</sup> <br><br>  To improve the quality of photos and videos taken on the Nokia Lumia 920 in low light conditions, we used an incredibly large f / 2.0 aperture.  To get this 16: 9 format, we focused on creating an optical design that is different from other cameras.  Therefore, we made our sensors at least 10% more than similar sensors with the same resolution.  The use of non-standard larger sensors instead of the popular serial ones allowed us to get real 16: 9 and 4: 3 aspect ratios, while remaining unique among all smartphones.  Only a few digital cameras use these sensors. <br><br>  However, the most significant improvement in the latest PureView camera is the OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) optical image stabilizer.  There are smartphones on the market that use digital stabilization algorithms, but they are all much inferior to optical stabilization systems. <br><br>  Optical stabilization systems use a gyroscope to determine the angle and direction of motion, moving the lens of the optical system in the opposite direction to compensate for unintended movements.  A similar principle applies to active noise cancellation technology. <br><br>  Adding optical stabilization to a smartphone is already quite a difficult task, however, we managed not only to integrate it into the Nokia Lumia 920, but also to bypass the effectiveness of the optical stabilization of many digital camera manufacturers by using lighter components that are easier (and faster) to move during stabilization.  Instead of shifting a single lens entering the optical system to compensate for camera shake, Nokia's optical stabilization system moves the entire optical unit, consisting of five Carl Zeiss aspherical lenses, perfectly synchronizing with the unintended shaking of the smartphone. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HSbhyaH0vw&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhittaxdq_EOCpZNomWTkmVagmg9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Many optical stabilization systems are able to cope with a certain frequency of movements.  Our laboratory tests have shown that the PureView optical stabilization system can handle approximately 500 movements per second, which is almost 50% more than conventional stabilization systems. <br><br>  However, in addition to the fast moving speed of the optical unit, the system must also have an incredible reaction to all unintended jitter.  To achieve an instantaneous response, we used a closed system that monitors the position of the optical unit in real time, even while this unit moves to the calculated position.  This process occurs five times faster than in existing optical stabilization systems, and 300 times longer than the human response time to an expected event. <br><br>  The Nokia Lumia 920 uses a new, powerful LED flash, which provides a comparable level of illumination with xenon, but at the same time working continuously.  Yes, you can use Nokia again as a flashlight. <br><br><h5>  Features of the PureView camera in the Nokia Lumia 920 </h5><br>  <b>Optics:</b> Carl Zeiss Optics <br>  <b>Optical Stabilizer:</b> Barrel shift type <br>  <b>Exposure winnings:</b> up to 3EV (8 times on long exposures) <br>  <b>Focal length:</b> 3.73 mm <br>  <b>Focal length in 35 mm equivalent:</b> 26 mm - 16: 9;  28 mm - 4: 3 <br>  <b>Aperture:</b> f / 2.0 <br>  <b>Focus range:</b> 8 cm - ‚àû <br>  <b>Construction:</b> 5 elements, 1 group.  All lenses are aspherical <br>  <b>Optical format:</b> 1/3 ‚Ä≥ <br>  <b>Sensor:</b> BSI (Backside illuminated) <br>  <b>Pixels:</b> 3553 x 2448 - 8.7 megapixels <br>  <b>Pixel size:</b> 1.4 microns <br>  <b>Video recording:</b> Full HD 1080p, 30 frames per second <br><br>  The camera of the younger model Nokia Lumia 820 cannot boast of having PureView technology, but it still allows you to take good pictures.  The device uses an 8-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics.  This camera allows you to take pictures with a resolution of 3264x2448 pixels and shoot video in FullHD, that is, at a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, with a frequency of 30 frames per second.  The flash in the Nokia Lumia 820 consists of two LEDs. <br><br>  Both devices also use Rich Recording technology, which makes it possible to capture very quiet and very loud sounds with almost no distortion as the human ear hears when recording video using special High Amplitude Audio Capture microphones (HAAC).  The Nokia Lumia 920 uses three HAAC microphones, whose recording quality does not suffer at a sound pressure level of 140 dB, and the Lumia 820 has two such microphones.  For comparison, conventional microphones already at a sound pressure level above 120 dB begin to create significant distortion. <br><br>  In addition to the ‚Äúiron‚Äù features of PureView, it is worth noting Nokia‚Äôs exclusive software features in Windows Phone 8 - these are ‚Äúlenses‚Äù built into the camera that allow you to apply various filters to your photos in real time.  So, you can arrange something like Instagram or make beautiful panoramic pictures using Microsoft Photosynth. <br><br><h4>  Communications </h4><br>  Immediately, we note that the communication capabilities of the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 are the same, so all the information below is applicable to both devices. <br><br>  This time, happiness is near: the devices support LTE in five bands, including those operating in Russia (LTE Yota Networks network, to which you can connect either via Yota or through MegaFon, works in a suitable range of 2.5-2, 7 GHz).  LTE speed in new devices is limited to 50 Mbps, but this is still 2.5 times greater than the speed at which Yota provides its services.  For users who do not want to spend extra on 4G, there is support for HSDPA category 24 protocol, with which you can achieve speeds of 42.2 Mbit / s. <br><br>  New devices are equipped with Wi-Fi modules (802.11a / b / g / n) with the ability to link Wi-Fi channels and a Bluetooth 3.0 module. <br><br>  To ensure navigation in the device, GPS and Glonass positioning systems are used.  Thanks to the use of A-GPS technology, the cold start of the navigator is limited to a couple of seconds - in this case, the initial positioning is carried out by cell IDs and Wi-Fi hotspots.  But even without the activation of the cellular network and when the Wi-Fi is turned off, the smartphone finds satellites in a few seconds. <br><br>  Communication can also include the NFC-module, which is a necessity for smartphones on Windows Phone 8.  But in our case, this is not a convention for the sake of certification of devices by Microsoft, but an important element that simplifies the use of a whole range of accessories - docks, headphones, headsets, wireless speakers - designed specifically for the new Nokia Lumia smartphones.  However, we will talk about accessories in a separate post - there really is something to tell.  In addition, the NFC module is tightly integrated into Wallet, a special application in Windows Phone 8 that allows you to make purchases using a smartphone. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Both devices work on dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processors with a clock frequency of 1500 MHz, graphics Adreno 225 and 1 GB of RAM.  The used MSM8960 processor model, made using 28-nanometer technology, is distinguished by low power consumption and high performance. <br><br>  The Nokia Lumia 920 uses a BP-4GW battery at 2000 mAh.  In theory, its capacity is enough for 17 hours of talk in 2G networks, 10 hours of talk in 3G networks, about 6 hours of video viewing and 67 hours of listening to music.  The maximum standby time is 400 hours.  The younger Nokia Lumia 820 is equipped with a less powerful BP-5T battery at 1650 mAh, so the battery can be written off by about 17%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ad/56c/20d/0ad56c20d5b337a9cda690633354666b.png"><br><br>  You can charge the devices using proprietary wireless charging according to the Qi standard.  This standard was developed by the consortium Wireless Power Consortium, consisting of 126 companies, so that in the future this charge can be used to charge other devices. <br><br>  Memory is more interesting. <br>  Despite the fact that Windows Phone 8 appeared to have full support for microSD memory cards, Nokia Lumia 920 had to abandon their support because of the monolithic polycarbonate case, whose characteristics could suffer with the appearance of an additional connector.  However, as practice shows, the built-in memory of 32 GB should be enough for the average buyer, especially since some of the information can be stored in the cloud.  In contrast, the Nokia Lumia 820 can use microSDs up to 32 GB in size, but the internal memory is 8 GB. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  In addition to a whole range of hardware innovations from Nokia, new smartphones, of course, carry fundamentally new sensations of use thanks to the Windows Phone 8 operating system: it‚Äôs worth remembering about the native support provided by Skype and, for example, the possibility of making contactless payments using the Wallet app. .  But while Microsoft does not allow us to talk about all the features of the new operating system, we will list our own exclusives available on this OS. <br><br><h5>  "Lenses" for the camera </h5><br>  As we have said, in the interface of the cameras Nokia Lumia 920/820, you can choose the "lens" - the application, whose work is closely tied to the photo.  In addition to several ‚Äúlenses‚Äù from Microsoft - Blink application, which allows you to take photos without blinking people and Photosynth applications to create full panoramas from a series of shots - in the new Nokia Lumia there will be exclusive Best Shoot lenses for removing randomly caught objects from the frame and Cinemagraph, with which you can make animated gifs with the ability to animate any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe frame. <br><br><h5>  Nokia Navigation </h5><br>  Offline support for Nokia Maps will appear on Windows Phone 8, and the developers will be able to use third-party applications.  This means that if you downloaded the maps of the region you need in advance and you suddenly did not have a connection to the Network, any application that uses maps in its work through the WP8 API will be able to display them.  In addition, it will simply allow once again to save Internet traffic. <br><br>  Now, voice-guided navigation for Nokia motorists Navigator can be accessed directly from Nokia Maps.  Moreover, there will be voice-guided walk-through navigation for pedestrians.  Moreover, pedestrian navigation will use hiking trails, subways, stairs, etc.  - competitors to build routes for pedestrians still use only roads, ignoring only the side of the traffic. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nokia-Maps-augmented-reality-view-1024x723.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Maps Nokia will appear and augmented reality with maps of institutions - on WP8-smartphones Nokia Lumia navigation will appear inside the premises, so now you can easily find the place you need inside the shopping center, stadium, airport, and even more so for nothing. <br><br>  With the help of augmented reality, it will be possible not only to find out what is around you, but also to look at the paved route through the smartphone‚Äôs camera, clearly realizing where to turn next. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nokia-Maps-venue-maps-723x1024.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the new Nokia Lumia smartphones, an updated Nokia Transport application will appear, paving the way using public land and underground transport.  Already familiar to the current owners of Nokia Lumia, the application in Windows Phone 8 will support the search history and unnoticed by the user to receive the latest updates ‚Äúover the air‚Äù.  And thanks to the close integration of the maps with the system, this application will be used in Nokia Maps when creating a walking route. <br><br>  Of course, you should not discount the huge number of third-party applications for Windows Phone.  Within a week, Microsoft will officially introduce the Windows Phone 8 SDK, and because of the support for native code and an expanded number of APIs, the number of these applications will grow significantly. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/lumia920/specifications/%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-lumia920sp-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtcb6fe1">Specifications Nokia Lumia 920</a> . <br>  <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/products/phone/lumia820/specifications/%3Fcid%3Dncomprod-fw-scl-na-habrlink_0x0-lumia820sp-othsocmedia-ru-ru-1todtmtfd1617">Specifications Nokia Lumia 820</a> . <br><br><h4>  Pre-order new Nokia Lumia </h4> <a href="http://www.n-store.ru/device/item/nokia_lumia_920/A00008727/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f82/166/9b2/f821669b2355e2d6210c4449e39d9e6a.png" align="left"></a> <a href="http://www.n-store.ru/device/item/nokia_820/A00008771/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/379/cd0/b3b/379cd0b3bad7f3260d58aea538aed92e.png" align="right"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151274/</a></p>
