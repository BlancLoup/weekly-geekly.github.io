You enter the supermarket, take the basket and start walking in rows.  In the supermarket a huge amount of goods, but you are looking for exactly those that you need for a dish.  After spending half an hour in the store, you find all the necessary products, put them in the basket and go to the cashier. <br><br>  Going to the checkout, you leave a basket full of goods and leave the store. <br><br><blockquote>  Not real, right? </blockquote>

      Indeed, in real stores no one does this, if you have already spent time, chose goods and put them in a basket, you will buy them.  It turns out that each basket filled with goods is a guaranteed purchase. <br><br><blockquote>  Why does this principle not work when shopping online?  What makes customers leave at the last moment? </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Firstly,</b> this is the lack of opportunity to touch, see, measure the goods.  The only thing that the client sees is a photo of the product and its characteristics, and based on this, using its imagination, it forms a certain image. <br><br>  The task of online sellers to make this image as attractive and desirable for the client.  To do this, use as many quality photos of the product as possible, show it from different sides, show how to use it, add a video review. <br><br>  An excellent solution is the 3D photos of the product, when it can be rotated and viewed from different angles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cab/945/2c7/cab9452c7fbcb55e80b48e88a43f4447.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The more information the customer receives about the product, the greater the likelihood that he will buy it. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , it is the doubts and fear of being deceived.  Since the purchase process takes place in a virtual store, the customer is never 100% sure that paying him money will not deceive him. <br><br>  He may not be sent a quality product or the one he chose, or not sent at all.  All these fears lead customers to buy more expensively in a real store, instead of buying online. <br><br>  In order to dispel doubts, it is necessary to make your store as real as possible in the eyes of customers. <br><br>  <b>Add your history</b> , certificates and awards (if any), photos of the office, shop, pickup point and your address on the map.  Create a section ‚ÄúOur team‚Äù, add photos of your employees there and tell us who does what. <br><br><h5>  A great example of a Bag &amp; Wallet store of bags and wallets: </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/506/d21/e0d/506d21e0d14f918053378c4a43af5879.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Add information that you guarantee the quality of the goods sold</b> and are always <b>ready to return the money</b> if the goods prove to be with the marriage. <br><br>  For example, customers of Zappos store do not hesitate to make purchases, because they know that if they are not 100% satisfied with the product, you can return it and get all the money back. <br><br><blockquote>  The free fitting option also works great. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>For example</b> , the Western optics store Warby Parker offers to send samples of eyeglass frames for a fitting, so that the client can find the right one for himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/50e/4fb/218/50e4fb218b720c78d9744941236a5329.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Agree, it is impossible to choose glasses without fitting, so this option is simply necessary. <br><br>  Plus, holding the item you like in your hands, the probability of a purchase is several times higher than when customers just look at it in the picture. <br><br><h5>  Thirdly </h5>  This is the cost and delivery time. <br>  The purchase process itself is based on the momentary desire to get your favorite thing.  Remember, if you give yourself time to think about tomorrow, then it is likely that tomorrow this product will no longer be so desirable for you. <br><br>  It is for this reason that the delivery time plays a huge role when making a purchase decision.  No one wants to wait, especially when the delivery time is 14 days or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2ec/358/8e0/2ec3588e0f6503c8be9952969a059bfe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  The second factor is cost. </h4><br>  Very often the cost of delivery is so high that it completely discourages even the strongest desire to buy. <br><br>  According to statistics from Forrester Research, 44% of customers drop the cart due to high shipping costs. <br><br>  A common mistake of online stores, specify the cost of delivery at the last step of ordering or do not specify at all.  This is not the best way to encourage customers to buy. <br><br>  <i>Even if for any reason the cost of delivery of your goods is too high, it must be indicated, while at the same time you can reduce customer costs by presenting a discount coupon.</i> <br><br>  The psychology of successful sales in the field of retail is based on the fact that there are no products that cannot be sold, that is, it does not matter what properties a particular product has, it is important who sells it to us. <br><br>  In fact, we buy not on the characteristics and properties of the goods, but on how they are presented to us and the main thing is who.  That is why when we are offered two identical goods, we will buy from the one who sells us with a smile. <br><br><blockquote>  There is no human factor in online sales, so you need to look for another way to make the order form ideal in the eyes of the customer.  A satisfied customer is a guarantee of purchase. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  What is the ideal form of placing an order in the eyes of customers? </h4><br><br>  ComScore specialists checked out a survey of 1,000 online store customers to find out what they would like to see on the order form. <br><br>  Respondents were asked to list the items that they thought were necessary in order to place an order as convenient as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/79b/162/3e3/79b1623e30415b307c4826128bc817d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not necessary to immediately run to add all these elements to your site on the order form, while still taking this statistics into service. <br><br>  All these elements make your purchases more convenient and simple, so if you have the opportunity to add at least one of them - ACT! <br><br><h4>  What to do if the client still left, despite all your efforts? </h4><br><br>  At the moment there are many tools for returning customers. <br><br><blockquote>  The most popular are contact centers, remarketing and email-mailing to abandoned baskets. </blockquote><br><br>  We‚Äôll dwell on the latter, as this is probably the easiest and most budgetary way to get customers back for a purchase. <br><br>  There is no need to write these letters manually and spend a lot of time on it, there are services that will do everything for you. <br><br>  You just need to make a letter template, set a sending script and turn on the newsletter. Once the client has left the site, without placing an order, an email will automatically be sent to them with an offer to return and make a purchase. <br><br>  In the letter, the goods that the customer left in the basket, their photo, description, cost and quantity are automatically pulled up.  Also, the button ‚ÄúReturn to purchases‚Äù was added to the letter, which returns the client to the stage of ordering. <br><br>  Caring sellers add a gift, discount or bonus to such letters that motivates the customer to make a purchase decision. <br><br>  <i>An example of a letter on the abandoned basket of the StartShop store, sent using the TriggMine service:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f7b/499/bdd/f7b499bddda1719cbc877e443753a372.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The process of setting up such letters usually takes no more than 20 minutes,</i> after which it is sufficient to simply activate the sending of letters. <br><br>  The introduction of such services is a step to automate business processes, which all online sellers are striving for. <br><br>  The involvement of the store managers is minimal, they will only need to check the mail, in case the client needs help and will write to you in response to the letter. <br><br>  As a result, the safer and more convenient your store will appear to the customer, the more likely it will be to make a purchase and turn from a random visitor into a regular customer. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>If he is still gone, contact him before he buys from your competitors!</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <i>Successes.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294646/</a></p>
