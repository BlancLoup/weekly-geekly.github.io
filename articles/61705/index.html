The work is not ready, organizational issues are not fully resolved, there is absolutely no time, projects are very promising, and clients are just damn valuable - it is impossible to refuse any of them. <br><br>  Against this disgrace, I found a way to increase the productivity of work and to postpone all deadlines for a period of two times the remaining time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Calculations </h5><br>  Let's try to imagine a spherical freelancer with a vacuum in a place where willpower should be.

    <h6>  amount </h6><br>  I watched myself for a long time, read articles and comments on self-motivation and organization of working space and time, and I extracted for myself two important constants: <br>  1. most people work effectively about four hours out of eight; <br>  2. A normal healthy adult's sleep is eight hours. <br><br>  It turns out that a person spends 8 hours a day for work, of which he produces 4 hours, and 4 dunce, 8 hours for sleep and another 8 for all sorts of human needs - to eat, brush teeth, go to the store.  But when deadlines are tight, you can donate part of your free time to complete the work, and usually this time is taken from sleep.  For example, if you reduce your sleep time by 4 hours, you can work 12 instead of 8 hours a day. But the more time a person has to work, the more he tries to grow the time he loses (4 grows to 5-6).  There is still not enough time, and time is being shortened to resolve life issues.  This is reflected in the state as a whole, fatigue and ultimately leads to an inevitable decline in performance. <br><br><h6>  Quality </h6><br>  When a person has several projects at the same time that require his full participation, he constantly jumps from one task to another in a subconscious search for a solution to problems.  Even if he is busy solving one problem, the brain slowly solves some of the others.  Sometimes, when you need to concentrate extremely, it is very distracting. <br><br>  Moreover, if this is freelance, it is necessary to solve organizational issues related to the coordination, signing of contracts, TK, banks, and other nonsense.  And it is mainly done during the daytime, because office workers rarely sit at work at night - they prefer to sleep.  But freelancers do the opposite - at night, quietly, calmly, you can concentrate and produce much more results than during the day when cars are buzzing, children in the yard shout (someone else is at home), etc., and some also have channels connections are much stronger. <br><br>  Here there is a dilemma - either to work during the day, but in a less comfortable environment, or at night, but to receive calls from customers and quickly respond to mail in the intervals between sleep and sleep.  It is not productive. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  1. It is convenient to work with clients during the day. <br>  2. It is convenient to work alone at night. <br>  3. You need to sleep 8 hours a day <br>  4. You need to have time to resolve personal issues. <br>  5. Deadlines are tight <br><br>  The problem is solved very simply: a day is divided into two equal parts - day and night.  Each part consists of 4 hours of sleep, 4 work, 2 hours of personal time after sleep before work and 2 after work before bedtime. <br><br>  Having 4 hours to work, it is very difficult to allow yourself to spend two hours on a game of chess or reading comments on a Habr√©.  Because the solution of problems in the current day is only two hours (and not six).  And if the work is not done qualitatively, then the day has passed to empty.  A shorter time frame for each of the parts of life mobilizes the part of the brain responsible for responsibility.  In this case, you do not go beyond the normal life. <br><br>  By adding another beautiful condition, you can make our short days very clear: create a schedule based not on integer values ‚Äã‚Äãof time, but on values ‚Äã‚Äãof the type float. <br><br>  Schedule sleep and work can be distributed in such a way as to cover night time for work on tasks that require increased concentration, and day time, which requires communications. <br><br>  At the output we get the purest productivity. <br><br><h5>  Example </h5><br>  11:18 - rise, rest 1.5 hours <br>  12:48 - day work 4 hours <br>  16:48 - end of the working day, rest 2.5 hours <br>  19:18 - evening sleep 4 hours <br>  23:18 - rise, evening rest 3 hours <br>  02:18 - night work 4 hours <br>  06:18 - morning rest (jogging) 1 hour <br>  07:18 - morning sleep 4 hours <br><br>  Rest within the limits of one working afternoon can be divided in any proportions, it is more comfortable for me in the evening to take a little longer before work, and in the morning, on the contrary, to sit down at the computer faster, until it is ruined. <br><br><h5>  Result </h5><br>  I cannot write anything here yet, because only now I decided on this measure.  I will be able to live this way in a week‚Äôs time, and even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, I‚Äôll definitely write about the results achieved. <br><br>  But, knowing the dunce inside my body, I will hope that I have selected the right methods for its destruction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61705/</a></p>
