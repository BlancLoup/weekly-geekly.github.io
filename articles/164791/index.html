I have long wanted to talk about my experience, but somehow I just could not get together, and a recent article on the topic of immigration to Slovakia pushed me to write my own opus. <br><br>  So, I'll start the story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My move to Slovakia occurred in two stages, the first one, in general, was unsuccessful, but the experience came in handy later. <br><br><h4>  Attempt number one: study </h4><br>  It all started in 2009 when I wanted to go to study somewhere abroad.  Considering that I have relatives in England, the options in Devon were considered, but as it turned out, the presence of relatives does not simplify the process exactly for how much, and the prices for education are considerable for local ones‚Ä¶ I was poorly informed about scholarships, therefore everything stalled.

      It took a little more than six months, and I became interested in the question again.  I was especially interested because  In the summer of 2009, I graduated from the institute and entered the magistracy, staying working in the department there (in Belarus there is still a forced distribution, because work in the department was the easiest and most pleasant way to do this distribution).  The first months of the magistracy terribly disappointed me in our science, because  my quite viable ideas for the master's thesis were rejected with the comment "we will not be paid a penny for it." <br><br>  I came across a note about the <a href="http://visegradfund.org/scholarships/">Visegrad scholarship program</a> .  From the countries about education in which there was a speech, for some reason I was most interested in Slovakia.  Why dont know.  Maybe because of the language (Hungarian is too complicated, Polish is simple, but I just don‚Äôt want to), maybe because I went to visit my friends in Pie≈°≈•any in spring 2009.  One way or another, but on the same day I found a <a href="http://uniza.sk/">university in ilina</a> ( <a href="http://osm.org/go/0LN3bblR">here</a> ), there I found a department where I was just doing what I was interested in and wrote them a letter with my own ideas about the work ahead, and in a day or two received an answer in the spirit of "Cool, come on!".  After a couple of telephone conversations and exchange of emails on the second or third day, I received an invitation letter, which was necessary for submitting documents for a scholarship.  In addition, I had to go to the international relations department of my university in Minsk and make there a certified translation of the diploma and an extract from it (as I later learned, they don‚Äôt make it there, but made an exception for me - not many people get involved in similar events). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e60/9a5/cad/e609a5cad166ec7edd7c195f3817a235.jpg"><br>  <i>≈Ωilinsk√° univerzita - University of Zilina</i> <br><br>  After preparing the remaining necessary documents and filling out the application, it was necessary to send all these documents.  And here a problem arose: there was just over a week before the application deadline.  None of the postal services agreed to such conditions.  To my luck, I found an acquaintance who just that day went to Slovakia, to Trnava, to study.  It was decided to do the following: having arrived in Trnava, she sends my documents to Zilina, an employee of the university receives them, reports to them the ‚ÄúPozyvaci List‚Äù and sends everything together to Bratislava.  Unfortunately, the plan ‚Äúfloated a little‚Äù: the documents came to Zilina on Friday after lunch, therefore they could only be picked up on Monday, and the last day of departure was Sunday ... <br><br>  In general, when in a couple of months I received an email, starting with the words ‚ÄúWe are sorry, but unfortunately ...‚Äù, I had no doubt why this happened.  The first attempt failed. <br><br><h4>  Attempt number two: work </h4><br>  One and a half years later, the distribution was over, I left the university, because  the conditions on which I was offered to stay would be incompatible with a sudden possible move to another country, which I considered as inevitable in the first year of ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù.  In the last months of work at the university, I received a job offer from a good Minsk company, which I myself was about to go to for a long time, and began the process of finding employment for them, without ceasing to look for foreign options.  Unfortunately, there were not very many options, due to the fact that the majority of potential employers wanted either local or already having a work permit, but they didn‚Äôt really want to get involved with people like me. <br><br>  Somehow it so happened that the firm in which I was still working alongside the work at the department was trying to start a joint business with a small firm just from Slovakia.  Business, in general, did not go, although a couple of times we went to them to show the prototypes of the devices that they would like to have (by the way, to this day those prototypes lie somewhere on their shelves).  Details do not play a special role, but the point is that during one of these trips another company was found in a nearby town, which urgently needed an embedded programmer to program some ARM-based system.  After a telephone conversation and a personal meeting, I was immediately taken to work - it remained ‚Äúonly‚Äù to collect the necessary documents, which was started right there in Slovakia. <br><br>  By the way, the company is located in fact in the village ( <a href="http://osm.org/go/0LasC8j5o-">Ni≈æn√°</a> , population - 4K people) in the territory of the former factory, which was once part of the industrial giant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_(company)">TESLA</a> .  By the way, not only almost the entire population of the village and the surrounding towns once worked at this factory, but people went there to work every day from afar, because the schedule of local trains - ‚Äúspecial moisture‚Äù - was much more dense than they are now, all were packed to capacity.  Unfortunately, those days are long gone, the plant has long fallen into decay and was sold in parts to local residents.  In the neighboring town of <a href="http://osm.org/go/0LavDFXB--">Trsten√°, a</a> once-large factory of wheeled tractors ceased to exist at all, and now it only works for a waste management company, whose workers dismantle it day after day and clean the nearby territory. <br><br>  The actual collection of documents did not take a lot of time, including due to the fact that in this region - on Orava - the population is quite ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù, people often work in another settlement than they live, people from different cities get married and villages, and therefore people know each other well.  Thanks to this, for example, it was possible to obtain a work permit without painful waiting for about two weeks.  I had to go to Belarus, get an extract from the police about my absence of convictions (funny, but ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù call this document a ‚Äúcertificate of criminal record‚Äù, and the police call it exclusively ‚Äúa certificate of criminal record‚Äù).  It should be mentioned that when submitting documents to the police for foreigners ( <i>cudzineck√° pol√≠cia</i> ) documents must be no older than 90 days, otherwise the police will not accept them.  Another point: at the time of filing the documents, the law was not allowed to submit them directly to the police if I was already there, it was necessary to submit them to the Slovak embassy at the place of permanent residence.  It seems that today this requirement is removed. <br><br>  The documents were filed, a written interview was conducted at the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãduring which basic questions were asked about Slovakia, as well as about my employment and what I would do if I suddenly lose my job for reasons beyond my control.  It remains to wait.  And here, as they say in Belarus, ‚Äúit was not without Moscow‚Äôs hand‚Äù.  The fact is that the documents are sent to Zilina, where the regional police are located, by diplomatic mail, in which the routing is quite intricate.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just take it‚Äù and send documents directly from Minsk to Zilina.  First they go to Moscow (why ?!), then to Bratislava to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and only then they are sent to Zilina.  As it is easy to guess, the documents in Moscow were received ... and lost somewhere.  Where - nobody knows to this day.  The embassy waited a month and a half from the moment of sending the documents, after which it sent copies directly by courier.  Documents received, a couple of weeks later I received the answer: A residence permit was issued.  At that time I still had a short-term visa - I regularly went to future employers, because I was not given a free national visa, although this is a normal part of the process.  Upon my arrival in Zilina, I wrote an application for issuing a residence permit card ( <i>preukaz o prechodnom pobyte</i> ), handed over fingerprints, and also, which turned out to be a bit unexpected for me, I posed for the camera.  Because of this surprise, I am a little unshaven on my first card :) <br><br>  From the company I was allocated a room in an apartment in the aforementioned Trstena, which was generally not bad, because  in the same town, our company opened a new building, where they moved the group working on our project.  In the same apartment lived colleague engineer who worked on the mechanical part of our project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/829/c8b/2c7/829c8b2c70e646c6c65d8fbe401f01aa.jpg"><br>  <i>Trsten√°, MR ≈†tef√°nika square, view of the Rogac hotel</i> <br><br><h4>  Life is here </h4><br>  I must say, from the first official salary, the first thing I bought was a bicycle (in Slovak it is bicykel, in Arabic dialect it is bicyke).  It cost me ‚Ç¨ 370, for which I received a wonderful bicycle from practically the local brand Kellys Scarpe (the headquarters and the assembly shop of the company are located in the aforementioned Pestanyans). <br><br>  In general, Slovakia is a wonderful country for cycling.  This, of course, is not Holland or Denmark with their excellent bicycle infrastructure, but outside the settlements there really is where to go.  In principle, it is for this that my friend John Rosman is in love with Belarus, because unlike the USA and England, where everything is private and fenced - where there is wire, and where it is brick walls (hello to the British!), You can go anywhere in Belarus whatever  In Slovakia, despite the presence of private property, you can also go where, how and anywhere (almost), but in addition to this there are mountains, streams everywhere, squirrels, hares, foxes, deer and other animals in the forest, meetings with which can deliver a lot pleasant impressions - well, or scare to death if we are talking about some wild boar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/639/ed4/abf/639ed4abf35e2c903de2dfcd35774d08.jpeg"><br>  <i>Velky Mountain at <a href="http://osm.org/go/0LPf0UAj-">Dolny Kubin</a></i> <br><br>  The local population, in principle, is divided into three categories according to their attitude to bicycles.  The first category is people over 35, mostly women, who ride old bicycles from the time of the king of Peas to work, to shop, and wherever they go.  In principle, people who used to drive and are now afraid of being hit by heavy vehicles on narrow highways can be counted in this category.  The second category is young people, owners of new mountain or city bicycles, who either use bicycles everywhere and always (as I do in the winter too), or very often, and at the same time try to popularize this occupation whenever possible.  Third - motorists who do not recognize the bicycle as such, and drive a car everywhere and always, even if the distance is less than a kilometer.  In principle, categorization is approximately the same as in Belarus, except that the group (1) is much larger, as is the case with the group (2), although in Belarus this has recently been beginning to slowly change - not without <a href="http://bike.org.by/">our</a> help. <br><br>  With regard to the monetary side of life in Slovakia, the situation is as follows.  On average, living in Slovakia is a bit more expensive than living in Poland.  This is bad if the reader lives there and thinks about moving :) On the other hand, living here is cheaper than in Belarus, despite the fact that the quality of life is generally better.  Salaries - it is difficult for a programmer to get higher than ‚Ç¨ 1500 in Zilina.  On Orava - and even less.  On the other hand, even with such a low, it would seem, level of wages (compared to the programmers in all kinds of EPAMs received in Minsk), this money is more than enough for a normal life and frequent travels. <br><br>  Generally speaking, travel is a topic for a completely separate conversation.  I have never traveled so much before moving to Slovakia.  The thought itself to go somewhere outside of Minsk and the Minsk region for most of the inhabitants of this city, apparently, is seditious.  In Slovakia, this is absolutely not the case.  People constantly travel, and if not abroad - which is rather conditional here, then around the country.  And there is where to go.  Castles, mountains, lakes, rivers ... There is something to see (it would be with whom ...).  And if you consider that owning a residence permit in Slovakia allows you to drive all over Schengen, the possibilities are truly unlimited.  For example, in Vienna I was 6 times, of which 4 - in the last year.  In Prague - only 3, over the past six months - 2. A ticket with a return to this very Prague - ‚Ç¨ 40, or even cheaper if you go by RegioJet train.  Well, in Krakow, as in Warsaw, I was just countless times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/edc/4b1/e5b/edc4b1e5b96a4de0954f20f750056efa.jpg"><br>  <i>Vienna, Stephansplatz</i> <br><br>  I must say, the language for me was not a problem at all.  The first couple of months, while I was in Slovakia ‚Äúarrivals‚Äù on short-term visas, communication with future colleagues and supervisors took place in English.  Outside the company, as a rule, no one understood English, so I spoke ... in Belarusian.  So much more people understood me, although the problems were still there.  Basically, they consisted in the fact that in the Belarusian language ‚Äúacania‚Äù and ‚Äúyakan‚Äù are very strongly expressed, therefore, the familiar words for Slovaks <i>robota</i> and <i>robi≈•</i> sounded quite unusual and incomprehensible: <i>work</i> and <i>work</i> .  When I became aware of this moment, I simply began to speak with a very strong near-Slovak accent, altering the words in the Slovak manner - the level of understanding grew by 70% :) My colleague Jan, whose English was rather weak, gave me a strong impetus to learn Slovak we had to somehow find a common language.  In total, more or less tolerably, I could speak after two months of non-permanent stay here.  Now Slovak is at my level that the local people take me for a ‚Äúvyhodnyar‚Äù - a person from the eastern part of Slovakia (‚Äúeast‚Äù in Slovak - vychod).  Yes, I will say straight away: I did not go to any courses or read almost any books.  I have ‚ÄúBelarusian-Slavatsk razmo—ûn—ñk‚Äù and ‚ÄúKarotkaya Gramatka Slavatskay Mowy‚Äù, which I open once every three months when I go two hours in a very slow train and I have absolutely nothing to do :) By the way, here it is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/632/424/e5a/632424e5a0aab0e1c4eb2f0e084ac522.jpg"><br>  <i>Osobn√Ω vlak Kraƒæovan√Ω ‚Äî Trsten√°</i> <br><br>  Admittedly, I was a little disappointed with local medicine, which I had to face a little.  Bureaucracy, this feeling is more than in Belarus.  Although doctors seem to be there, unlike. <br><br><h4>  Moving </h4><br>  Unfortunately, my contract was signed only until the end of the year, because the project was ending, but the new was not foreseen, because at the end of the year I had to look for a new job and a new apartment.  I decided to move to Zilina, because  I had time to like her - I was there literally every two weeks, but I was already tired of Orava, because  Still, I am very unaccustomed to living in small towns.  After publishing a resume on profesia.sk, they called me literally five times a day.  As a result, I got into the company, to which I myself sent a resume.  And here problems began. <br><br>  As it turned out, my work permit, issued to me a year ago in N√°mestovo, is not only invalid (because it expires), and is not subject to automatic renewal, because  I change my employer, and my new one is in another city in the region.  Because of this, the device process is a little podzatyanulsya. <br><br>  The second problem was to find an apartment in Zilina.  Most of the apartments were either expensive or in poor condition.  For example, for ‚Ç¨ 176 (without paying for energy) a so-called  <i>garz√≥nka</i> , i.e.  A one-room apartment in which there is no separate kitchen, but a stove, a sink and a refrigerator are in a single room.  Fortunately, there were acquaintances whose two-room apartment stood idle, which they agreed to rent out to me for an even lower price. <br><br>  And finally, the last, yet unsolved problem is the Internet.  In the new apartment there is the possibility of connecting to as many as 6 or 7 different providers.  It would seem, go and connect.  Each of them offers a bunch of discounts and other bonuses.  There is, however, one thing that they are silent about right away.  It is called <i>viazanos≈•</i> , that is, roughly speaking, the conclusion of a contract for a certain period with conditions that exclude its easy interruption.  In case of termination of the contract before the expiration of the term, a penalty of about ‚Ç¨ 200 is paid  The term, as a rule, is 2 years, but the option is possible for 1 year - in this case, the subscriber loses discounts and participation in promotions.  In principle, the option is possible without ‚Äúknitting‚Äù, but in this case, the total cost of connection is about the same ‚Ç¨ 200, and besides the tariffs are even higher.  Compared to this, the conditions of Beltelecom are just some kind of a fairy tale. <br><br>  The second part of the problem with the Internet is the need for a residence permit with a validity of not less than the term for which the contract is concluded, therefore the best solution to the problem in my case, apparently, will be the conclusion of the contract for the apartment owner. <br><br>  Despite some difficulties of this kind, I don‚Äôt plan to leave Slovakia in the next couple of years :) <br><br>  In general, this is probably all that I wanted to tell, at least, everything that was remembered now.  Ask questions, try to answer them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e4/c52/7fa/7e4c527fabb7de69181e6afc89355f6e.jpg"><br>  <i>Zilina, Mariana Square</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164791/</a></p>
