The sixth generation prosthesis can be easily dropped from one and a half meters, you can tune different grip on it and fix additional gifts - a remote control for a quadrocopter and a flashlight. <br><br>  Watch the video taken after installation.  And about what the prosthesis is capable of, how to get it and why it looks like this - read under the cut. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHQZ--EPbcM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpUilkyMSjxRUvJfTW0kwXJCl3gw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In January 2016, Maya from St. Petersburg turned to Motorika - she needed a prosthesis for her son, Fedor, who was 4 years old in February.  Fedya had worn a cosmetic prosthesis before, but only for one day.  A few years ago, Maya saw a video of <a href="https://youtu.be/ApUodVFdjss">Richard Van As</a> , who made a functional prosthesis for her son using a 3D printer, and wanted this for her son - in Russia at that time it was difficult.  But in the end, on the Internet, Maya found Motorika and turned to experts from this startup.

      Fedor has a congenital underdevelopment of the hand, preserving the mobility of the wrist joint.  The prosthesis "Motoriki" is designed specifically for such cases.  And Fedya got the newest at the moment, the sixth version of the prosthesis. <br><br>  The founder of the startup, Ilya Chekh, <a href="http://motorica.org/kibi_piter/">writes</a> that new design solutions have increased the grip strength.  The size for children 3-4 years old is commensurate with the size of a real hand and fingers at that age.  You can drop the device from a height of one and a half meters, without fear of breaking.  The tension mechanism allows you to adjust the tension of each finger.  But to change the type of grip, it is necessary to reconfigure the prosthesis. <br><br>  Silicone pads on each finger provide tenacity to objects.  In the video below - the possibility of a new prosthesis.  And how ‚ÄúMotorika‚Äù makes such prostheses, read in my <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271580/">previous article on this topic</a> . <br><br>  As a gift, Fedya received a quadrocopter control panel, soap bubbles and a flashlight, which can be installed on the prosthesis. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/inWZrT8BEhU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCUkwkUjDI61i1ZcQiSAu2WlMmxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the near future, 4 more children will receive updated versions of prostheses.  Pink in this photo will get the girl Masha, about whom <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271580/">I wrote</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44a/955/c63/44a955c634769e6cdfaabb16865e8034.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How to get a prosthesis </h4><br>  After the parent's request, it is necessary to clarify the presence of the Individual Rehabilitation Program and write about the need for prosthetics with an active prosthesis.  If the IPR is issued and there is such a record, the time for manufacturing is reduced - because there is no need to undergo a medical and social examination and re-register the IPR.  Record is needed to get a prosthesis for <b>free</b> .  The prosthesis is certified and subject to the regulations and laws. <br><br>  During the year, ‚ÄúMotorika‚Äù changes dentures as the child grows.  Warranty for mechanical damage - six months. <br><br>  The company not only develops and manufactures a prosthesis, but also accompanies a person at all stages of prosthetics - from disability registration and IPR, to receiving compensation for an independently acquired prosthesis.  And it helps to resolve conflicts that arise with doctors and medical and social expertise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/314/f4f/c8f/314f4fc8fcd540d368d39e5b5e611f7b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Appearance selection </h4><br>  As part of the crowdfunding campaign, company representatives said that they want the prosthesis to not look like a human arm.  There is an interesting effect - ‚Äúominous valley‚Äù.  The Japanese scientist Masahiro Mori in 1978 investigated the emotional reaction of people to the appearance of robots.  The more a robot looked like a man, the prettier it seemed - but until a certain moment.  The most human-like robots turned out to be unpleasant for people because of minor inconsistencies that cause discomfort and fear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33c/f0e/a22/33cf0ea2252af681ded6055468388952.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The same is true in prosthetics - the more a prosthesis looks like a hand, but it does not carry any functionality, the greater the effect of rejection it causes.  But the girl Anya, when she came to school with a pink prosthesis with a built-in player, immediately attracted attention.  She was asked what the device is and how it works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee1/68b/e02/ee168be02a101cf7ba20f98271df1ed7.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The theme for the design of the prosthesis for Fedor was the character from the cartoon Robokar Pauly - the transforming fireman Roy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcd/983/241/fcd98324192c9d58e7884505549fed4d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30d/bc1/f97/30dbc1f9735b2834eb97e0067ed89ccd.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How to take measurements remotely </h4><br>  In my previous article in the comments they discussed the possibility of taking measurements for prostheses remotely.  In the case of Fedya, it was done this way: he was sent a special instruction for self-removal of the required size. <br><br>  And the installation takes place either on the basis of a laboratory in Moscow, which recently moved to Skolkovo, or specialists come to the man and prosthetics on the basis of the local institute of traumatology and orthopedics.  Doctors became interested in the prosthesis - everyone got their smartphones and started taking photos and videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c35/b5d/2d1/c35b5d2d166cbc9eebeb6e10e379aee6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On average, the prosthesis is made about 20 days.  This artificial limb was installed on his birthday, February 26th.  A few minutes after fitting, the boy began to use it with might and main.  Now, Fedya needs to constantly train, use all the muscles of the hand and forearm, so that in the future he can better manage the myoelectric prosthesis that Motorika is developing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1FhSIxZmuY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiIlMBqV36GrVpaeTsWm4ayw_911Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a12/390/f82/a12390f821bfe64c77d274939dc62688.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/666/554/d14/666554d1464c58830c4e7971b9554de4.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  This video is a prototype of the prosthesis of the forearm Stradivary v3.1. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8yLldGuDSQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8QTc00HXmlbnXKcS1CyYix71WhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390933/</a></p>
