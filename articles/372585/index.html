  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of Sony Xperia X Performance. Premium without reservation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The entire line of Sony Xperia X got to the Russian stores.  New devices received a single design, but it is extremely difficult to confuse one with another, even when it comes to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/277796/">Xperia X</a> and X Performance.  The latter is slightly different in appearance, but the main differences are hidden inside the case.  As the name hints, the device is more powerful and productive - this is the real flagship of 2016.  We spent a month in the company with X Performance and are ready to share our impressions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f47/9e3/c59/f479e3c59f744c0abec0ccd5ecf41fbe.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Design </h2><br>  The smartphone skillfully masks its thickness of 8.6 mm.  This is a very good indicator, but in Xperia X Performance the transition from the side edges to the front and rear panels is rounded, which visually reduces the ‚Äúpomp‚Äù of the gadget.  Metal housing, as befits a flagship.  The back cover has a special treatment, as if slightly scratched, such an effect is only in devices with a graphite and white case.  But the options "golden lime" and "pink gold" are homogeneous, they have no grinding at the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/bc7/c00/3fcbc7c0026b425898e7c5348777d7bb.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/029/674/9b702967403f4e6981be34f48743c2d0.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing superfluous on the rear panel: the camera‚Äôs peephole is edged, the flash and the inscription XPERIA.  On the left there is only a slot for a nanoSIM SIM card and a microSD memory card.  The tray must be pulled out neatly: it is connected to the plug itself.  Note that when removing even an empty tray, the smartphone will automatically reboot.  On the right in the center there is a power button with a built-in fingerprint scanner, and in the lower area are the camera key and a double key for adjusting the volume.  At first it seems that changing the volume is inconvenient, but in practice it turned out that there are no difficulties, just out of habit, you always look for keys at the top of the phone.  Because of this, by the way, a couple of times I took the phone upside down.  But in one and a half or two days you get used to it.  But the camera button is just perfect: when shooting in panoramic mode, holding the smartphone at the edges, the index finger of the right hand is right on the desired button, while not obscuring the display.  Below is a microUSB connector, on top - 3.5 mm for headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/9fe/db0/5139fedb03af43ffa92033881f54f248.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/268/738/dc9/268738dc936e4b6e81607910aeb1013e.jpg"><br><br>  A five-inch IPS screen holds Full HD resolution (1920x1080), the pixel density is 441 ppi, which is more than a good indicator.  The glass is slightly rounded at the edges, but there are small frames on the side.  The effect of framelessness, as in Xperia XA and Xperia XA Ultra is not, but the smartphone does not lose anything from this.  It lies perfectly in the hand, does not slide over polished surfaces and is comfortably felt in the front pocket of jeans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0d/e4c/3df/d0de4c3df9c748d9aac5bd3a3df25b39.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/04a/01d/3b504a01dbd145288185354d3db813de.jpg"><br><br>  The Xperia X Performance case is protected from dust and water in accordance with the IP68 standard.  And this means that the smartphone will not suffer at all when diving to a depth of one and a half meters for half an hour.  But even if we ignore the protection, we must admit that the device is perfectly assembled: it did not even creak when squeezed or attempted to twist the device.  There is no backlash of the keys, they do not rattle while shaking the gadget. <br><br><h2>  Iron </h2><br>  The heart of the smartphone is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core chip, using 64-bit architecture.  As much as three gigabytes of RAM - more is simply not necessary for a smartphone.  The built-in space of 32 GB, but at your disposal is approximately 2/3 of this amount: the operating system and related applications occupy about 12 gigabytes.  By the way, in the version of Xperia X Performance Dual 64 GB of memory is installed by default, but it costs only a thousand rubles more.  If the available space for data storage is not enough, you can put a memory card.  Plus, there are NFC, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS + GLONASS modules and other standard things for devices of this level. <br><br>  It all works as expected very quickly.  Open under two dozen sites in Chrome - elementary, no slowdowns.  Running any hard game is easy too.  Applications such as World of Tanks Blitz, capable of straining almost any smartphone, at the maximum settings of the graphics go without a hint of lags, and this is really impressive.  Rather, it should be in the flagship devices, but few devices are actually able to easily digest such heavy games.  It's nice that Xperia X Performance is one of those. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf4/ad5/750/bf4ad5750d464536a606356a30246ca4.png"><br><br>  In synthetic tests, the device also proved itself more than worthy: almost 91 thousand points in AnTuTu, 1535 for one core and 4304 points in multi-core Geekbench 3 mode. Full test in GFXBench GL revealed good performance (see screenshot), tests Sling Shot and Ice Storm Unlimited in 3DMark reaffirmed the excellent performance of the device: 2078 points in the first case and 21820 in the second. <br><br>  With tests and heavy applications, the back cover heats up, but weaker than you expect.  At least, the iPhone 6 in the same tasks heats noticeably stronger.  It is probably not only a matter of heat release, but also in the properties of the metal from which the casing is made, as well as the thickness of the lid. <br><br><h2>  operating system </h2><br>  The device originally comes with Android version six, it is Marshmallow.  The system has long got rid of childhood diseases, such as unreasonable lags and slowing animations.  The interface is quite standard, and when you first start the smartphone, we thoroughly familiar with the functions of the device and offer to transfer all possible data from the previous device.  Sony has installed a number of its proprietary applications: PlayStation, What's New, Xperia Lounge and others.  With the presence of other devices of the Japanese company, you can create a good ecosystem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc8/825/133/fc8825133ffc4c7c9f0ccb4bd7c2c332.png"><br><br>  Perhaps the main thing that can be said about Android on Xperia X Performance - it is not at all annoying, it is not overloaded with proprietary utilities and does not put pressure on you with unnecessary decorations.  In addition, it turned out that the transition from iOS does not cause pain - it was checked on itself. <br><br><h2>  Autonomy </h2><br>  The device has a battery capacity of 2700 mAh.  This is enough for a day of very active use with heavy games, frequent surfing on the Internet, navigation and other voracious applications.  On one percent of the charge, the Xperia X Performance played YouTube videos for about fifteen minutes. <br><br>  If energy remains low, you can activate one of two energy-saving modes: STAMINA or Ultra STAMINA.  In the first case, GPS, vibration, some visual effects, background application updates are turned off, which will allow the device to last for a couple of hours more.  When this is not enough, the most benign mode remains: the Internet is completely turned off, only basic programs are available - contacts, messages, calendar, calculator, phone and a couple of others.  In the PC Mark test, Xperia X Performance showed almost seven hours of battery life, but the actual usage time will definitely be higher.  Charging takes about two and a half hours. <br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  The Xperia X Performance uses serious optics - 23 megapixels from the main camera and 13 megapixels from the front.  The camera is really very smart.  It opens in an instant and quickly focuses on objects, even moving objects.  It involves the technology of predicative focusing, which predicts the trajectory of motion, say, a car or an animal, therefore, it is possible to catch them dynamically without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ac/de1/66a/4acde166a2ab47e3a34e163b6c78e8fe.jpg"><br><br>  Images come out sharp and clear, but for maximum quality it is better to use the manual mode.  For shooting in automatic modes, there is only one small complaint: with the scorching sun, the whole sky is too bright, but if you play a little with the brightness settings, the problem will disappear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/3f4/8b5/4cd3f48b5e9d4348a4246eba8b48162f.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a5/235/ada/0a5235adadfe4edbb06fa8b9214c1fab.JPG"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  An excellent choice for users who choose a device not only in terms of characteristics, but also in quality.  Xperia X Performance looks solid and expensive, corresponding to the flagship status.  The shell is no less important than the insides, and Sony clearly understands this.  There is no cheap plastic and creaky case, which is sometimes found in very powerful smartphones - as if the engine from Ferrari was installed in Zhiguli.  On the contrary, Xperia X Performance - initially a premium gadget that is clearly visible.  Sony's flagship is definitely a success. <br><br>  <b>Main technical characteristics of Sony Xperia X Performance</b> : <br>  <b>Display</b> size: 5 inches <br>  <b>Display resolution</b> : Full HD (1920x1080 pixels, density ~ 441 ppi) <br>  <b>Chipset</b> : Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (2 cores at 2.15 GHz + 2 cores at 1.6 GHz) <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 32/64 GB non-volatile, slot for microSD memory cards up to 256 GB <br>  <b>Main camera</b> : 23 megapixel, LED flash, video recording in Full HD resolution <br>  <b>Front camera</b> : 13 megapixel with wide-angle and high-aperture optics (22 mm, F2.0) <br>  <b>Battery</b> : Li-ion, 2700 mAh, non-removable <br>  SIM card format: nano-SIM <br>  <b>Optional</b> : fingerprint sensor, NFC, dust and moisture protection IP68 <br>  <b>Operating system</b> : Android 6.0 Marshmallow <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> : 143.7 x 70.5 x 8.6 mm;  165 g <br>  <b>The price in Russia</b> : 49 990 rubles / 50 990 (Dual SIM) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372585/</a></p>
