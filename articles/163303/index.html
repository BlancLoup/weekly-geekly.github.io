We issued similar reports last year for other countries, and this year we included Russia as well.  In addition to analytical information, the report contains basic recommendations for service providers regarding work on the SMB market and promotion of cloud services there. <br><br>  Under the cut - a few interesting (from our point of view) facts and links to the report itself, as well as a link to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163291/">survey</a> , where we ask your opinion about the reasons for not switching to cloud services.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Methodology in brief </h3><br><br>  We interviewed 400 Russian companies of various sizes, business areas and from different regions.  The companies surveyed were divided into three groups: micro-companies (from 1 to 9 employees, not including individual entrepreneurs), small (10-49) and medium (50-250).  All conclusions and recommendations in the report are made in view of this division. <br><br><h3>  Market volume </h3><br><br>  The total volume of the public cloud market in Russia in 2012 is 15.6 billion rubles, or $ 466 million. Here we include web hosting, cloud communications and collaboration, business applications and IaaS.  Separately, we note that we stand for ‚Äúelastic‚Äù services, when the user does not pay for a fixed tariff plan with a fixed configuration of virtual capacity and software, but for actual consumption of cloud services, as implemented, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infobox/blog/159801/">in Infobox</a> .  <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F:%25D0%2598%25D0%25A2-%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">According to the Ministry of Communications</a> and <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F:%25D0%2598%25D0%25A2-%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Mass Media</a> , in 2011 Russia spent $ 32 billion on IT. Against the background, $ 466 million in 2012 is still a modest figure. <br><br><h3>  Market structure </h3><br><br>  Some information for consideration is given by the histogram of the market structure.  Infrastructure as a service turned out to be the most popular service on a global scale, taking 41%, and the more developed the cloud market in the region, the higher the average IaaS share in the total pie, and vice versa, in emerging markets the IaaS share is lower, about 35%.  However, there is an exception to this - India. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e9/2d4/344/4e92d43448c1a018caf6e05d99eeddd9.png"><br><br>  There, IaaS occupies almost half of the entire market (47%) - this is a record, there is no higher place.  Apparently, this is due to the active use of Indian outsourcing in many IT areas, which requires Indian companies to rent a lot of virtual infrastructure. <br><br>  The second place in popularity is occupied by business applications.  Russia distinguished itself here - in our country it is 37%, as much as IaaS, and much more than in the world.  The secret is that we refer to the cloud business application services for the delivery of electronic reporting and electronic document management, and the market for these services in Russia has been developed very well. <br>  The fastest growing market segment is communication and collaboration services (annual growth rate of 59%), the most notable of which are paid corporate mail and virtual office PBXs.  In three years, this segment will reach 2.4 billion rubles. <br><br><h3>  IT staff in SMB </h3><br><br>  The situation with IT staff in SMB in mature and emerging markets is more or less the same (which is not surprising, to be honest).  We compared Russia and the United States for example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/986/7c9/f2e/9867c9f2ee34acb8ba760e86223497a0.png"><br><br>  Among the microbusiness, about half do not have their own IT people, of the rest, most of them have an IT person on staff, and a smaller part hires incoming administrators (they are consultants).  Small and medium-sized companies, on the contrary, prefer to have IT people on staff, and only a small number of companies hire consultants. <br><br><h3>  Infrastructure and servers </h3><br><br>  But the situation with the use of servers (I think, it can be extrapolated to information technology in general) in Russia and the United States differs dramatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ac/7fe/ca3/3ac7feca315f25a6797c3f7476cf529a.png"><br><br>  If in Russia 88% of micro-businesses, 65% of small and 47% of medium-sized companies do not have any servers at all - either internal or cloud-based - then in the USA these are 43%, 4% and 2% respectively.  The difference is colossal.  And in Russia from those who have servers, 5%, 15% and 22% in any use of cloud resources, and in the States it is 20%, 32% and 43%.  On the one hand, it is sad that we are so far behind, on the other hand, the market is huge, the field is not plowed. <br><br><h3>  Causes of counteracting the clouds </h3><br><br>  And perhaps the most interesting comparison is the reasons why companies do not transfer their servers to the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/67d/1fc/45e/67d1fc45ed78c61222b4aeb7c66df948.png"><br><br>  The top 3 reasons in Russia are doubts about data confidentiality - 59%, recommendations of IT specialists (IT specialists are afraid to go to the cloud! - 43%) and the presence of applications that for some reason can only be located ‚Äúin-house‚Äù "(We called it" territorial binding ") - 37%.  In the US, the top three are different: 59% - price, 33% - security and privacy, and, as in the Russian Federation, the territorial link is in third place with 27%.  IT professionals in the US do not recommend moving servers to the cloud three times less. <br><br>  The report itself can be downloaded from our <a href="http://www.parallels.com/smbreport">public</a> or <a href="https://parallelsnetwork.com/">partner</a> sites (registration is required), and we also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163291/">want to ask</a> the audience of Habra why you are not using cloud infrastructure and / or services in your company?  In the comments, suggest your answer options if the options from the list do not fit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163303/</a></p>
