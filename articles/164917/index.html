Why? <br><br>  Today we are 150. Exactly a year ago we were 72. Impossible?  Realistically.  In our project portfolio - the largest players in the global financial markets.  And it is natural. <br><br>  There are several conditions, fulfilling which, we gain confidence in our forces, in the potential of the team and that we will do everything: <br>  1. together and <br>  2. as it should.

      <b>1. Recruitment at all levels.</b> <br>  Every company needs highly qualified employees.  It would be nice if they didn‚Äôt have to train, train, learn at the cost of mistakes ... Is it good?  Is the ideal employee always ready to surrender to the work at 110 percent (100 percent of working time + a piece of the soul)?  Not always. <br>  We certainly take to the team of experienced developers, quality engineers and other professionals.  But we are also ready to open our doors to young talents, whose will power enables them to study at work and work several times more productively after just a few months of practical training and work.  This is our future that we don‚Äôt want to sacrifice :) <br><br>  <b>2. Vocational training and certification.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Sure, training is needed.  It expands our knowledge, develops skills, gives us new perspectives, and raises our self-esteem.  Therefore, we often conduct in our office training seminars and workshops on various technologies, tools or methods of development and testing.  Our senior and leading developers are happy to share their knowledge with colleagues. <br>  We also encourage the successful certification of our specialists in the field of their professional activities. <br>  In addition, working with Western customers, we must be sure that we are comfortable with them to communicate, as they are with us.  Therefore, in all offices of ETNA Software, corporate English language training is provided by the company. <br><br>  <b>3. Training in the subject area.</b> <br>  We work in a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãfinancial markets.  We are sure that our software is the most high-class, not only because it is developed by professionals in programming and project management, but also because all our employees are experts in the field of financial markets thanks to the internal trading training system. <br>  Inside ETNA Software, the Trading Academy is created, where everyone gains and enhances knowledge of the basic concepts and processes in the currency and stock markets of the world. <br>  We continuously monitor the level of knowledge of employees, and thanks to its improvement, our employees can not only develop a higher-quality product, but also manage their professional growth. <br><br>  <b>4. Mentoring.</b> <br>  Each new employee of ETNA Software can count not only on the comprehensive assistance of the HR department and its team.  We assign to each employee a mentor - a person who has excellent technology and is also well-versed in projects in which the newcomer will work.  The mentor will help not only to quickly adapt to the company, he will also be able to give the right direction for the development of knowledge and skills, advise training resources or experts who should be contacted for help and advice. <br><br>  <b>5. Timely evaluation and development.</b> <br>  All of our employees know how their professional development happens within ETNA Software thanks to our assessment and personal development system.  Every six months an employee undergoes a reassessment of his skills (both technical and personal) according to the 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegree method.  This assessment is carried out primarily to show what each employee has achieved over the past period, what level he occupies in the grade system, as well as what skills require improvement to increase the current level, as well as fulfillment of a new role in a team or the entire company. <br>  When identifying the need to improve certain indicators, we can always give specific recommendations on how and with what help this can be done. <br>  Another important goal of these meetings is to get feedback from employees.  We work with each incoming offer, and do not leave anyone‚Äôs ideas or questions forgotten. <br>  <b>6. Competitions.</b> <br>  There is nothing better than healthy competition, especially if participation in competitions is rewarded with dignity. <br>  Trading Weeks are held quarterly at ETNA Software - weeks where anyone can try himself as a trader using the knowledge acquired in our company.  The winner (like any successful trader in the market) is always awarded a good cash prize :) <br>  We also organize Hack Day every year - this is a developer competition, where any programmer or team can come up with and implement any project on a financial topic.  The best projects receive prizes and the opportunity to be realized to customers. <br><br>  <b>7. The climate in the team.</b> <br>  Everyone knows how important it is to go to work with a smile.  We try to do everything possible so that everyone finds an occupation and company for himself.  In addition to various holidays, we often gather for joint leisure activities - we play bowling, mafia, board games, we hold table tennis and darts competitions in the offices. <br>  We also love outdoor activities and often collect big fun companies for snowboarding, skiing, skating, paintball and airsoft games.  Cinema, beaches, country cottages, rollers, bicycles and scooters - and that's all about us :) <br>  And under the aromatic coffee and sweets, we are always ready to discuss relevant topics in our cozy kitchen. <br><br>  <b>8. Openness.</b> <br>  Our leaders are not bureaucrats hidden behind thick doors.  These are the same people, experienced and sociable, these are our colleagues.  Any employee can seek help from company executives and get a timely response or help in resolving any issues. <br><br>  Perhaps these 8 simple conditions are the best, but not the only thing that we can and are ready to do for our colleagues. <br>  This strategy of teamwork and helps us say - we will do it! <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, I would like to thank all our colleagues for their professionalism and dedication!  We know that you are reading us :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164917/</a></p>
