  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Secrets of successful blogging</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wrote an article for one of the contests, but in the end I didn‚Äôt have time and flew with the participation.  Therefore, I decided to publish it in my <a href="http://tods-blog.com.ua/blogging/successful-blogge/">personal blog</a> , and also to duplicate it here.  Do not disappear the same good!  I have been in the blogosphere for 11 months, during which I discovered a lot of interesting things and opportunities, being fascinated by the process in full.  Along with this, I also gained a small (and, I believe, invaluable) experience. <br><br>  In this post, I would like to highlight the main, in my opinion, points that should be paid attention to when maintaining your own blog.  For those who have been on the topic for a long time, the article may seem boring and banal, but for beginners and just starting to deal with blogs, there is something to read here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Communication</strong> <br>  Find out the ‚Äúworld‚Äù (blogosphere) around you, look at the popular authors in your topic, subscribe to their blogs, comment.  Interaction is a necessary thing.  But the main thing is to act without fanaticism!  You should not knock on ICQ all top bloggers asking yourself to promote and so on.  Let everything go on in its natural course and gradually, step by step, you will gain the same authority and respect. <br><br>  <strong>Self development.</strong> <br>  You never need to stop there.  Every day there are new discoveries, changes occur in a particular subject area.  A true professional should not only always be aware of these events, but also demonstrate good knowledge in his niche.  Then his opinion will be listened to, and new points will be credited to the "piggy bank of credibility".

      <strong>Discipline.</strong> <br>  You need to work out for yourself the rules that you follow, set goals and define the mechanisms for achieving them.  You also need to follow the regularity of posts, try to adhere to a clear publication schedule.  If you take a break (take a vacation), nothing terrible will happen, but you should not start blogging!  It's like playing sports ‚Äî you won't work out for a couple of days, and it will be even harder to get into a former rhythm. <br><br>  <strong>Perseverance</strong> <br>  In blogging, as in life, there are often ups and downs, some unexpected, not always pleasant moment.  You need to be able to ‚Äútake a punch‚Äù and continue to go towards your goal.  If you have something to say, you competently write, publish interesting and useful materials - be sure, everything will work out for you!  Only a few can ‚Äúwake up famous‚Äù in one beautiful morning; success by 90% depends on serious daily work. <br><br>  <strong>Relationship</strong> <br>  The blogosphere is first of all people!  Puzmerki, counters, graphs and indicators - a very relative concept, which, in principle, can be screwed.  One of the most important features of a blog, like any other social projects, is the audience.  Respond to comments, letters, help readers understand these or other issues.  In general, treat your blog visitors the way you want the authors of other projects to treat you. <br><br>  <strong>Time management</strong> <br>  The point in some way intersects with discipline, but rather refers to the organization of your working time as a whole.  Try to design the day so that each lesson is performed efficiently and in the shortest possible time.  For example, it is often possible for western bloggers to meet remarks that it is necessary to determine for themselves the maximum positive period of time to write new articles / posts and devote it to this particular task, be it morning or evening.  At the same time not to be distracted by extraneous "irritants".  Similarly, you can set the hours for parsing mail, reading RSS reader, communicating in ICQ or creating new projects.  This will significantly save time. <br><br>  <strong>Promotion.</strong> <br>  The blogosphere is very large, it is almost impossible to lighten up just like that, without exerting effort.  Every day there are hundreds and thousands of new resources, many of which never become known, readable, etc.  We must fight for a place in the sun!  To promote your blog, you can use various methods, perhaps it is even a topic for a separate post.  Among the simplest ones, commenting on other authors' blogs, mastering social networks that exist in your subject, guest posts, participating in contests, experiments, holding own actions, etc. can be distinguished. <br><br>  In principle, this topic can be developed infinitely, breaking up and highlighting smaller details, but I think that if you stick to the points listed above, you are guaranteed success. <br><br>  <strong>Believe in yourself and success in becoming a successful blogger!</strong> <br><br>  ps.  If you have something to add - write in the comments, we will be enlightened together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287528/</a></p>
