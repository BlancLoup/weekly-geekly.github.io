Unsurprisingly, her main guest, Steve Ballmer (who does not know, is the president of Microsoft), is an English speaker. <br><br>  What did Microsoft want from the crowd? <br><br>  1. Taste the Winduse Internet server (through a free familiarization of course) and hosting the studenthost.ru, which redirects to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/student/">www.microsoft.com/rus/student</a> with a b / w photo of a very famous botanist.  It is worth to go just for the sake of this photo  Recommend.

      2. Use php under IIS, use Windows PowerShell, in which all familiar Unix commands are embedded. <br><br>  3. To use SilverLight. <br><br>  4. Prepare the brain for the invasion of IE8. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - IE8 will be beautiful.  For example, the host is highlighted in the address bar, but, say, the long URL is shaded. <br>  - Web slices.  You can subscribe to frequently updated parts of a web page.  RSS is resting. <br>  - Selection of a fragment and viewing through a popup menu: address on the map, spelling, prices of goods, translation (such a module for FF, however, has long been there). <br>  - If the web page detects that the connection with the Internet disappears during form submission, the form is saved. <br><br>  That's all.  And, of course, it was packed into an excellently rehearsed and rehearsed show of developers, with frequent change of roles of speakers, with competent jokes, with video, with bugs, with burglary windows through a calculator, ‚Äúscrapping‚Äù of ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù by Tolstoy and arguments about French .  All this reminded me of a well-staged student comedy. <br><br>  However, skittler eclipsed the heavyweight business and the outstanding showman Ballmer.  His fiery speech for exactly 10 minutes (second to second, I noticed) can be conveyed by one quote: ‚ÄúMicrosoft makes a lot of useful software, and everyone knows that it has changed (changed?) The world in software.‚Äù  Although what he said was not important, i.e.  this is so well known.  The main thing - his inexhaustible incendiary, his never-ending battery. <br><br>  Then Anton Nosik interviewed Balmer.  Monotonously, as according to the scenario, first on a crumpled leaflet, then ‚Äúquestions from the Internet‚Äù.  Ballmer answered.  The mask of a permanent smile never left his face.  1 time in 2 minutes, obeying the voice of the image-maker in the earpiece, straightened his short pants and straightened his socks.  And so all 30 minutes, no more, no less.  And no questions from the audience. <br><br>  What was interesting about the interview?  Perhaps only this ... <br><br>  AN: 80% of software used in the Russian Federation is pirated.  Officially - this is 17%.  Real estimates suggest that the percentage is even higher than 80%.  What do you think, what is the real percentage, and what are your plans for this? <br>  SB: We believe that piracy in Russia reaches 25% of the total turnover.  We believe that there should be no piracy in the state and educational sector, big business, a little bit - in small business.  And in general, there should be as little piracy as possible in general (laughter in the hall). <br><br>  AN: People do not like that they have to pay for what schools get for free.  There are plenty of free software programs for schools and educational institutions.  Do you think this will help to remove the problem of piracy into the background? <br>  SB: We believe that the comprehensive measures that we take help to reduce this phenomenon, because people will not steal what they can get for free. <br>  AN: So, people will not steal what they can get for free?  But this leads to a decrease in your profits on some $ 50 billion there ... <br>  SB: We are conducting research on these issues, these measures will develop our clients to a new level, allow them to achieve more - and, accordingly, pay us more, covering these losses of 50 billion. <br><br>  AN: A question about OpenSource.  Is this reality or are you just trying to interest and attract attention to yourself in this way? <br>  SB: A lot of Microsoft products now have open code.  Sometimes people think that OpenSource products are free, but we say NO (Ballmer made an incredible stress on this word - note), this is not so.  There was a question about why we would not open all the products, and our answer was NO, because  This violates security, for example, government agencies that use products.  Naturally, we will not open the code of all our products, because it will affect security. <br><br>  AN: I know that many people use xp because they complain about whist.  What's wrong with whist?  What with xp distribution?  Perhaps stopping the release of xp will put them in a bad situation.  How long will you support xp? <br>  SB: We are continuing to sell whist at a discount and upgrade for less money.  This applies to the home edition, where people are not so knowledgeable in the computer device and among people who are not familiar with xp.  On the market a lot of cars are already sold with Vista, also a lot with xp.  Until the end of this year, we expect that people will understand and understand the advantages that Vista provides in terms of performance and ease of handling. <br><br>  AN: What do you think will be web 3.0? <br>  SB: Web 3.0 will solve two problems: 1. The user will modify the application to fit his needs.  2. The applications of the future should be integrated into the system, and communicate with each other, regardless of whether you are on the OS or os / 2. <br><br>  AN: How do you like your character in the film "Pirates of Silicon Valley"? <br>  Sat: I liked him (laughter in the hall, applause). <br><br>  AN: Microsoft product interfaces - will they be better in the future?  What will they look like? <br>  SB: They will expand your capabilities in a variety of ways.  For example, you can easily operate with such things as video, sound, etc. ... (blah blah about the friendly environment for inexperienced users, and the usual crap that has long been hanging on microsoft.com). <br><br>  AN: What is the most difficult task for Microsoft in the past 5 years, and what is most important for the implementation in the next 5 years? <br>  Sat: 20 years ago, this confusion began with security, speed and so on, and everything was important.  In the next 5 years we are going to do a search. <br><br>  AN: How is your working day organized? <br>  SB: Usually the day starts at 7:30 and ends at midnight.  I ride a bike, and around the office too.  I do not have an assistant, I cope with everything myself, and I also read soap. <br><br>  AN: And spam? <br>  SB: Yes, a lot of letters are written by computers, and I love to receive letters from real people, with real suggestions and wishes.  But even if I read almost everything, I cannot answer all the letters.  Some people write to me just ‚Äúwrite me!‚Äù (Laughter in the hall) <br><br>  PS When everyone dispersed, behind the scenes I heard: ‚ÄúYes, like a battery, there is a lot of energy, but ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd what did they tell me, from what I didn‚Äôt know before?‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26039/</a></p>
