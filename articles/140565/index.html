  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small orders have a life too.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is about the project payment.  Orders that are published on freelance exchanges.  Sometimes there is a choice (and sometimes there is no and there is only a trifle) - one project is larger or a few small ones.  What's better?  For a large number of freelancers, the answer to this question is obvious - a large project is better than two smaller ones.  The larger the project, the better.  Part of the medium and small-sized projects are generally ignored, or only beginners pay attention to them, or unqualified personnel.  At one time, I realized that this is not quite fair and there is a niche in which it can be better than with a large one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why do performers fear small projects?  There is an opinion that the time spent on discussion and evaluation simply does not pay off in the process of work - it will take a long time to discuss the project, but it costs a little.  As a result, it is not profitable, and such projects are better to avoid.  I disagree with that.  If you discuss a large project, discuss it in its entirety, for an accurate estimate of terms and prices, it will need proportionally more time.  It is larger, there are more nuances and more time is required. <br>  Another argument against - often small projects are improvements, refinement or search for problems.  Again, the time to master a foreign system frightens and repels.  Many do not take up the revision and never eschew them.  But this is a matter of personal preference. <br><br>  So why do I prefer small projects? <br><br>  The first important plus is <b>that you can earn more</b> .  This is a matter of psychology, apparently.  People perceive numbers differently.  The difference between 25 and 30 in percentage terms is the same as between 250 and 300 or 2500 and 3000. Only in the first case it is ‚Äúonly‚Äù $ 5, and in the latter - half a thousand.  A person will easily overpay $ 5, but it will take a long time to rest for 500. Therefore, on a small project of $ 50, it is easy enough to shift the price to 60 or 70. The customer will not protest and think for three days.  $ 10 is not big money.  And in the project for 500, to increase the amount by $ 100 you will have to put a lot of effort to justify such an increase in the budget.  On budgets of a completely lower range - $ 20-30, you can easily double the amount, and as the budget grows, it will be more and more difficult to move the customer along the budget.  This is not about heating customers, but about opportunities to feel more at ease and to offer new and interesting ideas, for which it is quite fair to ask for an increase.

      The second point - the <b>price of a mistake</b> on a small project is lower than on a large one.  If you make a mistake with the estimated deadlines, with the budget estimate, with the scope of work, on a small project you risk the same two / three hours of work and $ 50.  In the case of a large project - a month of life and mortgage payments :). <br><br>  The third plus is an <b>estimate of the amount of work</b> with less error.  Actually, I really can‚Äôt imagine how you can accurately estimate the amount of work on a project at $ 2000.  Take into account all the nuances, find out all the details, provide for problems.  I just need a megamosk, but I don‚Äôt have it.  About the price of the error in this assessment, I wrote above. <br><br>  Fourth plus - small projects easier to line up.  If you take the project for a week, and you are offered another one, then the second customer will need to wait a week.  Not everyone will do this.  And when you run a project, it‚Äôs not so easy to be distracted by the discussion of another project.  If you have a project for two days, then you can not notify the customer at all that he is in the queue, but simply call the deadline, taking into account the end of the current project.  Thus the flow of orders can be obtained denser. <br><br>  Naturally, I mean not those projects for which the price costs $ 50, but works there for 500. I‚Äôm talking about those in which there is work for 50. IMHO it‚Äôs in vain that they avoid such projects and believe that it‚Äôs better not to do anything at all this time than take a couple of such small projects. <br><br>  In my practice, there was an interesting case - the customer suggested that I make improvements on a static site.  There was only html and little php for a simple dynamic.  I agreed, I called a completely small price for such a volume of work, I did it and received payment.  I was satisfied, the customer was satisfied.  Two days later, the customer addressed me again and again offered to make edits.  I agreed again, again easily done the work.  After that, I asked if the customer would like to transfer the project to some kind of cms and do this work myself (here I am kind).  He called prices, described what was happening.  The customer refused.  Expensive, they say.  Don't need this.  It is noteworthy that after this, within a month he repeatedly approached me with a similar amount of edits and work, I ended up doing a lot more than I called for the transfer to cms! <br><br>  The relationship between 500 and 10 to 50 in a person is strong only when these numbers are next to the same sentence, and if 10 to 50 is within a week, then this will not be the same as 500 at once.  Just heaven and earth.  This feature, in my opinion, is widely used for all small goods.  They buy trinkets in China for $ 3 a bucket, and then sell them here at 50c.  And the point is not in the amount of the mark-up, there is simply no difference between 1 and 2 rubles for the buyer, but the difference is real. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140565/</a></p>
