  <section class="page js-page"><h1>29% of Russians believe that online services reliably protect their passwords</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From time to time, we are told how things are going out with inventing and using passwords for citizens of different countries, this time the details of the Russians‚Äôs wits have come to light.  As Kaspersky Lab found out for a couple with B2B International, there is still cause for concern, not all users are responsible for protecting sensitive information.  So, only 31% of respondents set different passwords for each account.  Although the proportion of users with a very disappointing approach turned out to be rather small - only 6% exploit the same password for all services without exception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61b/ce3/abc/61bce3abc5ba4cb39172ea98ce61c1b7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the other hand, the majority of respondents in one way or another are trying to increase the level of security.  26% alternate passwords for different accounts, 23% occasionally allow themselves to repeat the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù, and 14% take a certain part of the constant and only change individual letters and numbers.  A Kaspersky Lab representative‚Äôs comment is quite predictable: ‚ÄúUsing identical or very similar character sets to access various services is fraught with the fact that if at least one password falls into the hands of criminals, the user risks losing control over all of their accounts.‚Äù

The lack of a special desire for a variety of passwords is to some extent explained by the habit of Russian users to keep passwords in memory - this is what 69% of respondents do.  42% of respondents do not believe that in this question it is better to rely on their own memory.  And specialized software for storing (and often creating) passwords is actually used by only 6% of Russians. <br><br>  In the light of recent events, 29% of respondents look very naive that the sites themselves reliably protect their accounts from intruders.  Plus, almost half of Russian users, 39%, firmly believe in the absence of any interest among criminals to their passwords to access online services. <br><br>  The publication of the study appeared right during the mass ‚Äúplum‚Äù into the Password Network of the largest mail services.  As recently as September 5, Yandex started the ‚Äúbaton‚Äù with approximately 1.3 million addresses, followed by Mail.ru on September 8 from 4.4 million, and on September 10 it closed the series of Gmail incidents with 4.6 million. Investigations are underway, LC expert expressed the following opinion: ‚ÄúIf we talk about the reasons, we have three versions.  The first is that one group of hackers stole a database with passwords from another and puts them in public access in order to ‚Äúannoy‚Äù competitors.  The second is that intruders try to draw attention to themselves in this way, i.e.  banal boasting and thirst for popularity.  And the third option - these data could have been stolen from scammers by so-called ‚Äúwhite‚Äù hackers, i.e.  a group of experts in the field of IT security, pursuing noble goals - as a rule, improving the security of users or services. ‚Äù <br><br>  Mail.Ru Group Vice President Anna Artamonova doesn‚Äôt see a particular tragedy in what happened: ‚ÄúThe bases are almost empty, and there are few users who have used these passwords.  This means that they no longer had value for intruders.  Moreover, we knew about most of the compromised accounts for a long time, and sent them to the owners a request to change the password.  This means that such bases have been collected for several years. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236553/</a></p>
