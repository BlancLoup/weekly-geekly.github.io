Someone is trying to find new channels and ways of development, someone comes to integration with a partner not from a good life. <br><br>  The ideal affiliate program is one that develops and complements sales.  Building a business solely on a partnership is quite risky, since at the same time one of the companies can quickly become dependent on a partner and lose their goals and strategy.  This article is about partnerships on the White Label model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  White Label is a relatively new concept.  Will help to understand it 5 representatives of different businesses.  These are services that have already implemented the White Label program and offer their partners mutually beneficial cooperation.  Who and why can this be interesting?  We understand together with the tour operator, SMM-service, anti-virus system and other products.

    <h3>  White Label is about mutual benefit. </h3><br>  White Label is a multi-company collaboration model.  It implies the sale of services or products under the brand of the selling company and turns out to be the resources of another company.  Today, such an interaction scheme is most often used by organizations with large client bases and a reputable brand in the market.  In other cases, the model works less efficiently. <br><br>  In Russian terminology, the term ‚Äú <a href="https://economy_en_ru.academic.ru/67737/white_label">non-brand product</a> ‚Äù or service is sometimes found.  That is, the emphasis is again on the fact that the product is issued without a label and is offered to the retailer or distributor.  The most common thing in business is the concept of White Label. <br><br><h3>  Why does business come to an affiliate program? </h3><br>  Everyone has their own reasons.  In general, the prerequisites for using White Labeling are: <br><br><ul><li>  The company does not have a sufficient budget for marketing, and the product is worth it to be interesting to potential partners. </li><li>  The company has a budget for marketing and there is time for that.  But the sales potential has exhausted itself.  The partnership in this case is a new breath, which does not change the direction of work, but perfectly complements and develops the business. </li><li>  The company wants to enter a new market and beat the competition.  Partners open up new opportunities and reach new audiences. </li><li>  The company consists of developers and no one to do marketing and sales. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f2/23d/52d/7f223d52d77ef560447dc5b289b936cb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Project Manager <a href="https://www.spa-oteli.ru/sotrudnichestvo/online-partner/whitelabel/">SpaOteli</a> Tatiana Glinskaya: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe are a major foreign tour operator, so affiliate programs, and in particular White Label, are an integral part of promoting our product.  Today it is prestigious to have this kind of partnership in the arsenal, especially since it is particularly well suited for our field of activity (online tours).  We have a rich search form: an extensive detailed menu, where the client can compose a tour of different parameters (direction, medical indication, subject, food, duration, hotel location, sports, etc.).  All this very well enriches and increases the level of the resource that offers all this.  That is, such a White Label solution is prestigious to have on your site. <br><br>  We have many markets, so we offer White Label in many languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  This is convenient for partners and end users. <br><br>  Of course there are some downsides.  Many partners think that after the installation of White Label, things will go up immediately and come to "flow like water."  However, they do nothing to properly position the White Label and its resource.  White Label requires a certain "cut".  The site must match the level of the proposed product.  Must be constantly filled with content and be relevant.  We always follow the latest trends in the field of SPA and wellness, in the field of marketing and IT technologies.  The visitor should easily find the White Label.  The partner should also promote the solution he has established, make some promotions, interesting offers, connect social networks, talk about the product, do the newsletter.  This is a cooperation of the two parties. <br><br>  We work with a PR firm, an analytical company, use the strength of our own marketing department, plus for each individual country there are employees who, in more detail, close to the sales market, are promoted products, including White Label.  Without constant promotion, the result falls.  For us, plus in White Label is also in increasing the traffic of visitors.  People love it when everything is convenient and you don‚Äôt have to think out or ask a bunch of questions. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d6/e8b/911/7d6e8b911e5a4e85a3103ed7267b716e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  What are the benefits of White Label for partners? </h3><br>  Each White Label company offers its own conditions to partners.  But more often, White Label implies the following benefits: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Quick start</b> cooperation program.  A partner can provide a new type of service in a short time and, thus, quickly increase competitiveness in the market.  The time to develop and test a new product when using White Label is 2-5 times less than developing and testing your own solution. </li><li>  <b>Achieve new target audiences</b> .  The seller of the decision may receive additional income from the clients of the client and, thereby, enter new markets.  The buyer can extend the functionality of the product and attract users to whom these features are important. </li><li>  <b>The possibility of integration</b> .  Often, off-the-shelf services can be easily adapted and embedded into existing partner platforms.  For example, in billing or service delivery systems. </li><li>  <b>Ready infrastructure</b> .  A party acquiring a finished product does not need to ‚Äúinject‚Äù a budget into the initial stages of release and support, or pay for the work of additional specialists.  The cost of self-development, as a rule, exceeds the purchase price of a turnkey solution by 2-7 times, depending on the region. </li><li>  <b>Additional support</b> .  Very often, partners are invited to support qualified professionals from the manufacturer.  In the case of difficult situations, such an additional line will help to quickly provide an answer. </li><li>  <b>Reduced churn</b> .  Customer loyalty will increase if the service provider starts offering more of these same services and the customer does not need to look for other suppliers. </li><li>  <b>Branding</b>  The service acquired by the partner can be issued in its corporate style and can be installed on its domain names. </li><li>  <b>Flexible price</b> .  Typically, companies implementing White Label solutions offer flexible pricing and discounts.  It depends on sales.  The partner creates the final retail price independently for customers, and it is always negotiable. </li><li>  <b>The possibility of postpay</b> .  A partner can provide services and accept client payments, and after monthly pay for services upon use and with reference to the number of sales. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/248/5df/0fd/2485df0fd13f2e6a0dbd635c00535acb.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote> ‚ÄúTo understand all the advantages of the White Label solution in the field of online gambling, it is necessary to at least generally present the structure of the online casino. <br><br>  Any online casino consists of 3 parts: platform, content and payment system.  The platform is software that includes all the functionality necessary for operating, which includes a registration system, a reporting system, a game content management system, a bonus system, an electronic wallet management, etc.  Content, i.e.  Games are slots, board games, and also live dealers.  This is a separate area that is not built into the platform.  Payment systems - a way to deposit and withdraw money at online casinos - visa, master card, neteller, skrill, etc. <br><br>  These are all different business areas, and in order to create a project, you need to combine them into one whole.  The White Label model is a comprehensive solution for opening an online casino, with a fully formed legal, financial infrastructure and includes: a platform based on the Saas model, integrated games, payment systems and a license. <br><br>  The operator does not need to spend time to obtain a license and to conclude contracts with providers of games and payment systems.  The operation is performed under the license of the supplier of the solution White Label and under its direct contracts with the providers of games and payment systems.  Thus, thanks to White Label, the operator gets the opportunity to start the project as soon as possible, and he can spend the saved time and budget for obtaining a license to promote his project.  Most of the projects on the market work according to this model. ‚Äù <br>  Nikolai Tugolukov, <a href="http://bossgs.com/ru/white-labelru">BOSS Gaming Studio</a> Development Manager </blockquote><br><br><h3>  White Label - short term? </h3><br>  It is believed that the main disadvantage of White Label is that a partner, selling a product under its own brand, reduces the focus on its own.  You can quickly get money - for the short term, it sounds tempting.  But with a long interaction - your brand can simply stop developing. <br><br>  But if the lack of White Label prevailed over all the advantages of the model, many companies would hardly have approached it, and White Label cooperation would not become more popular from year to year.  Companies that are just starting to implement a non-marketed partnership system, or who have long felt the benefits of working with White Label, prove this with their experience. <br><br>  Here's how Denis Bogdanov, director of <a href="http://www.nanoav.ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D23858%26Itemid%3D174%26lang%3Dru">NANO Security</a> , comments on the use of White Label in his business: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúCreating an antivirus solution from scratch is an extremely resource-intensive task, including in terms of time-consuming.  Throughout the world, only a few companies can afford such a development.  Using our ready-made solution allows partners to quickly receive their own high-quality anti-virus product, designed to meet all the high standards of the industry.  In addition, we provide professional technical support, updates using our resources and other types of support for a new product for our customers.  This approach is interesting for partner companies that use our White Label platform for their solutions. <br><br>  Our product NANO Antivirus White Label is a co-branding platform entirely based on our technology.  We use the platform to create new anti-virus solutions in accordance with the requirements and needs of the client. <br><br>  We propose to implement the "almost impossible" - in a short time and a relatively small price to get your own high-quality antivirus.  All technical issues related to the development, as well as further support and maintenance of the anti-virus solution are completely removed from the partner.  As a result, the partner receives the product with its brand, made in accordance with its technical task.  Then he can start making money on the distribution of his own antivirus, use it for image purposes or dispose of it somehow in accordance with his business plan.  In this case, the client receives an antivirus solution similar in quality to NANO Antivirus Pro. <br><br>  With the promotion of White Label, everything is simple: we use our own website, third-party Internet resources, specialized events (conferences, exhibitions), direct contacts with potential customers. ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a6/131/fc6/8a6131fc64430d1c46a041a065f571a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The service for massposting and analytics of <a href="https://kuku.io/ru/">KUKU.io</a> social networks began to offer White Label cooperation this year: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúToday, a business of any size actively comes to social networks, which are becoming an irreplaceable channel for sales and promotion.  Therefore, services for automatic posting, detailed analytics of accounts, the use of a convenient content calendar, as well as the management of an SMM team and online content greatly simplify the marketers life.  Therefore, <a href="https://smm.kuku.io/white-label-vozmozhnosti-kuku-io-i-vashego-biznesa/">KUKU.io White Label</a> may be of interest to companies from any industry and different regions.  For us, however, this is, first of all, access to a new audience. <br><br>  Any of the modules, whether analytics or posting, can be embedded in your existing product.  In addition, additional features can be added to enable more detailed analysis of content and audience, automate the work of employees and a number of others.  That is, in 1-2 months a partner receives a completely unique SMM product that can sell under its brand. <br><br>  We are approached by financial, media, advertising organizations to create their own services for working with social networks.  Practice shows that there is a future behind this model, so we are counting on the interest of new partners. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dba/530/d08/dba530d08e40425fdc0b170f9e221629.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.black42pay.com/">Black42pay</a> estimates its experience as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe offer the possibility of organizing payment by bank cards on websites from all over the world (acquiring), for renting our certified platform, which a partner uses for its payment system, under its own brand. <br><br>  We came to White Label to keep afloat in business.  Such a format of cooperation implies mutual benefits, in which each party deals with its area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise. <br><br>  We provide integration solutions and create partnerships with other electronic payment systems, for example, the White Label partnership for technology.  We provide the software and server part of the system.  Our benefit is the percentage of integration and rental of software, the benefit of our White Label partners is the opportunity to advance in the market of acquiring and electronic payments. <br><br>  At our White Label partner, the costs are minimal, since he chooses the list of modules he needs for his payment system himself, according to the price list and the wishes of the final result in the operation of the system. <br><br>  Since the introduction of the White Label model, we have concluded dozens of agreements, the White Label scheme is working, the partners are satisfied with the results, as they were able to launch their payment system from scratch with minimal loss of time and money. " </blockquote><br>  As you can see, White Label is actively gaining trust in various industries and is not going to disappear from the sites of companies.  How do you rate this collaboration?
