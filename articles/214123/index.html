    <h4>  The main purpose and objectives of HBP </h4><br>  Let's start with the global.  So, HBP sets as its task nothing less than an understanding of the workings of the human brain.  And if we can make this dream come true, then we will understand how to cure various diseases of the brain, we will be able to realize what makes us people, and also create revolutionary computer technologies. <br><br>  <i><b>A brief description of all 12 subprojects (a list of organizations working on their implementation is given at the end of each video):</b></i> <br><br>  <b>SP 1 - <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/strategic-mouse-brain-data">Strategic Mouse Brain Data</a> -</b> The main objective of this project: to obtain all the missing basic information about the structure of the brain of mice and to simplify the comparison between the mouse brain and the human one. <br><br>  In fact, part of this subproject on brain research using three-dimensional electron microscopy was analyzed in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/211997/">previous article</a> .  As correctly noted in the comments to the post, the mice are able to solve simple puzzles, for example, purposefully press a button to get food or look for the shortest path in the maze with it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3eqrD9SfCjM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>SP 2 - <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/strategic-human-brain-data">Strategic Human Brain Data</a> -</b> Main objective: to obtain a multilevel set of data on the human brain, which is similar to data obtained for the brain of mice, and to simplify the use of data from the SP 1 project to predict processes in the human brain. <br><br>  Thus, the project team will fill the void between the microscopic data obtained in the SP 1 project and the macroscopic data that can be obtained, for example, using MRI.

After several sleepless weeks of searching for information, calling around neighbors and friends, we are still ready to provide answers. <br><br>  Each question contains the nickname of the person who asked this question, so if you don‚Äôt want to read the whole thing, you can safely move on to the right answer.  Also, some of the questions are combined, since the subject and purpose of the question are approximately the same (for example, consciousness vs brain simulation). <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/211997/">Habrahabr</a> </h5><br>  <b>Question from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nadezdash/" class="user_link">NadezdaSh</a> :</b> <br><blockquote> The goal of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168087/">project</a> is to create a single open platform for experiments with simulating the functions of the human brain, a single open framework.  It will be possible to develop and new computer models of emulation, and test new methods of treatment of diseases. <br><br>  From what has been described as a goal, it becomes unclear why it is possible to emulate a neuron in the gland, if it can be done programmatically.  The goal is written to create an open framework. <br><br>  In games, you can emulate the universe and flying to the stars, in low-level languages ‚Äã‚Äãto control the movement of bytes.  Is it really impossible to programmatically emulate a neuron.  Perhaps this is not the goal that the project pursues ... <br>  1. Explain the main goal of the project.  The goal - to make a new storage device? <br>  2. How does neuron emulation allow to cure diseases?  The human brain consists of a number of other parts, not just neurons.  Besides the fact that there is still a body. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Similar questions from Dedushka_shubin:</b> <br><blockquote>  1. What is the ultimate goal of the project?  What is supposed to be the result? <br>  2. (Answer 3) How important will this be for medicine and social sciences? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answers:</b> <br>  1. The purpose of the project is precisely that stated: to create a single database of neural structures and mechanisms that apply to them, to simulate various neural connections in particular, and to reach the scale of the human brain as a whole.  Simulation of neurons just happens programmatically, after careful study of what happens to neurons at the real micro and macro level.  All accumulated data will be just in bytes, in the structures of the neural network, but at the same time, they are planned to be implemented within the framework of SP9 in hardware, in neuromorphic chips. <br><br>  2. With the success of the project it will be a huge breakthrough in the field of medicine.  Now patients with diseases associated with various brain lesions are treated with pills, although they have no idea exactly what they are affecting.  When analyzing neural structures, it will be possible to see the disease ‚Äúfrom the inside,‚Äù and to start from this, which must be changed at some level, in order for a person to become ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù (that is, more adequate according to generally accepted norms of society).  For example, this video describes the potential benefits of studying the brain for medicine: <br><br><br><br>  As for the social sciences, this is already a question of the interaction of different types of neural structures, roughly, different brains.  This question is still premature enough to ask, and there is no stated goal of the project in this regard. <br><br>  If it is interesting, then <a href="http://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">in open access</a> there is a small simulator of the work of neurons at the membrane level, it is possible to build synoptic, ionic bonds in it, to process the system of spikes and so on. <br><br>  3. All signals emanating from our body pass through brain processes.  In the brain there is a physicochemical-electronic medium, which is part of the simulations.  The models not only include the neurons themselves and their topology, but also suggest activity outside the neurons, in the environment where they are located. <br><br>  About the interaction of the brain with muscles, you can watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_wolpert_the_real_reason_for_brains.html">this video with subtitles</a> or in the original: <br><br><br><br>  <b>Question from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/anc/" class="user_link">Anc</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  1. In such studies, the main point is to model real neurons.  Will anyone in the project be engaged in the interpretation of the simulated processes?  The first artificial neural networks were based on the assumption of the summation of incoming signals in a neuron.  Then spike neural networks appeared.  Neural networks with different effects on the result of input signals on dendrites or depending on the type of synapse are now born.  Your research may well become the basis for new models of artificial neural networks. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>A similar question asked <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/waphyld/" class="user_link">waphyld</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  Tell us about the criteria for comparing their models for compliance with a functioning brain.  If there are any.  In other words - how will they know when to stop? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  2. What structural parts of the brain will be scanned, modeled, and distinguished in the design?  Only neurons?  Myelin?  Glia?  Blood vessels?  The blood-brain barrier in general?  Microtubules, layers of the neocortex, some part of the neocortex, or other parts of the brain? <br>  3. Will the model be dynamic or static in terms of establishing new connections and dying off of old ones?  After all, a huge number of synapses are established and ruptured in the brain during the day of the lived life. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  1. In order to build an adequate model of neural networks, each slice (slice) of the brain is subjected to a lengthy and tedious procedure of checks, emulations and regular checks.  That is, electrodes and sensors are used to establish communication between individual neurons, which are implanted in certain areas of brain tissue.  A certain impulse is applied to these electrodes and with the help of sensors the direction of propagation of impulses is recorded. <br><br>  Then it is transferred to a specific model and a simulation of a similar stimulating effect on the models is carried out.  If everything works well, then this part is left, if not, then new experiments are conducted with brain tissue.  Thus, computer results are compared with the actual response of neurons in the brain.  Naturally, the same procedure is performed several times for the same areas in order to obtain statistically correct results. <br><br>  2. It is not possible to model everything at once.  At first it will be only neurons, as the main cells and structures involved in information processing, and by and large only the neocortex, the latest in terms of the evolution of the part of the brain that determines our thought processes. <br><br>  As for simulations, the third or fourth level is the construction of neural networks, where the neuron is considered as a whole, without further scaling, that is, a neuron and certain connections with other neurons - the network.  And already on the basis of this, 75 million neural networks can be simulated easily.  But this is a completely different topic: this is called the <a href="http://www.nest-initiative.org/">NEST simulator</a> , and it is also part of our Blue Brain Project. <br><br>  3. At the moment, only static links are considered.  When simulations on existing models reach a certain level of excellence, you can start talking about changing relationships.  Before running ahead, you must first establish the valid results of current tests.  Now the largest model in the research is calculated within 12.5 milliseconds of real time.  I do not think that changes in connections on such a scale are very relevant to consideration. <br><br>  <b>Question from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/whilenotfalse/" class="user_link">whileNotFalse</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  At what level do you model neurons: on a detailed physical or abstract functional?  Perhaps there are some analogies and interesting facts about the work of neurons? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  How neurons are simulated: first, mouse slices (subproject SP1) use neuron topologies using automated microscope complexes.  In principle, such work can be carried out automatically, but so far it is in its infancy (see the previous article on 3D reconstruction of the brain).  So now it is done in a mixed mode: manually plus some automatic processing / correction / post-processing.  Photos and accuracy of such maps are determined by the high resolution of microscopes.  Further, as noted above, the testing of connections between neurons occurs by applying electrical impulses to the corresponding areas of brain tissue. <br><br>  Secondly, data from other subprojects help to understand the role of certain areas of the brain.  As a result, at the output we have a copy of the neural network, which is built as a physical copy of the real brain with the functionality assigned to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/300/f64/fee/300f64feef6e3e38a9daab3347800bd7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Question from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/esir_pavel/" class="user_link">esir_pavel</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  What worries me is this question.  The project The Human Brain aims to create a model of a whole brain.  And further, using this model, what the fantasy wishes, even to simulate neurodegenerative diseases and test drugs for them, even to model consciousness. <br><br>  It is clear that computational drug testing requires biologically plausible neuron models, such as <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">Hodgkin-Huxley</a> .  But as far as consciousness is concerned, there is such a premonition that it can be modeled using much simpler neuron models that do not take into account all physiological features, like Izhikevich‚Äôs phenomenological model. <br>  ... <br>  Therefore, my question in the refined version is: ‚ÄúIs the Human Brain being used to study the possibility of realizing a strong or at least weakly conscious being based on simple phenomenological, non-physiological models of neurons as part of the project?‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Also <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kvz/" class="user_link">kvz</a> asked similar questions:</b> <br><blockquote>  1. Is it planned to further try to model consciousness, based on the results of this project, or is it a completely different kind of research?  If yes, then from the outside it looks like if we looked at the magnetic hard disk drives under a microscope and cut the processor with nano-knives in order to understand how Windows XP works. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>andreyis:</b> <br><blockquote>  The question of the human brain is always a question of consciousness.  How is consciousness born?  Where is the place where meaning goes into action? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>wilderwind:</b> <br><blockquote>  Is it possible to programmatically model the evolution of the emergence of consciousness? <br>  Is it possible, the way to create artificial intelligence through the independent evolution of software? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>And <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/m_romul/" class="user_link">M_Romul</a> :</b> <br><blockquote>  If I am not mistaken, the HBP intentions declaration stated that the goal is a simulation of the work of the brain (um) of a person WITHOUT a simulation of consciousness.  How so?  If um of a person works entirely, there will be consciousness.  Bioethics insisted on such a formulation?  And yes, will the simulation work in real time?  Who is the donor who gave you the brain?  His gender / age / culture?  It will be considered as loading of consciousness when everything will turn out? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  2. There are two large state-level projects - The Human Brain Project and Blue Brain Project.  However, it seems that all of them are associated with the study of primarily biological and chemical processes of the brain using various microscopes and other measuring equipment.  Are large grants allocated specifically for the simulation of consciousness?  Scientists in what direction is closer in their specialty to modeling consciousness as an information shell (and not at the level of a biological structure) - Computer Science or Neuroscience? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Long and tedious answer:</b> <br>  1. Consciousness is a side effect, but in no way an advanced, priority goal of HBP.  Consciousness is like seeing what is happening on the monitor screen, while not understanding what the stuffing of the computer is made of - here you are absolutely right.  In HBP, roughly speaking, they are building various systems of the very stuffing (separately CD, processor, memory), and only then various configurations can be assembled from them. <br><br>  Or another example of how medicine was created.  For a long time, people and had no idea about the DNA, the causes of disease, and so on, but were treated, cut, bleeding involved.  And now we have access to molecular medicine, when an effective medicine or candidates for them can be calculated on a computer, DNA therapy, the cultivation of organs and tissues, as well as cloning.  HBP - an attempt to skip the "Middle Ages" in the understanding of the principles of the brain for 10 years. <br><br>  The project is based on the goal of studying the mechanisms of neuro-physico-chemical interaction of neurons between themselves and the environment.  This is the very basis that can provide answers to fundamental questions about the work of the neurons themselves.  The brain is a biological structure, which, in fact, is studied in HBP, and consciousness is a side effect of the evolutionary complication of this biological structure.  At some point in time, the brain of our distant ancestors had to start processing all the growing volumes of information, and evolution had found an excellent mechanism for this ‚Äî <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">neocortex</a> columns, which actually work as cores in our multi-core brain, and only then the consciousness developed on the basis of this evolutionary tricks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e14/8c5/9c8/e148c59c8d88821272fa5beadbe4ef99.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="http://phys.org/news171565512.html">A source</a></i> <br><br>  It‚Äôs still too early to talk about consciousness in this context, for now we only want to learn how to simulate brain activity.  But, if it, consciousness, depends only on neural, synaptic and molecular interactions, it will certainly appear as a side effect of more and more complex interactions of neurons in large numbers.  If so, then we ourselves will witness its occurrence from the moment of the simulation of quite complex neural structures, allowing to achieve a certain level of development of brain activity. <br><br>  The question of artificial intelligence (AI) is directly correlated with the question of consciousness.  What people now call AI is an attempt to come up with a formula for pseudo-consciousness, and to fit it into general cases.  For BBP, the problem is absolutely the opposite: to create structures, the complication of which may lead to AI simulation to one degree or another, or it will give a great development to already existing AI subsystems.  But this approach from the bottom, though much more time consuming, is much more fundamental and correct.  We do not use phenomenological constructions for this. <br><br>  Of course, the creation of artificial intelligence through the independent evolution of software is exactly what we all expect from HBP, but only after scientists understand the principles of the brain and learn at least to simulate it using the simplest examples. <br><br>  Moreover, it has not yet been proved that all neural structures will be sufficient for self-consciousness.  So ethically it can be easily circumvented using this statement of the statement.  As for how it will be in reality, it seems that so many are running ahead.  No one knows yet what they will have to face until neuron models appear that are close to a real human brain, in which there are 300 billion neurons.  Simulation calculations will be closer to real time, and then ahead of them, because no one will give up faster calculations. <br><br>  For the simulation, the human donor, as such, is not needed, since our brain works according to certain algorithms for 90% of the same for all people. <br>  You can, for example, refer to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_jones_a_map_of_the_brain.html">this lecture</a> : <br><br><br><br>  What is meant by loading consciousness?  Consciousness itself is conscious at some stage: it is either there or not.  Be sure that the times are not far off when people with transparencies will stand on the streets ‚Äúdo not touch the T2030 model, it has realized itself‚Äù - although this is just a simulation, and the edge is very thin there. <br><br>  And once again, the question of the brain and consciousness is even more a philosophical question than a scientific one.  Who can answer: Do animals have a consciousness if they themselves cannot tell us about it? <br><br>  For example, in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/antonio_damasio_the_quest_to_understand_consciousness.html">this video</a> it is stated that if a living being has a connection between the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">brain stem</a> and the cerebral cortex, then such an animal has self-awareness, is able to memorize and reproduce patterns: <br><br><br><br>  As for the meaning, it, the meaning, goes into action all in the same biological structure, the brain that receives the input signal, ‚Äúevaluates‚Äù it - interprets it - and gives some output information, for example, that it is necessary to rearrange the leg from position A to position B. <br><br>  And this long answer I would like to finish the <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets.html">TED-lecture of</a> one of the ideologists of the project - Henry Markram.  It is worth noting that for the entire lecture, he never mentioned consciousness - consciousness, only perception - feeling, perception: <br><br><br><br>  I also advise you to refer to the TED lecture series <a href="http://www.ted.com/playlists/1/how_does_my_brain_work.html">‚ÄúHow does my brain works?‚Äù</a> , I highly recommend to see 1,2 and 6,7 lectures. <br><br>  2. Blue Brain Project - a purely Swiss project, which at one time was the impetus for the adoption of the program The Human Brain Project.  The main goal of both projects is to understand how the brain works and how it works, the question of consciousness is secondary, because consciousness is the highest degree of brain development.  Not understanding how the brain works at the level of biochemistry, we are simply not able to build an adequate model of any consciousness, except for phenomenological ones. <br><br>  As for what is more, it is rather Neuroscience with the support and active participation of Computer Science. <br><br>  <b>Questions from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/completebrains/" class="user_link">CompleteBrains</a> sent by mail:</b> <br><blockquote>  1.

Perhaps some kind of effort needs to be made by our PR team in order for the project to be more recognizable in countries where they speak Russian. We have a lot of smart and skilled developers.

<br> HM: Let me first explain that a Turing machine is a machine that can solve any problem if the problem is given to it in discretely timed batches. So a Turing machine is a universal computer for what is called ‚Äúbatch processing‚Äù. But what a Turing machine can't do is to solve problems universally while information is continuously coming in and disturbing it from finishing the operation it just started on. In other words, it can't (without work arounds and cheating) strictly speaking solve problems presented to it on an analog time scale and produce answers on an analog time scale. A liquid computer is however a computer that can solve any problem in realtime and at any time (not discrete time). You can even call it ‚Äúanytime processing‚Äù. So it is a universal theory for analog computing. You see, a big problem that the brain has, is to solve how to keep thinking about something that it just saw while the world around it never stops sending it new information. If you sent your computer continuously new information it will not be able to do anything because it can't finish one thing before it has to start on another problem. The way liquid computing works is very much like an actual physical liquid. It makes sense of the perturbations rather than seeing them as a nuisance. We also call it high entropy computing or computing on transient states. This is a very important (but not complete) theory of how the brain works because it shows us how to tap into the vast amount of information that lies in a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù. Another big challenge to understand the brain is that it is always physically changing. Your brain right now is already different from what it was just 1 hour ago, and extremely different from what it was when you were 10 years old. So, because your brain is constantly different and because every moment in your life is potentially (hopefully) also novel, there is a very good chance that most of the time, the responses produced in your brain are new to you (to your neurons) ‚Äî never ‚Äúseen‚Äù before. So if the brain produces a response that it never ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù before, how does it know what it means? The state that your brain is in right now, never happened before so how can your brain make sense of states it never saw before and connect them to all your moments before? Liquid computing provides a partial explanation for this problem by showing that the same state never actually needs to reoccur in the brain for you to make sense of the states ‚Äì that is why we also call it computing on transient states. Liquid computing can in principle solve any problem instantaneously and keep solving them in real-time and with infinite parallelization. But, it is very difficult to build a good liquid computer. One of the benefits of Blue Brain is that it will be able to design and build extremely powerful liquid computers. <br></div></div><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simply put, our brain receives information, even when processing the previous one, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúliquid computing‚Äù (computing on transient states) is to build in some sense an analog computer that processes information in any given time interval (that is, in real time), and not bars, as now. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Question from father_gorry:</font></font></b> <br><blockquote> 1.      ,   ,         ,        .    ?  ,   ? <br><br> 2.                 ?    ‚Äì,    ‚Äî     ,  ,  ,     . </blockquote><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Answer from the user of neuroscience:</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You have already got far.

Is it possible to isolate the very essence, removing all unnecessary? <br><br>  Are the quantum-mechanical properties of matter the basis for the existence of consciousness, or, theoretically, it is possible to create absolutely identical system emulation on future super-computers? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  Many questions about consciousness have already been there, as well as answers that remain approximately the same: so far no one has been able to model quite complex neural structures in order to witness the initial appearance of consciousness.  And this is on condition that the neural structures and processes in them are all that is needed for consciousness.  Therefore, it is too early to talk about this.  We can judge the consciousness so far on the basis of the available surface data. <br><br>  The quantum-mechanical question is unlikely to be considered, because there is nothing ‚Äúdivine‚Äù (spiritual, universal) in the mind itself, as some believe.  This is just an idea from the category of misunderstanding that there may be something more complicated than human consciousness.  And it necessarily is, we ourselves take part in it, evolving.  Of course, no one denies that consciousness, as it is, will be achievable with time for simulation.  The only question is time and ethics. <br><br>  <b>Question from red_ostrich:</b> <br><blockquote>  What is the proportion of scientists from different areas in the Blue Brain Project?  Is there a proportion of people involved in the theory, or is there mainly a focus on the analysis and description of experimental data?  Who designs the experiments and how does it go?  At what level do you need to study biology, some math (or physics, or CS specialist) to participate in the project? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  Most scientists are engaged in theory and model building.  Although the project itself is, first of all, neuroscience, and only then computational.  In terms of programming, there is a high-performance computing team, a visualization team, and a platform building team (the largest of all computing ones).  Some knowledge of neuro-processes needs to be acquired even by the guys from CS at the beginning of work, but all this is quickly understood at an abstract level.  The main thing is to always have a mediator between calculators and theorists, for these parties are not always able to find an equal language for work. <br><br>  By the way, a fairly large group of scientists is engaged in the neuro-form robotic SP10. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bd/dfa/594/1bddfa594b628aef7c24ce27546da160.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Question from vsh:</b> <br><blockquote>  Can you briefly describe the model you use to simulate?  Tell me, are there any things that she for some reason does not take into account, and would you prefer to take them into account? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  Unfortunately, we can not, all models in the BBP are under the NDA.  However, you can read about the mechanisms that are part of the models ( <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/qbxXCbAoJfUeb">1</a> , <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/JZEzkMgQJfUhe">2</a> , <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/0iTTrgm4JfUk5">3</a> , <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/BaQ86Li-JfUmt">4</a> ) without any problems. <br><br>  <b>Question from X5robot:</b> <br><blockquote>  Is it possible now to estimate how energy-consuming the analogue will be? </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  If the energy expended on the simulation itself is meant, then even this parameter is difficult to determine (there are estimates in gigawatts of electricity and billions of euros in investment).  Taking current models and current machines is not entirely fair, since the energy consumed is now more for fewer neurons, plus a new generation of supercomputers will consume less electricity, and ideally the entire human brain should be simulated on a 20 megawatt data center. <br><br><h5>  <b><a href="http://www.nanometer.ru/2014/02/12/mozg_412800.html">Nanometer</a></b> </h5><br><br>  Question from Shepherd Evfgrafovich: <br><blockquote>  And you can transfer the model of a neuron to a model of any human organization, replacing axons like a telegraph link.  How many people will be required for such a model?  Or at least for one synaptic vesicle?  If, of course, there is at least some program that simulates its behavior?  Will there be enough for this ordinary sports stadium?  And why not, if the ant's brain consists of only about 250 thousand neurons ... </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br>  The neuron model can be transferred to anything, but why?  At the moment, the goal is to study the very neurons and their connections, and then, after building the corresponding mathematical models, they can be transferred to almost anything. <br><br>  If we have missed something, you can always contact the <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/discover/the-project/faq">FAQ of</a> the project itself. <br><br><hr><br>  And at the end of this slightly narrated story, another fun, fun video from TED <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_seung.html">with subtitles</a> and in the original: <br><br><br><br>  <b>PS:</b> We understand the text is impressive, it is difficult to verify everything with jewelery accuracy, but if you find a mistake, please write in PM. <br><hr><br>  Sometimes briefly, and sometimes not so much about the news of science and technology, you can read on <a href="https://telegram.me/TiberiusRu">my Telegram channel</a> - welcome;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214123/</a></p>
