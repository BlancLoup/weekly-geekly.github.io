  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Launched the world's first 100 Gbit / s commercial highway</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Indiana University in the United States and several partner organizations were able to create and launch a commercial network backbone with data transfer speeds of 100 gigabits / sec.  It is worth noting that the tests were conducted not in the United States, but in Germany.  In addition, on the basis of this network, testing under ‚Äústressful‚Äù conditions is being conducted, so to speak, of the file system Luster (cluster file system).  So far, the system shows itself perfectly. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The project partners are such well-known companies as T-Systems and Alcatel-Lucent, which provided their products in June of this year.  In addition, the equipment was also provided by well-known companies such as Data Direct Networks (DDN) and Hewlett Packard.  The total length of the highway is 60 kilometers, it works on the basis of a single signal carrier frequency.  Geographically, this network is located between the cities of Dresden and Freiberg.  The data is transmitted over the network between the Whamcloud, Data Direct Network and High Performance Computing centers. <br><br>  The project manager claims that the speed is really huge - in a second it managed to transfer 21.9 gigabytes of data, which is 87% of the theoretical maximum.  Every minute this network is capable of transmitting a volume of information equivalent to the data contained on 285 DVDs.

      It should be noted that the creation of high-speed highway was not engaged in the entire University of Indiana, and its division, Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI).  This organization is fairly well known throughout the world, among professionals working in the IT field.  For the creation of the highway was allocated $ 15 million by Lilly Endowment, Inc., engaged in investment in the IT sector.  As mentioned above, the Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI) team, which develops and implements the high-speed network backbone project, involves experts not only from the university itself, but from various IT companies around the world. <br><br>  The long-term goal of the project is to create a high-speed network infrastructure, so far only around Dresden and Freiberg, with the ability to transfer large amounts of data.  It is worth noting that the Luster file system has been developed since 2006, and is already at the testing stage in new conditions. <br><br>  The detailed technical specification of the express highway has not yet been announced, as it is a commercial development.  At the end of this month the project will be presented by the project management. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/topic/storage/Indiana-University-Announces-Saturation-of-First-Commercial-100-Gigabit-Link-108251309.html">hpcwire</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108403/</a></p>
