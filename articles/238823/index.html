But there was someone kind who gave me an invite for it.  So it came in handy. <br><br>  Now I can publish it, but I warn you that a lot has already changed.  Many services already work with Maestro cards, no longer require only Visa or MasterCard.  Bank transfer from Yandex-money has become more difficult, now it is required to pass <a href="">identification</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD 03.10.2014.</b>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/formasha/" class="user_link">formasha</a> suggests that Yandex can now transfer <a href="">to any card (including Maestro)</a> directly, and not by bank transfer.  <a href="">Payment page</a> .  There is no longer any need to find out your details for Yandex-money.

    <hr><br>  I had two thousand rubles on Yandex money.  I wanted to withdraw them.  The issue price is commensurate with the cost of owning VISA or Mastercard.  I didn't want to get a paid card. <br><br>  Below I will tell you how: <br><ul><li>  get a free Sberbank-Maestro "Momentum" card; </li><li>  connect Sberbank online; </li><li>  transfer Yandex-money to the card. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sberbank online is technically linked to a plastic card.  If you do not have any cards - go to the bank and take a card. <br><br><blockquote>  The first time I went to the bank, I did the wrong thing.  I thought that it was necessary to conclude an agreement and went to where it says ‚Äúagreements, loans, bills‚Äù.  An employee of the bank was not in the subject and began to convince me that it is necessary to take VISA for 700 rubles or Mastercard for 600. <br><br>  I called 8 800 555 5550, and they explained everything to me. </blockquote><br><br>  The ‚ÄúMomentum‚Äù card is made instantly and there is no need to pay for it.  It is necessary to go with a passport to any window where they accept payments.  The girl will print an application for a card, you sign and immediately receive a card. <br><br>  The card must be activated: just insert it into the ATM and request a balance. <br><br>  With the help of an ATM, you can get a login and password from Sberbank-online.  In the menu: Internet service -&gt; ID and password printing.  In the <a href="http://sberbank.ru/common/img/uploaded/sbol/all/proj_01_first.html">video,</a> all set out in detail. <br><br>  Then the most difficult thing: you need to withdraw Yandex-money on the card Sberbank-Maestro "Momentum". <br><br><blockquote>  I was glad that I made the map so easily and went home.  It turned out that my personal account and the details of how to transfer were not written anywhere in Sberbank online. <br><br>  In Yandex money is also unclear.  There are several options to transfer money through the bank.  On the Internet did not find detailed information.  I had to try differently.  From the second time it turned out. </blockquote><br><br>  Do not rush to leave the bank when you received the card.  Ask for your branch details and your personal account number.  Details of the branch + number of your personal account = what Yandex needs. <br><br>  Select in Yandex: <br><ul><li>  To withdraw to the account in a Russian bank (3% + 15 rubles) </li><li>  Account Type - Banking </li><li>  Transfer method - Personal account </li></ul><br><br>  Below are the details I entered for <b>my department</b> : <br><br>  Withdrawing to the account of an individual in a Russian bank <br><br>  Bank: <br><br>  SOUTHWESTERN BANK OJSC SBERBANK OF RUSSIA <br>  Rostov-on-Don <br>  BIC 046015602 <br>  TIN 7707083893 <br>  c / a 30101810600000000602 <br><br>  Translation method: <br>  Personal account <br><br>  Recipient: <br><br>  Bank account number (empty) <br>  Account number 47422810352099999001 <br>  No. of ruble account 408178 ************** <br><br>  Ivanov <br>  Ivan <br>  Ivanovich <br><br>  Price issue: <br><ol><li>  receiving a card is free of charge; </li><li>  card service per year - for free; </li><li>  Mobile Bank service is free of charge if you choose the Economical tariff (it is connected when you first enter Sberbank online); </li><li>  transfer from Yandex money 3% + 15 r.  (as well as on other plastic cards); </li><li>  cash withdrawal from a card at an ATM of Sberbank - without interest. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238823/</a></p>
