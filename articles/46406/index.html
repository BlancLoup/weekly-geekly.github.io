  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Financial Tsunami is unstoppable. The Great Depression is Coming Soon 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Translation of an article from the blog of Hela Turner, who recently scared us with the <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/item/499/">general mobilization in the US</a> , and provided us with <a href="http://ostrovityanin.habrahabr.ru/blog/46190/">images of Amero paper</a> , whose currencies are destined to be combined into the North American alliance of Canada and Mexico this spring (in his opinion).</i> <br><br>  December 2, 2008 was a turning point in the saga of the disappearing international monetary system, and yet there was no mention in the press that gold went to the depot (discount compared to the price of goods for closer periods) for the first time in history.  The facts are as follows: December 2nd, on the Comex commodity exchange in New York, December gold futures (last delivery: December 31), as stated, were at a discount of 1.98%, while February gold futures (last delivery: 27 February 2009) was at a discount of 0.14%.  (All percentages are annualized.) The situation worsened on December 3rd, when the corresponding numbers were 2% and 0.29%.  This means that the gold exchange base has become negative, and the state of the deportation has persisted for at least 48 hours. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the Comex delivery report of December 3rd, there were 11,759 offers to accept delivery.  This represents 1.1759 million ounces of gold, while Comex-approved warehouses contain 2.9 million ounces.  Thus, 40% of the total amount must be delivered by December 31st.  Since that time, not all gold in warehouses is available for delivery, and the Comex supply of gold far from justifies demand at current rates.  The futures market for gold is crumbling.  "Paper" gold is increasingly losing confidence.

      There was already a small deportation for gold at the end of the previous active month of deliveries, but it never flowed into the next month of deliveries, as it happens now: the deportation in the December delivery displaces the February supply, which was 0.36% at the last count.  Silver is also in the depot, silver futures prices have fallen by half compared to gold. <br><br>  The gold exchange base is an ancient, unchangeable measure of trust.  Of course, it is too early to say whether gold went to a long-term deportation, or the situation will be corrected (this will probably be).  Come what may, it doesn't matter.  The fact that this happened was the final, fatal blow to the unreliable currency system.  She will bleed to death until she dies, and may die slowly, even if there are no other blows, jolts, or shocks to the system.  Very few people understand that this will continue and, of course, official sources and the media do not help clarify the importance of all this.  I will try to help the reader. <br><br>  Gold, which goes to a long-term deportation, shows that it is no longer sold at any price, either in dollars, yen, euro, or Swiss francs.  The situation is exactly the same as it was several years ago: gold is not sold at any price specified in the currency of Zimbabwe, but it has a high cost.  Look at it differently: all offers for the sale of gold respond, be it newly mined gold, gold bars or gold minted.  I draw attention to the case, which threw a long shadow a few years in advance: the last contango (mark-up to price) in Washington.  Contango was made in opposition to the deportation, in Washington, in the city where the Paper Mill, the Federal Reserve Board are located.  This is a mocking way of saying that the game of Washington is over.  Music is stopped for players "musical chairs."  Those who do not have any gold in their hands became losers.  They can not get it through the "white" channels and there is only one way out - go to the "black" market. <br><br>  Gold and silver bases serve as an early warning system, and this signals the beginning of the end.  The end inevitably approaches the climax in the "Greek tragedy", since the heroes and heroines are drawn into their own destruction.  An existing opposing experiment with paper money enters into death agony. <br><br>  The situation with the deportation of gold in the money system is comparable to the collision of Titanic (the international monetary system) with an iceberg (gold and its disappearing basis) emerging from the fog too late to avoid a collision.  The vanishing golden base and its consequences threaten the world with the Great Depression, which will eclipse the Depression of the 1930s. <br><br>  A strengthening depot in gold money leads to the fact that the ‚Äúdollar cancer‚Äù will reach the last stage.  The progressively evaporating confidence in the non-convertible dollar can no longer be stopped. <br><br>  A negative basis (deport) means that people who manage the supply of monetary gold cannot part with it, regardless of the bait.  These people are not speculators.  They are neither miser or usurers.  They are very capable businessmen with a conservative mood.  They are determined to preserve their capital, no matter what happens, for a long period.  So they can turn around with normal government and a normal monetary system.  Their tool is the possession of monetary gold.  They blithely ignore the siren signals, hoping for a guaranteed profit.  Indeed, they could sell their "material" gold in the commodity market and buy it at a discount on the futures market in 30 days.  The lure of guaranteed profit would be irresistible.  But in the case of gold it is not.  Why? <br><br>  Well, they do not believe that "material" gold will be available for delivery in 30 days.  They do not want to be stuck with "paper" gold, which is useless in order to preserve capital. <br><br>  December 2 is a turning point, because before this date the monetary system might have been saved by opening up the US Mint with gold.  Now, considering the deportation of gold, it is too late.  Last chance to avoid trouble was missed.  As the saying goes: "The last straw will break the camel's back." <br><br>  Few people realize that the suspension of the gold trade, which happened, means the suspension of world trade.  This is a financial disaster equal to ten on the Greenspan scale, with its epicenter at Comex in New York, where the World Trade Center Gemini Towers stood.  This is no exaggeration, but this incident will cause a tsunami that destroys a prosperous world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46406/</a></p>
