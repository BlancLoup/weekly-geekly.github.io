  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase website conversion by 30% in 5 minutes?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that the conversion rate is usually very small, on average 2 - 3%, in many online stores it does not even reach 1%.  Conversion depends on the specifics of the product and the demand for it, on the marketing strategy used by the store, on the design of the store and a number of other factors.  If the conversion in your online store exceeds 10%, then you can safely consider yourself a guru.  However, this is not the limit.  After all, there are 90% of visitors who, for one reason or another, left your site without ordering anything. <br><br>  Conversion can be compared with the process of displaying the site in the TOP search engines.  There is no single recipe for how to achieve this.  Some of the old-fashioned way is limited to buying links, more advanced marketers use an integrated approach (improving the quality of the site, working on behavioral factors, social networks, etc.), and some hone each potentially influential factor (A / B testing usability, reputation management etc.).  With a conversion of approximately the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4df/a8f/bae/4dfa8fbae6ee47afa6438a949775de2e.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of our clients, specializing in the sale of books, helped us conduct research.  During it, we measured the conversion of his online store in different periods of time:

    <ul><li>  before installing the callback widget, </li><li>  after installing the widget for 1 week, </li><li>  after collecting customer satisfaction data and training its operators. </li></ul><br><br>  The data in the infographic is calculated as the average number per day by a statistical slice per week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cd/a6c/941/3cda6c9419a14c38bd975f9b910aa5a8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Contrary to our wishes, the client did not experience a tremendous increase in conversion immediately after the widget was installed, since among the potential clients who spoke to the operator, there were still those who, after consulting, moved to the ‚Äúlost‚Äù category.  From consumers' assessments of the quality of responses, it became clear that they leave much to be desired.  After listening to the recordings of telephone conversations that <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">our service</a> provides to all its customers, the management of the client company was able to identify a number of reasons why customers did not order and formulate a plan of corrective measures, one of the points of which was operator training.  After their introduction, the <b>conversion increased by another 0.36% or almost 2 times</b> compared to what it was before the installation of the <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">callback widget.</a> <br><br>  Now let's turn to the numbers: what is 0.36% for this company? <br><br>  The average check of one order (excluding delivery costs) is 2,000 rubles.  An additional 12 purchases per day brings the company an average of 12 * 2,000 = <b>24,000 rubles</b> .  Through the <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">callback of the</a> company, 17 calls a day came on average, the client spent 898 rubles on them. <br><br>  Total 24 000 - 898 = 23 102 rubles (economic efficiency per day) or <b>about 700 000 rubles per month.</b> <br><br>  This company is just beginning to optimize its relationship with customers, and we are confident that they will achieve even greater results, and we, in turn, will help them with all our might. <br><br><h5>  <b>First the connection, then the quality.</b> </h5><br><br>  At first glance, an increase in conversion of 0.36% seems quite insignificant, but agree, if you translate it into economic efficiency, it turns out not bad at all.  And the costs are much lower than the profit. <br><br>  But again, as in the case of striving for the ideal, ‚Äúsomeone will be in the TOP quickly, and someone is slower,‚Äù and everyone will have their own set of recipes that can be given by one tool - quick communication with the client and feedback about as a conversation with him! <br><br>  So, for example, one of our clients has an ‚Äúoperator-seller from God‚Äù, but his online store is absolutely incorrectly designed: with a structural glut, it is very difficult to find the right product, there are no images or descriptions for the whole range.  Among the many links it is difficult to make out contacts, so often consumers simply leave the site without leaving a chance to a talented operator.  Of course, to increase conversion, you will need to address each of these issues, but in the first stage, the customer retention widget helped to solve these problems.  Not finding the right product, some customers left their phone number and within a minute, clarified the availability of the product they needed and all related questions from the operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/387/f32/269/387f322697754ce5a839a3743c78e6cd.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>We do not ship the client, he is already tired</b> </h5><br><br>  Not surprisingly, the <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">callback widget was</a> so popular with customers.  The life of a modern person is literally overflowing with information: a news feed in the morning, outdoor advertising on the way to work, stories of colleagues at the morning coffee, then someone gives us a leaflet at the entrance to the store, then the child‚Äôs class teacher calls and tells about his failure .  Analyze your day and you will have a personal list of information stimuli.  For this reason, imperceptibly for ourselves, the brain learns to adapt, ceases to be susceptible and is looking for the simplest algorithms for obtaining the desired.  And what could be simpler than to press the callback button, enter your number and in 30 seconds get answers to all your questions? <br><br>  The presence of a <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">callback widget</a> on the site is not just a fashion trend, but also a new, yet emerging, format of communication between the consumer and the seller.  The consumer requires minimization of information, and a quick callback provides it.  Statistics among our clients showed an increase in the number of sales, even without changes in business processes.  This is primarily due to the increase in the number of hits. <br><br>  When introducing a customer-oriented approach to the consumer, training and motivation of call center operators, you can increase the profitability of your business even when it seems impossible. <br><br><h5>  <b>Save your time</b> </h5><br><br>  It happened in one online store of children's goods.  His owner initially did not want to put our widget.  She had only one operator (assistant), who did not have time to answer all the callers: the calls were often transferred to the owner herself, which prevented her from developing the business and kept in constant stress.  The liquidity of the business did not allow expanding the staff, so she didn‚Äôt want to increase the number of clients, since they could not cope with the current ones.  The company kept afloat, working just above the payback.  Widget from pozvonim.com director put out of curiosity. <br><br>  As a result, an interesting thing turned out: first, the manager and her assistant no longer had to search for the customer numbers in a variety of sources and dial them manually - <b>this saved</b> an average of about a minute per customer, about 10 minutes per hour and <b>about 80 minutes per worker day</b>  Secondly, after receiving a report on the time of conversations and listening to records, it became clear that the operator speaks a lot of unnecessary information that does not affect the client‚Äôs decision.  More than 10, 20, and sometimes 30 minutes were spent on the conversation, after which the tired client, as a rule, apologized and promised to call back. <br><br>  As a result, after installing the <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">client retention widget</a> : <br><br><ul><li> due to the paid tariff of the call, the talk time with the client was reduced from 10 - 30 minutes to 3, </li><li>  the growth of calls with the same volumes of traffic to the site made it possible to assess potential losses and make clients those who could not get through earlier, </li><li>  the business owner no longer answered calls herself, since the time freed up was sufficient to process all calls by the operator. </li></ul><br><br>  We asked the director to share with us information about how the company's profits had changed over the course of several months, and with her permission, we publish the following schedule: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/51a/878/aa351a878deb41a196326ffff607ba9f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Afterword</b> </h5><br><br>  In pursuit of profit, business owners tend to forget the fact that it is their customers that shape the status, success and attractiveness of the company.  At the same time every day there are new players who will eventually copy all the technical characteristics of your product, improve them and offer them at a lower price.  And only the communication established between you will be difficult to destroy. <br>  Appreciate your customer and he will appreciate you.  Introduce convenient communication tools and communicate with your customers.  Install the feedback widget after spending only 5 minutes, we have a <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">free test period available</a> .  Upon registration, you will receive 1000 rubles as a gift to check the effectiveness. <br>  We wish your business prosperity and conversion growth. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  team pozvonim.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293102/</a></p>
