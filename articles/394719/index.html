To date, about a dozen home automation technologies are available, and a modern smart home integrates all engineering systems, providing control over heating, electricity, air conditioning, security systems and water supply, creating a comfortable environment for humans. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The smart home market is constantly growing and developing.  According to <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/420755/global-smart-homes-market-value/">forecasts of</a> Statista.com, the value of the global smart home market will grow to $ 58 billion. Of this amount, slightly less than $ 10 billion <a href="http://www.statista.com/outlook/282/100/home-entertainment/worldwide">will be the</a> share of the home entertainment market.  As for Russia, in 2016 the Russian market of smart home entertainment systems will be <a href="http://www.statista.com/outlook/282/149/home-entertainment/russia">estimated</a> at $ 16.6 million, which at an average annual growth rate of 43.41% will give $ 70.2 million in 2020. <br><br>  Entertainment multimedia systems have long been part of our lives.  Home theater is a common phenomenon and can be found in almost every apartment.  Other home cinema includes one or more sources of sound and images, a speaker system, a plasma panel, an LCD TV or a projector with a screen. <br><br>  By making the cinema system part of a smart home, you get the opportunity to control all this equipment from a single console or touch pad.  As the latter can easily be a smartphone.  To do this, you just need to install a special <a href="http://www.igeeksblog.com/turn-iphone-into-remote-control-for-smart-tv/">application</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to the integration with the smart home, the user can program certain scenarios, for example, giving the command ‚ÄúWatch a movie‚Äù, the house, the name access to the servos, automatically close the blinds on the windows and dim the lights in the room.  Moreover, the smart home connects a home theater, video surveillance systems, alarms, lighting, temperature and water supply management into a whole.  In this case, the TV will act as a kind of information station. <br><br>  In this regard, <a href="http://gs-group.com/press-center/news/gs-group-predstavit-unikalnoe-reshenie-dlya-umnogo-doma-na-consumer-electronics/%3Fsphrase_id%3D616">Smart TV technology</a> <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/rynok-televizorov-smart-tv-v-rossii-i-mire-2010-2017-gg-2014081902152772">has gained</a> great popularity, which is a popular destination for startups in the field of TV, as it allows to implement many innovative ideas in a new large market.  J'son &amp; Partners Consulting estimates that in 2013, 234 million television sets were sold worldwide, and, according to Strategy Analytics, 76 million of them supported Smart TV. <br><br>  By 2017, the Smart TV park in Russia <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/rynok-televizorov-smart-tv-v-rossii-i-mire-2010-2017-gg-2014081902152772">will reach</a> 29.8 million installed devices, which will be 22% of the total TV fleet.  Also in 2017, 7.2 million Smart TVs will be sold, which is 78% of sales of all ‚Äúflat‚Äù TVs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/017/54d/9ab/01754d9ab219461f979a70ba76e0df3d.png" width="500"><br><br>  <i>Park Smart TV in Russia, according <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/rynok-televizorov-smart-tv-v-rossii-i-mire-2010-2017-gg-2014081902152772">to</a> GfK and J'son &amp; Partners Consulting</i> <br><br>  At the end of last year, it became <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/29/smartthings-and-samsung-team-up-to-make-your-tv-a-smarthome-hub/">known</a> that Samsung intends to turn the entire line of Smart TV 2016 into ‚Äúsmart hubs‚Äù.  Televisions will be created based on the SmartThings platform, which will allow you to control a large number of smart devices, including lamps, locks and thermostats. <br><br>  Thus, customers will be able to use the TV as a controller for a smart home.  You can easily view the status of various sensors, and integration with video surveillance systems will allow you to display the image from the cameras directly to the TV screen, for example, at that moment, if the motion sensor in the yard triggered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5e/41d/519/b5e41d5197c14365b07eb6905aa32853.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Smart TV lineup of 2016 will offer customers new opportunities and will strengthen Samsung‚Äôs leading position in the market as the first company to launch TVs ready for IoT,‚Äù said Hyun Suk Kim, president of Visual Display Business in Samsung Electronics. <br><br>  LG is trying to keep up with its competitor, which confirmed that its webOS platform has also found application in the field of smart home.  The IoTV app on LG Smart TV will be able to manage connected devices in a similar way.  Again, this means that you can adjust the brightness of the lighting or ‚Äútwist‚Äù the temperature of the air conditioner directly from the TV menu. <br><br>  Often a component of a smart home is a multi-room system that allows you to transmit video or audio from a source to several TVs or speakers located in different rooms.  In this case, the devices in the room are combined into a zone and get their own individual set of custom playback options.  The system is controlled using the remote control or touch panels. <br><br>  The system allows you to receive and distribute on-air or satellite TV throughout the premises, as well as distribute other digital data streams throughout the home.  Smart home makes rational use of satellite and cable television, allowing the display of several channels on televisions located in different rooms. <br><br>  If we touch upon the situation that has developed in the audio segment, then DIY multi-rooms, capable of distributing an audio signal via Wi-Fi, have appeared relatively recently.  Such devices are designed to simplify the deployment of intelligent systems.  Today, many eminent manufacturers enter this market - Harman / Kardon, Monster, Bose and LG, as well as Sonos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d8/fbe/1c6/7d8fbe1c6aad4b329da213644ca44066.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  Sonos allows you to build a simple network of audio devices, without using any control equipment at all.  There are three options for combining individual devices into multiroom.  The first is that all the speakers connect to the router and use it as a hub to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with each other.  The second is to connect one audio device with a router using a cable and create a wireless network with a mesh topology. <br><br>  So gadgets will be able to share information with each other, transferring data along the chain.  The third option is similar to the second, but the speaker is not connected to the column, but to a special device that creates a wireless network. <br><br>  An interesting fact is that multi-rooms do not impose special requirements on devices for reproducing both audio and video content.  The only condition is compatibility with the interface over which the signal is transmitted.  Therefore, any plasma panel or audio system that does not have its own ‚Äúsmart‚Äù software can be used as an output device. <br><br>  <i>PS June 10-12, Technopolis GS holds the first <a href="http://gs-smartcode.ru/">competition</a> in Kaliningrad for specialists from various software development areas.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394719/</a></p>
