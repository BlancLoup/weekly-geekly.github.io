Friday post</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/f8c/0cf/4a0f8c0cf65957a062296a4e84e12357.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Modern man is so intimate with technology that, often, simply can not imagine his life without a number of devices.  Here we are talking, first of all, about smartphones.  They replace several gadgets at once, plus they provide communication with the whole world, provide access to entertainment and perform a host of other functions.  This is probably why many people cannot even do without their electronic assistants even at a friendly party.  As a result, we can see friends or colleagues who came to chat in a cafe, but instead of talking, they stumbled upon the screens of their phones. <br><br>  Psychologists say that smartphones are highly addictive.  Someone already just needs to simply turn the smartphone in their hands, periodically looking there.  According to statistics, some smartphone users can unlock the phone screen to view messages, notifications, or no purpose at all several hundred times a day.  What is there to talk about communication.  True, some companies offer a way out of this situation.  We are talking about the so-called "anti-smartphones."  What it is? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several interpretations of the term "anti-smartphone" (or "anti-phone").  In general, here is meant the simplest phone without additional functions (Internet, mms, tracking, etc.).  A person stays in touch, but only - neither the Internet, nor games, there is simply nothing like it.  There are not many similar devices on the market now, but they are there.  This is what we would single out in the first place.

    <h3>  Nophone </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/299/e91/1f7/299e911f7717cbf203c7bec6eaf92ce2.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  This is not a phone at all.  Case NoPhone repeats in size and dimensions of the iPhone case.  But this is where the similarities end.  The fact is that inside NoPhone there is not a single electronic part.  It's just a piece of plastic, designed in the form of a phone in order for a person addicted to a smartphone to more easily give up his habit.  The dimensions of the device are 140 x 67 x 7.3 mm. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/116492386" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The developers have released two models of such devices - the usual and "selfie version" with a mirror on the front panel. <br><br>  Generally speaking, the development of NoPhone began as a joke.  The authors of the idea posted a comic campaign on Kickstarter - and ... the fundraising began.  Yes, even what.  Within days, the campaign was fully funded.  The most interesting is that NoPhone is sold for real, not comic, money, and there are users who buy this product. <br><br>  In Russia, pre-order for NoPhone can be in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/nophone%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dno_smartfon">store Madrobots</a> .  With this "device" nothing will happen, even if you drop it from a height or dive to great depths in water.  Well, yes, and what bad can happen with a piece of plastic?  It can be destroyed, except by throwing it into the fire. <br><br><h3>  Light Phone - a phone in a business card form factor </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f8/297/e44/2f8297e44ea33eaf31d84302af4f40a6.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  There is no longer a piece of plastic, but a real phone that has only basic functions.  No SMS, no internet, nothing like that.  Only hardcore, only calls.  But you do not have to think about how to execute or clean the OS from garbage.  Just because there is no operating system here. <br><br>  And what is there?  A small electronic display, it contains only one line, and only numbers are placed here - no letters.  The buttons on the touch panel.  There is a slot for a SIM card, plus there is also a volume control button.  Oh yes, the only wireless module is GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz. <br><br>  The thickness of the phone is only 4 mm.  The dimensions of the smartphone are 85.6 √ó 54 √ó 4 mm, weight - 38.5 g. Due to its size and minimum functions, the phone works offline for about 20 days.  Here it is just worth taking it to the cafe, it will definitely not distract from entertainment. <br><br><h3>  Round Runcible Anti-Smartphone </h3><br>  This unusual device was first introduced in 2015 at the MWC.  The strange phone attracted the attention of many journalists and ordinary visitors to the exhibition.  The shape of the case at the smartphone - round, he himself looks like a compact from the cosmetic set. <br><br>  But these are only external impressions.  The case is made of wood and metal (in the basic version - plastic).  The configuration is not bad: here we see a Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor with an Adreno 306 graphics chip, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal memory, a 7 MP camera with support for gesture control.  There are wireless communication modules Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/170711272" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The operating system uses Android with BuniOS firmware.  Initially, the developers planned to use Firefox OS, but it did not work out - the operating system was not very successful. <br><br>  The diameter of the screen - 2.5 inches, resolution - 640 * 640 pixels.  Such a smartphone, especially in the hands of not turning it - is not very convenient.  But there are basic functions here, they are much more than all other smartphones. <br><br>  The price of the phone is $ 399 and $ 499 (budget and regular versions, respectively). <br><br><h3>  Antismartphone Elari CardPhone </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMGN9ra97-U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is a domestic anti-smartphone developer - the company Elari.  She first introduced the device, the mass of which is only 42 grams.  Such a device can be used as a full-fledged phone, and as an auxiliary, secondary phone. <br><br>  It is possible to synchronize with "older" smartphones and other types of devices via Bluetooth.  The contact book contains 500 items. <br><br>  Developers advise using the Elari CardPhone when traveling and on business trips.  If the primary phone is discharged, you can use a secondary one that can work offline for a long time. <br><br>  <b>Elari CardPhone Specifications</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Networks: GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz <br>  ‚Ä¢ Display: 1.1 inches <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery: 220 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Talk time: about 3 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Standby time: about 3 days <br>  ‚Ä¢ SIM card: microSIM <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interface: Bluetooth 3.0 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dimensions: 86 x 48 x 5.5 mm <br><br>  In Russia, Elari CardPhone can be bought in the store Madrobots.  And you can buy it in a set with a case for <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/telefon-elari-cardphone-chekhol-dlya-iphone-5-5s/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dno_smartfon">iPhone 5 / 5S</a> and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/telefon-elari-cardphone-chekhol-dlya-iphone-6/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dno_smartfon">iPhone 6</a> .  Thus, in one case there will be two phones at once. <br><br><h3>  Elari NanoPhone </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/914/a95/fe6/914a95fe6603896a8b1aa4ffa33c6d52.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  This is another miniature phone from Elari, the size of which is even smaller than the previous model.  There is a SIM card slot, a Bluetooth wireless communication module and ... everything.  No games, no internet, nothing. <br><br>  There is, however, the ability to download music to the phone, and then listen to it wirelessly, but this does not change things - the phone has only basic functions. <br><br>  As for calls, all GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz networks are supported.  The phone in the case of loss of communication with the main smartphone begins to squeak, warning of the loss.  The battery lasts about 4 days of work. <br><br>  The body is shockproof, it is made of aluminum alloy.  Included - a mini-carbine, strap, adapter for SIM, a needle for working with a card slot. <br><br>  In general, if you are already very dependent on the smartphone, you can try to work with anti-smartphones.  Well, or, at worst, buy a regular dialer and take it to meetings with friends and family, so as not to be distracted by everything else. <br><br><h3>  Antismart MP01 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c50/f41/63a/c50f4163a8f3399814b2702652d22bdb.jpg" alt="image" width="850"><br>  This is a regular mobile phone, which is equipped with only basic functions.  Its design is also very simple - nothing more.  True, here, besides calls, there is also the possibility to send and receive SMS. <br><br>  The device is charged via USB-port, and due to the fact that the display is monochrome and there is nothing superfluous in the phone, the device works offline for a very long time. <br><br>  Sells the device company Punkt.  According to the developers, the idea when creating a device was to save a person from having to constantly charge his device, as well as to ensure that the user is less distracted by various notifications and similar things. <br><br><h3>  As output </h3><br>  In general, this post should not be taken too seriously, yet today is Friday.  Nevertheless, the semantic load is there - after all, indeed, smartphones simply prevent some people from living.  Maybe try to get rid of dependence in such an original way?  It‚Äôs not for nothing that an ordinary piece of plastic collected a lot of money on Kickstarter - it means that someone needs it. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dno_smartfon"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dno_smartfon"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400733/</a></p>
