      In most cases, services deal with a visitor who THINKS that he is able to make his choice, making it based on marketing guidelines and internal myths.  And in most cases it rolls. <br><br>  A bit more complicated this story is arranged with services that are related to the physical world, since real objects usually impose more requirements on the competence of the consumer.  Not always drastically, but still. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  A canonical example of overcoming such incompetence can be considered a Yandex guru, one of the most innovative services of the Market of its time, now almost completely disappeared from it.  The idea with the Guru was very simple - to select a product for the consumer with the necessary characteristics based on the answers to the questions asked in the language of the consumer, and then transformed into a request that would be formulated by a professional. </blockquote><br><br>  In a situation with the automation of the creation of legal documents, the problem of user incompetence becomes critical.  But here it is necessary to make a reservation: <br>  A significant part of the audience of FreshDoc Document Designer is occupied by professionals: lawyers, chief accountants.  They are doing well with competence, for them the system is adequate in the ‚Äúas is‚Äù mode.  BUT!  There is another audience for whom our project is in many ways a panacea, but which sometimes find it difficult to work with it. <br><br>  It would seem that, in theory, we are optimal in order to give the amateur the opportunity to make an agreement for themselves on their own, without involving a lawyer, and the procedure itself usually does not raise big questions.  But at the same time the path to the required contract template can be very difficult.  At best, you need a highly specialized contract with a name that is known to the consumer.  Any loan agreement.  In this case, he knows exactly what he wants, as it is called, not only in everyday language, but also in legal language. <br>  Everything gets worse when the consumer understands that he, in principle, needs to be legalized through a contract, but does not understand how to formulate it.  This is the story when, in order to ask the right question, you already need to know half the answer.  But he does not know.  Neither half nor quarter. <br><br>  It is clear that in most cases this problem can be solved by asking leading questions in everyday language.  If you can integrate the interactive bot into the sales funnel, which will allow you to narrow down the request to one document - great, this is a good solution.  And very fashionable.  But if we return to the truth of life, we will see that we run into the problem of a narrow entrance.  I'll show you now. <br>  99% of people coming from search engines (and these are the most delicious consumers - with hot demand) expect after the click to see in front of them a specific answer to their request, and not a form with additional questions.  Pound on the form - double the failure.  Further worse - the input field can mean anything, including search.  A person thinks that tricky optimization has led him to a secondary search engine, which is quite a common method of search spam and falling off.  So you need to explain.  I hope it is not necessary to say that most people do not read texts, that is, this is also a road to a dead end. <br><br><blockquote>  Actually there are two potential solutions: to jerk up the consumer‚Äôs competence at the expense of an easily digestible format (almost like yogurt, only more useful) or to draw it into communication and start asking the necessary everyday questions in the course of the play. </blockquote><br><br>  In general, both ways are relatively clear: <br>  In the first case, we are helped by infographics and binary comparisons such as ‚ÄúDo not know what to choose, the contract of sale or delivery contract?  Here's a comparative tablet, understand. ‚Äù <br>  In the second case, we come up with a step-by-step scenario in which the setup starts already after some time or effort was invested in the work with the document. <br><br>  As a bonus to the first scheme, we get content that works with indirect questions like ‚Äúcomparison of contracts‚Äù, to the second one you can get very cool interface solutions that will distinguish you from others visually. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301880/</a></p>
