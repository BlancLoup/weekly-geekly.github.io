And it began, as everyone guessed, in the west.  When the cost of a mobile phone dropped from transcendental heights (mid-90s), mobile electronics manufacturers began to look for new markets.  But a new market in the form of monitoring of transport did not appear immediately, since  The accuracy of determining the coordinates was important for monitoring.  Namely, determining the location of a position with a minimum error for civilian purposes was impossible, because initially GPS was developed as a purely military project for accurate guidance of missiles at stationary, and then at mobile objects in the air and on the ground.  And only in 2000.  deception of accuracy was canceled by decree of US President Bill Clinton.  It is exactly 2000 that can be considered the starting point in the development of transport monitoring.

A little later, these devices began to be delivered to Russia.  The second problem that has got in the way of large-scale use of transport monitoring is the coverage area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGPRS networks.  That is why the first car terminals transmitted coordinates in SMS messages.  And in software, the dispatcher could observe a ‚Äúpoint on the map,‚Äù which indicated the location of the car. <br>  But since then, a lot of time has passed, and transport monitoring systems in the Russian Federation and in the West have stepped far forward, choosing their own development paths.  Maybe in something even copying each other.  Let's take a closer look at these markets now.  The depth of penetration in the markets of the Russian Federation and the West, we will compare the presence of commercial services in these two markets. <br><br><h2>  Key players </h2><br>  Commercial services are developed by a large number of companies.  How popular these companies are can be judged indirectly by the number of vehicles connected to their software platform.  In the West, <b>Octo Telematics</b> recently announced their data in the news feed, <a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/2014/10/10/octo-telematics-achieve-three-million-customer-milestone/53759/">announcing</a> about 3,000,000 connected subscribers, and <b>TomTom Telematics</b> about <a href="http://business.tomtom.com/en_us/press/releases/2014-07-24">400,000</a> .  Also notable players in the Western market are MiX Telematics, DigiCore, Navman Wireless, Omnitracs, Teletrac, Telogis, Trimble, Webtech Wireless, Altea, ATX Group, Connexis, Eurowatch, Verizon Telematics, WirelessCar, Trafficmaster, Masternaut, Garmin, CIS numbers with so far no one has boasted with six zeros, but there is a company with a clear leadership position, for example <b>Gurtam</b> with <a href="http://blog.gurtam.com/2014/07/cifry-ne-vrut-gurtam-the-best/">500,000</a> connected vehicles.  Recently, <b>SpaceTeam</b> announced 40,000 users connected to the telematics platform.  Also the most notable players in the Russian market are Technocom (Autograph trademark), APKKOM, Galileo, Scout, Omnicomm, SantelNavigatsiya, Fort Telecom, Sibsvyaz, Antor, STATT, Advantum, Escort, Incotex, Shtrikh, Atol, CSBI, ENDS.  And now let's go directly to commercial services.  In order not to get lost in a wide variety of monitoring services, let's divide them conditionally into systems that are equipped ‚Äúoff the assembly line‚Äù, or as they say in the west, OEM, and the secondary market (Aftermarket).  We also highlight the direction of M2M services for private vehicles and monitoring of commercial vehicles. <br><br><h2>  eCall vs ERA Glonass </h2><br>  Emergency response systems in case of accidents are designed to promptly inform emergency services about traffic accidents.  The essence of the projects lies in the M2M-modules, which are installed in automotive systems on the conveyor and allow to determine the exact coordinates in case of an accident and, if necessary, to send this information via cellular communication channels to the rescue service.  Currently, pilot projects are being implemented as part of the <b>HeERO</b> initiative (Harmonized eCall European Pilot Project - project harmonization of the European eCall project), in <a href="http://vestnik-glonass.ru/stati/mezhdunarodnye_aspekty_razvitiya_proekta_era_glonass/">eight EU countries</a> worth 10 million Euros: the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden .  3.5-4 billion rubles has already been spent on the Russian GLONASS ERA, but the list of regions where the system can be seen in action has not yet been announced. <br><br>  Equipment of vehicles with eCall and ERA GLONASS systems is supposed to be initially on the conveyor.  In the west, many automakers have already launched the production of cars with eCall support: BMW, Mercedes-Benz, PSA Peugeot Citro√´n, Volvo Cars.  In Russia, the conveyor did not get it, but the media has already reported that the Lada Vesta will be completed with the ERA GLONASS system.  Also, the ERA GLONASS system became interested in MAN. <br><br>  But it‚Äôs probably not entirely correct to call emergency response systems as commercial services, so Western automakers began to offer their additional services, which received the general name "Connected Car".  Connected car "Connected Car" can be attributed to M2M services for private vehicles. <br><br><h2>  Connected car </h2><br>  I thought for a long time what kind of additional M2M service Russian automakers are currently offering, but I could not find the name.  In this direction, there is a lag, which is unknown when and by whom it fills.  But the lack of M2M services "from the automaker" can solve the secondary market. <br><br>  In the West, a radically different picture: on the contrary, it is difficult to find a car maker who would not start cooperating with an IT company to create joint M2M solutions.  And there are plenty of examples. <br><br>  Volkswagen Car-Net telematics services demo video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/K71lWqorMLk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgko-5DA7IiQcdn02K0ACBoeXWIZA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Audi Connect telematics service and video instruction: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAOYQz1e3Ns%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhicQu9WeJyX000OKQxh1WLXIWiFHg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Toyota T-Connect telematics services: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9hvK1znSTo&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhNs56zsIcqLoZxlaWRr38fNvl4Eg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Volvo On Call telematics service): <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WoNjM0DPRiA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjNKGJnej8Apxkl8LgILBVQrwmUDA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Those who watched the videos surely understood the possibilities that M2M can provide in-car service.  If you believe analysts' forecasts (for the Western market), then we can assume that "not connected cars" may soon not be left at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce6/500/1df/ce65001dfc14ede0d5d675fd0fa4ab4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, enough has been written about the private car market segment to assess the overall situation.  Well, next time I will tell you how M2M services are developed for commercial and freight transport, and I will share my observations on the services that are offered in the secondary market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241109/</a></p>
