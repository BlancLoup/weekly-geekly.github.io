      Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) <br><br>  Pinterest has always been a platform for sharing, discovering and sharing new ideas.  And now it is also becoming an influential advertising platform for managing marketing activities based on the concept of opening an idea. <br><br>  Using the ten tips below, you can work with ads on Pinterest like a true professional. <br><br><h4>  <b>1. Use only one pin for one position advertising campaign.</b> </h4><br>  A / B testing for pins is required.  The main reason for this is that such testing will allow you to choose the most effective pin, well, it will be effective if it is one, but multiple promoted pins will take the lion's share of attention, and the buyer will not be able to concentrate on the main an idea. <br><br>  Note also that Pinterest determines the optimal results according to the number of clicks per pin, and not the conversion goals (although it can track conversions). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/847/58f/dc484758f6424c21be90cdd746f4c1f7.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>2. Groups of advertising campaigns by keywords and topics.</b> </h4><br>  When building your campaign on Pinterest, talk about each company as a separate category containing a common theme and relevant keywords.  For example, a health food counseling service may include such topics as gluten-free foods, veganism, paleo diets, and low-carb diets. <br><br>  Work with your rating on Pinterest (if you have one) or a representative to determine which topics have the highest monthly volume of search queries, in order to give priority to advertising companies for these categories in the future. <br><br><h4>  <b>3. Remember that creativity and creativity are more powerful levers than keywords.</b> </h4><br>  Given the apparent similarity of Pinterest with a digital channel, such as SEM (Search Engine Marketing), a deep analysis of keywords may seem very tempting.  Although it is worth focusing on keywords, you should remember that the pin itself, its meaning and image carry much more than the keywords themselves. <br><br>  This is the cause of the search algorithm on Pinterest, because most search queries on Pinterest are exploratory in nature and focus on the visual side. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Learn how the keyword selection algorithm works.</b> </h4><br>  Pinterest makes every effort to ensure that the pins exactly match the requirements and keywords, but requests can be very widely interpreted and this point should be taken into account when choosing keywords. <br><br>  Use keyword-related suggestions from the Ads Manager, as well as add keywords to Pinterest.  The optimal number of keywords for an advertising company in one position is 30-40 pieces. <br><br><h4>  <b>5. Use the vertical image format in your pins.</b> </h4><br>  In other words, pins that are elongated rather than wide (i.e. occupy the entire screen) are very well perceived by the eye.  The reason is that they physically occupy a lot of screen space when searching, and thus the chance of being noticed above them. <br><br>  This is especially true for mobile devices, where a single pin that is vertically oriented may even require the user to scroll down to view it fully, and this will increase the time spent on it and may lead to greater user immersion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/548/074/fcc/548074fcc41a4112b3c2a04fa2d5a48c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>6. Repurpose the best pins that already exist for your advertising purposes.</b> </h4><br>  The most promoted pins are those that are able to attract attention to themselves.  Promoting a pin is like taking the first step towards achieving a goal, but the real effectiveness comes from the activity and viability of your pins. <br><br>  When launching an advertising campaign, use Pinterest Analytics to find existing pins with the most clicks, reposts and likes.  For inspiration, we recommend that you look at the board of the most popular pins (Pinterest's Great Promoted Pins board). <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Leverage on the interests of the target categories.</b> </h4><br>  Target category interests are now available on Pinterest.  At present, Pinterest offers more than 420 different purposes, such as travel, weddings, men's / women's fashion clothing, as well as other categories for personal interests. <br><br>  The best use of targeted interests is to use them in addition to keywords as part of targeted advertising campaigns based on user behavior and user requests. <br><br><h4>  <b>8. Divide budgets into advertising campaigns for the mobile application and for the desktop computer.</b> </h4><br>  Marketers know that the behavior of users of mobile devices can vary greatly, and this also applies to Pinterest.  One of the main advantages for allocating ad placements is that you can manage costs separately, since the mobile app will have lower CPCs. <br><br>  Allow budgets set up for mobile devices and desktops to exist independently of each other, so that you can get the maximum economic benefit. <br><br><h4>  <b>9. Consider more superficial conversion metrics.</b> </h4><br>  Although Pinterest can certainly manage multi-level conversions, in addition to this, you can also consider more superficial conversion metrics.  You may find that Pinterest is incredibly efficient at pushing users to register via email, but not making a purchase.  Tracking surface conversions allows you to determine the true benefits of using Pinterest. <br><br>  Tip: Use the ‚Äúclosed type‚Äù pages for Pinterest, requiring a subscription to a newsletter / registration in the event that a user comes to your site. <br><br><h4>  <b>10. Retargeting Pinterest</b> </h4><br>  If you are working with the Pinterest Marketing API Partner, then retargeting is available in a selection of advertising platforms.  You can access retargeting by posting conversion tags with Pinterest on your website, as well as by uploading a CRM list to the API. <br><br>  Subscribe to our blog, then there will be a lot of interesting things. <br>  By the way, we are doing logistics for online stores here, if anything, maybe someone needs it? <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  ( <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> - turn your online store into a computer game) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301968/</a></p>
