At this point, most go to the stock exchange.  The choice of exchanges is huge.  In the CIS: fl.ru, weblancer and others.  But when you get to the point you begin to understand how everything is in decline.  The only place where more or less normal orders are found can be called fl.ru and one or two more exchanges.  But on fl.ru you need a pro account, because it turns out that in order to take an order you need to pay the exchange, and it‚Äôs far from a fact that something shines for you.  Therefore, it was decided to go to Upwork. <a name="habracut"></a>  Here orders are more, their cost is higher, customers are technically savvy.  You will have to pay, too, and no less, but you pay a percentage of the project. <br><br>  So, let's begin. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

    <h2>  Fill out the profile </h2><br>  First you need to fill in the profile, because with empty nobody will take you.  The system itself gives hints, but it is much better to see once than to hear a hundred times. <br><br><ol><li><h3>  Niche selection, hourly rate, skills </h3><br>  I think most have already chosen a niche.  It is unlikely that someone without experience will go to freelancing. <br>  Specify the name, under it in the field enter your niche.  It is important not to heap this field.  Specify hourly rate.  It is very difficult to assess your abilities, especially if this is the first work experience, but you cannot greatly underestimate your price.  For example, Junior Android Developer can count on 10-12 USD, Middle 20 - 25 USD, Senior 30 - 50+ USD.  Specify skills (Upwork has a lot of them).  It is advisable to specify all ten, according to him the employer will search for freelancers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/570/236/bc1/570236bc1f1c4c6c951f23eda0e283ca.png" alt="image"><br></li><li><h3>  Video </h3><br>  You can make a short video about yourself or your projects and publish it. <br></li><li><h3>  Overview </h3><br>  Write a short story about yourself, do not stretch too much, otherwise the employer will just be too lazy to read.  If you do not know what and how to write - see what the top freelancers write in your niche. <br></li><li><h3>  Portfolio </h3><br>  Completing a portfolio is worth paying a lot of attention.  Add an interesting description of your work.  Make pictures that catch the eye and shape them properly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/72d/409/8fe/72d4098fe74f4003a3ed7e5077aa3b18.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When a portfolio has pictures it catches the eye, and their design makes you look at them even more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d25/192/445/d251924452984a8ebfc10c2796f9501f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fa4/a1a/279/fa4a1a2798084d5e94ddadda414a10fc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Before you are two absolutely identical pictures but differently decorated.  Which one to choose?  By the way, you can add to the portfolio a project that was done on upwork. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/748/ac0/764/748ac07649cd458f976f41d9670f7352.png" alt="image"><br></li><li><h3>  Certificates </h3><br>  If you have a certificate then this is fine, it can help you a lot (especially at the beginning), so you should add it.  If there are no certificates, then nothing terrible is possible without them. <br></li><li><h3>  Tests </h3><br>  There are many tests on upwork, but you shouldn't dwell on it.  Sometimes there are questions on long-obsolete topics, and this test cannot show true knowledge at all.  But it is worth a couple of passes, but whatever the need is for the Upwork Readiness Test.  After all, if you do not have a certificate like mine, then this is a great way to fill out a profile at 100%. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e7d/396/a6b/e7d396a6b37e41efbceb8dc462ab9a55.png" alt="image"><br></li><li><h3>  Other fields </h3><br>  With the filling of the remaining fields, everything is clear <br></li></ol><br><h2>  We are looking for the first order </h2><br>  Find the best order for yourself.  First you need to look for projects up to 200 bucks, for large orders without reviews you will not be taken.  Do not underestimate the rate, call the real price, sometimes you can specify the price above the budget, so you will attract attention, but this is an extreme case.  Do not drop bids for everything. <br><br>  You should also understand that a crowd of Hindus come running to easy projects, and you are a novice without feedback, just get lost in this crowd.  You may have a smart portfolio, but you need to be interested in looking there, since you do not have any feedback you should ‚Äútake‚Äù with your cover letter.  How to write them is a separate story.  I will only highlight what you need to write unique letters in which you will show how you will solve the problem that arose at the customer.  You should not look at projects published more than 2-3 days ago - most likely they were just scored. <br><br>  <i>Interesting fact: the more skills in the project will coincide with yours - the higher you will be shown in the list of freelancers.</i> <br><br>  The first orders are the hardest to continue.  For example, while I received the first order I spent half the connections (15 applications), and only one person allowed me to be interviewed, and later hired and left a review for five stars.  I took the second order leaving 5 applications and 2 people allowed me to interview, I hired one, and my abilities did not suit the second project, but the customer said that he would soon have a project and I would go for it. <br><br><h2>  Rising talent </h2><br>  Cool bun from upwork for beginner freelancers.  With its help, you will often flicker at the customer as a priority executor, therefore receive more orders.  Also get a profile icon that will highlight you. <br><br><h3>  How to get? </h3><br><ul><li>  Make orders quickly and efficiently. </li><li>  Fill profile 100%. </li><li>  Update profile regularly (add work to portfolio, rewrite Overview, etc.). </li><li>  Respond to received job invitations within 24 hours. </li></ul><br>  In general, be an exemplary freelancer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b8/c94/b63/3b8c94b638084a64ad6b8cbe245ec9fe.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Top rated </h3><br>  This is a new stage when you have a Job Success Score, you can go into this caste.  To do this, you need to keep the rate above 90% 16 weeks and earn the first thousand.  See <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/290844/">here for</a> more details. <br><br>  Well, it's time to finish.  Good luck with your work. <br><br>  The next part is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/337200/">https://habrahabr.ru/post/337200/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337136/</a></p>
