  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Good skull</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You know, sometimes you really want recklessness.  For example, take and burn all the skulls on the board at once, turning the usual signs of death into trump "+5".  Or even more crazy to do: once, and declare Puzzle Quest as the best casual game of 2007.  And do not care that the yard is only October and still may change. <br>  The trouble, however, is that the price for recklessness is sometimes too high.  So, your rival can use the trump skulls, literally two kicks driving your hero to the grave.  As for the game of the year ... <br>  No, I'm not afraid that before January something better will be released Puzzle Quest.  Just the Puzzle Quest itself, with all its casual nature, is wrapped in an overly intellectual shell.  Simple secretaries may not like it ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Stand in a row</strong> <br>  Is it worth mentioning that the word ‚ÄúWarlords‚Äù in the name of the game is not without reason, and even ‚Äúregistred‚Äù and ‚Äútrademarks‚Äù?  Probably worth it - but only in the context of the fact that the famous strategic series Puzzle Quest refers only to the geography of the game world, the names of the characters and the nomenclature of magical creatures.  From the point of view of the gameplay, there is nothing in common between the novelty and the hits of the past years. <br>  Although the essence of Puzzle Quest is extremely simple, there are so many interesting possibilities around it that it‚Äôs not so easy to decide where to start the story about the game.  However, let's start with the essence. <br>  You may have ever met with the game Bejeweled or its counterparts.  This casual project is very popular, it has spread across all gaming and near-game platforms: PCs, consoles, cell phones, PDAs.  Its principles are uncomplicated: there is a certain rectangular field littered with figures of a different type.  There are few types of figures - 5-7.  The goal of a gamer is to swap adjacent figurines vertically or horizontally to form chains of 3-5 identical figures.  These chains disappear, points are added to the gamer, upper figures fall down to the vacant place, the general lack of figures is compensated by spilling from above. <br>  So, in general terms, looks Bejeweled and clones.  But not Puzzle Quest.

      <strong>Life in chains</strong> <br>  To begin with, moving the figures on the 8x8 field with their alignment in chains is only one, albeit the main, element of the game.  It symbolizes the fight.  Or the capture of the enemy.  Or the invention of a new spell.  But most often - just a fight. <br>  A fight, as you know, is unthinkable without an opponent.  Thus, the movement of the figures on the 8x8 board is engaged not only by the player, but also by his opponent - by turns ... The meaning of these manipulations in Puzzle Quest is as follows ... <br>  The 4 colors of the rounds on the board are 4 colors of mana, which is necessary for spells.  Chains of roundels, which are made up by players and which are removed from the board, add this mana to them in the ‚Äúbins‚Äù. <br>  In addition to mana, the figures on the board are: money icons - add money to the treasury, purple stars - add points of "experience" to the hero.  Finally, there are skull icons on the board.  Gathering the will of the player in the chain, the skull directly cause damage to his opponent. <br>  Both opponents have a certain amount of life points.  The higher the level of the heroes or the enemy - the more his "life".  It `s naturally.  As soon as the ‚Äúlife‚Äù points (using skull chains and spells) decrease to zero, the game ends with the victory of the surviving fighter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ed8/9a7/6d6/ed89a76d66c3f223bef7ec35a3b4005a.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>The world around</strong> <br>  Everything is wrapped around this base.  Heroes of several classes, each with its own strategy of victory and preferences in spells.  Role system, taking into account the growth characteristics, the presence of the hero trophies, the quality of memorized spells and the presence of friends and companions - all this wealth on the battlefield translates into numerous modifiers, bonuses, additional manipulation of figures ... <br>  In addition, we must not forget about the plot, which is very well superimposed on the kingdom map in the form of cities, castles, abandoned ruins, caves and other secret crypts.  The matter from which the plot is woven are quests, most of which involve one or a whole series of battles with various enemies. <br>  A variety of opponents in Puzzle Quest pleasantly pleased: rats, wolves, orcs, wizards, knights - each of them has their own fighting style, their favorite techniques and skills.  Find the key to each of them, oh, how not easy. <br>  Fortunately, Puzzle Quest, as befits a casual game, is extremely gracious to the defeated, giving them a second, third gratuitously ... but at least a hundredth chance. <br><br>  <strong>Casual vs spite</strong> <br>  The Internet community has already managed to evaluate Puzzle Quest, since the game is small in size and is distributed on the principle of shareware.  Enthusiastic responses ‚Äúspent three days without stopping‚Äù, ‚Äúturned on, went out, I looked - 5 hours had passed‚Äù and ‚Äúplayed all night long‚Äù are heard on one forum, then on another. <br>  This, of course, can not but rejoice - like any appearance of the next high-quality and interesting game. <br>  Confused another. <br>  The game is positioned as casual.  However, enthusiastic responses are heard until from well-formed gamers, who can not be suspected of casualness.  And even the information on the furious success of Puzzle Quest on consoles and pocket platforms does not dispel this confusion until the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/048/306/a40/048306a4035fcfabf7769802f5999d10.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <u><strong>Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords</strong></u> <br>  <strong>Genre</strong> puzzle with role-playing game elements <br>  <a href="http://www.valusoft.com/">D3Publisher</a> <strong>Publisher</strong> <br>  <strong>Publisher in Russia</strong> <a href="http://www.nd.ru/">New Disc</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.infinite-interactive.com/">Infinite Interactive</a> <strong>Developer</strong> <br>  Pentium III-1000 +, 256+ MB, 3D required <br>  C2D-4300 +, 2048+ Mb, GF 8600GT + <strong>recommended</strong> <br>  PC <strong>platform</strong> , Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Wii, cell phones <br>  <strong>Multiplayer</strong> LAN, I-net <br>  <strong>The complexity of</strong> the elements of chance <br>  <strong>Knowledge of English is</strong> desirable </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15745/</a></p>
