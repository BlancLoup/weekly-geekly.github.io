  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Understanding the jungle of programming, or why was Mowgli friends with Python?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the work of Rudyard Kipling ‚ÄúThe Book of the Jungle‚Äù, the python Kaa personified not only strength, but also wisdom.  Mowgli quickly realized that it‚Äôs better to take such a character as an ally - and in the tropical jungle you will not be lost, and thanks to his advice you will at least make you look like a person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The modern information world is the same jungle.  Databases, sky high, computer networks hanging from them, alyapisty dynamic websites, wild competitors who are ready to eat you alive.  And yes, Python is one of the few programming languages, a friendship with which will make you king of the IT jungle.  Studying it at the Junior level is not so difficult, but what if you want more?  If you want to easily navigate in various libraries, to be able to solve complex problems with Python, in the end, write a serious project in Python, which then will not be ashamed to show the employer at the interview?  For those who want new heights, we have found a personal Kaa - the <a href="http://otus.ru/lessons%3Fcourse%3D3%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Daffilate%26utm_campaign%3Dkaa">teacher of the serious study course Python</a> will share wisdom and knowledge with students of the new group for 5 months, check homework, give fitbacks, guide and support, talk about the intricacies of the language, so that The student could easily navigate the middle of senior programming in the wilds of the specialist, had project support skills and, if successful, had real employment opportunities for major IT companies (they  ntiruyut best students of the course interview). <br><br>  Why did we choose Python for the new course?  There are a number of reasons for this. <br><br>  <b>Python is very strong</b>

      The average lifespan of a royal python is 20-30 years.  Python has already lived 26 and feels great.  All this time he did not lay soulless somewhere in the sun, he grew, developed, penetrated into all sorts of spheres of the IT world and not only.  During this time, he acquired a very cool framework - Django, which is among the six most popular versions of <a href="https://hotframeworks.com/">Hotframeworks.com</a> . <br><br>  Today, Python is seriously competing with MATLAB, Scilab and GNU Octave in the field of mathematical computing and big data thanks to powerful libraries and modules.  Data Science is generally the most current direction for this language today. <br><br>  In games, especially online games, Python is also extremely good for bundling large streams of information, graphics, and hardware.  Game projects such as Battlefield, EVE Online, Mount &amp; Blade, Sims 4, Civilization IV use Python for various needs, from server controls to internal game logic. <br><br>  Python allows you to create functional and dynamic code, write web and desktop applications, databases, parallel computing, networks, servers.  Seriously - there are no impossible tasks for Python, there are only those where it is not very suitable.  They say pythons are not very fast. <br><br>  <b>Python has a bunch of friends</b> <br><br>  Python has a lot of fans among programmers, and according to some <a href="http://blog.codeeval.com/codeevalblog/2016/2/2/most-popular-coding-languages-of-2016">ratings</a> , this is generally the most ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù programming language in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8aa/33b/5b9/8aa33b5b9a51472598e7821053c8a2cf.png"><br><br>  In large and rich companies, python is also loved.  Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Yahoo, NASA, IBM, Mozilla and many others use it in their products.  It‚Äôs much easier to list large IT companies where, for some reason, Python is being bypassed. <br><br>  In general, it is very difficult to imagine modern life without a python.  Whether you watch videos on YouTube, or play World of Tanks, or collectively write code using Mercurial, while pumping something parallel to BitTorrent - everywhere Python. <br><br>  <b>With python you will not be lost</b> <br><br>  Developers with knowledge of Python are becoming an increasingly prominent force in the labor market.  Competition in the profession is serious, but not unlimited, while the demand for such specialists is consistently high.  Just look at the statistics of the portal Indeed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/43e/071/c07/43e071c073694294823c62f29786a2fb.png"><br><br>  By the way, about the same demand for professionals with knowledge of Javascript and only 0.4 percent more from Java.  Statistics on demand within Russia, we have already identified in one of our previous texts.  In short: it is not huge, but noticeable.  According to <a href="http://www.trud.com/">trud.com</a> , in Russia, programmers <a href="http://russia.trud.com/%3Fq%3Dpython">with knowledge of Python</a> need more than developers for iOS and Android combined. <br><br>  <b>Friendship with python is beneficial to all</b> <br><br>  Not only is there a steady demand for Python experts in the labor market, but also the average wage level is surely among the top five in the entire IT area according to the version of the same portal, <a href="http://www.trud.com/">trud.com</a> .  Take a look at the sample throughout Russia: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dcc/947/067/dcc94706774e4f09a647ec1ef192c962.png"><br><br>  The age requirements are extremely liberal - the bulk of vacancies cover people from 22 to 45 years old and work experience of less than 3 years.  True, the level of minimum knowledge that is required even for a junior position is a decent one. You will not be able to get off with superficial knowledge of the language and the Django framework. <br><br>  PS In the ‚ÄúBook of the Jungle‚Äù, the wise Kaa gave young Mowgli advice about life by projecting them into the laws of the jungle.  In the real world you don‚Äôt need to listen to snakes.  It is much better to grab Python by the tail and, swinging it, rush along the jungle of programming towards the new career heights.  And Python won't bite you for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330824/</a></p>
