This is an attempt to create the first in Russia social network dedicated to flash games.  The collection is replenished with portal users;  the place of the game in the general list is determined by the interest of visitors to it. <br><br>  The goal of Bukakusy is to collect all the best flash games in one place.  A beta version is currently working - complex functions such as rating of participants are still under development, but you can already play and add your games. <br>  In the future, the hottest new items and the most popular toys among users will hang at the top of the igrosepka;  the rest of the games are searched for by tags.

      Now on Bukakus there is a <a href="http://onair.bukakusa.ru/2007/08/27/konkurs-playstation-3-ishhet-xozyaina/">competition for the best author's game</a> .  Surely because next to us there are geniuses of flash games who have nowhere to use inspiration.  But you cannot be full of glory.  The author of the best igruhi will receive a prize - Playstation 3. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>What is on Bukakus:</strong> <br><br>  Moneybox for toys.  The games that users post are available on the personal profile page and in the general collection. <br>  Blog: the <a href="http://onair.bukakusa.ru/">main game blog</a> , where we write about everything related to the theme of games and gambling.  It created a <a href="http://onair.bukakusa.ru/2007/08/27/kniga-bagov-i-predlozhenij/">separate post</a> where you need to write about the bugs found.  He also works as a book of complaints and suggestions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b79/cd2/79c/b79cd279c5ee8e8dff6a8d6fffd98cfc.png" width="150" height="147" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>What is still in development, but will soon work:</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Rating of participants.  It consists of the number of added games and their popularity.  For author's toys, the rating grows more than for borrowed ones - of course, if they still like at least someone other than the author himself. </li><li>  Rating toys.  Games can be put pros and cons, so that good games hang out at the top of the list, and unworthy ones are thrown into hell. </li><li>  Search by tags.  Search by genre, topic and association. </li><li>  The function is love-not love.  Games that the user notes as loved ones will be included in his personal list - so that you do not have to search every time. </li><li>  The ability to add your favorite game to your blog or post on the site. </li><li>  We will open the main blog and anyone can write about what he cares about in the world of games. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>How we did it (Lyrical digression, not obligatory to read):</strong> <br><br>  The idea came by itself.  Tired of walking on three thousand different links to games.  I wanted everything to be in one place, free of charge, simply, without intrusive advertising, and so that games could be searched for topics, and so on - a two-line scheme used in flash games.  To be honest, we generally like short games more than long games, because they do not delay.  Well, yes, this is not WoW, but they do not oblige to anything: there is nothing to take half an hour to do - shoot the newcomers, amuse themselves and forget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/933/c3e/c1b/933c3ec1b71854bf872031c146126b98.jpg" width="450" height="189" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br>  After long and painful reflections, we decided to write our own engine, and not use the finished one (still in doubt).  It was in April, in parallel, two of us wrote a diploma (by Bukakus, by the way) and defended themselves, so the process was delayed.  And for a long, long time, a <a href="http://bukakusa.ru/">stub</a> hung on a <a href="http://bukakusa.ru/">bukakusa.ru</a> : there will be games, Trinidad‚Äôs national team will lose, write letters!  After the launch, the Bukakus stubs were written in a wonderful blog - blog.geeknews.ru - thanks to its author, he was the first to notice us and wrote something about us (we want to successfully launch <a href="http://geeknews.ru/">GikNews</a> ).  After that, the attendance of the stub increased from 5 people per day (of which three are authors, hahaha) to 10. Of these, 1-2 left emails.  Now we hope that all of them will come to us to play. <br><br>  Then, by himself, in conversation, the slogan ‚ÄúMake Fun Not Work‚Äù was invented - not as a slogan, but as a reminder to ourselves, so as not to bother too much;  but we decided that Bukakus was quite fit.  Then they called a friendly illustrator.  So on Bukakus there were pictures: brain slugs, a yeti with a cudgel, a wolf from the memorable game "Electronics", a digger, a captain Comic and other celebrities.  It was believed that those people who are now addicted to flash games do not remember all this gray-haired antiquity - but we decided not to bother with this.  We ourselves remember, and it is too early to record us as an old fart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/492/9d6/888/4929d688830526902179029442af5acd.png" width="150" height="130" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br>  Launched a <a href="http://onair.bukakusa.ru/2007/08/27/konkurs-playstation-3-ishhet-xozyaina/">competition for copyright games</a> - in order of intelligence.  At first it was planned to launch the site only with a contest.  But we decided that it would be dishonest in relation to the average visitor, who cannot write games himself.  So they completed the engine and launched the "playing beta". <br><br>  Now on <a href="http://bukakusa.ru/">bukakuse we</a> treat glitches, we add games, we complete functions, we wait for visitors and constructive offers. <br><br>  via <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/bepunk/" class="user_link">bepunk</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13665/</a></p>
