Of the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.  Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/2010/05/04/digest-2010-april/">April</a> , <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/2010/07/02/digest-2010-june-may/">May-June</a> , <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/2010/08/13/digest-2010-july/">July</a> , <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/2010/09/13/digest-2010-august/">August</a> . <br><br><img title="Review of fresh materials, September 2010" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/861/f22/299/861f22299808e284575d3ce60059e424.jpg" width="550" height="150"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Methods and practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/09/dancing-with-the-cards-quick-and-dirty-analysis-of-card-sorting-data.php">Dancing with the Cards - Quick-and-Dirty Analysis of Card-Sorting Data</a></strong> <br>  Shanshan Ma talks about an interesting technique when using card sorting - using a convenient and intuitive matrix, it allows you to sort and group related options.  Besides the fact that it is a useful tool in the work, the final result is also excellent for presenting to clients.

These steps allow you to turn a simple information block into selling and luring customers. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/09/three-reasons-why-persuasive-design-isnt-enough-to-influence-change.php">Three Reasons Why Persuasive Design Isn't Enough to Influence Change</a></strong> <br>  Collen Jones article on the limitations of "persuasive design" - a practice that has become particularly relevant in the last few years.  She cites three reasons why this approach is not yet fully mature and requires a deeper study. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/09/recruiting-participants-for-unmoderated-remote-user-research.php">Remote User Research</a></strong> <br>  Jim Ross from Electronic Ink Philadelphia provides a series of tips on how to select respondents for remote unmoderated usability testing.

He talks about the reasons why this trick works, and gives some examples from practice. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://kathstraub.posterous.com/that-phd-whats-it-worth-to-ya-in-ux-at-least">ROIs on PhDs - How much are the trailing letters worth to you?</a></strong> <br>  Kath Straub is trying to figure out whether the effort involved in obtaining a doctoral degree for usability specialists is worth it.  She explores two main reasons - increasing prestige in the professional community and high salaries. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://sixrevisions.com/usabilityaccessibility/improve-site-usability-by-studying-museums/">Improve Site Usability by Studying Museums</a></strong> <br>  Alexander Dawson has collected an excellent collection of examples from museum practice that are well applicable when building interfaces.
