The situation was similar with mobile phones, when they, and then smart phones, almost completely eradicated stationary phones, leaving only the sector of corporate clients.  The development of mobile computers occurred mainly depending on the release of new versions of Android or iOS.  Microsoft didn‚Äôt want to put up with it and at the end of 2012 rolled out its own Microsoft Surface tablet to the market.  At the same time, a new operating system for tablets based on ARM processors - Windows RT was introduced.  Naturally, the main manufacturers presented their devices on the new OS.  One of them was ASUS, releasing the tablet Vivo Tab RT.  Exactly this review will be devoted to him. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/446/48a/974/44648a974f93a897b6720b1e21d3f82a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, ASUS Vivo Tab RT is a small line of tablets, distinguished by the presence or absence of 3G and LTE.  Also, the tablets come with or without a keyboard dock module.  To be precise, I got a review of the version of ASUS Vivo Tab RT TF600TG + 3G 64Gb, which has a built-in 3G module, but does not have a docking station. <br><br>  The tablet is packed in a colorful cardboard box, barely exceeding its own dimensions.  The front side of the box contains an image of the tablet and the docking station.  On the tablet screen is easily recognized by a new tiled interface of the operating system, called Modern. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b49/cea/909/b49cea909fcb962aa2cf13a60f6b1973.jpg"><br>  The reverse side of the box contains only a brief description of Windows RT, contact details for ASUS and a sticker with technical specifications.  In principle, everything is standard and there is nothing supernatural. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49f/1ef/1e8/49f1ef1e808c3a7ebed5a28fb09c60e7.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box on the first tier was placed directly the tablet itself, and on the second its additional accessories. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af4/055/230/af40552308673b4de488f2c3fac2ba06.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/439/a56/5bd/439a565bdfea3693c5810ff37ec8b8ff.jpg">

      <br>
      The dimensions of the tablet are 262.5 x 170.9 x 8.3 mm, and its weight is 535 grams.  A connected docking station increases the size of the device to 262.5 x 170.9 x 18.7 mm, and the weight increases to 1073 grams.  This is due to the presence in the docking station of an additional battery, which almost doubles the autonomous operation time from 9 to 16 hours.  The running time indicated on the manufacturer‚Äôs website was measured when playing 720p video. <br><br>  The tablet display has a diagonal of 10.1 inches and is based on a Super IPS + matrix with a WXGA resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels.  Corning Fit glass is installed on top of the display, designed to protect the display from various kinds of damage, which can befall the tablet during its life cycle.  The display has high contrast and excellent viewing angles - 178 degrees.  As a result, on the tablet it is convenient to work with both text and view photos or media content, while the letters are not blurred, and the picture is not smeared. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9b/441/dc5/f9b441dc564146a700dea27de24e894d.jpg"><br>  The upper right corner of the front of the tablet is decorated with the manufacturer's logo.  At the same level, but closer to the center of the case, is the front two-megapixel camera and light sensor.  At the bottom of the crane is the only capacitive button "Windows".  It is located in the right place and does not cause any inconvenience, while working on the tablet. <br><br>  The reverse side of the tablet is presented in the form of a combination of metal and plastic.  The metal cover should significantly increase the rigidity and strength of the body.  In addition, in the process of work, it heats up slightly, thereby removing excess heat from the iron filling of the device.  The plastic cover takes up about a quarter of the back of the tablet.  Thanks to the grooves on it, the tablet is very securely fixed even in one hand and does not strive to slip onto the floor with the first awkward movement of the hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb8/412/ae0/cb8412ae06ddf6ba610be04d9ec44ee7.jpg"><br>  It also houses the main eight-megapixel camera with LED flash.  The camera is located in the middle of the long side of the tablet body, so it is much more convenient to take pictures of it than, for example, with a smartphone camera, where the user's hands strive to get into the frame or close the flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d1/5a1/9ff/1d15a19ffdae9e0c6f38e653dfc7fa29.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the camera on the back of the Vivo Tab RT are the speaker holes, of which there are as many as four pieces.  By the way, I, as an inexperienced audiophile, liked the sound very much.  Therefore, those wishing to pass the time for listening to your favorite music or watching a movie are unlikely to be disappointed. <br><br>  The upper end has an on / off button and a hole for the built-in microphone.  The power button has a spotlight LED that signals white if the tablet battery is fully charged or orange if this process is not yet complete. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1e/45a/626/b1e45a6266398297f66edf2220fbead9.jpg"><br>  The right side of the tablet is fully given to control and connect audio components.  For this, there is a 3.5 mm two in one TRS connector for connecting headphones or a microphone.  Just below it is the volume control, which is very well tactile palpable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/236/925/077/236925077789c0ee078458d128d8e836.jpg"><br>  The lower end is designed to connect a keyboard dock, almost turning into a laptop.  In addition to the keyboard and additional battery, the docking station offers the user to use one full USB 2.0 port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31d/859/d03/31d859d03371c7c968e6429e13f7f82d.jpg"><br>  For those users who choose the option without a docking station, the manufacturer has kindly enclosed the EXTENSION KIT - a special adapter that allows access to a single USB 2.0 connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/452/c82/2f3/452c822f3a7d4cddaac380fced5ad205.jpg"><br>  I think users will easily like this move because they get the opportunity to connect USB devices right out of the box.  The implementation of connecting devices through an adapter is due to the thickness of the tablet, because the case with a thickness of 8.3 mm simply physically cannot accept this connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24e/d58/eaf/24ed58eafbbd0b996e0fdbda78684b2f.jpg"><br>  The left side of the tablet sheltered mini HDMI connector, slot for micro SD memory cards, a compartment for a Micro SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a32/cf2/c14/a32cf2c14a89a9f0f055f17f418ac0fb.jpg"><br>  The tray under the Micro SIM card is removed using a special key-clip. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ac/0f5/acb/3ac0f5acbe12232664a20e132ce9cc8c.jpg"><br>  After that, it fits the operator card and the tray moves back into the body of the tablet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fe/bbe/a6a/5febbea6aa46ffc07ed8eb4faccede17.jpg"><br>  To do this, it is most convenient to keep the tablet screen down on your lap or desk. <br><br>  It comes with a Vivo Tab RT power adapter ASUS ADP-18BW, designed to recharge the battery.  Output characteristics are constant 15 V at a maximum current of 1.2 A or 5 V at a maximum current of 2 A. Despite the ASUS inscription, the manufacturer of the power supply is actually a very well-known company DELTA ELECTRONICS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/378/c0b/5c6/378c0b5c6f37fc41d6201dc67f7222c9.jpg"><br>  Licensed sticker Windows pasted on the power supply. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0da/052/2b5/0da0522b5c07cd7ad5df6d890b95a963.jpg"><br><br>  In total, the whole package includes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Charger; <br>  ‚Ä¢ EXTENSION KIT to implement USB 2.0 ports; <br>  ‚Ä¢ key-clip for removing the Micro SIM card tray; <br>  ‚Ä¢ wipe for cleaning the screen; <br>  ‚Ä¢ various documentation and user instructions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec2/702/d7f/ec2702d7f3112543ad050791bc0d22e5.jpg"><br>  With regards to the hardware component, ASUS Vivo Tab RT boasts a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor running at 1.3 GHz.  The processor is manufactured according to the standards of the 40-nm process and is quite common in such devices.  For example, such as tablets Acer Iconia Tab A510, Asus Google Nexus 7, Sony Xperia Tablet S and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/678/1fa/255/6781fa255d362bdad457be500eabc568.jpg"><br><br>  The amount of RAM is 2 GB.  This is the maximum possible amount supported by Tegra 3 processors. Of course, I would like to see 4 GB, but I have to be content with what we have. <br><br>  The Tegra 3 platform uses the ULP NVIDIA accelerator with twelve graphics cores. Due to this, it is possible to view media content in FullHD resolution.  Supports H.264 decoding (HP @ 40 Mbps), VC-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX 4/5, XviD HT, H.263, VP8, WMV, Real Video, VP6 and encoding: H .264, MPEG-4, H.263, VP8. <br><br>  The tablet version I got has 64 GB of non-volatile eMMC type memory.  In my opinion, this volume is quite enough for everyday use of the tablet.  With the latest updates and several applications installed from the available 54 GB of disk space, about 12 GB are occupied.  But the version with 32 GB of memory can be paid attention only if the user does not plan to work with large files or is limited within the limits of the available budget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/557/b11/8fa557b116f44cd21c96ad85bc6f1ed8.jpg"><br><br>  As I wrote earlier, the tablet is running the operating system Windows RT.  The desktop version of Windows 8 has a similar interface, so users who are used to it with this operating system should have no particular problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9e/6d2/8a4/b9e6d28a42bf48a6e489e66cf54fe2e0.jpg"><br><br>  But the installation of applications in the case of Windows RT is organized differently.  For this, we have our own Shop, in which both paid and free applications are available for purchase and download.  To date, the Store already has essential applications for life.  True, for some applications have to fork out slightly.  At the same time, the user has the opportunity to try the application in a time limited mode before purchasing. <br>  So for the YouTube RT application they are asking for 45 rubles, and for the 8-zip archiver already 240. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58d/cb9/6c9/58dcb96c90053bc5bf7ad6e72e6c04ea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/005/012/2ea/0050122ea6a79697d7e1f2ad69ee7a66.jpg"><br><br>  From interesting and free apps in the Store, applications such as Habralent or TeamViewer are available for download. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1d/8c1/2b1/e1d8c12b13bbc6a95c96bf261ff212b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a1/c14/dd6/1a1c14dd6b1084e09bcfddc7c8a52a08.jpg"><br><br>  Updating applications occurs through the Store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16a/0af/235/16a0af23539445c7fef5fdf52880770b.jpg"><br><br>  But the installation of system updates is still going through Windows Update. <br><br>  Connecting USB devices also does not cause much difficulty.  After the first connection, the device is installed into the system, after which it is already available to the user.  In this case, everything is completely analogous to Windows desktop operating system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f17/c99/80a/f17c9980adc92db7ea9198ee6f1abc47.jpg"><br><br>  Hard stuffing tablet with a supply of enough to perform almost any task.  You can monitor the use of system resources through the already familiar task manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d8/444/b96/4d8444b9635f87ea097cc2458fa10256.jpg"><br><br>  Another important point of Windows RT is the availability of Office 2013 consisting of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d83/43d/d31/d8343dd31567e7c39de510fd2b40827e.jpg"><br><br>  Basic operations are performed using gestures on the touch screen.  But the text input occurs using the touch keyboard, which takes about half of the screen.  At the same time, the size of the keys is quite large and does not cause any special difficulties with typing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94a/0fb/96d/94a0fb96d05070e98be2c3dadd2fd30c.jpg"><br><br>  My version of the tablet has the ability in addition to Wi-Fi to use the capabilities of 3G from mobile operators.  This is especially true for those users whose activities are not rigidly tied to a home or office with a Wi-Fi network coverage, but are associated with constant travels or business trips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/102/372/498/102372498ced1ab22e0e616b4a178b0c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, ASUS Vivo Tab RT is a very interesting device.  If you delve into the basis of the operating system Windows RT with the ability to use a tiled interface and the usual already huge number of users of the window interface, the Vivo Tab RT is a kind of transitional device from a desktop computer or laptop to a full-fledged tablet.  Therefore, for users who have not yet decided to use tablets in their lives, it is the Vivo Tab RT that can become a cross over bridge to this world of devices. <br>  The ability to use Wi-Fi, 3G, LTE and Bluetooth to the maximum expand the communication capabilities of the tablet, and will not force its user to miss almost anywhere in the world. <br>  The presence of a full-fledged office package Office 2013 also contributes to the rapid adaptation of most users hitherto with tablets unfamiliar. <br>  Of course, it was not without unclear and unpleasant moments.  By incomprehensible points include the update of applications and operating systems from different places, and for this you need to switch between interfaces. <br>  But the unpleasant moments are most likely a lack of a number of applications, besides, some of the popular applications or their analogues are commercial, and a rather modest number of games in the Store.  However, this claim, in fact, relates more to Microsoft Corporation than to the ASUS Vivo Tab RT tablet itself. <br>  I think the high point of tablets on Windows RT is still ahead when, after some time, the App Store will become as saturated as the App Store or Google Play.  The fact that such a giant as Microsoft, will make maximum effort, I have no doubt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169369/</a></p>
