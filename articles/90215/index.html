And the first step in this process will be communication with users of Habrakhabra, the main developer community in Russia. <br><br><img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/vladiseu/pic/0007ctea" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is happening only now, not at all, because earlier it was not desirable.  The company had difficulties associated with the sharp growth of the project.  Pavel told me about them at the first meeting.  A small team of a large startup could not build a service and simultaneously respond to any discontent on the network.  Now we will try to catch up.

      First of all, the Thematic Media employee David responded to our small steps into the light: ‚ÄúWow, I was told about you that it‚Äôs hard for you :) Stereotypes are crumbling literally every day :)‚Äù.  He was the one who promptly added us to the list of corporate users of Habrakhabr. <br><br>  In this welcome post you should probably comment on regular blog posts that Pavel Durov has died.  No, fortunately, he is alive and meets with the development team at least once a week to discuss the latest achievements together.  There were no accidents.  And the post about hacking <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/89882/">security.vkontakte.ru</a> and its subsequent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/89915/">denial</a> indicated how easy it is to mislead the public, and how administrative employees were not ready to respond adequately to such problems, getting cons for sharp comments.  Personally, I, as a person closely associated with the media, liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa joke.  The company's inability to quickly and adequately respond to such things is already our problem, on which we will now work. <br><br>  Soon we will show our new office to the public.  Now it is full of work on the arrangement.  Recently table tennis and air hockey have been brought there (there are still many things planned), and the only girl in this office, Maria, is closely watching that programmers who have already moved do not die of starvation. <br><br>  Pavel Durov, by the way, laid out in his albums the layout of the reception, which is about to be installed.  Maybe someone did not have time to see: <br><br><img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/vladiseu/pic/0007eaey" alt="image"><br><br>  In a meeting room with a large touch-pad, developers gather once a week to show the results of their work.  Last Friday we discussed bugs in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/89695/">running updates</a> .  After that, talked about the upcoming innovations.  I can only say that very soon, through the VKontakte profile, it will be possible to pay for purchases at one of the online stores of the Runet (later others will connect).  Attentive guys from Roem.ru even <a href="http://roem.ru/2010/04/06/addednews14264/%3Fc">noticed</a> our new job: <br><br>  <i>Today, VKontakte has a <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/jobs.php">vacancy</a> called Online Shopping Manager.</i>  <i>This confirms the rumors about the plans of the largest domestic social network about the development of its own Payment system.</i> <br><br>  All this in the following posts. <br><br>  We will hold Internet conferences in which the management and developers of the site will answer interesting questions from Habr users.  We will invite to visit, meet, drink tea.  And a lot of things will be.  I noticed that among the users of VK, there already appeared guys who decided to become owners of the <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app1850211_93388">local media</a> .  The start, of course, is weak, but we will definitely help them with materials and informational reasons.  Maybe sometime they will sell advertising space there and make a fortune on it. <br><br>  Cost to pay tribute to Durov.  He does not limit me in what I need to write.  The man took a bold step by inviting an unfamiliar journalist to the company, and gave him all the cards in hand.  I go around the office, listen to people, draw conclusions, write down.  No installations and requests to blind someone‚Äôs image of a holy man have been reported to me.  I am not asked to write only about what brings money.  Therefore, the dialogue should be objective. <br><br>  By the way, my name is Vlad Tsypluhin.  All my contacts are in profile. <br><br>  See you live! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Questions are collected and will be placed in separate topics with <b>answers of the company's employees</b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90215/</a></p>
