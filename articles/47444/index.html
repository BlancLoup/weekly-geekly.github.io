  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúStartup for the week‚Äù Day 2. Idea and concept</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  First, we chose (out of the 4 proposed by us and 3x watching the show) a revolutionary idea (IMHO), which, we believe, can turn the usual picture of the alignment of forces on the Runet.  Then they came to the conclusion that there are many not worked out moments in it, which can take more time allotted for the show and disrupt the project.  Having decided that we will deal with it in a quiet mode (I hope we will not postpone it for a long time), we will work out the details and start by the beginning of March.  Therefore, we present to your attention a more developed idea. <br><br><h3>  Idea </h3><br>  Make the project site <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">StartupPoint.ru</a> <br>  Many have heard, and someone has already participated in meetings of startups held in Moscow.  The first meeting took place in September, the last (already the fifth) on December 7.  We can say that the idea is a success.  But there is no site with decent functionality.  Therefore, the first goal of the site: the online continuation of offline meetings, as well as expanding the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãStartup Point to the regions and possibly the CIS. <br>  The second goal: a highly specialized place to meet startups with startups (to share experience and discuss specific details of startups - business model, usability, code, design) and startups with investors (so that investors can see "live" projects, and startups show their project accordingly in all its glory before the investor). <br><br>  <b>Functionality:</b> <br>  * Presentations of startups and their discussion (blog structure) <br>  * StartupWiki - a structured encyclopedia of startups, from creation to monetization, created by the editors and users, moderated by the editors <br>  * Startup rating by users - reduced in the first version <br>  * User Rating (analog of karma) - reduced in the first version

There will be quite a web 2.0 project. <br>  The following options are possible: <br>  1) Project ideas are put to vote.  But then the term needs to be increased, and once we have NG in a week, the project will be transferred to the tenth of January (we can sit down right from the 10th). <br>  2) We continue to make Startpoint to be on time. <br>  3) Your option. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47444/</a></p>
