      The examples above are not the only ones.  Yes, what to say, we have ourselves and the companies with which we work, a similar situation.  Therefore, below I share in a way that allowed me to get away from the routine on my own experience, in practice. <br><br>  Below are 5 simple steps.  Immediately please - move to the next step, only after you have done the current one, then it will make sense: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> We take a sheet of A4 paper, mark 10 minutes and start on a sheet in a row in a chaotic order to write out all the types of actions that are in your company that are repeated every day. <br><br><ul><li>  pay Yandex Direct </li><li>  make a contract </li><li>  send a commercial offer </li><li>  to meet with a client in the office </li><li>  transfer money from current account to card </li><li>  plan further actions in the company strategy </li><li>  train new employees </li></ul><br>  and so on.  Such types of actions must be at least 30. There were records of 80 and 120 types of actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d0/ae7/998/8d0ae7998fad42f587f74f86973f58be.jpg"><br><br>  The trick is that when we do, for example, the ‚Äúfurniture business,‚Äù the brain simplifies all processes and merges them all into one common jelly over which the name of the company flaunts. <br><br>  This simple step makes it possible to understand that in this jelly there are separate ‚Äúberries‚Äù - separate actions that together form a common system.  And the new "berries" get there gradually in the development process.  Here, by the way, a typical mistake of start-up entrepreneurs arises, judging from my personal experience - they sit on the ‚Äúneedle of quick results‚Äù.  Because of this, new services and processes are constantly being added to their company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76a/7f0/b7f/76a7f0b7faca418f9dfae0dfc0ffdf98.jpg"><br><br>  Do you deal with Yandex Direct and one-page sites?  The client addressed: ‚ÄúCan you do whale marketing?‚Äù - ‚ÄúAnd why not - this is extra money!‚Äù And at that moment the main mistake of the young company occurs - the creation of whale marketing is an increase in the volume of ‚Äúkissel‚Äù - plus 20 additional types of actions.  It seems that they are all small, they take quite a bit of time - but all these small details are ‚Äúpebbles‚Äù that accumulate make the business very difficult - this is the main reason for the emergence of a routine in the company. <br><br>  In general, just because of such a logic ‚Äúwe undertake everything that the money pays for‚Äù the previous company collapsed, which we launched in Rostov-on-Don with a partner from January to August 2015, we had 17 people working at the peak. office and about 100 people in social networks like freelancers.  When we turned to a professional to create a structure for us, the structure of a large holding turned out, which has been on the market for 10 years and should have about 150 positions.  Do not repeat our mistakes. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Continue.  The next step is to simply circle all sorts of actions in which you somehow participate - completely or periodically. <br><br>  Such a situation is possible that all actions are circled in circles - it means either you are 1 person in the company, or not all actions are written out. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Put "!"  next to the actions that you really want to do yourself, they like it or you can not transfer them to other people for any reason. <br><br>  What happened.  For example: a total of 44 actions, 30 of them in circles and 10 exclamation marks. <br><br>  30 circles minus 10 "!"  = 20 types of actions need to be delegated - these are the reasons for the routine. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Below you need to write ways to "destroy" the routine, namely: <br><br><ul><li>  specific posts that these actions should do </li><li>  patterns that close these actions </li><li>  automatic services </li></ul><br>  For example, small tasks such as ‚Äúsend KP‚Äù, ‚Äúfill in a contract‚Äù, ‚Äúgo to the post office‚Äù can be done by a personal assistant.  And instead of the action ‚ÄúPrint a letter‚Äù, you can simply make a letter template and so on. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Suppose there are 5 ways to get away from routine actions.  If they are all introduced, it will be much easier to breathe.  Now the most important thing is to simply put down the priority of implementation - what to do first, what's second and beyond.  First for implementation we choose the solution that closes the most routine functions and tasks and write how and when it should be done in the simplest way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5c/5b1/201/a5c5b120184349cc92e08dabd324bd45.jpg"><br><br>  This is the simplest model for avoiding a routine that has already been repeatedly put into practice and in reality has much more free time. <br><br>  Another question is how to ensure that new employees do everything clearly and could not be afraid for quality - this is already a question of adding training, video clips, regulations, scripts, and other templates to the work. <br><br>  There are many options for the development of events and ramifications.  I will tell about it in the further posts if this proves useful.  Write questions, comments, opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322494/</a></p>
