  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High-speed SSD of new generation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, new SSD drives with SAS-3 interface (12 Gbit / s) from HGST, a leading manufacturer of solid-state SAS / FC drives of corporate class, went on sale.  The company, which was founded by the pioneers of the hard drive industry, continues its history of innovation, and is now the first supplier to offer solid-state drives to the market with this high-speed interface.  These high-speed devices provide read speeds of up to 1200 MB / s, and write speeds of up to 750 MB / s. <br>  Before taking a closer look at the characteristics of the new drives, let's talk about the advantages of the SAS-3 interface. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Firstly, its maximum throughput - 12 Gbit / s - twice as much as its predecessor.  The maximum exchange rate with SSD-drives connected via a 6-gigabit interface is 550-550 MB per second. <br>  Secondly, the interface implements a mechanism for automatic adjustment of transmitter parameters based on information received from the receiver.  The high quality of the signal provided by this and other mechanisms allows the use of cables up to 10 (passive copper cable), 25 (active copper cable) and 100 (optical cable) meters. <br>  In addition, SAS-3 is an effective solution for use in SAN.  Surpassing 8-gigabit FC in speed and only slightly lagging behind 16-gigabit, 12-gigabit SAS is at the same time much cheaper than the latter.  At the same time it provides the same level of reliability. <br>  Finally, the backward compatibility of SAS-3 drives with the SAS-2 interface allows them to be used in the existing storage infrastructure in order to fully unleash their potential after the upgrade. <br><br>  Ultrastar SSD800MH <br>  The older model, the Ultrastar SSD800MH, when connected via the SAS 12 Gbps interface, provides the following characteristics: read speed up to 1200 MB / s, write speed up to 750 MB / s.  I / O speed is as follows: up to 145,000 sequential read operations and up to 100,000 consecutive write operations per second (random blocks).  This is more than 100 times faster than hard drives and twice as many as solid-state drives with a 6-gigabit interface.  Regarding the lifetime of the device (type of memory - MLC NAND), the modification with a capacity of 800 GB allows a total of 36.5 PB of data to be written, or 20 TB per day.  This means that the disc can be rewritten 25 times a day for 5 years.  The warranty period for these devices is 5 years or is determined by the maximum amount of recorded data.  Also available are devices of similar class with capacities of 400 and 200 GB. <br>  Applications Ultrastar SSD800MH - high-frequency trading, online transaction processing, data analysis and other tasks that require intensive exchange with external memory and at the same time high speed. <br><br>  Ultrastar SSD800MM <br>  This model, which is also available in versions of 800, 400 and 200 GB, is slightly inferior to the previous one, mainly in terms of the number of write cycles.  The device can be completely rewritten 10 times a day.  The maximum read speed is 1150 MB / s, the write speed is 700 MB / s.  Maximum I / O frequency: 145,000 consecutive reads and up to 70,000 consecutive write operations per second (random blocks).  Type of memory used: MLC.  Maximum recording capacity: 14.6 PB, or 8 TB per day for 5 years. <br>  Recommended applications are zero-tier of multi-tiered (multi-level) data storage systems, high-performance computing systems, video processing systems, etc.

      Ultrastar SSD1000MR <br>  These drives, released in versions for 250, 500 and 1000 GB, are designed primarily for work in data-oriented applications.  The maximum read speed is 1200 MB / s, and the write speed is 700 MB / s.  Maximum reading frequency: 145 000 operations per second, records - 20 000 operations per second.  The 1000-gigabyte model allows a total of 3.7 pbytes of data to be written, which is equivalent to 2 terabytes per day for 5 years.  In other words, during five years of operation, the disc can be rewritten completely twice a day. <br>  Recommended areas of application are zero-level data readout of high-performance storage systems, high-speed computing systems, video processing systems, cloud computing services, compact systems, and systems with low power consumption. <br><br>  All drives are available in a 2.5-inch form factor, in versions with power consumption (during I / O) 9 or 11 watts.  The maximum time between failures is 2 million hours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192410/</a></p>
