And I never touched computers from the times of the USSR, and I was very surprised when I found out how many there were.  In this post I collected personal computers developed and manufactured in the countries of the socialist bloc in the 1980-1990s <br><br>  Did you have any of the computers below?

Puldin 601 had as many as four video modes of 0..3 and a SECAM coder.  The following models have added input using a light pen and a printer port. <br><br>  <a href="http://solidstate.karelia.ru/~yura/pyldin/">Documentation, computer and additional circuit diagram, photos, articles and other materials about Pildin.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec3/815/f96/ec3815f96bea1c34acdc8410d3a4faf0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Electronics MC 0511, or UKNTS, was intended for training.  It was first introduced in 1987.  Also on its basis were built process control systems, telegraph hubs, accounting systems, ticketing systems and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c3/e24/e66/2c3e24e669b404b08861cb20cafb2186.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Corvette PK8010 / PK8020 has been mass-produced since 1988.  These computers could be connected to a local network of up to 16 machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70b/8a5/f87/70b8a5f872550ed2751fe2a6c9272aaa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The UT-88 microcomputer consisted of a power supply unit, a central processor unit, a small memory block and an interface unit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/64c/58e/9c564c58edc7052ab579e40341da10c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is also UT-88, but in a minimal configuration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/863/c6a/dc4/863c6adc481fafe43c0fd418bd21b7e6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Bashkiria-2M was developed in 1989.
