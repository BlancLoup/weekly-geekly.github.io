You need only two installers, one starts the device from one end, the other accepts it.  Due to this, time and labor costs are reduced. <br><br>  ‚ÄúScout‚Äù is not replaceable when performing work on broaching an additional cable over busy streets and highways without requiring their overlap.  It is also necessary when laying cables through existing transmission lines, there is no need to agree on their disconnection. <br><br>  Analogs of such devices exist, but they are very bulky and heavy and more than once I heard from installers that sometimes it is easier to manually drag a cable than to lift a heavy device. <br><br>  Our goal was to create a compact, not heavier than 2 kg and at the same time fully functional device with the ability to remote control. <br><br>  We immediately plunged into the work without bothering to look at analogues on the Internet, and this is probably the only time when this helped us.  We have created a fundamentally new device in terms of constructs that are very different from their analogs.  And if they had seen an analogue before the development, they would involuntarily repeat it. <br><br>  In the beginning, we simply made a rectangular chassis. We installed a roller there and attached it to the battery. At the first test, we realized that whatever material we made the roller, it would slide when it went up, we need to make the pressure roller from below.  Well, then how to install the device on the cable?  The mechanism of opening one of the rollers and snapping was suggested.  Moreover, it should be easy to click into place and not open at the same time.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe snap mechanism was suggested by the mechanism of the furniture hinges, in which two positions - open and closed, held in both positions by a spring.  After assembly, another test and again failure.  The scout dangles like a snot and constantly turns it to the right then to the left and tries to jump off the rollers.  How to keep him in the right position?  And then one of us remembered the transfer of discovery about dinosaurs, that dinosaurs rule the tail.  Eureka, we attach the tail to our device, we attach the other end of the tail to the cable through which the scout travels through the ring.  Urrra drove smoothly and confidently.  Subsequently, we replaced the tail with four stoppers that did not allow the spy to move to the right or left, well, in fact, we made two tails in front and behind. <br><br>  The field tests began, everything went well, except that when the scout was allowed in, there was not enough cable to reach the next roof, and the ‚Äúbusher‚Äù was moving and could not be stopped, it was necessary to force it back out of the cable.  And then there was a desire to make a remote control.  A remote control device, a pair of relyushek, a remote control, and our scout became remote-controlled, was purchased. As a consequence, this remote control facilitated the installers life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e4/ba5/0a9/1e4ba50a9b0140cb974872becf00300c.jpg"><br><br>  Video about our club and in particular about the "scout" can be viewed here: <a href="http://vk.com/club71815206%3Fz%3Dvideo255324247_169886117%252F45c95fbba824252b98">vk.com/club71815206?z=video255324247_169886117%2F45c95fbba824252b98</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240571/</a></p>
