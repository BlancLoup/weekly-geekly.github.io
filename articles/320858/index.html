In this regard, in the near future we will present you a cycle of translated articles of our front-end developer, Lyubov Lozhkina, on the qualitative development of VR projects. <br><br><h3>  Go... </h3><br>  <i>This article is an introduction to the cycle of materials about the qualitative development of VR projects.</i>  <i>Over time, it will be supplemented with links to further materials.</i> <br><br>  Virtual reality is not only an exciting new technology.  VR is a <b>completely new way of communication.</b>  The technology is so young that there are still no established rules and proven methods of experience on which to rely.

      Total freedom - <b>everyone starts from scratch.</b> <br><br>  VR movement existed back in the 80s (at that time, hardware limitations severely hampered progress).  However, the first really important knowledge on the development of VR applications began to appear in the last two years thanks to modern technologies and success in the VR industry. <br><br>  Over time, this knowledge will accumulate, new ones will appear, and techniques proven by experience will emerge. <br><br>  In this series of articles, we want to consider the most important features of VR development, which will bring your project to a new level of quality. <br><br><h2>  1 - A look into the virtual world </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/264/34b/fec/26434bfeccb7a6e22917bf8b746e6df3.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The basis of the foundations and the biggest difference in comparison with the classical media is the handling of a virtual camera, which is what we will tell about in the first place.  If you make the wrong decisions at this stage, our VR apps will cause <b>nausea and headaches.</b> <br><br>  Therefore, during the development of VR applications should pay much attention to this aspect.  And if we follow the basic rules, then you can not worry about unpleasant side effects. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320860/"><u>VR-Design: a look into the virtual world</u></a> <br><br><h2>  2 - Rendering: techniques and tricks </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/07f/f1b/16707ff1b279d23cf470e94ab500bf62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we look at the second important factor: rendering.  Here we will talk about the visual component, first of all, about the speed and high frame rate. <br><br>  We will take a closer look at the basic technical concepts, but keep in mind that modern engines take most of this work as far as possible. <br><br>  We will also learn about other tools that will <b>interact with the engine</b> and help us in the design and development of virtual worlds, so that, as a result, third-party technologies work flawlessly with our VR applications. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321784/"><u>VR rendering and optimization</u></a> <br><br><h2>  3 - Sound </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/247/ef2/02e/247ef202e1abddc308894ceac205ba52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When developing VR applications, sound effects are more important than ever.  Proper use of sound increases immersion at times and takes impressions to a new level. <br><br>  What you need to pay attention to when implementing what technologies exist and <b>why, while imitating sound, they still resort to deception</b> - we will learn about all this in this article.  In addition, issues of hardware and other important points will be raised. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/323072/"><u>Sound effects in virtual worlds.</u></a> <br><br><h2>  4 - User Interface in VR </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/695/a4e/fcc/695a4efcc396b8424756181948659434.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Developing a user interface in VR, or the interaction between man and machine, is complicated by new problems. <br><br>  The application of the classical principles of design of a 2-dimensional interface does not work in VR.  Need to experiment with new abstractions.  This applies not only to the use of controllers, but also to virtual reality glasses, with the help of which we control our viewing angle. <br><br>  In this article we will look at the existing developments and considerations on this subject and how they can be applied in your project.  All this is very interesting, and besides, it is the basis of the fundamentals in the field of VR-design, which will be valuable for everyone who wants to develop really good applications. <br><br>  <u><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/324002/">VR-Design: User Interface</a></u> <br><br><h2>  5 - Scene Content </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa2/835/20e/aa283520e2e64fa7517c0210d6ab3537.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After we get acquainted with the most important aspects of technology and design, you can go to the central element of each VR project - content. <br><br>  What should be shown and what is not, what impact does the VR project have on the user and what do we want to convey to him?  Compliance with certain ethical frameworks in VR projects is important, as nowhere else. <br><br>  Since, due to the deep immersion, we have a greater influence on the psychological state of the user or player.  This is a big responsibility and you need to be careful with it. <br><br>  What you should pay attention to and what principles already exist, we will look at this article.  In addition, we will understand why VR causes such a strong sense of empathy, like no other media. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/325284/"><u>VR Design: scene content</u></a> <br><br><h2>  6 - VR Development Methodology </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a4/a6c/cdd/3a4a6ccdd6ae1564bdfc2ee526e4bba8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After receiving information about the most important fundamentals of a good VR application, we will finally consider the ideal development process. <br><br>  Theoretical knowledge can not automatically guarantee you a tremendous success.  You should get your own experience and test your ideas in practice. <br><br>  Armed with knowledge in theory, we can practice.  How to develop more effectively, learn faster and experiment - we will look at all this in this article.  We will also understand why you should not rely only on your own opinion and what VR legs are. <br><br>  <u><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326392/">VR development methodology</a></u> <br><br><h2>  Go </h2><br>  The first article from this fascinating series, which will improve your knowledge in VR development, is coming soon. <br><br>  In any case, it is important that you apply all these techniques and principles in practice.  Moreover, it is worthwhile to subject everything to doubt and experiment. <br><br>  All this knowledge is an experience and a small experience of the VR community.  Much has not been invented and not openly.  And the worst thing you can do is rely on someone else's opinion or limit yourself. <br><br>  More information on various topics can be found in the Oculus Best Practices Guide.  Google also published its experience in its manual and the Cardboard APP.  Also very interesting is the book about VR-design from Jason Jerald. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320858/</a></p>
