  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bunker for the date: how I was allowed to walk on the data center RUVDS on the territory of the space plant</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Someone likes to go to the cinema, someone likes to go to clubs, someone loves to go to museums - and I have long dreamed of going around the data centers, looking at everything with my own eyes, and talking with those who work there.  But to organize all this seemed unreal.  Fortunately, the certain recognition that <a href="https://poiskvps.ru/">poiskvps.ru has</a> earned over the years, and which sometimes surprises me now - has simplified the most difficult thing: acquaintance.  So over the past two months I have already visited two data centers.  What interesting things I saw in St. Petersburg, I still plan to write later.  And today I will tell you how I saw the near-center data center of <a href="https://ruvds.com/">RUVDS</a> in the city of Korolev, their ‚Äúsmall homeland‚Äù, where they started from the first server racks in the bomb shelter on the territory of the rocket plant.  Yes, it not only sounds cool, but also looks.  Just look at these tightrope: <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/poiskvps/blog/420045/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/74c/7e3/fcc74c7e3efe5add3860a779b580e644.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At the end of 2015, the history of RUVDS began here.  At first they just got a collocation to another company that rented racks in this DC.  However, they did not linger there, soon moving to a separate room inside the air-raid shelter, in order to build their data center behind its luxurious doors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Nikita Tsaplin, managing partner of RUVDS, explained that for the claimant to the role of a major market player, this was a strategic move: 
      <br>

      - Its place to place, its capacity allows you to organize everything under your control, without subtracting contractors, and obtain licenses from the FSB and FSTEC for compliance with all information protection requirements. <br><br>  The main work was undertaken by the employees of the company MTW.RU, which is also a superior communications provider and data center operator.  Since it was a question of a building built decades ago, I immediately decided not to wait for the prilization of specialized DCs with their perfectly twisted twigs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/7s/ne/dx7sneh46qirtfa5ixozlcvykkq.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  The history of the <a href="http://www.kompozit-mv.ru/index.php/ru/">Composite</a> plant, on the territory of which the bomb shelter is located, which grew and became a data center, began together with the Soviet rocket industry in 1947 with the creation of a materials science department for domestic rocket production in the central laboratory of plant No. 88.  In 1975, the department "doros" to the Central Research Institute of Materials, renamed in 1986 in the NGO (today - JSC) "Composite".  The skin from Korolev protected almost everything and the space stations from Salyut to the ISS, was on the Buran and the Proton, Mir, Energiya-Buran, Vega, Phobos and ISS rockets. </blockquote><br>  It was really necessary to sew on a live thread: holes were punched in the walls to organize ventilation, a fire extinguishing system was made, diesel generators and bespereboyniki were installed - but we had to accept the layout and height of the ceilings different from other data centers.  But already at the beginning of 2016, RUVDS had its own racks in its data center. <br><br>  Nothing, testifying against such a choice, I, in fact, did not see.  The result was just as boring as needed: ‚Äúeverything just stably works for clients‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/7_/-r/sc7_-rhfzqkdaubguyubpzgwpg8.jpeg"><br><br>  The maintenance of their DC RUVDS was given to MTW.RU for a row, so the employees of the hoster themselves often don‚Äôt have to go to their data center from the Pushkinskaya office.  The staff of the company is about 30 people. <br><br>  The first line of technical support was also outsourced to a third-party call center.  Telephone support itself is rarely enough for hosting, but Tsaplin says that the possibility, in case of any problems, to talk with a living person, allows them to become more customer-oriented.  In about half of the cases, this is enough.  Only every second question needs to be transferred to the second line of technical support. <br><br>  Another factor of economy: the hoster does not provide IPv6 addresses and in the near future there are no plans for this.  Tsaplin protects this solution as well: <br><br>  - Trite such addresses are not needed.  For all the time no one was even interested in this issue, and the cost of implementation is not zero, so there‚Äôs no point in spending money on things that are not needed. <br><br>  Apparently, saving by delegating processes to outsourcing and reducing non-optimal personnel costs, it turns out really well: the cheapest virtual server at RuVDS can be taken for 130‚ÇΩ - the price is quite low and on the Search for UPU tariff falls on the first or second page. <br><br>  3 independent Internet inputs of 10 Gbit / s each come to the data center, which are fully sufficient for the needs of the RUVDS data center and their upstream provider.  True, once all three were killed by excavators from a construction site in the next building block.  The Internet, of course, was quickly restored by welding optics.  And soon they promise to finish the fourth, bringing the bandwidth up to 40 Gbit / s. <br><br>  Power is also reserved: 2 independent substations and a diesel generator, which is checked once every 2-3 months with a complete imitation of the loss of electricity from the city, there were no failures fixed, and there is nothing to complain about in the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/wi/jp/5zwijptx3d7r4yitrgpx10obloc.jpeg"><br><br>  The fire extinguishing is done in the classic way: sensors, cylinders with freon and yellow pipes.  Since the opening in 2016, they have not yet burned anything - and I hope it will be so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/md/p8/bdmdp8ofo0fji8_xforxvrpvzg8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/z5/te/gmz5teyayhjgjqgrbtty1_gifv8.jpeg"><br><br>  The hoster rents IP addresses - so, according to them, it turns out to be much more profitable than buying their IP address blocks because of the less headache - they are cheaper and there are no problems with obtaining them, while the cost of buying addresses can be much more expensive , even when calculated for a long period.  Plus, it‚Äôs very hard to buy the required number of IP addresses, in one hand most often they give no more than 1000 addresses at a time.  Currently hoster only in Korolev uses about 15 thousand IP addresses. <br><br>  Since 2016, RUVDS uses only Huawei servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/ha/lm/kdhalms8thbuo--vhirutuh9ch4.jpeg"><br><br>  These servers seemed interesting to me because in the event of a failure on the front panel, you can see the error code and quickly understand which element does not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5c/40/ff/5c40ffjmjsxtg01hkgt3a0r5weq.png"><br><br>  All discs are signed, so in which case you can quickly find the right one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/ec/wk/jqecwk11pb8j6xzlizybonin2kg.png"><br><br>  The maximum such servers can accommodate either 8 2.5 "disks or 4 3.5" disks. <br><br>  On the servers, the hoster uses Hyper-V virtualization, so the client can put both Linux and Windows and Windows on the virtual machine fully licensed, since the host‚Äôs license goes through the processors, so customers who want to buy a virtual server with a Windows license will it is very beneficial to contact this hosting provider: on any server, the license is already included in the price, while for other hosters the cost of such a license may exceed the cost of the virtual server itself and cost from 500 rubles per month. <br><br>  Many clients, according to them, bring them a blog on Habr√© (he remembered me from the article about <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/323330/">useful techniques for working in the Linux command line</a> ). <br><br>  There is, of course, an affiliate program, in which PoiskVPS participates from the very beginning of adding this host to the catalog, and the partner reward increases every month. <br><br><h2>  Where I have not reached </h2><br>  In addition to the DC in Korolyov, RUVDS has an additional platform in Moscow in <a href="http://www.mmts9.ru/">MMTS-9</a> , and since January 2017 in Switzerland, in the data center Deltalis, opened on the site of the former command center of the Swiss Air Force (NATO) deep under the Alps. <br><br>  And in July of this year, about the same days when I was walking around their data center near Moscow, RUVDS servers had <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/416133/">a</a> registration address in the UK. <br><br>  This time one would have expected something like the Bletchley Park mansion: Alan Turing hacked Enigma at the British Intelligence Station X Second World Secret Center which occupied it.  But the ultra-modern London data center Equinix LD8, which is one of the main traffic exchange points in Europe, is also nothing - Turing would have approved. <br><br>  <a href="https://ruvds.com/">You</a> can <a href="https://ruvds.com/">view RUVDS</a> tariffs on their website or in a convenient form in my catalogs: <br>  <a href="https://poiskvps.ru/companies.php%3Fid%3D462">Search VPS</a> and <a href="https://vps.today/company.php%3Fid%3D109">VPS.today</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420045/</a></p>
