There are lots of ideas and forecasts, but there are few real cases.  We can now observe the first timid attempts to begin the actual use of a distributed registry.  The brightest and most successful of these attempts are listed in this material.  He replenished.  Please write in the comments about the projects known to you, and I will definitely add them.  This is not about projects that accept BitCoin for payment and are not pure cryptocurrency, but about those that provide additional value through the use of distributed registry technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Internet, development, security </h2><br><ul><li>  Bitcoin-based decentralized DNS and a special browser for working with this system <a href="https://blockstack.org/">were developed by the Blockstack community</a> .  Earlier, a similar mechanism has already been proposed by <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> and <a href="http://emercoin.com/EMCDNS_and_NVS">Emercoin</a> .  Recently, the project <a href="https://logincasino.com/news/blokchein--i-bitkoin-startapi-poluchili-bolee-42-mln-investicii-v-yanvare-2017-goda13102.html">received an investment of $ 4 million</a> </li><li>  A decentralized trusted repository of SSL certificate hash sums was <a href="http://emercoin.com/EMCSSL">introduced by Emercoin</a> .  The mechanism has already been developed and can be used by IT departments of companies for passwordless user authentication.  As an example, a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/emc_ssl">module for Drupal is</a> developed. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.bigchaindb.com/">BigchainDB is a scalable distributed database built on blockchain principles</a> .  The stated performance target is 1 million write operations per second.  The base is positioned as a storage for ‚Äúbig data‚Äù and is <a href="https://www.bigchaindb.com/whitepaper/bigchaindb-whitepaper.pdf">based on RethinkDB</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://brave.com/">The Brave browser</a> from Mozilla co-founder and JavaScript creator Brendan Eich <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273816/">allows advertisers to pay sites for posting, and users for viewing ads</a> .  The browser itself also receives its share (about 15%).  Brave Payments realizes one of the key advantages of cryptocurrencies: low transaction costs and the possibility of cost-effective micropayments.  Payments are made in BitCoin </li></ul><br><h2>  Media, PR, advertising </h2><br><ul><li>  Decentralized <a href="https://golos.io/">social network for bloggers and journalists "Voice"</a> - the analogue (fork) of the English-language <a href="https://steemit.com/">platform Steemit</a> .  The main idea in the direct financial encouragement of authors for each post, rated by readers </li></ul><br><h2>  HR Recruiting </h2><br><ul><li>  Employees of some specialties will be able to sell their free hours <a href="https://chronobank.io/">on the open market ChronoBank.io</a> .  The project is based on several platforms and is now at the stage of creating a single ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù, provided with real labor hours. </li></ul><br><h2>  Agriculture </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.kolionovo.ru/">Peasant economy (KH) "Kolionovo"</a> on the basis of the platform Emercoin <a href="http://forklog.com/deyatelnost-agrobiznesa-podmoskovnoj-derevni-kolionovo-pereveli-v-blokchejn/">implemented the mechanism of</a> farm units with annual repayment </li></ul><br><h2>  Power industry </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://solarcoin.org/">Solarcoin is a cryptocurrency receipt of which is tied to the production of solar energy by</a> individual households and commercial organizations.  The project is designed to give additional financial incentive to use environmental sources of electricity generation. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ideocolab.com/prototypes/smartsolar">Startup Smart Solar</a> offers a solution for independent metering of electricity generation by solar panels based on the Ethereum blockchain and the Internet of things.  Declared to be a more transparent way to obtain US Renewable Energy Manufacturers ( <a href="http://apps3.eere.energy.gov/greenpower/markets/certificates.shtml">REC</a> ) Certificates, but an ‚Äúindependent meter‚Äù may be useful in any other country. </li></ul><br><h2>  Finance </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://humaniq.co/">Humaniq</a> is a project designed to provide access to banking services for 2 billion people who are now deprived of it.  The basic idea is that the service eliminates the main barriers to financial subjectivity: allows you to identify the user by biometric indicators, without the need to produce documents;  is a kind of commodity / labor exchange and a platform for settlement of contracts;  can be used on any, even the cheapest smartphone with Internet access (does not require a computer) <br></li><li>  <a href="https://dgx.io/">Digitx service</a> allows <a href="https://dgx.io/">you</a> to purchase electronic equivalents of gold using "tokens".  1 token = 1 gram of gold.  Tokens are provided with physical gold by the London Association of Participants in the Precious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_bullion_market">Metals</a> Market ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_bullion_market">LBMA</a> ) </li><li>  Letters of credit based on Ethereum smart contracts <a href="https://vc.ru/n/alfa-s7-blockchain">were tested in an</a> S7 <a href="https://vc.ru/n/alfa-s7-blockchain">test deal</a> with their counterparty.  S7 partner was Alfa-Bank </li><li>  The prototype of the exchange system based on tokens blockchain <a href="https://rns.online/finance/Sberbank-razrabotal-prototip-sistemi-obmena-valyut-na-osnove-blockchain-2017-01-24/">presented Sberbank</a> .  The essence of the system: tokens of different colors (depending on the country) are bought for the national currency.  Further, on a third-party exchange, the tokens of one country are changed to the tokens of another country.  Next, the tokens are exchanged for real money.  A prototype system has already been created. <br><br></li><li>  NASDAQ <a href="http://business.nasdaq.com/marketinsite/2017/Is-Blockchain-the-Answer-to-E-voting-Nasdaq-Believes-So.html">conducted a successful experiment of</a> electronic voting of shareholders using the blockchain.

Revenues from the sale of music come to the artists themselves and their active fans who help in the release and promotion of new albums, depending on their share in tokens.  The project is close to the pre-alpha stage. </li><li>  <a href="http://dotblockchainmusic.com/">dotBlockchainMusic</a> - Developed for decentralized distribution of music.  This service positions itself not so much as a solution for retail users, but rather as a B2B tool for professional participants of the media market (radio stations, TV, theaters).  The customer purchases a file in a special format .bc, which contains meta-data about the ownership and conditions of playback of the content, also recorded in the blockchain.  Music is downloaded over the network from the corresponding services.  The fact of reproduction and other information is also recorded.
