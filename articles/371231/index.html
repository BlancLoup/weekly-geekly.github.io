  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two game records in decades recognized invalid</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  2018 for the world of classic games lovers began with the removal of several game records from the base of the American organization <a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/">Twin Galaxies</a> , which monitors the achievements of gamers.  Player Billy Mitchell got into cheating - he set a record at Donkey Kong using the MAME emulator instead of the arcade machine itself.  And the name Todd Rogers ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Rogers_(video_game_player)">Todd Rogers</a> ), who set a record in 1982 in the game Dragster on the Atari 2600, can soon be removed from the Guinness Book of Records.  How did they manage to deceive the community, and how were they brought to clean water?  Let's figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3u/ba/wj/3ubawjop6jfzlepq_s3ozi1n6l0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Dragster game on the Atari 2600</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Billy Mitchell and Donkey Kong </h1><br>  In 2007, the United States released the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Kong">The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</a> , telling about the attempts of gamer Steven Wibe ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wiebe">Steve Wiebe</a> ) to break the record of current champion Donkey Kong Billy Mitchell.  Uibe played in different halls, tried to call his opponent to a duel, called in to his house, but Mitchell never appeared in the frame of the game for the whole movie.  Uibe broke Mitchell's record, but soon the defeated champion provided a record of the new game, where he restored the status quo. <br><br>  According to Twin Galaxies, among Donkey Kong's Billy Mitchell records were 1,047,200 points, 1,050,200 points and 1,062,800 points.  An analysis of the confirming records by community members <a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/176004-Dispute-Jeremy-Young-Arcade-Donkey-Kong-Points-Hammer-Allowed-Player-Billy-L-Mitchell-Score-1-062-800%3Fs%3D1b636c5f4af03d7b042dbc6ea35b7ac0%26p%3D946633%26viewfull%3D1">helped to reveal the deception</a> - the gamer used the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME">MAME emulator</a> .  The images that the emulator produces differ from the work of the original ‚Äúhardware‚Äù of the slot machine.  You can find out what exactly gave the picture, if you see how it was shown:

    <ul><li>  This Donkey Kong machine generates an image as if you are opening or closing the curtain: there are artifacts when parts of the image appear in pieces, from one side to the other </li><li>  Older versions of MAME before 0.122 show a picture like a puzzle - detail by detail. </li></ul><br>  Mitchell said that he connected to the machine directly when he put one of his records.  Chris Gleed did the same thing to test this version - but got a different result.  And, perhaps, he became the only person who actually <a href="http://donkeykongforum.com/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1413.0">received the picture directly from the machine</a> . <br><br>  The Twin Galaxies website <a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/176004-Dispute-Jeremy-Young-Arcade-Donkey-Kong-Points-Hammer-Allowed-Player-Billy-L-Mitchell-Score-1-062-800%3Fs%3D1b636c5f4af03d7b042dbc6ea35b7ac0%26p%3D946633%26viewfull%3D1">features</a> many GIFs proving the use of the Mitchell emulator.  Below is one example. <br><br>  Billy Mitchell: a record of 1,047,200 and MAME version 0.116-0.181 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4i/bn/0a/4ibn0ahbu3oytpxklfcuw0uthyu.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/lm/ev/enlmeva-n0zilzt5vfv6rbta0to.gif"><br><br>  Billy Mitchell: A record 1,050,200 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nb/ys/t6/nbyst6r0h1mzv_zbhvt04kmulfw.gif"><br><br>  This is how the game should look like on a real slot machine with a direct connection: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/np/hr/ij/nphrijeajk3wfvyu-84vnnhygdo.gif"><br><br>  The game when shooting on a smartphone with 60 fps: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/08/5v/dr/085vdrhjl9glyriougi2qjnu_ue.gif"><br><br>  The name of Billy Mitchell with disgrace struck out of the ranking of champions Donkey Kong.  At the moment, the leader is Robbie Lakeman.  The result shown to them on February 2, 2018 is 1,247,700 points ‚Äî it is significantly higher than the Mitchell's 1,062,800, achieved in an unfair way. <br><br><h1>  Todd Rogers and Dragster at Atari </h1><br>  Billy Mitchell this year was the second fake gamer-record holder.  The first was Todd Rogers.  In 1982, he set a record in the game Dragster on the Atari console, completing the flight in 5.51 seconds, took a photo on the Polaroid and sent it to Activision.  The company confirmed the achievement, and in 2000 it was automatically transferred to the Twin Galaxies base.  In 2000, the gamer got into the Guinness Book of Records as the holder of the record, which in the entire history of games was not beaten the longest. <br><br>  No one has yet overcome the result, but all the achievement records have been removed from the highscore lists, and the Records have been sent information that Rodgers has deceived the gaming community. <br><br>  Dick Moreland, a member of Twin Galaxies in November 2017, doubted the accuracy of the record after Eric Koziel demonstrated the impossibility of a result in normal game conditions.  Time better than 5.57 seconds on the Atari 2600 can not be shown, even if you use the software to assist in the game.  Collected evidence was enough to remove all the Rogers records. <br><br>  The best possible result in the Dragster on the Atari 2600 is 5.57 seconds. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jszP5YZxjLU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúWe cannot affect the recognition of the record by Activision, but we are responsible for the reliable provision of information about achievements in games and can no longer accept historical records from the company as the only evidence for the results established earlier.  We have not witnessed the installation of the record, cannot find any evidence used by the game publisher, and cannot find anyone who saw the evidence provided by Activision as a confirmation of the record, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/175364-Dispute-Dick-Moreland-Atari-2600-VCS-Dragster-NTSC-Game-1-Difficulty-B-Fastest-Time-Player-Todd-Rogers-Score-05-51%3Fp%3D945911%26viewfull%3D1">write</a> in the decision on the Twin Galaxies website. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371231/</a></p>
