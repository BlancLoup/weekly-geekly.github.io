  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication for everyone: Grandstream Networks news</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Grandstream Networks develops SIP telephony and unified communications solutions for organizations of all sizes.  Let us consider briefly what has been recently introduced by the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60e/e68/f87/60ee68f8791d432d862136e20c228f00.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When the main vendors actively entered the era of IP telephony, few people took into account in their strategic plans that with the development of VoIP, the industry will also move towards the openness of the program code and protocols.  Freely developing SIP protocol and the Asterisk platform * quickly adopt the proprietary functionality developed by companies.  Solutions that have costly in the past, such as contact centers, conferences, the so-called additional telephony functionality, in which developers still invest a lot of resources, are becoming increasingly difficult to sell. <br><br>  Grandstream Networks, which does not have such baggage, has focused on developing devices that use only open protocols and work only in open systems.

      <b>IP phones</b> <br><br>  Park Grandstream IP-phones recently added a new line - the 17th series.  This family of devices has filled a niche between the High-End models and the basic phones of the previous series - the so-called Mid-Range devices.  This range of models is designed to supplant the most simple phones that are commonly used in the office by ordinary employees of companies.  They will provide more functionality for a reasonable price, displacing low cost devices to places where communication is only needed periodically - for example, in the lobby or in the common rooms.  The new series also boasts a very elegant design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc3/1f7/ee7/bc31f7ee7c344f4b9308a09f0b1651f2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the main advantages of this line is the appearance of a large number of virtual keys (24 or 32 depending on the model), on which you can program various functions, such as speed dialing or an extension with its status.  You can go through the entire list of such keys by simply flipping through the display, which makes working with new models easy and convenient.  It is also worth noting that these devices have the ability to create a conference of up to five participants and support many SIP lines. <br><br>  <b>Gateways</b> <br><br>  The replenishment of the Grandstream analog adapters is also new - the new models HT802, HT812 and HT814 have appeared, which will completely replace earlier devices with similar functionality.  Solutions are designed for both office and home accommodation in case of remote work.  They can also be used by large providers to provide a large number of customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d37/00c/29d/d3700c29d8a6443e83a0aaa96d8d985d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A new look and a simple monochrome display on the front panel allow devices to seamlessly fit into any interior.  Network and analog ports are marked with different colors.  Automatic device configuration is supported using Zero Config, TR-069 and XML - this simplifies connection for users with any level of training. <br><br>  The HT812 and HT814 adapters for 2 and 4 FXS lines received a NAT router inside, which makes it easy to install them as takeaways.  Also worth noting is the support for the OPUS broadband codec and the possibility of registering on the backup server. <br><br>  <b>IP PBX</b> <br><br>  The new line of IP-PBX UCM6200 comes to replace the already popular UCM6100 series.  Despite the fact that the externally new models UCM6202, UCM6204 and UCM6208 are visually very similar to the devices of the previous family, they have a number of significant differences.  UCM6200 has an improved element base.  All models of the new series will have a NAT router and a DHCP server, in particular, in the UCM6208 device, the number of supported users will increase to 800, and simultaneous conversations - to 100. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/846/f3d/ff0846f3d8b0406aaf12cb23f72a966b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The UCM6100 and UCM6200 devices have the same firmware, which allows you to easily transfer the configuration and saved data to a new PBX.  Naturally, all the functionality is preserved, and with the updates, new functions will continue to appear, both for the old and for the new line.  Of these features include: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Zero Config support from different subnets; <br>  ‚Ä¢ transfer calls without put on hold; <br>  ‚Ä¢ IPv6 support; <br>  ‚Ä¢ integration with Salesforce CRM and SugarCRM; <br>  ‚Ä¢ PMS integration with H-Mobile hotel service; <br>  ‚Ä¢ conference scheduling and Google calendar integration; <br>  ‚Ä¢ sending faxes from a web portal; <br>  ‚Ä¢ automatic routing of incoming faxes. <br><br>  You can follow the appearance of the new functionality <a href="http://www.grandstream.com/">on the company's website</a> .  In the ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù section on the firmware page for all products there are documents called Release Notes, where you can find a list and a detailed description of the new features. <br><br>  <b>VCS and IPVideoTalk Systems</b> <br><br>  But the update versions in video conferencing systems GVC3200 and GVC3202 is mainly associated with the advent of support for the IPVideoTalk cloud service.  The service itself also acquired new features.  Users can not only watch and communicate with voice during video conferencing via Chrome and Firefox browsers, but also transmit the image from the camera or broadcast content from the screens of their computers.  Thus, a video conference can take place with the image broadcast to up to eight participants simultaneously.  The rest of the interlocutors can watch and talk in a voice, at any time by connecting to the video ether if they give up their place.  In connection with these innovations, video mixing during IPVideoTalk conferences is now performed in the cloud in HD or Full HD quality, depending on the selected license at 15 frames per second.  It is worth noting that the IPVideoTalk application is also available for Android and iOS. <br><br>  Video conferencing can be combined using GVC modules.  The conference leader has a number of ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù features, for example, can prohibit the participants from showing the entire list of attendees.  He can also leave the conference, leaving the rest of the participants to continue the conversation.  Any participant can replace the leader by entering a special four-digit code. <br><br>  <b>DECT</b> <br><br>  The new DECT model from Grandstream consists of two devices - the base station DP750 and the wireless phone DP720.  It is worth noting that the previous version, consisting of the DP715 and DP710, is discontinued and not compatible with the new solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25f/7d2/f94/25f7d2f944714aeca0551e6809468b99.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The DP750 base station allows you to register up to five DP720 devices and process up to four simultaneous calls.  The range of the station - 300 meters in open areas and 50 meters indoors.  The DP750 supports up to 10 SIP accounts and can distribute them to all DECT handsets connected to it.  The ability to connect to the POE provides more opportunities for mounting devices on the walls. <br><br>  The handset is equipped with 800mAh batteries, which allows up to 250 hours of work in standby mode and up to 20 hours with uninterrupted conversation.  The model is equipped with a 1.8-inch color screen.  The menu has become much more convenient - using features such as call hold and call forwarding, call pickup, and organizing a tripartite conference has become much easier. <br><br>  Expanded the ability to work with contacts.  Global and downloadable private contact lists with up to 3,000 entries are supported, as well as LDAP.  It is possible to register the handset simultaneously on the four bases of the DP750, which allows increasing the fault tolerance and expanding the telephone operation area.  The functionality of the phone includes a speakerphone, call waiting and auto answer.  Charging can be done not only using the base, but also through a cable with a microUSB connector.  Work without batteries is also supported. <br><br>  <b>Wi-Fi hotspots and routers</b> <br><br>  Grandstream also launched a number of new products for the market - wireless access points and routers.  These solutions will enable customers to quickly deploy a network using a convenient web interface. <br><br>  The first access point GWN7610 is designed to build wireless networks in large, companies of any scale.  The ease of use of the model is in the presence of a controller that is built into each GWN7610 and allows you to control 50 points at a time.  An intuitive web interface allows you to quickly and easily configure all connected points.  GWN7610 can work as a separate unit that does not require a controller.  The solution is ideal for small rooms where only a few access points are planned.  To get started, just connect the model using POE. The presence of two Gigabit Ethernet ports ensures fault tolerance when connecting GWN7610 to another network.  Omnidirectional antennas with MIMO 3x3: 3 can cover up to 150 meters, and support for the 802.11ac wave 2 standard provides speeds of up to 1300 Mbps.  The ability to work in Dual Band mode provides excellent call quality and allows you to connect users at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz at the same time.  GWN7610 allows you to create up to 16 SSIDs with the ability to use different VLANs to limit traffic.  QOS technology provides high quality voice and video for telephony and video conferencing devices such as the GXV3240, GXV3275 and GVC3200.  And WPA2-Enterprise support will allow authentication and authorization using a third-party Radius server, while increasing network security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b4/37f/559/8b437f559a2544e0af4e4fc5a6ccdd67.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The next innovation from Grandstream Networks will be the GWN7000 routers, which will allow you to complement the functionality of the wireless network and perform high-quality configuration wired.  It is planned that the built-in controller will allow you to manage up to 500 access points at the same time, which will make it possible to build wireless networks on a huge scale with centralized control.  The GWN7000 will have 7 Gigabit Ethernet ports, of which 2 WAN ports and 5 LAN ports, as well as two USB3.0 connectors through which you can connect a printer, a 3G / 4G LTE modem or additional storage.  The use of a 3G / 4G LTE modem will provide connectivity in cases where the wired connection has been disabled for some reason. <br><br>  <b>Office intercom</b> <br><br>  Another interesting novelty from Grandstream Networks was the IP intercom GDS3710.  This is an IP65 vandal-resistant device designed to control the access of persons to the premises.  The solution is equipped with LED-backlit and touch screen.  The device is easily integrated with the existing video surveillance system, which will allow you to use the DVR and to store records from the intercom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/247/b62/80a/247b6280ad264c22bc0ff3b62de46864.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  For video compression, the GDS3710 uses H.264 and MJPEG codecs.  the intercom is equipped with a two-megapixel Full HD camera with a 180-degree view and an integrated RFID reader.  It allows you to use an access card to open the door.  At the same time there is no need to use separate cards for the intercom - you can program existing ones. <br><br>  One of the advantages of the solution is the presence of a SIP-account, which allows you to integrate the intercom with the existing telephony system.  Thus, you can call the intercom and open the door, using the pre-programmed code from the phone. <br><br>  Model GDS3710 has all the most necessary telephony features: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ support for encryption using SRTP; <br>  ‚Ä¢ user authentication using Radius server; <br>  ‚Ä¢ support for voice codecs such as G.711 Œº / a law and G.722. <br><br>  In addition, a number of important functions migrated from the Grandstream camcorders.  So, motion detection allows you to track movement in the observed territory.  A Privacy mask makes it possible to close certain areas from the record.  The intercom also provides for the connection of third-party sensors and devices - for example, a sound or light alarm system.  To connect the intercom to the network, you can use either the power supply or POE. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324782/</a></p>
