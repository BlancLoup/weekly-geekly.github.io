The phrase UX was invented by Donald Norman in 1993, when he worked at Apple. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI came up with the term because the concepts of‚Äú human interface ‚Äùand‚Äú usability ‚Äùwere too narrow.  I wanted to cover all aspects of personal experience with a system that includes industrial design, graphics, interface, physical interaction and user manual.  Since then, the term has spread widely, so that it began to lose its meaning, ‚Äùsaid Norman in 2007 in <a href="http://adaptivepath.org/ideas/e000862/">an interview with</a> Adaptive Path.

      UX is the realm between design and analytics: designers think about what sensations a product evokes and develop prototypes. <br><br>  Sometimes UX companies call <b>UXD</b> or <b>UED</b> - <b>user experience design</b> ( <b>user experience design</b> ), <b>XD</b> - <b>experience design</b> (design experience). <br><br>  <b>The UI</b> is the <b>user interface</b> .  One of the authors of the term - the founder of "Adaptive Path" Jess Garrett defines the UI as the sphere of interface elements: tables of color codes, text and buttons. <br><br>  The task of the UI is to make the product understandable and easy to use.  Often, the UX and UI designer are one person: he tests prototypes on his own and imposes them for the web developer. <br><br>  <b>IxD</b> is an <b>interaction design</b> (interaction design or interaction design).  The term was introduced by Bill Moggridge, working on the first GRiD Compass laptop in 1984. <br><br>  At the core of IxD is animation inside interfaces: moving icons, menus, transitions, gifs.  Motion designers are working on IxD. <br><br>  Consider the terms used by UX designers and testers when they talk about the structure of a product, its goals or interaction with customers: CX, AI, UX Ecosystem, SD. <br><br>  <b>CX</b> - <b>customer experience</b> .  It is part of the UX, includes the experience of the brand, most often - online stores. <br><br>  CX-design focuses on several factors: usability of the site, user reviews, customer loyalty index - <b>NPS</b> (from the English. <b>Net Promoter Score</b> ). <br><br>  <b>IA</b> - <b>information architecture</b> .  The basis of IA is a site or application map: it helps to understand where the user is and how the content is organized. <br><br>  Information architecture is a table, classification, menu.  IA's goal is to help the user quickly find information. <br><br>  <b>UXE</b> - <b>user experience ecosystem</b> .  One of the authors of the term is UX-designer The Nerdery Dave Jones.  He defines UXE as a ‚Äúset of relationships between components in an information environment."  Components are people, their goals and practices, digital and analog technologies that they use to communicate and exchange information, as well as the information they share. <br><br>  <b>SD</b> - <b>service design</b> .  <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">Interaction Design</a> defines SD as: ‚ÄúService design is the organization of people, infrastructure, and communications in such a way as to improve the quality of interaction between the service provider and customers.‚Äù <br><br>  The goal of SD is to design a convenient, understandable service for customers that will successfully compete with other offers on the market. <br><br><h3>  Where to read about UX, UXD, CX, UI, IxD: </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/">Interaction design</a> <br>  The largest electronic library with free UX / UI materials in English. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-interaction-design/">Complete beginners guide to interaction design</a> <br>  User interaction principles, guidelines and useful tools.
