At the most crucial moment, this very connection falls and you find yourself without communication.  But I will not get ahead, everything is in order.

      The second case, happened a month later, another friend of mine Denis, at a table in a cafe, effectively took out an egg-shaped (yota egg) device and organized a Wi-Fi grid for us so that we could use the network.  It was on Tverskaya, in the center of Moscow, and then it made an impression on me. <br><br>  Actually, from this point on, I am already oriented towards the reviews of my acquaintances and become a user of Iota.  The case was provided on the eve of the birthday, my friend from Voronezh gave me an Iota - egg - a plague as it seemed, then a Wi-Fi distributive thing.  (date of sale end of September 2009) <br><br>  But!  As a rule, when giving presents, a check is not presented, but I didn‚Äôt demand a check and didn‚Äôt come to my head (tell me, who will come?) And as it turned out it was a fatal mistake - a device for 5 thousand can be thrown out!  But more about this in more detail below.  And all this because the firmware tends to perish irretrievably. <br><br>  At home, on the first floor - this thing refused to work completely, apparently due to the thick autumn foliage that will prevent you from receiving the signal.  Well, since I am a humane person and did not cut the trees under the window, I took this thing to the office. <br><br>  Then hell started, periodically the device was working / hanging / dying - but it was always still alive / rebooted and started, the breaks reached several hours, and the employees reached a frenzy. <br><br>  Since there was no alternative for the iota, and the move to another office was coming, the staff "prickled, but continued to eat the cactus" - which is to say that the device completely refused to work and distribute Wi-Fi for more than 3 computers, especially if there were Macs . <br><br>  We decided to wait and check the work in the new office, since it was closer to the center. <br><br>  The first 4 days of the new year passed in celebration and fun, then the problems continued, the device bravely and courageously died at the right moment, the network always burned orange and everything began to spit.  But the real problems started later, when the tenant‚Äôs Internet provider asked if we had Internet and, having learned what Yota was, shook his head - they say ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt work here‚Äù.  Never mind?!  She generally stopped working after his arrival!  Then I will tell you about my research - it turns out that many business centers jam wimax in order not to lose clients.  A small agency printing business cards not far from DHL at m. Airport comes to the memory, the guys had no alternatives and they also ‚Äúeaten the cactus‚Äù of Yota. <br><br>  So, it turns out there are companies offering several types of signal jammers, and selling them in Russia, I will not personally advertise them - who will always want to find it - the device is called ‚ÄúCrab 2527‚Äù <br>  Sterilizes WiMax within a radius of 80 meters, with a signal strength of a WIMAX base station provider 20 dB, in open space, at least 100 meters, listen, at least 100 meters!  And it can work 24 hours a day.  Having installed several such devices at the price of up to 42,000 rubles.  You (if you are a landlord) will restore your monopoly on the Internet.  And after all, they can periodically turn on these jammers, bringing the landlords to full agony. <br><br>  Here we are in such agony, and we are. <br>  More interesting, after the move - when the iota was still working somehow (before the provider arrived from the landlord), we decided to put the device in the office - the GD2808 wireless ip camera distributing the picture to 10 wifi users, the device turned on - its native software showed that it found The device is online and following the instructions offered to open the camera settings in IE.  It was a fatal move! <br><br>  It turns out - the settings have opened Yota! <br>  Moreover, the most fantastic is that there is no indication that these are iota settings and it was not close! <br>  As it turned out later, this is the secret Korean admin joke. <br>  Having no idea that iota opened, I began to change the settings as I thought the camera, at the point - working as an Access Point (access point) - I was pleasantly surprised, thinking it was a sinful thing that the device (and the price as a decent router is 7500 rubles) work as a router!  (And why not, the socket for the network cable was in the case) <br><br>  And suddenly, everything is lost, there is no Internet, no camera, or anything that does not work!  It turned Yota Egg died forever. <br>  But the documentation states that resetting to factory settings is possible by clicking on Reset - nonsense!  Lies!  Egg dies forever! <br>  You can log in to the admin panel by trying 192.168.1.1/admin or 192.168.1.254/admin password / login as from the camera admin / admin <br><br>  There are a lot of interesting settings, but be careful - you can kill an egg. <br>  Went to change this "egg" - at least reset to factory settings. <br><br>  Further more, the iota turns out to be one for the whole of Russia a technical center, located on the Taganskaya - radial. <br><br>  Had arrived.  The head of the center, a certain Andrew, kindly talked, thank you Andrew for a psychotherapy session, but you did not help. <br><br>  Formally, the warranty period is calculated either from the date of production of the goods, or from the date of issuance of the cash voucher.  As you understand, I didn‚Äôt have a check, because this device is a gift, and the device was manufactured in December 2009.  That is, when I arrived on January 13, 2011, I received a paper formal reply, with a bunch of spelling errors, that no replacement will be made. <br><br>  And here is an interesting moment, Andrey from my arguments understands that the device cannot teleport and clear customs instantly, and moreover be certified at Rostest, which <b>means that the cashier‚Äôs check could be broken no earlier than January-February 2010.</b>  .  Further more, Andrei hints - what a certain letter can show - from a person we both know, with a valid description of the situation.  (This is what he hints at my post on the Yotatester.ru website where I described honestly what I did and how I asked and how to fix the situation without coming to their office.) The tricky manager compared my email with the email of the person who posted the post.  Yes, for God's sake, I describe here in detail how your fucking Yota jot died.  This does not mean that you do not have to be human during the warranty period, and if it is written in your manual that it is possible to switch to the factory settings - so just ensure it! <br><br>  From that moment on, complete nonsense went, he realizes that if the check were in place - he would have to change the device, but since there is no check - they apparently considered me as a kind of hacker who hacked their unhappy whit, and refused to meet them.  Purely formal approach, not designed for the client.  Which by negligence killed the firmware. <br><br>  At one time, the American network Nordstream took back car wheels from an angry customer, and she had never traded wheels before!  But you will tell me - ‚Äúdo not forget what country you live in‚Äù and you will be right.  The service is # nute by nature, and not a damn thing changes. <br><br>  It turns out that iota has several legal entities, which is very reasonable from the point of view of such claims, one Yota Retail LLC sells devices, the other - Scartell benefits from subscribers.  And he offers to write me a claim to a completely different legal entity that provides wimax service - this is almost rubbish and nonsense, it's like writing to MTS that you have a phone and have their SIM card - and you ask them to repair your warranty phone .  And what's more, the service is so weak that you can't reflash this Egg for money!  That is, the myth of the YOTA service center is confirmed, because the guys managers who know how to reset the modem settings to default and know how to set passwords are clearly not what the service center means, they can‚Äôt even reflash the modem. <br><br>  In my argument that my monthly fee will sooner or later cover the costs of replacing the Eggs, they have not had any effect.  It is understandable, they do not want losses at any cost.  Since the benefits of the subs.  board gets another ure face! <br><br>  And now I‚Äôve harbored a grudge against them and I‚Äôll never use the service, you stick this egg to yourself, I offered this to Andrei, to which he politely refused, dear comrades from the Yotov - you have service about anything, you have a connection about anything and it turned out too about anything. <br><br>  Personally, Andrei - the head of the technical center at Taganskaya Radial - you could not resolve the problem, tried not to say goodbye to merge quickly, you did not want to change almost under warranty, one device, ok - no problem.  Maybe you then want to change a bunch of devices?  How do you figure 10?  Or maybe better than 100?  Who suddenly have the same problem?  You still give an iota for 7 days in testing? <br><br>  Then I go to you. <br><br>  I will come every day with a new killed device, but this time with a warranty card and a cash voucher and a box.  So that you understand how to work. <br><br>  PS: The brief essence of the negative is that the instructions say about the possibility of "restoring factory settings" - and this does not happen.  And no matter how they do it, since I do not have a check for the device. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111878/</a></p>
