  <section class="page js-page"><h1>14 phrasal verbs for telephone and Skype-talks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the development of technology, it has become possible to conduct negotiations remotely, with the help of programs and applications that help to establish audio and video communication with an interlocutor, even if you are on different sides of the ocean.  And secretaries and personal assistants often have to call overseas offices for various business issues.  Let's see which phrasal verbs will help with such remote communication.  Selection for the usual negotiations <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/puzzleenglish/blog/298791/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Put through (to) </h3><br>  A verb that comes in handy from the very first second of a conversation when you need to ask you to connect with someone.  This verb means “connect with”, <i>“to connect”</i> . <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  Could you put me through to Mary Jones, please? </blockquote><br><h3>  2. Put on </h3><br>  To many, this verb will be familiar with meanings that have nothing to do with telephone conversations.  For example, it means "to put on."  But in our context, it means “hand over”. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  I talked to Jane a bit, and then she put Lily on. </blockquote><br><h3>  3. Call back / ring back </h3><br>  Two synonyms that mean the same thing - "call back."  Remember that the word <i>“recall”</i> does not matter to “call back”!  This is a polysemous word, one of its meanings - “to remember”, “to remember”.  And we call back only with the help of phrasal verbs or the phrase <i>“I'll call you later”.</i>

      <br>
      <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  - Can I speak to Mr.  Rogers, please? <br>  - he is out for a meeting. <br>  - OK, I will call back then. </blockquote><br><h3>  4. Get through </h3><br>  A useful verb for both phone and Skype.  <i>“Get through,”</i> among other things, means “phone calls.”  And here he has a little in common with his other meaning “to do something complicated,” “to do away with something.”  This verb is appropriate in cases where a person did not answer for a long time, the line was busy or the connection was unimportant. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  I couldn't get through, the line was engaged. </blockquote><br><h3>  5. Get back to </h3><br>  Oddly enough, even to the verb <i>“call back”</i> is a synonym.  True, he has a slightly different meaning.  In essence, <i>“get back to”</i> also means calling back.  But as a rule, you can <i>“get back to someone”</i> only if you have left a message or you have already spoken, and your partner needed to be interrupted.  That is, <i>“call back” is</i> possible without prior communication, but for <i>“get back to” you</i> need some kind of prerequisite. <br><br>  Also, unlike <i>“call back”</i> , which requires a phone call, the verb <i>“get back to”</i> can be used without being tied to the phone.  For example, your colleague brought you a report or documents, and you have no time to talk with him and discuss what was written.  In this case, you ask a colleague to come back later.  And then to the existing verb one more (yes, third!) Preposition <i>“on”</i> will be added, which will mean “on” [some topic] (see Example 2). <br><br>  <b>Examples:</b> <br><blockquote>  There is a message on the answering machine.  But no one has got back to me yet. <br><br>  Can you get it back? </blockquote><br><h3>  6. Cut off (sometimes cut out) </h3><br>  If the connection is very bad and is interrupted, then the verb <i>“cut off”</i> will come in handy.  He just means "break off."  The main thing is not to forget that in such cases this verb is used in the passive voice, because it is not the connection that breaks something, but it is cut off. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  But we got cut off. <br><br>  I couldn't reach you. </blockquote><br><h3>  7. Break up </h3><br>  This is another verb about poor communication quality.  He means "interrupted."  If you do not hear the interlocutor, you can say this: <br><blockquote>  Sorry, you are breaking up, I didn't hear that very well.  Could you repeat, please? </blockquote><br><h3>  8. Make out </h3><br>  And the third verb of misunderstanding.  Whether it is bad communication or unintelligible speech of the interlocutor, it’s better to say <i>“I can't make out what you saying”</i> instead of <i>“I don't understand you”</i> .  In the second case, you may get the impression that you do not understand the language or the emphasis of the interlocutor. <br><br><h3>  9. Hold on </h3><br>  This verb is well known to many: it is universally used in books, films, and recordings of foreign answering machines.  It means "stay on the line."  If you are a secretary or an assistant, feel free to ask the caller <i>“to hold on”</i> while you inform the employee or boss about the call.  By the way, this verb has an informal <i>hang on</i> option. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  - Is Mr.  Leeds in the office?  I need to talk to him. <br>  - Hold it on, please. </blockquote><br><h3>  10. Pass on (a message) </h3><br>  If you want to ask your interlocutor if he wants to leave a message, you will say <i>“Would you like to leave a message?”</i> .  And if you want to promise or assure the person that his message will be delivered to the addressee, you can use the verb <i>“pass on”</i> . <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  I'll pass the message on. </blockquote><br><h3>  11. Set up </h3><br>  We already came across this verb when we talked about organizing the meeting.  This verb means “arrange (meet)” and is synonymous with the verb <i>“to schedule”</i> .  In the case of Skype calls, this verb means exactly the same thing, plus the usual “set up”.  For example, you can instruct assistants to set up a camera and check the operation of the microphone before calling via Skype: <br><blockquote>  We need to set up the call with Ms.  Jimenez, could you check if this laptop has Skype installed and functioning, please? </blockquote><br><h3>  12. Pick up </h3><br>  This verb has about a dozen different meanings, but in a telephone context it means “pick up the phone” or “answer”. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  I've been calling them all morning long, no one picks up. </blockquote><br><h3>  13. Hang up </h3><br>  The antonym of the verb <i>“pick up”</i> is the verb <i>“hang up”</i> .  However, you need to be careful.  Just <i>“hang up”</i> means “hang up” and quite friendly to end the conversation.  But if you say <i>“He hung up on me”</i> , then it will already mean that at the end of the call the call was cut off on purpose.  Simply put, you didn’t hear out and threw the phone. <br><br>  <b>Examples:</b> <br><blockquote>  Don't forget to hang up when you've finished speaking. <br><br>  I can't believe she hung up on me! </blockquote><br><h3>  14. Call up / phone up </h3><br>  As we know, native English speakers have a simple rule: colloquially, a phrasal verb is much better than a regular verb.  Therefore, instead of the usual “ <i>call</i> ”, you can hear the verbs “ <i>call up</i> ” and “ <i>phone up</i> ” with exactly the same meaning.  This does not mean that by using the verb “ <i>call</i> ” in these sentences, you will be mistaken.  Just phrasal verbs will make your speech more alive. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> <br><blockquote>  If you’re looking for something to do. <br><br>  I called him up. </blockquote><br><h3>  If you want to upgrade English, come to us </h3><br>  Readers of the blog give a <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/prices%3Fcoupon_id%3D36%26pes%3Dgeektimes_phrasalwork_coup">coupon for 500 rubles</a> for the purchase of a subscription, which includes 8 types of training and weekly mailings about English grammar and vocabulary - "Vitaminki" and "Buns".
