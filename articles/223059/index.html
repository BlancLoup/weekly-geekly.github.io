Sometimes the topic of analysis at such conferences is completely forgotten.  We wanted to do something completely different and, more importantly, more useful, albeit for a less broad circle of people. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      And, as a result of our work, on May 24 everyone will be able to take part in the already third <a href="http://www.analystdays.ru/">Analyst Days</a> conference, which is 100% dedicated to business and systems analysis.  After all, analysts are people who deserve to have their own platform for communication and hone skills. <br><br>  And it‚Äôs not for nothing that the highlight of Analyst Days lies in the people themselves - the organizers, speakers and participants - for analysts have an exceptionally systematic thinking and attention to detail, which, among other things, shapes their outlook on life as well as their course of action.  What does it mean?  And the fact that a large concentration of such people ultimately creates an incredible atmosphere, which everyone should get into. <br><br>  <b>Analyst Days-III: features and traditions</b> <br><br>  Analyst Days is a rather young conference, and on May 24, 2014, it will be held only for the third time.  She still has everything ahead, but now you can already note a number of traditions and new emerging features transmitted from event to event. <br><br>  We, as the organizers of Analyst Days, are always open to any relevant topics.  Therefore, the main tradition of the conference is to stay on the crest of today's events.  At the same time, the details of the event are determined by the speakers themselves, because when submitting reports they choose the topic in which they are most powerful and in which they feel most comfortable.  On the part of the jury, we organize a strict selection.  As a result, thanks to this multilateral approach, it is possible to create a unique product that is truly useful for the participants, which allows you to retain enthusiasm and desire to work effectively at the event from one side and the other throughout the day. <br><br>  In addition, each subsequent conference is held in a new city, which makes it possible to place particular emphasis on the specifics of a particular region thanks to the participation of a pool of speakers from local companies.  It does not do without the "fresh blood", in the face of visiting speakers with their unique projects, ideas and international experience. <br><br>  Analyst Days come to analyst from various cities and countries.  They are involved in a wide variety of projects, and a conference is a great way to share experiences and learn from the experiences of others.  After all, analysis is a relatively young industry, so it is especially interesting to observe how it develops, what techniques and approaches it uses, how it solves problems from a technological point of view.  In addition, the event allows you to trace the amazing relationship of the analysis phase with other phases of the project life cycle. <br><br>  This year, Analyst Days will be held in Moscow - a large business conglomerate, with large mature companies, in which systems and business analysis processes are developed at a high enough level.  Therefore, extremely interesting reports from a number of major players are expected at the conference, and not only from the IT market.  And this is another distinctive feature of this conference: on May 24, it will be possible to learn about the vision of systems and business analysis not only IT companies, but also many large industrial, banking and trading enterprises that have specialized departments with extensive experience in this field. <br><br>  <b>Why not to miss Analyst Days III</b> <br><br>  Analyst Days 2014 is a very large community of professionals, within which more than 400 analysts will be able to talk on the sidelines with perennial ‚Äúmostadontami‚Äù and promising ‚Äúyoungsters‚Äù, as well as to hear 26 reports from experts from completely different companies, cities and countries. <br><br>  This conference is an incomparable complex of presentations about tools, methodologies and standards, stories about the practical experience of each expert and, of course, informal communication and leisure with colleagues. <br><br>  During the conference day, participants will receive information many times more than attending specialized trainings.  You do not need to look for scattered and often dubious information on the Internet.  Everyone will receive a ‚Äúready-to-use‚Äù knowledge extract that can be immediately incorporated into their daily work.  In addition, the conference will allow to answer many questions that our participants face.  Many will find a solution to problems that are difficult to cope alone. <br><br>  A nice bonus for all participants will be an additional <a href="http://www2.sqalab.ru/ru/training/sqalab/trainings/15168/15173/19561%3FtrainingId%3D19562">training day</a> on May 23, where all the ‚Äúfighters‚Äù of the analytical front will receive targeted training. <br><br>  Analyst Days is an event due to which the system and business analysis industry continues to actively develop in the right directions by increasing the level of knowledge and skills of its participants.  Therefore, today every analyst has the opportunity to contribute to the development of the sphere, simply by <a href="http://analystdays.com/ru/registration">registering</a> and taking part in the conference on May 24. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223059/</a></p>
