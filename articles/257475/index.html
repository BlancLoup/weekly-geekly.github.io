Today, in this article, we want to talk about the most common reasons for not using a callback widget on websites.  The reason for writing the article was the analysis of failures that were collected by our sales managers and consultants.  Go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need it - we are fine‚Äù </h2><br>  This reason is the most common and seemingly can be attributed to the category of excuses (so that the manager is behind), but in fact a significant part of the leadership of certain companies really thinks so.  We do not deny that some are really doing well, and this suits them perfectly.  But in this case, the words from the book of Peter the Great by Alexey Nikolaevich Tolstoy come to mind: <br><br><blockquote><h4>  ‚ÄúWho is pleased with everything, but does not want to change the good for the best - to lose everything‚Äù </h4></blockquote><br>  Often our managers ask: ‚Äú <i>Let me clarify.</i>  <i>If I understand you correctly, then you do not need to increase the effectiveness of advertising the site?</i>  <i>You do not need to sales did not stand idle?</i>  <i>In the end, you do not need additional sales?</i>  " <br><br>  And in 80% percent the answer to all questions is one: ‚Äú <i>Why?</i>  <i>Of course you need!</i>  ".  And after that, the conversation flows into a completely different direction, as the level of interest increases dramatically.  And given that we offer a really working technology and at an affordable cost, the profit is obvious.

    <h2>  2. ‚ÄúPop-ups will annoy my clients.  Thank you but no." </h2><br>  When it comes to the display type of the widget, when the phrase ‚Äúpop-up window‚Äù or ‚Äúpop-up form‚Äù sounds scared, ‚Äú <i>Oooh, no.</i>  <i>We do not need this!</i>  ". <br><br>  For a sharp negative to the pop-up elements, you need to ‚Äúthank‚Äù the ‚Äúmarketers‚Äù of the non-schoolers (and webmasters-moneymakers) who absolutely do not know the measures when using any technology to retain or attract customers.  Hellish, ugly windows that appear every 15 seconds, and an alert when trying to close a tab.  Br-rr-r. <br><br>  Probably everyone will be able to remember a visit to such a site.  Our clients are no exception, and it is because of this that they have unpleasant associations. <br><br>  We always oppose such methods and we strongly advise not to display the widget more than 1-2 times per session.  Also, in order not to annoy returning visitors, we introduced the option ‚ÄúShow only to new visitors‚Äù.  In addition, you can make the widget passive, that is, it will be shown only by clicking on the animated mini-widget, or on a link or button. <br><br><h2>  3. ‚ÄúThese your widgets are not working.  We set, but there were no calls. ‚Äù </h2><br>  In this situation, everything is quite difficult.  To fully understand the cases you need to get the following information: <br><br><ol><li>  What sells the site. </li><li>  The period of the widget on the site </li><li>  Site traffic for the duration of the widget. </li><li>  Conditions for displaying the widget. </li></ol><br>  If a company sells, for example, monopods (especially if they are not heaped up), then it is likely that there will be few calls.  Since the product is simple (in fact, a stick for attaching a smartphone) and with photos, information about the characteristics, price and delivery of applications can be completely at a minimum.  Why?  Yes, because everything is clear: it remains only to make a decision - to buy or not. <br><br>  Often faced with the situation that the client put the widget literally half a day, received 1 call and filmed it.  By itself, such a result did not seem to him something impressive.  In order to really understand how effectively the widget will work in your case, you need to use it at least a week, or better, a month. <br><br>  Traffic.  It's all easier nowhere.  With an attendance of 15-20 people a day, one should not expect a miracle at all.  In addition, some of this traffic will somehow not be targeted. <br><br>  Terms of the show.  With a lack of interest of the visitor to show the widget does not make sense at all.  That is, the display of the widget ‚Äúat the entrance‚Äù will work only on the returning visitor, or, if you're lucky, you will fall for a visitor who wants to buy the product immediately and no matter where.  Or vice versa: there was an ‚Äúoverexposure‚Äù of the visitor, when the widget was displayed too late, and the coverage was insignificant. <br><br>  To all the above, we can add that in a given situation, several factors can play the role of several factors simultaneously.  And yet: you should not treat technology as a ‚Äúmagic button,‚Äù which immediately brings you many, many calls.  Since a lot depends on the level of competition, on your prices and conditions, on the quality and informativeness of the content on the site and many other factors. <br><br>  <i>And finally, we decided to show you a small successful case for introducing a callback widget:</i> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/74d/b4d/98c74db4dfb443e5909da0ab42da1dee.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>At first glance, it seems that due to the appearance of the widget, direct calls were reduced, but this is not quite true, because the decline in direct calls was affected by the approach of holidays.</i>  <i>And a little numbers: for the period when there was no widget, the average conversion into calls was 0.67%, and after the appearance - 0.87%.</i> <br><br>  In any case, it is better to try once than to read reviews about how this is all cool (or not cool) works.  For such cases, we, at <a href="https://uptocall.com/">UpToCall</a> , have a free tariff that includes 20 minutes to talk with customers. <br><br>  That's all for now.  We will be happy to answer your questions in the comments or PM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257475/</a></p>
