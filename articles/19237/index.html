I love ( <em>and can</em> ) find a good job.  I sit tight, monumental and comfortable, even if I sit lazily for several months.  Never wrote-sent " <em>summary</em> ";  always invited and caressed by familiar and unfamiliar admirers of <em>quality work</em> for the credible <em>amount</em> .  But even now, when I am in a calm and nourishing cruising harbor, I can be attracted by an attractive start-up mess. <br><br>  The above sounds like a mantra.  This is the <strong>mantra</strong> , which is realized in life.  A lot of <em>things</em> were on the road.  I decided to make a haphazard list of ‚Äú <strong>conditions</strong> ‚Äù tried in different places and talk to you about the importance of individual items. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <font>one</font> <br><br>  I will start with <strong>money</strong> (where would it be <em>without them</em> ?) At various times I met with offers from + 10% to + 100% (in fairness, I note that the second was withdrawn after the announcement of the initial salary amount).  ‚Äú <em>Black envelopes</em> ‚Äù deserve special attention.  In the turbulent nineties, an office in which <em>cute bonuses were</em> not practiced, could be safely called a concentration camp, and recorded in the ‚Äú <em>former</em> ‚Äù.  Now with this worse, but also nothing.  Although the statements: " <em>... and we still have a system of dynamic bonuses</em> " we can safely spit intra-abdominal saliva. <br><br>  <font>2</font> <br><br>  <strong>Social package</strong> .  In addition to generally accepted vacations and retirement plans ( <em>no, not too early</em> ), enticing sometimes offered up to four additional savings funds to choose from, as well as paying for courses to improve flowering qualifications.  Nobody promised medical and near-medical ‚Äúrazdols‚Äù (reasonably believing that a sufferer interested in advanced medicine does not need a healthy team in FIG).  However, once a massage therapist was offered the services (eh?), He did not use it. <br><br>  <font>3</font> <br><br>  <strong>Transportation</strong> .  Since the time of the junior ministry in the long-forgotten office, and the " <em>official travel</em> ", many times attracted (and attracted, yeah) machines and "taxi-to-home."  Did not decide what is best.  A free car is good; the fuel is not bad either;  I like to nap in a taxi, <em>that's the</em> whole thing. <br><br>  <font>four</font> <br><br>  <strong>Power</strong> .  Hot reusable.  No wonder, of course, everyone has.  And some have a bar.  But!  <strong>Good food</strong> is still rare, especially catering.  Moreover, it is inversely proportional to the quality of the collective and the democratic nature of the authorities.  Apparently young and not stupid cheerful people, the gods of imported food send constipation, especially for " <em>life-raspberry dissonance</em> ."  Once promised "sushi".  Long time ago, when <em>it</em> still meant something. <br><br>  <font>five</font> <br><br>  <strong>Team</strong>  Once called to " <em>bison</em> ", which, on occasion, " <em>poke their noses</em> ."  Initially, careers are very tempting (the one who is not tempting is an <em>eternal layman and ignoramus</em> ).  Later lured with all sorts of " <em>winners of everything in the world</em> " and " <em>designers of Coca-Cola</em> ‚Ñ¢."  Then it went differently (arthdir is usually not entertained with fables about " <em>career growth</em> "; where to grow?).  In one funny place they proudly reassured them that they did not hold homosexuals, blacks and ‚Äú <em>Jews</em> ‚Äù in their company.  Like, clean with us - pass.  I refused, said Negro. <br><br>  <font>6</font> <br><br>  <strong>Office.</strong>  When it is time for the ‚Äú <em>cubes-boxes</em> ‚Äù to pass, the location of the office and the surrounding landscape (with the ‚Äú <em>landscape</em> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <em>perspective</em> ‚Äù) become valuable.  Often they call in a <strong>stylish tower</strong> - pleasant to the soul and business card.  Although the seat on the sixtieth floor (and there was such a thing) pleases more ‚Äú <em>in the mind</em> ‚Äù than in reality.  Purely individual: I love beautiful parquet.  No one would think of this to attract, but once I came, squinted my eyes ... and stayed. <br><br>  <font>7</font> <br><br>  <strong>Gadgets</strong> .  Strangely, space ships for fifty years " <em>plowing the expanses of the universe,</em> " and issuing <strong>laptops</strong> , <strong>pockets</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> phones to employees, is still something special.  This is reported with some unusual stress, and almost disappointed when I do not start to bounce and clap at the thought that I will have a shabby ‚Äúpowerbook‚Äù.  However, it is convenient, and therefore worth the attention. <br><br>  <font>eight</font> <br><br>  And finally - " <strong>different</strong> ."  In one of the places where I (later) worked, the privilege of the <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/">designer</a> was to watch pristinely fresh films, coming to the special show, strapped to the arm of the gray-suit ‚Äú <em>representative</em> ‚Äù.  In the other there were <em>drugs</em> (you do not think anything bad: they were and were; just funny).  Almost all of them had a billiard table (and a ping-pong table).  And in one of the last - models are sailing. <br><br>  That's all, perhaps.  Specially did not say a word about " <em>very interesting projects</em> ."  Because it is trite, aha.  The partisan time, with the ‚Äú <em>wire clamped in the teeth of the dying signalman</em> ,‚Äù ‚Äútighter-tightened belts,‚Äù and so on, has passed.  It goes without saying that it is necessary to deal with interesting projects, but no one has canceled the <strong>quality of life</strong> . <br><br>  And to discuss with you, I would like the following: what attracted (or <strong>attracted</strong> ) you personally?  What is valuable <strong>to you</strong> when changing jobs?  What exactly will you leave for, or vice versa - will you stay, even if the circle of bullets are whistling?  Thoughts about <em>my</em> examples are also warmly welcomed (they can be used in comments <em>on numbers</em> , so it is more convenient). <br><br>  The original article (and discussion) is <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2008/01/23/designers-cheese/">in my blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19237/</a></p>
