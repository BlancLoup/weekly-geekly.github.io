  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google has opened a new data center priced at $ 600 million</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/e05/230/d03e05230403c915d2fa502ba90d3110.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  Google has opened a new data center in Oregon, with a total data center area of ‚Äã‚Äã15,240 m <sup>2</sup> .  Earlier, the company stated that the total amount of funds invested in the construction of a new data center <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2013/09/google_says_data_center_expans.html">is $ 600 million</a> .  Dulles has become a new home for the corporation's servers. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the first large data center of the corporation, which opened in 2006, was built in this city.  Since then, the construction of data centers for their needs has become an integral feature of business for a company, the number of users of which is increasing all the time.  Gmail, Google Drive, YouTube and other services of the company require more and more new capacities, and the corporation is trying to increase the capacity of its DCs in time, as well as build new ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The corporation chose the state of Oregon as a place with relatively inexpensive energy and very favorable tax policies.  The state does not levy taxes on the overwhelming number of types of equipment (worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of Google), which is installed in the DC.  Therefore, the company saves significant funds by building new DCs in Oregon.

      It should be noted that not many people work in the corporation data centers, since almost all processes are automated.  In addition, operations that need an operator can be performed remotely.  According to Dulles, Google‚Äôs data center employs about 175 people (including support staff). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d87/5b0/bc3/d875b0bc31212c970123fd50eec7ca52.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br>  <i>The first Google data center in Oregon, inside view</i> <br><br>  In agreement with local authorities, the corporation pays additional funds to the city.  Thus, according to the contract, the corporation paid $ 1.2 million to the city, county and local school district.  Thus, the city has additional funds, and it is logical that the authorities are willing to cooperate with the company.  Next year, the corporation will pay the local authorities about $ 800,000 - now this amount will be paid annually. <br><br>  Plans to create a new data center were announced last fall, when state legislators decided to levy a special tax on companies-owners of data centers, removing the tax burden. <br><br>  Now other companies, including Apple, Amazon, have announced their intention to expand existing data centers in Oregon, and create new ones.  But Google managed to be the first to agree with the authorities last year. <br><br>  The corporation is going to rent an additional room of 1.5 thousand square meters for a small team of engineers working in Portland.  Thus, the corporation will expand its office and give its team more working space.  Perhaps soon the Google Fiber project will start working in the region.  Details are now negotiated with local authorities.  And the law, which will remove part of the tax burden from the project, has already been approved by the state senate, and is awaiting signing by the governor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255497/</a></p>
