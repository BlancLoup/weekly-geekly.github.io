  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to release the game and make friends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, an inquisitive reader!  What they went through and what decisions they made, what is similar and what is completely different for two unequal, but somewhat similar indie games - this deserves a separate two articles.  But to improve your appetite, you have an easy article - a Friday motivator to do your own projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br>  The year <i>tDoSaoT</i> development <i>team</i> began very rapidly, namely with a large release of their first independent game.  The beginning of January, a seemingly rather unfortunate time for release, in spite of this, the game nevertheless achieved some success. <br><br>  In the same way, the <i>OpenMyGame</i> team continued its tradition of starting a new year with a new project.  This project was not the first and not much time was spent on its development.  But like all previous ones, this project was completed with a soul. <br><br>  Before, during and after the release, the game developer who loves his job looks at the tops.  To explore popular applications on the market and monitor their progress (or decline).  And it was thanks to the monitoring of the tops that two indie teams of one small but very proud country learned about each other.  All thanks to the new Google Play policy, which requires an indication of the developer's address when accepting payments in the application.  Coincidence?  I do not think.

      After the exchange of experience between the teams, we derived the following rules, made some conclusions and would like to share with you the first portion. <br><br>  <b>About games</b> <br>  <i>Feed Kota</i> is a colorful casual puzzle game with simple controls that require the player's attention and sharpness.  Driving as in 2048, it is necessary to feed all the cats with snacks (establish a one-to-one correspondence between the four-legged representatives of the feline squad and pastries). <br>  The game was created using Unity, so it is cross-platform (already available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id957859790">iOS</a> , <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.openmygame.games.catsandsweets">Android</a> , <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/feed-the-cat-with-sweets/409bdebd-0ce7-440c-af30-5c1bcacbe2af">Windows Phone</a> ).  It was made in two months, one month - the schedule, the second - the development.  The graphics turned out to be in an anime style, which led to success among the representatives of this trend.  There is no designer in the OpenMyGame team, so if you are a free artist with fire in your eyes - <a href="">call me maybe</a> ;). <br><br>  <i>Jelly Puzzle</i> is a classic from the point of view of mechanics and a rather original implementation puzzle, available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tdosaot.jellypuzzle">Android</a> .  To many, it reminds everyone the favorite tag game of childhood. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/fa1/4a1/f3afa14a12bc43e398e9611740046224.png"></div><br><br>  <b>Unity VS Samopisny engine</b> <br>  For writing <i>Jelly Puzzle</i> was chosen samopisny on the knees, the engine in C + +, which initially used only OpenGL ES 1.1, and later totally rewritten.  Many asked: <br><blockquote>  Why yourself?  Why not Unity and others like her? </blockquote>  I wanted to feel the whole process from the bottom, it seemed that it would be better.  Well, in general, because the programmer wanted.  And as one friend said: <blockquote>  Even if you're a thousand times right, what's the point if your programmer cries? </blockquote><br>  As a result, quite a functional engine, which is quite flexible for further development.  Nevertheless, the quality depends on the tools, even if they are virtual ones. <br><br>  When creating <i>Feed the Cat</i> , Unity was used.  Since the game is casual and immediately all the simple requirements for the game were clear, the choice was obvious.  Confidence added desire to perfectly understand this development environment, because potentially it is a very promising technology.  If Unity successfully succeeds in solving some of the current jambs, then we will not be equal in the market as a result.  Thanks to the use of Unity, today <i>Feed the Cat</i> is available for all three major mobile platforms. <br><br>  The conclusion on the engines is clear.  It all depends on your vision of the future of your team and your projects as well as on the chosen setting and game mechanics.  With a lot of drawbacks, the engine has one significant advantage - you can always easily expand or upgrade it, this possibility in commercial engines costs quite a lot of money.  But if you make the choice of the engine on the basis of price / quality, then the choice is obvious - ready-made cross-platform engine with a development environment convenient for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/349/dd0/94a/349dd094aedb19f72ddb1e497fb2599b.png" align="right" alt="happy"><br>  <b>In-app purchases</b> <br>  It was noticed VERY MANY attempts to hack payments on Android.  Therefore, verify the purchase necessarily, how to do this is written in many separate articles.  Decided to accept payments - so be concerned about security, if you value the ecosystem around your game. <br>  About the solvency of the Russian-speaking audience, Android applications are better or not at all, so let's focus on the positive. <br>  I am glad that the most popular purchase - ‚ÄúThanks to the developers !!!‚Äù is something to think about during times of total domination free to play monetization. <br><br>  <b>Do not add begging ratings before running the game</b> <br>  It can save you from unnecessary negativity.  There are always some shoals in the libraries or technologies you use.  There are always minor irregularities in the hands of the developer.  As soon as the game goes to the masses on all the zoo devices (especially Android) will get out all sorts of artifacts, so it is better to first see and fix what is possible.  And then collect the cream of satisfied users in the form of fives;) <br><br>  <b>Feedback</b> <br>  Be sure to respond to users, many of them correct the assessment, starting with understanding refers to the difficulties we face.  Again, testers will never check everything that users can create - consider not only complaints, but also suggestions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e64/35d/f15/e6435df15b35048db8226c4b82b6679c.png" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee8/3a8/05a/ee83a805a3e5ef756118799af4373ae4.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>The main thing - do not "score"!</b> <br>  Let it sound weird, but try not to think about money at the time when you make the game.  Otherwise, create another milking player with payvolami and other attributes of "funny farms." <br><br>  Set a time for yourself, and even lying on the couch, do it towards the dream.  Remember all your ideas, brilliant and very brilliant, and if you were waiting for a sign to get started, then <a href="">here it is</a> . <br>  As Uncle Branson said, ‚Äú <i>To hell with it, take it and do it!‚Äù</i>  Have a productive weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249875/</a></p>
