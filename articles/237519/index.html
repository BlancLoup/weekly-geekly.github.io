Disassemble to the bottom of the largest Apple smartphone, comparing with the iPhone 6 and 5S</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus went on sale at the same time, the larger diagonal version immediately became deficient.  Yesterday, while working on a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vilianov_inc/blog/237483/">post about parsing the "six"</a> , I received information about the real battle that unfolded in Europe for the iPhone 6 Plus.  To be honest, there was a moment when the hope of promptly receiving a copy for parsing almost melted.  In Paris, in Nice, in Munich - everywhere the first phablet (or smart card, as you like) Apple went on sale in small quantities and was instantly snapped up.  And already at about midnight the news came - one copy was nevertheless managed to be obtained.  On Saturday morning he arrived at a friendly service center, and we immediately began a total breakdown. <br><br>  Of course, not to look at the stuffing, but to observe the progress of Apple's engineering thought, the assessment of maintainability and comparison with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/211/edf/3e5/211edf3e5a83414b8aea1cbd25660222.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Let's face it: we found no radical differences between the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.  Of course, the absolute majority of the details are incompatible with each other, although sometimes it seems that the differences were made a little ... artificially.  iPhone 6 Plus reminds iPhone 6 under a magnifying glass - everything is about the same, but more. <br><br>  Judge for yourself.  Here is the iPhone 6 Plus with the cover removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/aa5/61b/124aa561bf2e4afaa79d12e5891fda9d.jpg"><br><br>  But the iPhone 6 <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vilianov_inc/blog/237483/">opened yesterday</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/202/c2a/3a8/202c2a3a8391462390e1e5b3b8bae131.jpg"><br><br>  If they do not lie close, you can be mistaken for twins. <br><br>  Moreover, when we removed the iPhone 6 Plus motherboard and put it on the half-assembled iPhone 6, they also turned out to be almost identical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0f/f11/d72/e0ff11d72910444cb167d168be5f14b8.jpg"><br><br>  The same layout, the same moisture protection.  Compared to the iPhone 5s, the difference is colossal, but not among themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93b/6fa/15a/93b6fa15a26d4faabf639da0b3fdb916.jpg"><br><br>  So, analysis is canceled, nothing interesting? <br><br>  Not really. <br><br>  First, you can be surprised by the size of the battery.  Compared to the iPhone 5s, it's just gigantic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02d/f07/a9e/02df07a9ea8f4da587dd8f3339ba4adf.jpg"><br><br>  With the "six" the difference is not so great, but there is, there is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52c/b2a/215/52cb2a2154224c0187abb633c733abd4.jpg"><br><br>  Those who watched the video from yesterday's post, saw how difficult it was to remove the battery from the iPhone 6, it was too firmly glued.  So in 6 Plus it is glued just tightly.  It took a very long time to heat the apparatus at the soldering station, and even after that, the battery was not easily removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85a/37a/ff0/85a37aff07f845608b0347a59f5d3810.jpg"><br><br>  However, it is not worth grumbling about this.  Changing the battery in the iPhone has rarely, but if it suddenly begins to hang inside the case - not enough good. <br>  Secondly, the design of the lower loop has changed.  We were glad yesterday how it became compact and well-knit, and in the iPhone 6 Plus it suddenly stretched out and looked like a fellow in the iPhone 5 s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/894/7a6/891/8947a68916b24745a665a2d600d8c36a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/5b1/13b/dc45b113b62e4564bb96cae07cb4e76c.jpg"><br><br>  And for comparison - with the iPhone 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57a/f1c/69b/57af1c69bdec4ca19711e460875e59a5.jpg"><br><br>  The connectors, as we can see, are the same, but the distance between them has greatly increased. <br><br>  Increased in size and the main speaker.  Yesterday <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vilianov_inc/blog/237483/">we noted</a> that it became healthy compared to its predecessor in the iPhone 5s, and so in 6 Plus even more.  Yelling so that wakes the dead.  In combination with a powerful vibration motor, which has migrated to the phablet from the normal-sized version, a very reliable alarm clock is obtained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/c73/dff/6dbc73dff774427fb4377b6c099549ff.jpg"><br><br>  The camera in the iPhone 6 Plus differs from the iPhone 6 in the presence of optical stabilization.  I have not yet succeeded in determining the quality of her work.  I took a few pictures - everything seems to be the same as in the ‚Äúsix‚Äù.  But that is precisely why I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúfirst views‚Äù made in a hurry, for which nothing is clear.  For a week, calmly, thoughtfully check everything and then accomplish your goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ec/f2a/cdb/5ecf2acdb4a64aa788029bc9fd1d6f8c.jpg"><br><br>  As for the dimensions ... Well, he is healthy, of course.  After it you take iPhone 5s in your hands and it seems like a toy, and not a former flagship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/306/be6/a74/306be6a747bd4055a01bc85bc54b4751.jpg"><br><br>  With the "six" the difference is not so serious, but also noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/4c5/466/aea4c54660b340f9a32128f54aa4761e.jpg"><br><br>  In the pocket of jeans, which is typical, it perfectly fits both - a round shape and a thin body affect.  Therefore, I still can not decide - which model I would like to walk all the time.  One thing is clear: roundness in combination with narrow frames and the absence of any screen protection makes the purchase of a cover or bumper simply obligatory.  Well, if, of course, you do not have a steel fortress, or the money does not burn a pocket (replacing the screen in the iPhone 6 Plus in the first months will cost about 15 thousand rubles).  However, life without a case has become dangerous since the days of the iPhone 4, and it is hardly an accident. <br><br>  Summing up our ‚Äúdisassembly‚Äù, we can say that Apple has made beautiful and elegant devices, not only outside, but inside as well.  Despite the fragile exterior, they cannot be called sissies - the connectors are reinforced compared to 5s, serious protection against moisture has appeared, and the unification of the design of a large and small iPhone makes life easier for collectors and gives hope that the demand will be met soon. <br><br>  If I missed something - I am ready to answer questions in the comments.  I also invite you to watch the video that we shot while disassembling the iPhone 6 Plus, there are a lot of important comments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvblneWEw6Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgxrtEdsu54W5bqca0IzSvOswzsbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Many thanks to the <a href="http://mediashop24.ru/iphone_6_predzakaz/">online store Mediashop24.ru</a> for the quickly extracted copy of the iPhone 6 Plus.  It was very difficult, but the guys succeeded. <br><br>  And, of course, without Alexander Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">www.tech-town.ru</a> ) I wouldn‚Äôt have disassembled anything myself, because unscrewing and then correctly tightening the 63 screws is not a joke. <br><br>  The iPhone 6 Plus is alive, well and works great, helping to collect impressions for future review. <br><br>  PS My review of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/obzor-iphone-6-i-iphone-6-plus-znachenie-razmera-i-razmer-znacheniya_5847.html">can be read here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237519/</a></p>
