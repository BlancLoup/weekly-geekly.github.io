  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ten bad things in Jobs's speech at WWDC 2007</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/16479.html">his speech at WWDC</a> this year, Steve Jobs told about ten great features of the future Leopard OS.  Well, I thought that I could come up on the other side and talk about ten points that I didn‚Äôt like in Jobs‚Äôs speech.  Admit it, <a href="http://rosnovsky.habrahabr.ru/blog/16653.html">you didn‚Äôt like everything either</a> .  So, I list my ten things, and you can add to the list in the comments.  Together we can prepare advice for Steve next year. <br><br>  <b>10. Again chatter about the iPhone</b> .  Is it really only me who got to death the chatter about this super-functional, super-duper, mega-amazing freak iPhone?  Calm down, Steve, ok?  Just stop.  Everyone already knows about this stupid iPhone and we are tired of hearing about it, especially those of us who do not live in the AT &amp; T network coverage area.  Choosing a single operator, you broke off many potential buyers.  Next time when I get my poor Verizon phone out of my pocket, I‚Äôll definitely remember you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>9. No iMacs</b> .  Before the start of WWDC, there were rumors about cool new poppies that will be presented at the show.  Now we know that any rumors about Apple are at best pieces of information, but the fact remains: one of the most important products of the company was completely ignored.  They say the headquarters prepared some really interesting news about iMacs, but Jobs just did not bother to share with us. <br><br>  <b>8. Announcement of EA Games</b> .  Jobs has never mentioned that EA Games will only run through Cider.  No one knows how fast they will work in this way, and no one is sure whether EA will remain and not abandon support for poppies, as it has already been.  And what does this mean for the market of native Makovsky games?  Does this mean a sentence for companies like Aspyr?

      <br>
      <b>7. Announcement id</b> .  When I first saw the id demonstration, it seemed pretty cool, but there‚Äôs almost no technical details.  This is simply an encrypted message from John Carmack about something that id plans to release in the future for poppies, and which will be announced later.  Come on, John, piss!  Can't you throw us a bone?  Well, yes, of course, 20 gigabytes of textures are cool, but what else do you have?  What games are being prepared for release?  When will they come out?  Come on, details, John! <br><br>  <b>6. Safari on Windows</b> .  I am the first to be pleased if Microsoft inserts a piston, but for some reason this news left me indifferent.  I understand that this is somehow related to the iPhone and Jobs‚Äôs supposedly secret plan.  That's all well and good, but Safari still has no sidebar!  In general, the browser is just as bad under Windows as it is on a Mac!  Okay, I admit that he loads the pages pretty quickly, but who cares about this, if you can't easily and quickly figure out your bookmarks?  Come on, Steve!  Put the sidebar on the "Safari", because there is not a single argument against.  If you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll stay with Firefox. <br><br>  <b>5. New doc</b> .  At first it seemed to me that it is very cool, but later I realized that this is just a new decoration.  During his speech, Jobs never mentioned whether it was possible to return to the old dock under the new Leoparad desktop.  Do I find fault?  Or is it really just a beautiful toy? <br><br>  <b>4. 64 bits?</b>  <b>Who cares?</b>  The excessive hype around the 64-bit platform, to put it mildly, is annoying.  Real geeks need it, but what difference will an ordinary home user notice?  How important is it for everyday use?  I do not want to catch up with depressed, but it seems to me that most users will not notice at all any difference between 32 and 64 bits.  And you?  I doubt it, so it looks like a big bubble inflated by Jobs.  This is a contagious thing.  You, too, can begin to brag about 64 bits when you set yourself a ‚ÄúLeopard‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>3. Spaces (independent desktops)</b> .  Well, okay, Steve, you're really tired of repeating how magnificent these Spaces are in Leopard.  I admit, they are cool, so what?  Independent desktops have been in Linux for many years, and no one is particularly noisy.  Of course, I am not against this feature in Leopard, but I don‚Äôt understand how to present it as a great achievement or something that is not found in any other operating system.  At least, these Spaces do not cause any special delight.  I think even you, Steve, sometimes need to filter your speeches. <br><br>  <b>2. Webclip</b> .  Only you relaxed and decided that no more stupid widget will disturb you, as Webclip appeared.  Now, any part of the web page can be turned into another useless widget from hell.  Jobs said that more than 3,000 widgets are now available, and in my opinion, this is too much.  It remains only to guess how much memory, traffic and CPU time these stupid things survive. <br><br>  <b>1. Turtleneck and jeans</b> .  I'm tired of looking at Jobs constantly in the same clothes.  He is an incredibly successful, rich man.  Can't he afford other clothes?  Hey, I'm not a fan of glamor, but I'm sure that he can dress better.  Okay, if you are so attached to sweaters with collars, well, at least try other colors, or maybe other pants?  Diversity is the basis of life, Steve, so get out to the store and buy something for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31124/</a></p>
