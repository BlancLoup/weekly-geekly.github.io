  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is your home network for you?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Good day, Habrovchane! </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c24/fda/45e/c24fda45e79d06e465baa56575ff9064.png" alt="image"><br>  In our time, it is difficult to surprise someone at home with Internet access or the presence of several computers.  I think at all, who set themselves the goal of giving access to the Network to several devices, there was a question about installing a router and creating a home network.  Such a network usually began with some unpretentious router, like the minimal D-Link model, and successfully managed to provide access to the Network to home devices.  However, not all stop at the achieved network performance and many are trying to bring their ‚ÄúLAN‚Äù to a certain personal ideal.  I want to talk about this ideal today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think everyone has friends or acquaintances who do not even think about the security of their Wi-Fi, but they set up the same routers exactly until the moment when Internet access is available.  Although thanks to such people a very widespread provider of free access under the brand ‚Äú <i>default</i> ‚Äù lives, for which many thanks to them! <br>  Once I had the need to share the Internet with a <s>neighbor of my</s> acquaintance living in the same stairwell.  However, the option to let him into his local computer did not suit me fundamentally.  This was the beginning of thoughts about upgrading network equipment and searching for options for available routers with support for several independent networks.  My choice fell on the products of the company MikroTik.  At first it was, like many, a broken version on a half-dead computer, then an ‚Äúiron‚Äù router of the same manufacturer was purchased.  In addition to smooth routing of several subnets with configured filters and queues, I configured an OpenVPN server on it to access my home network via the Internet, set up a NAS.  This configuration gave more network usage scenarios and something more than the average user home network. <br>  The next step was to install similar routers in apartments with relatives and in the country, connecting into a single network using VPN tunnels and dynamic routing within them.  This configuration made it possible to place network storages geographically and set up backups, which increased the reliability of information storage (I really didn‚Äôt want to lose 400 GB of family photo archives and some other data) and made it possible to implement services like remote viewing of ip cameras in my secure network.  Unexpectedly found convenience was the ability to configure IPTV transmission from one point of presence to another, where the local provider does not have such a service. <br>  In the near future: to establish ‚Äúpeering‚Äù with neighbors connected to another provider, in order to provide mutual access to the Network when there are problems with providers;  installation of a backup router in the ‚Äúcentral‚Äù point to which VPN clients are connected, with VRRP setup;  setting up centralized 802.1x authentication for wireless clients and many other, in my opinion, interesting ‚Äúbaubles‚Äù. <br>  So, in a brief retelling, my story of home network development sounds.  I suggest in the comments to discuss your experience in home-networking affairs and interesting ideas! </div>
