  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Websphere: new momentum for innovation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early May, the annual IBM conference IMPACT 2010 was held in Las Vegas.  The conference was positioned as the ‚ÄúFirst Conference for Business and IT Leaders‚Äù.  The new concept was predetermined by the new initiative of IBM Technical and Industry Advocates, which is designed for new ways of using innovations and reducing the time to implement projects. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2d/b1f/e2a/d2db1fe2a650a57c85d00537b0b72b86.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IBM Technical and Industry Advocates <br>  The goal of the initiative is to help partners create, develop and strengthen long-term relationships with leaders of various IBM departments, industry experts, senior technical specialists, researchers, developers and other IBM IT specialists.  Through this relationship, partners will be able to take advantage of expert assistance in building an IT architecture, increasing productivity, updating software solutions, migrating, and configuring software to meet industry-specific requirements. <br><br>  As an illustration of the benefits of this initiative, the experience of PayPal, which together with the IBM Cloud Labs cloud technologies center, worked to expand its global open electronic payment platform, PayPal X, into the cloud environment was described.  Working directly with IBM specialists directly, PayPal now provides its developer ecosystem with an opportunity to improve workflows and develop innovations in the IBM cloud environment.  Thousands of developers have already begun to create innovative applications using PayPal X. By extending the PayPal applications ecosystem to the cloud computing environment from IBM, PayPal enables PayPal X to be used by more developers and makes the cloud environment a new e-wallet dwelling. <br><br>  As part of the IBM Technical and Industry Advocates initiative, partner networks on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/connect/partnerworld/">PartnerWorld Communities have</a> organized social networking groups with industry focus.  The project was launched in June 2009 and is a unique social networking community created by IBM to facilitate real-time communication and business collaboration for its partners.  The community is expanding beyond the PartnerWorld network and has 10,000 partners visiting 250 LinkedIn social networking groups, 400 Facebook social networking groups, as well as over 500 thematic blogs discussing a wide range of specific application issues in a particular industry ‚Äî from implementing SOA architectures and environmentally friendly information technology before virtualization and cloud computing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d7/a0b/ee9/6d7a0bee93bd9dcabd73bd5a567d46bc.png" alt="image"><br>  PartnerWorld Community users can also take advantage of the new Virtual Summit virtual meeting feature, through which partners can plan and conduct online seminars to strengthen and develop communication and interaction with their customers.

      At the conference, special attention was paid to the tasks of specialized industry solutions.  IBM talked about how its experience with clients from different industries is used by the company's partners.  And as a result, partners can use IBM industry infrastructure solutions to develop projects for their clients.  This ensures that their solutions will work reliably and seamlessly with IBM technologies. <br><br>  Today, this initiative is being improved, expanded and extended to the recently announced <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/industry/banking/">IBM Banking Industry Framework</a> program.  This interoperability testing program provides objective criteria for testing business partner solutions.  Customers from the banking industry will be able to ensure that deployed independent software vendor solutions are pre-integrated and tested for compatibility with IBM infrastructure solutions for the banking industry. <br><br>  For partners working with public sector customers, IBM introduced Value Advantage Plus for Government Sales.  This program helps authorized resellers to learn the knowledge and experience of experts and to use useful resources to organize sales to customers from the public sector. <br><br>  Not at the conference and without cloud computing.  At the IMPACT Business Partner Summit 2010 Business Partners Summit, over 100 partners took part in a series of cloud computing technology training workshops.  Among the main issues raised at the seminars, it was discussed in which areas the benefits of cloud environments are manifested and what partners can do to develop services and solutions that realize new business opportunities.  Such educational seminars on cloud technologies will continue to be organized at all events related to IBM software and partner events, as well as at all 40 international innovation centers of IBM Innovation Centers. <br><br>  In addition to new initiatives, new products were announced to optimize and manage processes and IT-environment.  The new IBM WebSphere Appliances solutions are easy-to-install network devices designed to accelerate the deployment of XML and Web services. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/datapower/xi50/">IBM WebSphere DataPower Integration Blade XI50B</a> network devices, now available on IBM BladeCenter systems, are designed to solve the problem of expensive point-to-point integration.  The new solution, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/xc10/">IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10,</a> improves application performance using the drop-in cache mode.  And the updated version of the <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/cloudburst/">IBM WebSphere Cloudburst Appliance</a> now supports the environments needed to automate business processes and services related to planning, coordination and management. <br><br>  In addition, the new Akamai Ready initiative was announced, which is designed to provide integration between IBM WebSphere products and Akamai services to speed up web applications.  Another important announcement is the new SOA Repository Artifact Model &amp; Protocol standard or S-RAMP, which will help customers simplify their IT environments by improving the interoperability of the components of these environments. <br>  In addition, IBM Global Technology Services also introduced the Rapid Deployment Services (RDS) for Middleware for rapid deployment of middleware.  These automated deployment services for complex multi-product middleware solutions allow you to speed application installation up to 80% compared to the manual deployment process. <br>  <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/events/impact/">Impact 2010 conference site</a> <br>  Presentations from sessions - <a href="http://www.impactsmartsite.com/">www.impactsmartsite.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94440/</a></p>
