I previously published here the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/342778/">‚Äú10 techniques for creating beautiful business presentations‚Äù</a> and noticed that some readers perceive the business presentation as a regular presentation for a speech.  Here I would like to expand the topic in more detail and highlight this type of presentations in a separate format.  For clarity, I used real slides of investment presentations, sponsorship packages and business proposals from the agency‚Äôs portfolio. <br><br>  <strong>Important:</strong> I will not tell basic information about the design of presentations and special platforms.  You will need some initial PowerPoint skills to understand and apply the tips in this article.

    <hr><a name="razdel2"></a><br><h2>  Differences between business presentation and presentation. <br></h2><br>  <strong>A business presentation for reading and a presentation for public speaking are completely different types of presentations</strong> . <br>  The main differences: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Application.</strong>  Usually business presentations are used for <strong>e-mail newsletters</strong> or shown on devices in person to the client.  A presentation for public speaking is demonstrated using a projector. <br></li><li>  <strong>Involvement</strong>  <strong>Business presentation</strong> does not require the presence of a special person who would explain the information, as it already contains all the necessary data to understand the essence.  Presentation for the speech is not possible to show without a speaker.  Most often they contain only tables, charts and pictures for the entire slide. <br></li><li>  <strong>Amount of text.</strong>  Presentation for public speaking ideally does not contain text, only additions in the form of theses.  The rest of the content - images and charts (as, for example, Steve Jobs).  Business presentations, on the contrary, should contain text.  <strong>Standard - size 12 and 14</strong> .  There are options for using 8 and 10 points in presentations for case-championships and financial statements. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34d/2bc/493/34d2bc493377197221395525509b8a58.png" alt="Text density presentations" width="100%"><br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Document format.</strong>  You can make a presentation in PowerPoint or Keynote, but the final file should be in <strong>PDF format</strong> , and now I will explain why. <br><br>  Such files the client can open on the phone, tablet or PC, and there will be no influx of text or changes in the design.  The risks of unwanted "modifications" of the presentation are minimal.  Presentations for a speech can be shown in any convenient format, as the speaker himself controls the entire process of the demonstration and checks everything before the presentation of the presentation.  I personally like to use the Prezi tool.  So the presentations are lively and interactive. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Conclusion: a</strong> business presentation in PowerPoint is the same document or commercial offer, only designed in a more modern way.  Data visualization is gaining popularity, and the modern world dictates a trend for thoughtful design of information.  Therefore, a beautifully designed PowerPoint document will be more efficient than a regular Word file. <br><br><hr><a name="razdel3"></a><br><h2>  5 tips for creating high-quality business presentations </h2><br><a name="razdel4"></a><br><h3>  1 - Use interactive navigation. </h3><br>  For ease of reading and viewing the presentation, I use interactive navigation.  It helps to move from section to section in one click.  Usually it is placed at the edge of the slide in the form of figures or icons.  For them, a hyperlink to the required slide is created, and the reader, when clicked, moves to the required slide. <br><br>  <strong>Important</strong> : it is not necessary to number the slides.  You can ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù the navigation point where the reader is located. <br><br>  <strong>Navigating from the bottom of the slide in the form of points</strong> <br><br> <a href="" title="Example of navigation in a business presentation"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9c/75c/3de/b9c75c3de8b2a2b7019418b290ac0182.png" alt="Example of navigation in a business presentation" width="100%"></a> <br><br>  <strong>Navigation icons on the left of the slide.</strong>  <strong>On the desired slide icon "lights up."</strong> <br><br> <a href="" title="Example of navigation in a business presentation"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/828/43a/1d6/82843a1d6482f7a49c1dbf2db4cbde20.png" alt="Example of navigation in a business presentation" width="100%"></a> <br><br>  It may happen that you do not fit into 10 slides.  And then what? <br><a name="razdel5"></a><br><h2>  2 - 10 slides - the optimal number for a business presentation. <br></h2><br>  Try to follow the rule of Guy Kawasaki 10-20-30: 10 slides for 20 minutes of performance with 30pt.  For business presentations only, use a smaller size;  30 pt more suitable presentations for speeches. <br><a name="razdel6"></a><br><h2>  3 - The orientation of the slide is 16: 9, not 4: 3. </h2><br>  Quite often I see 4: 3 presentations.  This is due to the format of the projectors, and this ratio was also used as standard in the first versions of PowerPoint. <br>  Now it is more convenient to immediately set the 16: 9 format, since most will read the presentation with this orientation.  As a plus, 16: 9 format slides are more convenient to divide into 2-3 semantic parts.  This will allow you to logically structure the information in the presentation. <br><a name="razdel7"></a><br><h2>  4 - Modular grid for business presentation. </h2><br>  The use of modular grid in presentations is half the success of effective design.  It will help not to overload the slide with unnecessary details. <br><br>  We will not delve into the subtleties of creating a modular grid, but I will help you to adjust it: using the guides function, you can <strong>make a frame for a slide with indents on the sides</strong> .  From above and below the frame should recede at the same distance.  To add new guides to PowerPoint, right-click - &amp; gt on the slide area, select ‚ÄúGrid and Guides‚Äù - &amp; gt and then click ‚ÄúAdd Guides‚Äù. <br><br>  A line appears that you can drag to the right place.  Why is it needed? <br><br>  If the information does not fit on the slide completely, then it makes sense to divide it into several parts or reduce the amount of information to the main points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d8/69c/f7d/8d869cf7dc822ff679b09529c635e3ed.png" alt="The modular grid in the business presentation from Artrange Digital" width="100%"><br><br>  <strong>Modular grid in work.</strong>  <strong>Presentation for a furniture company from Kenya:</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/adc/d5d/26aadcd5d7ec6cfbabee5e629c821992.png" alt="An example of using a modular grid in a business presentation" width="100%"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/473/3f9/0ba/4733f90ba2de5340cccd22bb0289c2a3.png" alt="An example of using a modular grid in a business presentation" width="100%"><br><br><a name="razdel8"></a><br><h2>  5 - Dark background in business presentations: use or not? <br></h2><br>  Many speakers follow the rule when preparing presentations for speeches - do not use a dark background.  If you do not need to print a presentation, feel free to write in white on black!  Your presentation will definitely stand out from the rest. <br>  <strong>Important</strong> : use only pure white color for text to maintain maximum contrast of the text-background slide. <br><br>  <strong>Dark background diluted with red accents in a presentation for Prime Partner</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e4/5d5/404/7e45d54040aca50ad2c37771d3ea9b98.png" alt="An example of using a dark background in a business presentation" width="100%"><br><br>  <strong>Infographics on a dark background.</strong>  <strong>Kuko App Investment Presentation:</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e8/e81/aec/1e8e81aec0145c261da77308da225099.png" alt="An example of using a dark background in a business presentation" width="100%"><br><br><hr><a name="razdel9"></a><br><h2>  Two special types of business presentations <br></h2><br>  Next, I will tell you about the features of the two presentations, which are often used in a business environment. <br><a name="razdel10"></a><br><h2>  Investment presentation of the project (pitch deck) <br></h2><br>  In our portfolio, we have collected investment presentations for American and European companies and accelerators. <br><br>  I think both investors and startups will agree with the proposed structure of the slides, which are necessary for a full and successful investment presentation.  If you do not agree, then share your opinion in the comments, we will discuss. <br>  <strong>The investment presentation slide presentation structure ( <strong>Pitch Deck</strong> ) according to Guy Kawasaki:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Title slide </li><li>  Problem </li><li>  Prove the seriousness of the problem </li><li>  Problem Solving - Your Product </li><li>  Business model </li><li>  Market Promotion </li><li>  Competitor Analysis </li><li>  Team </li><li>  Forecasts and metrics (financial, marketing) </li><li>  Current project status </li></ol><br>  <strong>Sequoia slide structure:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Existing problem </li><li>  Decision </li><li>  Why now? </li><li>  Market size </li><li>  <strong>Competition in the market</strong> </li><li> <strong>Product</strong> </li><li>  Business - project model </li><li>  <strong>Team</strong> </li><li>  Mentors / Consultants </li><li>  Finance </li><li>  Investment size </li></ol><br>  <strong>The structure of the slides from D</strong> <strong>ocsend:</strong> <br><br><ol><li>  Setting a company's goal </li><li>  Problem </li><li>  Solution to the problem </li><li>  Why now? </li><li>  Market size </li><li>  <strong>Product</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Team</strong> </li><li>  Business model </li><li>  <strong>Competition in the market</strong> </li><li>  Financial performance </li></ol><br>  Sequoia and Docsend propose to include in the presentation a good slide "Why now?".  Investors need to be convinced that your project is relevant and will benefit society. <br>  Why all this? <br><br>  Presentation of the project to the investor is considered one of the most difficult stages in the search for investment.  It should be thought out and clearly structured.  Alternatively, an investment presentation can serve as the basis for a B2B sales presentation or sponsorship package. <br><a name="razdel11"></a><br><h3>  Commercial offer <br></h3><br>  Many may disagree with further information, so let's share opinions in the comments.  By tradition, commercial proposals are sent in Word format.  In the past, organizations made proposals and sent them in the form of letters without any design.  I share a link to examples of these letters in <a href="https://www.sampletemplates.com/letter-templates/business-proposal-letter.html">English</a> . <br><br>  Result of Yandex for the request "commercial offer": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/182/aa9/b88/182aa9b88f223cbda5b2fa79a35282d7.png" alt="Commercial offers in search" width="100%"><br><br>  Companies are trying to cut design costs, considering it a worthless exercise.  But after all your clients will see your offer.  Think about what they might have the first impression of your company? <br><br>  <strong>I offer you:</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Create a thoughtful quotation template in PowerPoint.  You will only have to make changes individually for a specific client; <br></li><li>  A4 format with landscape orientation slide for correct printing. <br></li><li>  Ideally, this offer should not exceed 5 slides: <br><ol><li>  UTP product or service. </li><li>  Product advantages over competitors </li><li>  Announcement of discounts, sales, seasonal offers. </li><li>  Details of the proposal, technical specifications (Optional, depending on the scope). </li><li>  Contact and call to action. </li></ol></li></ul><br>  In some cases, you have to deviate from the rule of five slides.  For example - a commercial offer for the development of the site.  Sometimes the technical aspects of the development need to be painted on 2-3 slides so that the client presents the whole picture of cooperation. <br>  <strong><em>Technology does not stand still and in the world of presentations!</em></strong> <br>  Speaking of commercial offers in the form of presentations, now the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D1094192266%26amp%3Bmt%3D8">Slider</a> team is developing a feature for corporate clients that allows you to quickly create a commercial offer template.  Through the application cabinet, an employee can change information immediately on the phone or tablet, add data and images individually for the client, upload everything to PowerPoint or PDF format and immediately send the client to the post office or instant messenger. <br><br>  For the time being, the guys manually connect such a function to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D1094192266%26amp%3Bmt%3D8">Slider</a> after requesting them by email at support@slider.pw.  You can try. <br><hr><a name="razdel12"></a><br><h2>  We measure the effectiveness of a business presentation and consider conversion. </h2><br>  Imagine you spent time creating the presentation, used all your creative potential to create a cool design.  What's next?  How to understand that the presentation is involved in the sales funnel? <br><br>  <strong>Decision:</strong> <br><br>  I propose to use in the presentation interactive hyperlinks to the site or landing page.  You can track clicks and depth of viewing on the site. <br><br>  I will give 2 frequently used tools: <br><br><ol><li>  Add a link to a presentation with a UTM tag.  Analyzing the conversion will be possible through Yandex. Metrics or Google Analytics. </li><li>  Generate the link in <a href="https://goo.gl/">Google Url Shortner</a> , add to the presentation and see how many times clicked on it </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a42/81e/f32/a4281ef32c65991e322b6711e41d4dca.jpg" alt="Using hyperlinks in business presentations" width="100%"><br><hr><a name="razdel13"></a><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br><ol><li>  Now you know the differences between a business presentation and a presentation for public speaking. </li><li>  Embed navigation through the slides. </li><li>  Stick to 10 slides for business presentations and 5 slides for business offers. </li><li>  Set the format to 16: 9 or A4 landscape orientation when printing slides on ordinary sheets. </li><li>  The dark background of the presentation will help you stand out among the rest. </li><li>  Consider the structure of an investment presentation the next time you create a business presentation. </li><li>  Replace boring word quotes with more presentable ones in PowerPoint. </li><li>  Hyperlinks with UTM tags and the use of Google URL Shortner links help track the conversion from the presentation. </li><li>  Write your impressions in the comments!  It is interesting to know your opinion. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346322/</a></p>
