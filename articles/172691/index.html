Bauman, MAI and MIIT.  Now there are free <b>seminars</b> where anyone can come just by showing a student card. <br><br>  Each seminar is a short and capacious story about what to do and how to deal with this technology.  The task is to show how to take the first steps in a particular direction and warn against frequent mistakes.  Simply put - remove the threshold of entry into the subject area.  Duration - one and a half to two hours, at the end is issued a piece of paper, which may be appreciated by your teacher or future employer. <br><br>  Below announcements of the next events.  In short - here are the main ones: <br><ul><li>  Data Center Architecture </li><li>  GNU / Linux server technologies </li><li>  Virtualization technologies </li><li>  Software Development Team </li><li>  Building loaded parallel systems (HPC) </li><li>  Open source software in integrated IT projects </li><li>  Who is a PM, why is it needed and how does it differ from the project lead programmer. </li></ul><br>  Well and to a heap - the review of decisions for creation of call centers on the basis of Avaya products.

      Now the details for each project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Architecture of the modern data processing center (DPC)</b> <br>  <i>March 27, 2013</i> <br>  It helps to deal with the fact that such a data center, the difference between data centers, what you should pay attention to and so on.  Despite the fact that the likelihood that you personally will be designing a data center is rather small, it is worth attending a seminar at least for the sake of achivki.  The fact is that after it you will know a bunch of pitfalls from this area. <br><br>  <b>GNU / Linux server technologies</b> <br>  <i>April 1</i> <br>  This is pure GNU / Linux propaganda from fanatical, bearded people in sweaters.  True, they will be without sweaters and beards, but oh well.  At the seminar, you can stop being ashamed of your lack of knowledge of Linux and generally learn more about it.  A variety of Linux distributions, application services and their capabilities will be covered.  Also affected are modern clustering and virtualization technologies.  The plan is: <br><ul><li>  GNU project and the Linux kernel.  Terms of use for Linux, types of licenses. </li><li>  GNU / Linux as a server: supported hardware platforms, typical applications, features of operation and operation, advantages and disadvantages. </li><li>  Overview of common Linux server distributions: RHEL, Centos, Ubuntu server, SLES </li><li>  Linux as a network system, examples of basic services: DNS, DHCP, NTP, routers, firewalls, Linux-based VPN hubs and encrypted tunnels, www servers and file sharing services, MySQL, PostgreSQL, mail, a file server in a heterogeneous environment ( NFS, SMB / CIFS). </li><li>  Linux as a virtualization platform. </li><li>  Highly reliable clusters and other ways to ensure continuous operation of systems. </li></ul><br>  Even if you do not believe in the power of * nix, you will learn how to troll other people on IT forums. <br><br>  <b>Virtualization and Cloud Computing</b> <br>  <i>April 3</i> <br>  It's twenty-first century, and you don't know what a hypervisor or a hybrid cloud is?  Nothing terrible, 99% of readers of this topic do not know about it :).  But seriously, this seminar is a very detailed educational program on the topic of virtualization and solutions on different hardware and software platforms.  Virtualization has penetrated almost all modern technologies and is manifested at different levels.  We start with an explanation on the fingers, then move on to the features of virtualization based on the x86 platform and touch on Xen, VMWare, KVM, Hyper-V, and then look at the capabilities of the Power and ARM platforms.  Let's look at different types of clouds - Google Gmail, Saleforce, Google Apps Engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS.  We will also tell about our rake in building a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù for the harsh Russian reality. <br><br>  <b>Software Development Team</b> <br>  <i>April 8</i> <br>  It's simple.  Any large company, taking in the state of the developer, is forced to retrain it and direct it from an individual approach to development to a team one.  We will talk about the details and differences of approaches, plus we will discuss traditional problems and show their solution.  The life cycle of software development and continuous integration (CI) will be reviewed to automate this process.  There will be no general commit and stable release at the end of the session, but the sensations will be the same. <br><br>  <b>Building loaded parallel systems (HPC)</b> <br>  <i>April 10th</i> <br>  One of the most serious seminars of the cycle.  We will look at the clusters and talk about their purpose, architecture, features, software.  You will stop being afraid of such words as: 1RU servers, blades, iDataPlex ,, 10G Ethernet, Infiniband, Myrinet, learn about hardware and interconnect topology.  Plus - about SAN, NAS data storage, hierarchical data storage and computing accelerators: GPGPU, coprocessors, and so on.  Let's talk about clusters in the Russian Federation, and the person who collected them with his own hands will tell.  At the end - a demonstration of the cluster installation, the launch of a test parallel task.  I highly recommend those who need a lot of calculations, for example, in scientific calculations, design, and various kinds of Data Mining.  In general, at the end of the seminar it will be painfully painful for you to look at the schedule of performance of your personal computer. <br><br>  <b>Open source software in integrated IT projects</b> <br>  <i>April 15</i> <br>  We have several large projects in which we use open source software.  <i><font color="red">Krasnoglaziki, who made the first builds of * nix</font></i> , will tell you about the experience of large-scale Linux implementation on workstations and their management.  Plus a couple of details about the things that are important right now - collaboration and terminal access.  You can come even if you have not seen anything except Windows, however, you will be a little ashamed under the looks of bearded colleagues :) <br><br>  <b>Project manager.</b>  <b>Coordinator, leader or boss?</b> <br>  <i>April 24</i> <br>  Everyone wants to be a PM, but few know how.  The fact is that PM is not only a person who is well versed in the subject area (and knows how to write code), but also a person who sees the whole project, knows what is most important, communicates with other people outside the development team, translates their requirements into the terms of technical specifications and - what is important - does not allow the project to crumble, the admin to forget, and the lead developer to go on a date when the release rolls out.  You know, they say, good PM'a difficult to kill, because it must first be found.  So, I highly recommend this seminar - it is useful to anyone who plans to code more than two of them together with a duckling. <br><br><h4>  How to get? </h4><br>  Register for seminars <a href="http://www.crocok.ru/ow2013/">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Who leads the seminars? </h4><br>  The training is conducted by leading experts of CROC - that is, people with extensive practical experience, who are directly involved in the integration of products and know all the rakes almost to the touch.  That is why such courses are always closely related to the real world. <br><br><h4>  And if I have enough? </h4><br>  Courses for students with a duration of several days, where there will be many, many practices, will begin very soon.  Here is the first pair: <br><br>  <b>An overview of call center solutions based on Avaya products</b> <br>  <i>March 18-20, very soon</i> <br>  This is a theory about how to build a large and medium call center, and then practical solutions from Avaya cases.  The seminar will consider the whole range of systems for processing incoming calls, voice recording and operator work screens, statistics collection and integration.  There will also be considered processing systems for email, sms, chat, etc., systems for automatic outgoing customer dialing and functionality for speech synthesis and recognition.  Plus practice setting environment.  Result - you will learn about launching and configuring KC first-hand.  Very useful achivka for the future employee of IT-services of a large company. <br><br>  <b>Video conferencing as a presence effect</b> <br>  <i>April 15-16</i> <br>  About video conferencing and its terminal equipment, server equipment, principles of construction.  In practice, setting up the equipment is shown and what important points should be taken into account when creating ready-made solutions.  At the end of the lesson, the main equipment will be shown live.  Practice shows that for many the topic seems very simple and understandable, but it is worthwhile to get to the implementation - just, and it turns out that there is a huge amount of nuances. <br><br>  You can <b>register</b> for courses by sending an application to <b>info@crocok.ru</b> . <br><br><h4>  Have you already gone through all these levels and are looking at the list of seminars as semolina? </h4><br>  Then it will be interesting to you that CROC traditionally holds administration olympiads.  At the end of 2012 was the fifth in a row.  In the first four, we offered tasks from different areas: hardware, networks, Windows administration and Linux.  Thus, participants who had experience in a heterogeneous environment, ‚Äúadmin-all-in-one‚Äù had the maximum advantage.  In 2012, they focused on the topic of Linux.  The prizes are different: this is a monthly stipend, gifts like the iPad, payment for the official Red Hat courses and subsequent RHCSA / RHCE exams.  "Catch" the following, you can subscribe to our corporate blog on here, on Habr√©. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And if you suddenly experienced IT-specialist and came here to remember youth, then we have the latest generation of combat iron test drives, where you can ask difficult questions and get complicated answers, plus a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/events/coming/">bunch of other pieces</a> needed in the practice of the IT department. <br><br>  <b>UPD, March 26, 2013</b> : Some seminars comprehend habraeffect.  Instead of inviting only the first applicants, we have duplicated the main seminars.  If you have registered, and the postponement of the date has touched you, then perhaps you have already received or will receive a letter, where the new date of the event is indicated.  Not very convenient, but you can still get to the seminar of interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172691/</a></p>
