  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 reasons why the iPhone should become open-source</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This topic is a post translation from the personal blog of William Hurley, chief architect of open strategies at <a href="http://www.bmc.com/ru_RU/aboutus/">BMC Software</a> .  Known on the network as ‚ÄúWhurley‚Äù, William is responsible for the company's participation in the open-source world and various open-source communities, as well as being one of the ideologues for adopting new technologies - he has 16 years of development and 11 serious patents.  In addition, he chairs the Open Management Consortium, a non-profit organization fighting for the adoption, development and integration of open management systems.  Called IBM ‚ÄúMaster Inventor,‚Äù Hurley received several awards for his work, including the IBM Pervasive Computing Award and the Apple Computer Design Award.  All regalia are listed here for one purpose only - to show the reader why the opinion of this person might be interesting. <br><br><blockquote>  Perhaps you know that more than a year ago, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2007/tc20071015_258257.htm">BusinessWeek asked me</a> about the potential possibility of "opening" the iPhone platform.  Enough time has passed since then, but no such initiatives have come from Cupertino, except for the ever-increasing pressure on and from projects like Android, which encroach on the throne of Apple.  Since Christmas is just a few days away from me, I have one wish for Santa Jobs, and this is not a double-barreled traffic jam. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  All I want from Apple is a slightly more open platform.  Of course, the chances of this are slim, while the iPhone remains successful and in the lead.  It is for this reason that I am not talking about the full disclosure of the source code ‚Äî all that is needed is to break the heavy gates and let in a little fresh breeze. <br><br><h4>  This is good for developers, non-developers ... and generally good </h4><br>  Open source is becoming the default way to develop software in many industries.  Why?  Because a well-managed, open community leads to focused and reliable functionality, it allows developers to share code in a healthy atmosphere that everyone in the iPhone ecosystem will like.

      Developers love to work faster, cheaper and more efficiently.  But more importantly, many guys who are not venerable programmers are starting to create their own applications for platforms like implied.  The one who satiates people will win the war. <br><br><h4>  Buyers like the choice </h4><br>  The opening of the iPhone will give buyers the opportunity to choose from a wider range of applications.  Faced with a huge list of useful software in the online store, they will definitely spend their money.  More money will make Apple more happy. <br><br>  Take away the opportunity to choose and people will rebel.  No amount of ‚Äúlegal delays‚Äù and cunning marketing will be able to change the desire of today's consumers to independently manage the situation.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs related to a 99-cent track in iTunes or the ability to cooperate during the development process;  closing people in your box to change it, subsequently, will be either very difficult or impossible. <br><br><h4>  This will strengthen Apple's dominant position. </h4><br>  Apple has a unique opportunity to assert its position in the market by killing any attempt to compete in the bud and the <i>open-source iPhone</i> will decently put dust into <i>Android</i> ‚Äôs throat.  The only thing that distinguishes Google from Apple today is the open approach in question.  The old Steve can raise the level of the game, because in his hands is an army of loyal fans and developers who are ready to ‚Äúgive their lives‚Äù for a piece of apple. <br><br><h4>  If Apple doesn't do this, someone else will. </h4><br>  If you haven't heard about the OpeniBoot project, check <a href="http://dvice.ru/blogs/mobile/893">out this one</a> .  Right, Linux on the iPhone.  Earth sends a message to Apple: ‚Äúif the iPhone were already open, it probably wouldn't have happened!‚Äù  I will repeat it again.  Open solutions come from all over the world, most often from an unsatisfied group of customers.  Don't like the feature set?  Write your.  Don't like the functionality?  Modify the gadget.  Is the price too high?  Wait a bit.  In the Internet era, every customer is a small producer. <br><br><h4>  Apple will have to do it anyway </h4><br>  Despite the opinion of Santa Jobs about open source software and the dominant position of the iPhone - Apple is now on the same course as Google in developing its own mobile platform.  And the open-source solution for the iPhone could be the most destructive weapon in the Arsenal of the Yabloko.  Do you think that the average buyer does not care?  I am writing this post from Wahoo Fish Tacos (Mexican chain of restaurants).  Today, my inspiration was one of the managers, Jordan, who asked me right away at the entrance about what can be done with the two iPhones that he bought and adapted to work on the T-Mobile network. <br><br>  Technically savvy shoppers are very ‚Äúhands on‚Äù.  And today, you do not need to be a Uber-geek in order to do something with the gadgets that you have.  Innovative networks of these same buyers cooperate with manufacturing companies in order to make better and long-lived products.  Open source is just a step into this future.  My 12-year-old son shares his modding tricks and tricks with his classmates on Skype, finally!  The consumer needs the right to participate - they want to be involved in the production of those products that they are interested in.  Having put them inside you can only make sure that the company gives customers what they really need. <br><br>  In order to collect opinions about this idea, we proceed as follows.  Those who liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopening the iPhone platform will begin their comment with "+1", and all those who think that the iPhone should remain closed, with "-1".  Let's see how things really are. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://whurley.com/2008/12/10/five-reasons-apple-should-open-source-the-iphone/">Whurley</a> via <a href="http://whurley.com/2008/12/10/five-reasons-apple-should-open-source-the-iphone/">slashdot</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46953/</a></p>
