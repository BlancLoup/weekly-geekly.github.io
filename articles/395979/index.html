To begin with, it is planned, like in cars, to make a hybrid engine.  Airbus intends to conduct a ‚Äúmore electric aircraft‚Äù test as part of the DISPURSAL project in 2022.

Certification is expected in 2017 and already 70 orders have been received. <br>  <a href="http://www.informdom.com/novosti/konvertoplan-aw609-kompanii-agusta-westland-gotovitsya-k-seriinomu-proizvodstvu.html">more</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://nypost.com/2015/10/11/four-candidates-to-become-the-airplane-of-the-future/">Darpa</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef2/db3/842/ef2db3842bd542c581e723bf89a6fd64.png" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  DARPA announced a competition to finally create an aircraft with a vertical take-off ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL_X-Plane">1</a> ) and 4 large corporations (Boeing, Aurora Flight Sciences Corp, Sikorsky Aircraft Co. and Karem Aircraft) will present their full-size prototypes for testing in February 2017. <br>  <a href="http://hi-news.ru/weapon/darpa-obyavila-konkurs-na-koncept-letatelnogo-apparata-s-vertikalnym-vzletom.html">more</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.jobyaviation.com/S2/">Joby Aviation</a></b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd5/771/5ad/fd57715ad2f644d1a2e1bc3e5122f333.jpg" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  Another attempt is an electric VTOL from Joby Aviation.
