  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There have been too many technological discrepancies in software and hardware lately</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It would seem that we <i>were lucky</i> to live in an era of great progress, neo-modernism and technical breakthroughs.  To see only, new nanotechnologies in the computer sphere push back not only the greatest inventions of the past, such as the usual tungsten lamp, but also the same innovations that we waited about 5 years ago with saliva in our teeth.  Take even the usual Nokia N95, which I craved when it just came out.  It would seem that this is a miracle: a phone with GPS, a huge screen and a lot of handy (although I will keep from the word useful) features ... But it was not there.  Just a couple of years separates the status of "know-how" from "old." <br><br>  Here comes the most interesting moment of my article - those who started reading may think that it‚Äôs about the eternal updating of hard drives, and that my plaintive words about how sad it is that everything goes so fast will follow.  Yes, a little not there it was. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, in fact, the phenomenon of progress, especially in computer technology, is a reasonable and logical thing;  It can not be excluded and not to say a few words.  After all, in fact, no one will ask for 300 euros for the Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTS 512 Alpha Dog, despite the fact that this is a great gaming graphics card so far - too much competition from the new products of this and competing company Radeon.  An old one merges with another old one, and they are replaced by new things.  As, for example, tactile smartphones have replaced the usual button phones (which gained popularity precisely because of Steve Jobs).  I involuntarily touched on the theme of Apple, after all, the revolution - this is just their fad. <br><br>  Let's leave for a minute in those times when we were shown unknown equipment - phones without buttons, computers, where the system unit and monitor are one and the same - we can't but admit that there are devices that can surprise.  And not just ‚ÄúOh, well, not a bad thing,‚Äù but ‚ÄúWow!  What is this?  I want him!  Well, remember, because it was literally not so long ago.  <b>What exactly in computer and telephone technology struck you most?</b>  Ask yourself.  Hmm, it looks like I started a lecture in the style of ‚ÄúBecome better in 7 days‚Äù, when people are given to think about commonplace things, but they didn‚Äôt have enough at that time.  But the point is that everyone decides for himself what, and when, surprised them the most.  This is important because (and we come to the heart of my article), being a very impressionable person and a lover of new products, I more and more <b>cease to be surprised at all the high-tech that is being done around</b> .  Just 4 months ago, I was shocked by the 3D technology introduced on a mobile platform that allowed me to reproduce the depth without glasses.  The models were LG 3D and HTC Evo 3D, which I personally felt.  But whatever the effect wow produced on me then, he quickly disappeared.  A person cannot become a deep pessimist in a matter of months, but what really could have happened (and, in my indiscreet opinion, happened) was the absence of real breakthroughs and revolutions.

      I will return to the top of my topic - we live in a glorious time, when you can go to the toilet not with a newspaper for jokes, but with a gadget (often for the same);  at a time when before such a beloved Sega 16 bit seems (and is) even more primitive than the average phone.  So why, then, everything that is being done has either a boring or really lacking boom effect, a tendency?  Or is this just my opinion? <br><br>  Everything would be very simple, I could return calmly from where I started, they say, this is only for me, an ordinary person, all the greatest works are something missing and not fitting.  But let's look at it from the other side - modern children cannot imagine life without gadgets, social networks and other, which have become popular, joys.  That is, it all became trivial. <br><br>  Yes Yes!  <b>Commonplace!</b>  Smartphones with 4 inches and 4 cores (this is much stronger than my first computer) will not be surprised, even in the metro to see CounterStrike-like games playing on tablets.  It is fashionable, stylish, maybe even comfortable, but not new. <br><br>  Another topic I am approaching now is the pomp of firms in presenting their products.  The same Apple, despite its (good, bad, I can not judge) products, inflates it to the size of a flying ball, by the way, on which Felix recently broke a couple of world records.  Each company has fragmented the market and is trying to crush its competitors with all mental and thoughtless ways.  These are strict laws of survival and prosperity, this is true.  But it is they, in my not so modest opinion, that lead only to mini-revolutions, which, on the contrary, is quite emotionally depressing.  After all, it looks like a pacifier, which we are happy to squeeze, advertising it with manna from heaven and a thing, without which life becomes wrong. <br><br>  No one will ever want to merge forces on something mega big, something worthwhile and global;  unite efforts corporately to make the world (not its products, but the world) a place more convenient and comfortable.  This concerns not only many times, although rather indirect mention by me of the telephone industry, but also in particular of computers. <br><br>  I do not deny that modern achievements are brilliant, but the most that I want to draw attention to today is greed and even greed in this area. <br><br>  Work in the integrated mode of computers with different operating systems is a fairly large haemorrhoids;  special, <b>unique</b> software for communicating "device - computer" further exacerbate the problem;  lack of support for cross-platforms, as well as eternal wars for the ownership of ideas ... God, how tired of all this!  And the worst of all is that in recent times many companies have been trying to ‚Äúmake life easier‚Äù, but this is noticeable - each is different, therefore there is never a common idyll.  The world is very divided into a multi-bar, multi-caste and because of this there is a clear damage to technological progress, which, if in general, resembles the well-known Krylovskaya stand on a swan, cancer and pike.  And what is your opinion about the current competition and technological progress in general? <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155483/</a></p>
