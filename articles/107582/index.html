  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Strategy - Silverlight and HTML5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet is a very interesting environment in which different opinions may arise, based on different facts and conjectures, and then easily and quickly translated into various rumors, conjectures, conclusions and conclusions.  Actually, this is a very interesting topic for the study of sociologists, but the post is not about that - it is about Microsoft‚Äôs technology strategy for Silverlight and HTML5.  And about how important these two platforms are both for Microsoft itself and for developers who choose Microsoft solutions - and top executives of the company wrote about this today. <br><br>  Bob Muglia, president of Server and Tools, has published a very <a href="http://team.silverlight.net/announcement/pdc-and-silverlight/">detailed article</a> on the role of Silverlight in Microsoft's strategy.  I strongly recommend everyone reading this topic to read it <a href="http://team.silverlight.net/announcement/pdc-and-silverlight/">completely</a> .  <strong>Silverlight is a strategically important technology</strong> , including for developing business applications, premium media scenarios, creating interactive applications for various form factors, including desktop computers and telephones.  CEO Steve Ballmer, in his ‚Äú <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/nov10/11-01Statement.mspx">PDC thoughts</a> ‚Äù, also relies on Silverlight as one of the core technologies.  And some journalists noted that in one section of the text he used the word ‚ÄúSilverlight‚Äù 5 times :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you that Silverlight 1.0 appeared in the fall of 2007.  Yes, it was only 3 years ago.  Exactly in 3 years Silverlight went through rapid growth to the fourth version, it was installed on 2/3 of connected computers and used by more than 600,000 developers worldwide.  Silverlight has become the main development platform for the Windows Phone 7 operating system, it has become possible to use it in embedded devices based on Windows Embedded - including cars.  All this shows that the platform has become mature for use in a variety of scenarios. <br><br>  As for HTML5, this is certainly an extremely promising movement, supported by the developer community, to make web standards more realistic.  Microsoft, as a member of the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> consortium, along with Apple, Google, Opera, the Mozilla Foundation, is actively involved in its development.  The beta version of <a href="http://online-krasota.ru/">Internet Explorer 9</a> released in September confidently shows the level of support provided by Microsoft for web standards.  The new preview version of <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Info/ThankYou/Default.html">IE9 Platform Preview 6</a> was released last week, and today the results of the official HTML5 tests from W3C have become known, in which IE9 PP6 was the <a href="http://microgeek.ru/blogs/ie/878/">best</a> !  All this shows that HTML5 is indeed an important and integral part of web technologies and enjoys the support of all market players.

      In recent weeks, some developers have been concerned that HTML5 is gaining momentum, but Silverlight hasn't heard much.  And after the appearance of information that the strategic role of Silverlight began to change, fans of hot stories began to actively add fuel to the fire.  The lack of a new version of Silverlight at the PDC conference gave rise to new suspicions - people really got used to the crazy speed of development and the appearance of updates when the technology was essentially a start-up.  As a result, on the Web, you can find different statements on this topic, to the extent that Silverlight no longer exists. <br><br>  However, this is not the case.  Only 6 months ago Silverlight 4 was released - it happened six months ago.  In addition, last week <a href="http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2010/09/28/keeping-your-silverlight-dev-environment-stable-through-service-releases.aspx">it</a> was updated, including WCF RIA Services and the new Portable Library project.  Today, November 1, the final version of <a href="http://blogs.iis.net/chriskno/archive/2010/11/01/iis-media-services-4-0-released.aspx">IIS Media Services 4 was released</a> , which supports Dynamic Adaptive Broadcasting with Smooth Streaming via Silverlight.  Last week, sales of Windows Phone 7 phones began in Europe, and in a few days it will happen in the United States.  The main platform for developing applications for WP7 is Silverlight.  All these are obvious indicators that Silverlight not only exists, but also is actively growing as a technology and platform. <br>  In his <a href="http://team.silverlight.net/announcement/pdc-and-silverlight/">article,</a> Bob Maglia highlights the main points about Silverlight: <br><ol><li>  Silverlight is a strategic technology for Microsoft. <br></li><li>  Microsoft is actively working on the next version of Silverlight, which will continue to be cross-browser and cross-platform on Windows and Mac systems. <br></li><li>  Silverlight is the application platform for Microsoft itself ‚Äî for both Windows and Windows Phone 7. <br></li><li>  The main scenarios for using Silverlight: <ul><li>  Business Applications (LOB, line-of-business) <br></li><li>  Client applications for different form factors and devices <br></li><li>  Maximum media capabilities </li></ul></li></ol>  What is better - Silverlight and HTML5?  This is not an entirely correct question, and Silverlight has never had a goal to ‚Äúkill HTML‚Äù (although some attributed other targets to it for such an attack :)) <br>  HTML5 is the most cross-platform technology that is supported and will be supported by all major market players - for launching web pages for both personal and mobile platforms.  And Microsoft intends to provide a better platform for working HTML5. <br><br>  Silverlight allows you to extend the capabilities of HTML5 within web pages, go beyond the browser, implement interactive scripts and rich business applications. <br>  These technologies are not mutually exclusive.  Moreover, neither Microsoft nor the developers have ever used and probably will not use the same technology for all tasks.  And Microsoft will continue to invest its resources for the development of both Silverlight and HTML5. <br><br>  I will be glad to speak at the conference ‚Äú <a href="http://msplatforma.ru/">Platform 2011</a> ‚Äù (it will be possible to watch online directly and in the recording - yes, at Silverlight :)) and to give a comprehensive review of the Silverlight technology in a <a href="http://msplatforma.ru/materials/DT_203.aspx">separate report</a> .  She has a great future - gradually the secret will become apparent;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107582/</a></p>
