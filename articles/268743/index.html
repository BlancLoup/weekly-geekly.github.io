  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we buy used server</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How to extend the warranty of your server?  How does the server lose in price and why?  How to get service, even if you are removed from the dealer and you have out of warranty?  What errors can I avoid in the sale of b / y server?  How can you most efficiently sell or buy used servers?  Summarizing the knowledge on this topic, which is an integral part of the professional competence of the system administrator, we tried to collect available information about how the purchase and sale of used servers now work in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93d/7e3/aaa/93d7e3aaa1f54c308ae4af2f28db51e6.gif"><br>  <i>When in the server all is well</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In foreign practice, there are and quite successfully operate companies like <a href="http://www.itcreations.com/">IT Creations</a> , which not only are distributors of new equipment, but also restore and resell, with the extension of the warranty, used servers.  The main advantages of this business model are two factors: <br><br><ol><li>  The second-hand server is taken, practically, wherever it is within the country.  The specialist arrives, checks the equipment and buys it. </li><li>  The restored server receives an additional 3-5 years of warranty, as well as maintenance: a specialist travels, if necessary, to any point within the country and within one working day. </li></ol><br>  All this creates a developed infrastructure, including support and guarantees, which allow minimizing the risks when buying used equipment and focus on the benefits of such an operation, which, in the first place, can result in substantial savings.

      In Russia, this infrastructure is yet to be developed.  Nevertheless, according to the IT Creations model, the <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">Network Administrator</a> company is currently working, which collects, restores and resells used servers throughout Russia, as well as in the entire customs union: the Republic of Belarus, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.  We will rely on the company's sales department data on pricing and seasonality of sales of used servers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#018bc7">Used server pricing</font> </h2><br>  At what point is the price of the server lost?  How much?  When it makes sense to upgrade the server park?  Who can sell your old servers? <br><br><h4>  <font color="#018bc7">3 steps to reduce server cost</font> </h4><br><ol><li>  <b>New model range.</b> <br><br>  There are two peaks in server price loss.  Like the car, the server loses in price at the time of purchase.  Further, a serious decline occurs at the time of the release of a new line of servers.  Rulers come out with a certain periodicity, therefore, it is enough to simply predict this price drop. <br><br>  Consider the three brand leaders of the market - this is IBM (Lenovo), Hewlett Packard and Dell.  So, the HP lineup is the G1, G2, and so on up to Gen9, the last lineup that was released last September.  You already know that, as a rule, HP has updates every two years and, most often, in September.  This means that the next HP lineup will be released next year. <br><br>  Last September, when the HP Gen9 lineup came out, the price of the previous lineup dropped dramatically.  Accordingly, next September there will be another fall. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Seasonality</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/309/0de/98d/3090de98d55743f98d87d58f53b49237.jpg"><br>  <i>Falling prices for servers can be predicted for the upcoming season.</i> <br><br>  The cost of server hardware varies with the seasons.  Demand grows from September to about the second decade of December, and by the end of December stagnation begins, which continues in January, February and all summer months, when it is almost impossible to sell a used server, as well as the demand for new servers subsides. <br><br>  You already know that these fluctuations are due to the fact that by the end of the year, distributed budgets are very seriously spent.  So, tenders are won, government money is spent heavily in the last three months, and, as a result, contracting companies earn and upgrade their IT infrastructure. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Warranty end</b> <br><br>  When the official warranty ends, the price of the server drops again.  Usually the warranty lasts from one year to three years (from IBM, HP and Dell). </li></ol><br><h4>  <font color="#018bc7">Reduced server prices in numbers</font> </h4><br>  <b>Up to -30% upon purchase</b> <br><br>  Why?  Most often they buy from distributors who sell servers with a margin of 5 to 10% (retail).  Trading margin can be up to 15%.  From now on, used equipment becomes more difficult to sell, because  it is in fact already used, and another 10-15% of the cost is lost on this.  This is the minimum drop. <br><br>  <b>Up to -50% in a year</b> <br><br>  After a year, the entire server equipment will end on-site service warranty.  Warranty service - a significant piece of the cost of the cost of equipment.  Thus, about 20% of the price is lost.  The result: up to -50% of the price in a year.  This is also the minimum drop. <br><br>  <b>Up to 65% with the release of the new line</b> <br><br>  Depending on at what point in the cycle of new lines, a server was purchased, two years or a year after its purchase, when a new model line is released, the price drop will be another 10-15%.  This fall in prices is primarily due to the fact that people have a choice: to buy new equipment or a previous line.  Many people buy a new line, considering that the cost of investment will be cheaper - although this is not always the case. <br><br>  Plus there are brands such as SuperMicro.  This is a kind of low-cost server market.  Their price is about two times lower than the servers of the big three.  Thus, the buyer is facing another choice: SuperMicro of the new model or second-hand server of the big three?  This also affects the price drop. <br><br>  Based on the foregoing, approximately every six months there is a drop in the price of the server: a new model, a guarantee, a summer.  Every six months exactly something from this happens.  If the server is 6-7 years old, it is already worth nothing in the market.  All that you can get for it after this period is 1-1.5 thousand rubles, which is already more expensive than delivering the server itself to its destination. <br><br>  The controversial question is when is the best time to change the fleet of servers.  Perhaps the most profitable period of sale is autumn and 2.5 years after the acquisition (the maximum cost of equipment).  A maximum of 3.5 years, if the company planned to upgrade. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#018bc7">Maneuvering space for the price</font> </h4><br>  The most significant price drop occurs when the third ruler comes out from the moment the current model is released.  For example, last year it was G7 (Gen9 was released) - and the price of this equipment drops to 20%, even up to 10% of the cost of new equipment.  During this period, equipment obsolescence is already underway, and new system administrators already underestimate the equipment five years ago and therefore do not pay attention to it, because  on those.  to the characteristics, they rate it as already too weak. <br><br>  But this is not always true.  For example, companies restoring used servers sell servers no older than 4-5 years.  Therefore, for example, HP servers older than G7 are not available for sale.  One can argue with this, but, in fact, in 4 years there is not much change in terms of server requirements, especially in medium and small companies.  If earlier on one server there were 100 people of infrastructure and now there are 100 of them, and with the previous parameters the server coped, then even now it is more likely to cope.  In turn, the software does not change very much in 5 years. <br><br>  Also, at the moment, restored Gen8, purchased 2-3 years ago, most of which still have a three-year official, so far can not be underestimated, perhaps, absolutely. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#018bc7">Processors and hard drives</font> </h4><br>  On the new equipment processors have a high price.  Few people buy servers with the most powerful processors.  New servers are often weaker with processors.  On the contrary, if you take the ‚Äúold‚Äù Gen7 server, then the most powerful processors in the line can outperform the younger representatives of the new lines. <br><br>  The number and volume of hard drives is practically unaffected.  More often than not, buyers do not trust second-hand-hard drives and prefer to buy new ones. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#018bc7">Ways to sell used servers</font> </h4><br>  There are many options: <br><br><ol><li>  On their own.  Avito and so on. </li><li>  Through familiar system administrators or companies - from one company to another.  But, as a rule, this is true for very small quantities.  So you can sell 1-2 servers, because  they are expensive and can be ‚Äúattached‚Äù. </li><li>  Through a specialized company that restores used servers and, therefore, deals with their purchase. </li></ol><br>  If you want to sell 2-5-10 or 100 servers, then selling them is most likely not so easy, especially at an inflated price. <br><br>  Perhaps the least effective way to sell is through Avito and similar bulletin boards, since  there is a question of trust.  Especially if the server is already without warranty.  Few people will want to risk when buying, due to the risk of being left alone with a faulty server, which, in essence, means a loss of investments.  Therefore, in fact, selling through Avito is not as a legal entity, an IT company, it is extremely difficult and often in this way the server has to be sold very cheaply. <br><br>  A common mistake when selling through bulletin boards is trying to sell server hardware at an inflated price.  In this case, the following scenario often unfolds: the seller places a high price without receiving feedback due to distrust of the supplier and due to the end of the guarantee.  After six months, the seller lowers the price, but also (see p. ‚ÄúPricing‚Äù above), the price also drops by itself, thus even the discount in the ad is again overpriced.  Thus, the sale process is delayed, and at this time the server itself is rapidly losing value. <br><br>  A convenient alternative is the sale of servers through a company that specializes in this.  So the server gets a second life and a guarantee for another 3-5 years, as it happens, for example, in the ‚Äú <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">Network Administrator</a> ‚Äù company, which fully accompanies the purchase process and buys back server hardware throughout Russia.  Perhaps this is the fastest and easiest way to sell a server. <br><br>  The process of purchasing servers at <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/">Network Administrator is</a> well established and offers several advantages compared to similar Russian companies: <br><br><ul><li>  Servers can be bought or sold throughout Russia. </li><li>  No need to send the server to another city </li><li>  The specialist travels directly to the location of the server </li><li>  The company has a representative office in more than 100 cities of Russia. </li><li>  Transactions can be conducted online without risk. </li><li>  Full testing is done in the presence of the seller. </li><li>  Cash is transferred immediately. </li><li>  Confirmation is given immediately </li></ul><br>  With the purchase of used servers in PC Administrator, thanks to the guarantee and quick specialist visit (1 working day), the system administrator receives support comparable to the dealership and the opportunity to take full advantage of using a used server ‚Äî saving money, more power, a longer warranty. . <br><br>  Since the used server is no longer able to sell further, this moment is being amortized.  As a rule, the company restoring the server gives an additional discount and specials.  conditions to its regular customers after 5 years with further collaboration. <br><br> <a href="http://pc-administrator.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc7/edb/445/cc7edb445bd94726824ef3d66015a302.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268743/</a></p>
