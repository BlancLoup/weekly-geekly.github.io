  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DrugMe.ru: Medical Web 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This week, the interactive creative system <a href="http://www.e-generator.ru/">E-generator</a> (owned by <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/finam/">Finam</a> investment holding) presented a new project - a social network of medical orientation <a href="http://www.drugme.ru/mainpage">DrugMe.ru</a> .  As usual in Web 2.0-resources, users will fill it with content.  More precisely - those who have the need to discuss their sores with a view, perhaps, to meet practical advice to eliminate them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0d5/ca0/a36/0d5ca0a36f8005fa6e00a76ea8bbf230.jpg" width="251" height="81" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Members of the DrugMe.ru network can keep personal blogs, writing down thoughts on any topic related to health.  They can get acquainted with the information from the catalog, which includes a list of hospitals, clinics and doctors' names supplied with user reviews.  Now in the catalog there are only Moscow institutions and specialists, but as far as development, the plans cover all regions of the country.

      ‚ÄúSocial networks are one of the priority vectors for the development of Finam's Internet projects,‚Äù says Sergey Mikheev, head of the Internet projects unit of the holding.  - In the near future, we plan to introduce several new sites related to this segment.  I think E-generator.ru will be one of their main developers. ‚Äù <br><br>  To learn more about DrugMe.ru, we contacted <b>Eugenia Kronberg</b> , the head of this project. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What are the main differences of DrugMe.ru from the existing medical resources of the user-generated content family?</b> <br><br>  The existing medical UG-resources of Runet can be divided into: <br><br>  - Sites for consulting patients with doctors, general medical topics (for example, <a href="http://03.ru/">03. ru</a> ). <br>  - Specialized sites for specific diseases.  In addition to information about the disease, there is counseling and communication (for example, <a href="http://www.artritu.net.ru/">artritu.net.ru</a> ). <br>  - Blogs and forums on medical topics.  Consultation and simple communication (for example, <a href="http://medprof.ru/">medprof.ru</a> , LJ-community <a href="">ru_med</a> ). <br><br>  It turns out that in RuNet for the sick people there was no general site dedicated to communicating patients with each other, with some useful information, useful medical services and more personal space for the user than in forums and blogs. <br><br>  Now on DrugMe, useful information is a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù catalog of hospitals and doctors. <br><br>  Among the services atypical for blogs like LJ, are: <br>  - search for users with the same diagnosis as you, <br>  - the ability to leave feedback about a doctor or hospital (in Runet there were no good social directories of hospitals and general medical doctors), <br>  - the ability to make a tape of friends, not only for users, but also for certain diseases. <br><br>  In the near future, we plan to make a number of other health-oriented services. <br><br>  <b>Do you intend to attract new users, motivating them with some special advantages?</b> <br><br>  The main advantage of the social network, of course, is in communication.  For example, when choosing a doctor or hospital, people often rely on the opinions of other people who are more experienced in this matter.  If you need to quickly get medical advice, people often ask for the opinion of their friends. <br><br>  In addition, when medical facilities show interest in the portal (and this should happen, as DrugMe visitors are their targeted audience), we will offer them to provide bonuses to visitors. <br><br>  <b>How many registrations do you expect in the first month after launch?</b>  <b>And in a year?</b> <br><br>  DrugMe.ru is now trying to occupy the niche of medical social networks.  To achieve success, we will use all platforms of ZAO Finam and RedTram.ru.  Given that the potential audience of the project is huge (unfortunately, now there are almost no healthy people), by the end of the year we expect up to a million users.  Of course, this number will depend on the quantity and quality of the implemented services, on the interesting content on the site and other factors. <br><br>  <b>How do you plan to promote DrugMe.ru?</b> <br><br>  First of all, we will promote through the "viral".  We expect people to recommend this or that section of our site when they need medical care.  In addition, we plan to promote using popular science medical content in the form of news and entertainment texts of medical subjects.  We will also place banners on the websites of CJSC Finam.  There are other ideas. <br><br>  <b>What can you say about the business model of the project?</b> <br><br>  DrugMe.ru is a venture project.  If the project starts, there will be no problems with monetization. <br><br>  In the West, on the one hand, such medical social networks have been successfully developing for a long time, on the other hand, advertising revenues of Western social projects are constantly growing.  The Russian advertising market is lagging behind, but a similar trend is expected.  In addition, the fact that in 2006 the income of the site <a href="http://positivesdating.com/">PositivesDating.com</a> (dating for AIDS patients, USA) amounted to 110 thousand dollars speaks volumes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8535/</a></p>
