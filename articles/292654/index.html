  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the road of his imaginary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a9/c86/28d/3a9c8628d1184c82bc71a9d7efa759fd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Present</b> </h4><br>  So we decided on a gift - a quest with your own hands, handmade.  But after all, to come up with "do it yourself" is only half the battle, we still have to do it.  At this stage, you need to turn on the fantasy to its fullest, strain your ‚Äúcreative muscle‚Äù, so to speak, and press the trigger on the floor of your imaginary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And sometimes it turns out that we pressed the trigger, but things are not going.  Why?  - you ask.  Yes, because not often we have to deal with such things as creating a quest.  Not all of us are born to Da Vinci and Malevich, who are capable of such a fantasy, that the mind comes to mind.  So we are sitting, staring blankly at the screen of the smartphone and trying to ‚Äúsuck from the finger‚Äù at least something.  But enough lyrical digressions, let's get to the point. <br><br>  One of the functions of the <a href="http://goquests.ru/">goQuests</a> application can help you get moving, pouring gasoline into a tank, so to speak. <br>  It‚Äôs called ... Yes, it‚Äôs not called at all (I don‚Äôt want to fool marketing stuff), it‚Äôs just a button with a specific functionality related to what3words service.  In a nutshell: using this service you can get the coordinates of a specific place, consisting of 3 words (even a computer chair, standing in your room, and having the coordinates of "pants: rutabaga: Putin", for example) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After learning about this service, we thought that it can be embedded in the application to help in the creation of stages.  Thought and done. <br><br><h4>  <b>How it works?</b> </h4><br>  So you came up with a name for the quest, made it a picture and went to the list of stages. <br>  Here you see a red button, which, when touched, opens a map with a choice of a specific point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd9/2cf/498/bd92cf49805e4e3b88f8d843a21d6061.png"><br><br>  The center of the cross is the selected point.  She, as you can see, are assigned 3 words.  They chose a point, clicked "Use" and in the list of stages they appeared as many as 4 at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f5/03f/9a3/1f503f9a316e4abaa8ceea6d87a48e7d.png"><br><br>  The first three stages are related to coordinate words.  The person passing the quest needs to enter a specific ‚Äúcoordinate‚Äù word in the answer field in order to proceed to the next stage. <br>  Having guessed three words, a person gets to the 4th stage, in which he needs to enter these words in the right order, and if he entered them correctly, then a place on the map opens, which is attached to these words.  And to pass the last stage, he needs to get closer to the desired coordinate at least 50 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e6/eb3/2c1/0e6eb32c178d4afa9ec2198f428e7e0e.png"><br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <br><br>  Suppose you do a quest for a girl and you need her to finally come to the park, where friends with sheathed flowers will be waiting for her.  With the help of the very red button you find the coordinate where it should go, and get three words in return.  These three words are answers to riddles and tasks that you need to come up with. <br>  For example, the first word "Mug".  In St. Petersburg in the Balkan area there is a sculpture of the literary character Schweik.  Behind his back he is hiding a mug.  So you can write in the assignment: ‚ÄúYou need to come to Kupchino (I know, far away, but at the end you will receive a gift) to the Balkan square and find a bronze soldier there.  What is he holding in his hands behind his back? ‚ÄùSo with the rest of the words, which, in the end, will lead to the park. <br><br>  Yes, you will have to invent tasks yourself, but this is the essence of the "DIY gift."  The task of the application is only to facilitate its creation, as the sewing machine facilitates the process of creating a unique thing, and the application gives impetus to creativity and imagination. <br><br>  PS <br>  You should not be limited to four stages, between them you can insert a couple more, with video, audio, complex riddles and beautiful design.  So I wish good luck and more imagination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292654/</a></p>
