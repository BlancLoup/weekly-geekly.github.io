  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To treat your customers badly is bad for business.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>[Official Google response to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/searchengines/109017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/searchengines/109017/</a> ]</i> <br><br>  A recent article in the New York Times is connected to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html%3F_r%3D1%26pagewanted%3Dall">disturbing story</a> .  Poor attitude to its customers, one merchant told the newspaper that you can contribute to complaints and negative reviews, which will lead to an increase in links to your site, which, in turn, will make it more visible in search engines.  The main premise of the article is that a bad attitude can be beneficial for a business. <br><br>  We read with horror about the case of Mrs. Rodriguez.  Although our initial analysis indicated that this is almost an isolated case and is not a widespread problem in our search results, we immediately formed a team that carefully considered the issue.  This group has developed an initial algorithmic solution, implemented it, and the solution is already working.  Now I want to say that a bad attitude affects, and, I hope, it will always be bad for business in Google search results.

      As always, we have learned a lot from this experience, and we would like to share some conclusions with you.  Consider the obvious solutions to the problem: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Block a specific offender.  It would be easy and could solve an immediate problem for a particular case, but it would not solve a broader issue in general.  Our first reaction to the quality of the search is to find solutions to the problem algorithmically. </li><li>  Use mood analysis to identify negative comments and use negative comments as negative votes.  Although initially this option sounds promising, it turns out to be based on delusion.  Firstly, the terrible businessman in this story was not in the top because of the links from the websites of customer complaints.  In fact, many consumer communities, such as Get Satisfaction, add the simple attribute rel = nofollow to their links.  The rel = nofollow attribute is a general mechanism that allows sites to tell search engines not to give weight to specific links, and it is ideal for situations where you want to add a link to a site, but do not want to support it.  Funny, but some of the most reputable links to Decor My Eyes are on major news sites such as the New York Times and Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg article was about someone who sued Decor My Eyes, but the language of the article was neutral, so a mood analysis would not help here. <br><br>  Google has a world-class sentiment analysis system ( <a href="http://www.icwsm.org/papers/paper67.html">Large-Scale Sentiment Analysis for News and Blogs</a> ).  But if we lower the rating of web pages that have negative comments, you will not be able to find information about many representatives of the government, not to mention many important, but controversial concepts.  Until now, we have not found an effective way to significantly improve our search using mood analysis.  Of course, we will continue to try. </li><li>  Another option is to show user reviews and ratings for various merchants along with their results.  Although it will not reduce the bad merchants in our results and still be able to lead users to their sites. </li></ul><br>  Instead, over the past few days we have developed an algorithmic solution that detects a merchant from an article in the Times along with hundreds of other similar merchants who, in our opinion, provide extremely poor service.  The algorithm included in our search rankings represents the initial solution to this issue, and Google users end up with the best result. <br><br>  We cannot say with certainty that in the future no one will ever find a loophole in our rating algorithms.  We know that people will try: attempts to influence Google's rating, like those mentioned in the article, continue 24 hours a day.  That is why we cannot disclose the details of our solution ‚Äî the underlying signals, data sources, and how we combined them to improve our ranking.  We can say with reasonable confidence that a bad attitude towards customers will have a negative impact on your business in Google.  And we will continue to work towards better search. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109200/</a></p>
