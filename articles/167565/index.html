  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sports and Android: life-saving applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All people want to be strong and healthy, and in not so distant times it did not have to put any special effort.  In everyday life, there was enough physical labor, and no one puzzled over the organization of additional workload.  But times change, and many people devote their lives to mental work. <br><br>  As a rule, this is accompanied by an increase in concentration on activities far from physical ones.  There is nothing wrong with this, but one should not forget about the mortal body, it may still be useful.  Fortunately, technologies allow us to find healthy scenarios for the use of the same mobile devices, and we'll take a look at several of them today. <br><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Fitness Buddy: 300+ Exercises </h2><br>  When you first start this program will offer you to download a collection of images and supporting illustrations that make the process of learning the exercises more visual.  It is worth getting used to this, since practically all the application-trainers exploit the same data distribution scheme.

All available exercises, of which there are many, even in the free version, are divided into appropriate muscle groups.  In addition to the images, you have a step-by-step description of each activity.  After reviewing the list and selecting the appropriate options, you can add them to the list of activities as part of any workout.  A fast-running search should help in this, but the interface as a whole may seem somewhat outdated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d58/600/936/d586009369f81b197679b94cd106ee50.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cee/1e1/002/cee1e10027a34ec143e3a6721a841070.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f01/1c1/3d9/f011c13d9f0f491b39462a0b5f15683b.png"><br><br>  For lovers of maximum freedom of choice, it is possible to create a training cycle from scratch, but there are several selections designed for different levels of training.  The history of classes, which allows you to track your achievements, is located in the settings according to a strange whim, but for the rest, the use of the program does not cause questions.  The full version, in turn, includes an even greater wealth of options for bringing your own body to the desired condition. <br><br>  Install Fitness Buddy for free with Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.skyhealth.fitnessbuddyandroidfree"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb3/5b3/a6c/bb35b3a6c2400ed495c4551bda59b147.gif"></a> <br><br>  Buy the full version of Fitness Buddy for $ 0.99 from Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.skyhealth.fitnessbuddyandroid"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3f/f2e/a24/c3ff2ea2480d2b58586370156912af8e.gif"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  JEFIT - Workout, Fitness, GymLog </h2><br>  Unlike Fitness Buddy, JEFIT promotes a very serious approach to business from the very beginning, and immediately suggests creating an account for cloud-based synchronization of your training data.  Modern and relevant, and in some cases it may be easier to analyze the results via the web interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8e/8a8/c7a/c8e8a8c7afebb3afbbc3ce41413219a0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0e/f1f/462/e0ef1f4627b78573f6c85f18a1e300a8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83d/60e/b35/83d60eb354a11d0345ab7ea9926851ff.png"><br><br>  It is important that the credentials give access not only to the program, but also to the vast community that lives on the JEFIT forums.  So if you have questions about the selection of suitable sports nutrition and other things, you will not have to go far.  The utility itself is made in calm and bright colors, and in terms of thoroughness, data retrieval can be compared with the level 80 officials. <br><br>  In particular, you will be asked to fill out comprehensive information about yourself, measuring all relevant parameters, and set yourself the goal of improving them.  This will help a huge number of illustrated exercises, as well as comprehensive training programs that are easily modified to the needs of the user.  If you need to edit the default values ‚Äã‚Äãof repetitions, approaches and rest time, you can do this by turning to the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f83/5ca/fb2/f835cafb27939698e07a44c7202cf44d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ace/3bc/287/ace3bc287c44dd4fad11a8fecdc5c53c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e5/758/a03/1e5758a0314ab9c1e3acb4f3d06ceb2f.png"><br><br>  In addition, even in one utility it was not so convenient to set the working weight for exercises of each type.  The replenishment of the personal collection also does not cause any questions (just do not forget to download the images beforehand), and in general the interface cannot be called a dead end.  In a gym, when you have limited time, large and clear buttons are what you need! <br><br>  Install JEFIT for free with Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dje.fit"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cd/eb4/358/2cdeb4358d7499a13873b4cfd6d0d3cf.gif"></a> <br><br>  Buy the full version of JEFIT for $ 4.99 from the Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dje.fit.pro"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a1/0fb/e17/9a10fbe17a7062070dc1dc65c9e1d650.gif"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  Noom Weight Loss Coach </h2><br>  If JEFIT, according to the motto, was created by athletes for athletes, then Noom pursues a more modest, but no less significant goal.  This program is designed to help you lose weight, and vigorous statements when you first start to make you believe that the technique really works.  With careful study, it becomes clear that Noom is good, and even the most skeptical user is infected with optimism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/225/76c/16d/22576c16d31c8c5e00617f591560ea1e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af7/73c/090/af773c0905b7ea968b7b91f5906f3c6b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/458/f5c/b06/458f5cb06d578e70985d5f53cfcc298c.png"><br><br>  In the presence of a game component, which increases the fascination of any process, as well as a modern and stylish interface, thanks to which it is a pleasure to use the program.  Noom's weight loss trainer does not contain exercises as such, but its use is not limited to banal motivators and appeals not to eat after six. <br><br>  On the contrary, nobody restricts the user in habits, it is enough just to write down all the consumed food in a magazine, dividing products by calorie content.  The daily ration rate will be calculated automatically by the program based on the biometric data that you specify, and if you accidentally exceed the number of calories, you will be asked to walk or run, fixing movements using GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/037/925/3b0/0379253b0993d1b84c638b16eb68822a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab8/bfe/fcf/ab8bfefcf157a87d30f7fa1f696c963b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cf/a90/246/2cfa90246430c255189538c3589207c7.png"><br><br>  Thus, Noom is not only a nutritionist and mentor, but also a sports tracker.  In terms of stability of work and accuracy of positioning, the program can be compared with Endomondo and other segment leaders, so the service monetization model no longer raises questions such as when we first met.  The developers provide an annual subscription fee, but there is also a lifetime license for 30 USD.  It seems that this is a small price to keep fit. <br><br>  Free install Noom Weight Loss Coach from Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.wsl.noom"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/063/f3d/cbd/063f3dcbd70ae3fe22c83669289376b7.gif"></a> <br><br><br><h2>  Workout trainer </h2><br>  The last figure in our selection today belongs to the type of classic coaching programs, which is clearly indicated in the title.  Being formally free, the utility forces you to spend a little time on the selection of training, since most of them are distributed on a commercial basis.  Nevertheless, the Workout Trainer can be useful to those who want to not only do their own work, but also do it right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eaa/0f4/89f/eaa0f489ff6f4b52a1a5ae7ea21657e3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/287/ea2/967/287ea2967d4f89a2ba5604d6fff1565a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/452/895/d5b/452895d5b2f75a8e426469438a2ca4af.png"><br><br>  He has a powerful potential for planning and distributing workouts according to your personal schedule.  It is necessary to choose the necessary exercises, as at a certain moment the program will not hesitate to remind you of the need to perform them and will cause a fairly motivating trainer on the screen, accompanying your repetitions with voice prompts. <br><br>  Each program is designed for a specific period, but many combinations are possible, and there may be as many virtual trainers as possible.  In the end, your schedule is easy to clarify by switching to calendar mode and, if necessary, shifting certain classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/089/ef8/8ac/089ef88ac6a2bf2fa059f77961856127.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fd/9c7/f81/4fd9c7f81f8d7c9c7fba3a97c06d3580.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2aa/c29/8c6/2aac298c6ffa27529409b5d4a4a91f3a.png"><br><br>  The application interface is quite convenient and modern, except that the settings screen is somewhat out of the general picture.  Of course, there are regularly deduced proposals for activating monthly or life-long memberships, but you can not rush with this until you decide exactly whether you need a coach in your pocket or other ways to motivate yourself for feats. <br><br>  Free to install Workout Trainer from the Google Play web version: <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.skimble.workouts"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b50/2b8/f1e/b502b8f1ef92854a3dd4db0db50dd236.gif"></a> <br><br>  A close look at Google Play results for sports-related queries will introduce you to hundreds of results.  Among them, there will necessarily be both well-known trackers from companies of the first magnitude, as well as applied utilities for measuring the pulse, along with tips for performing individual exercises.  At the same time, it should be noted that the transition to an electronic system for recording workouts requires a fair amount of discipline and discipline, and in many cases it is easier to use a regular notebook or your own memory. <br><br>  On the other hand, decisions similar to those discussed above will allow not only to monitor progress in exact numbers and dates, but also present your activity in a visual form, which sometimes is very lacking.  Only beautiful graphics can be enough to take new peaks in a short time and warm up without hesitation at the weight that was recently the maximum for you. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167565/</a></p>
