Several articles are devoted to what are the ways for their own development as a specialist in data analysis and machine learning.  Also, several articles cover such topics as Data Engineering and consider such popular products as Cassandra and Apache Kafka.  But this issue begins with an overview of the online courses that start in the near future, related to the topic of data analysis and machine learning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Online courses (MOOC) on Data Science, starting soon </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">Machine Learning</a> (Coursera - Stanford University) <br>  One of the most famous Machine Learning courses, led by Stanford University professor Andrew Ng.  The course began on June 16 and will last 10 weeks.  The course is quite simple and clear, it does not require any special knowledge for its successful completion, and at the same time it covers quite a lot of Machine Learning areas.  You can still manage to register for this session of the course, having time to pass the first test. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/biostats">Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1</a> (Coursera - Jonhs Hopkins University) <br>  The first part of the course on biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University.  It began on June 16 and will last 7 weeks.  It is an unofficial addition to the Data Science specialization from the same university.  Well covers the basics of statistics and probability theory.  Again, you can still register for this session of the course, having time to pass the first test. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci">Introduction to Data Science</a> (Coursera - University of Washington) <br>  Course on the basics of Data Science from the University of Washington.  The course starts on June 30 and will last 8 weeks.  One of the most popular online courses on the basics of Data Science. </li><li>  <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/BUx/SABR101x/2T2014/info">SABR101x Sabermetrics 101: Introduction to Baseball Analytics</a> (edX - Boston University) <br>  Although the course started at the beginning of May, it is not too late to join it, since the deadline for passing tests for all modules is July 18.  The course explains many aspects of Data Science and Big Data based on an analysis of sports statistics (in this case, baseball). </li></ul><br><h2>  Data analysis and machine learning materials </h2><br><ul><li>  A series of materials on the popular method of machine learning Deep Learning: <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/06/deep-learning-deep-flaws.html">Possible problems with practical use of Deep Learning</a> [EN] <br>  The material is devoted to potential problems that may be faced by someone who uses Deep Learning algorithms for machine learning. </li><li>  <a href="http://igorsubbotin.blogspot.ru/2014/06/deep-learning-machine-perception-applications.html">Deep Learning Lecture</a> [EN] <br>  The method of machine learning Deep learning is gaining popularity lately.
