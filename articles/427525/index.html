Now it's time to move on to numbers.  Again, we are applying for exclusive information to an inexhaustible source of knowledge - <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/">the Anandtech website</a> .  Its experts conducted a <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13400/intel-9th-gen-core-i9-9900k-i7-9700k-i5-9600k-review">thorough and comprehensive comparative testing of three released Intel Core 9th Gen processors</a> .  For those who do not have the time and desire to study this 23-page major work, we will list the most important and interesting of it under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As already mentioned, the ninth generation of Intel Core is part of the updated Coffee Lake family, that is, it continues the glorious traditions of the eighth in all key parameters with the addition of a certain number of additional cores and megahertz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xa/l9/2y/xal92yih-le2red2pgyhfotdene.png">

      A little apart in the table is the top model, the Core i9-9900K.  First, this is the first i9, released in a standard, non-extreme socket, the same as the younger models.  Secondly, the presence of 8 cores, although not something completely unique (more happened), was also an attribute of extreme models with an X index and corresponding inhuman price in Core.  Now, ‚Äú8 cores for the people‚Äù, taking into account the motherboard and everything else, has become much more accessible. <br><br>  Another trend that we did not talk about last time was the gradual disappearance of hyper-trading.  Experts see two reasons for this.  First: ordering and trimming the line ‚Äúby cores‚Äù so that the consumer does not have questions, which is better: 6 cores with hyper-trading or 4 without.  Second: according to recently obtained data, the presence of hyper-trading reduces the security of the chip, which is also important in the light of recent events. <br><br>  Another interesting point that I would like to transfer to our digest is a list of turbo frequencies by core.  As already mentioned, the Core i9-9900K can overclock two cores up to 5 GHz and all cores up to 4.7.  The Core i7-9700K performance is worse, but in terms of "horsepower" and it looks very solid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/3x/c7/-r3xc7xtrrbvpynjjcdxmxqtnnu.png"><br><br>  Now, with the help of experts from Anandtech, we can answer the already intimate questions: how many new items are consumed at the maximum and does the TDP value have anything in common with reality?  Let's say right away: the answer to the second question is rather negative.  Here is the graph of consumption of the Core i9-9900K depending on the number of loaded logical cores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/xm/y3/qgxmy3fcpf6yooak5-o6rd1wzom.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the <b>maximum consumption</b> at the maximum frequency of the cores is 166 W at a <b>TDP of</b> 95 W.  Unfortunately, due to various indicators of overclocking, it is not even possible to establish a relationship between these two indicators, which further reduces the value of the TDP for the consumer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/gj/jq/vfgjjqugvq0ovobl3dn9pa0oxbo.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the consumption of Core i9-9900K exceeds that of i9-7900X, despite the fact that the number of cores and TDP in the latter is greater.  As they say, "looking at the world, it is impossible not to be surprised." <br><br>  We now turn to performance.  Already the first tablet with characteristics prepares us for the fact that we will not see anything surprising here.  On the other hand, everyone understands that in the basement with such parameters, new items also will not be.  In principle, it is already possible not to read further, but we still show some more slides. <br><br>  In the classic synthetic benchmarks PCMark and Geekbench, our new products are doing well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/ux/hh/djuxhhfdsro5nxxn2w-w9bscryi.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/dk/hc/wddkhcrnljsxrl01ymsut5dpkl0.png"><br><br>  In its announcement, Intel calls the Core i9-9900K "the best gaming processor."  Is it so?  The meticulous Anandtech members have tested half a dozen games to render a verdict: in games, the ninth generation really looks very good.  With nuances, of course - read about them in the full version of the test.  Below is the test result in several games with several options for picture quality - at random, without choosing the most winning one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/ck/u5/jmcku5_vn6u8iejljzv6myg6du4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/2b/29/ex2b29mf-j3qglty7xm8yaczryo.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/wt/a3/-owta34oehlbnbxw_fy8wzhevcc.png"><br><br>  Summarizing, we can say this: Intel Core 9th Gen is unlikely to disappoint you after the purchase.  Then the question turns into the financial plane, where each has its own priorities and calculation systems.  Well, we will not argue about tastes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427525/</a></p>
