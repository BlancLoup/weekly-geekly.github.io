Interview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alfa/blog/349612/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/wx/kt/cxwxktsgehh4hryge2lfbnojyni.png"><br></a> <br>  We are faced with the task of improving the products of the bank based on user experience.  You can solve this problem by testing the entire application, and write a report on several hundred pages with recommendations for remediation.  By the time this work will take about 3-4 months (nightmare, Agile and weekly sprints in shock).  This format does not work (we tried and not only, remember all the reports that are in your company from the agency that conducted the independent audit, and even usability testing).  By the time the report is ready, its value will fall by 30%, and when at least one of the teams is released and can start working on the proposed recommendations, the relevance will be even lower. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We cannot physically work with each of several dozens of teams, otherwise they will either tear us apart, or the teams will stand in an eternal long line, which does not please us either.  We always try to test with users and involve the whole team in the process.  Unfortunately, this is not always possible for objective reasons. <br><br>  This does not contribute to increasing culture and understanding within the teams, who such users are.  And yes, posters on the walls, CJM, Persons, etc.  also didn‚Äôt work much and didn‚Äôt help us.  And we decided it was time to get out of the shadow of the test room and one-off performances. <br><br>  What can involve the maximum number of people, and even so that at the same time it was possible to trust the information received?  We have accumulated a lot of materials with usability tests and interviews.  Why not share it with everyone in the form of a movie or a series?

      <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/annavoshkarina/" class="user_link">AnnaVoshkarina</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/annavoshkarina/" class="user_link">I</a> decided not to compile answers to the same questions, but to fully show each question and the answers of each respondent.  For the pilot show, we selected one topic and two questions that were asked to several respondents during the experiment.  It turned out a 35-minute video, by chance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vn/su/sn/vnsusntsz195za5-kvnianl5fcm.gif"><br><br>  Waiting for the premiere evening was scary.  We did not know how many people would come, whether anyone would come at all (despite the availability of food), how colleagues would react to the format, whether they would be interested.  In general, experienced a lot of stress almost like when you start the movie in the rental. <br><br>  During the show, as in this cinema, we have banned audio and video.  The film is broadcast only once in the same office. <br><br><h4>  Useful observations: </h4><br><ul><li>  Duration of 30 minutes is ideal for this format. </li><li>  Popcorn, big screen and darkness rule.  It turned out to create an atmosphere as close as possible to the cinema.  Maybe next time add more tickets. </li><li>  Best remembered first, and especially the last respondent.  Put the brightest and most important things at the beginning and at the end of the video. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/qe/23/wlqe23eluwsutx3ef3tm4xxvwzu.jpeg"><br><br>  The most biased colleague will never believe anything - no user quotes, no video.  After all, we always cut out only a part of the quote.  You can not alone persuade such a colleague, but the whole team can, if not convince, then at least affect him. <br><br>  We were hard to stop, so we decided to collect more feedback from our colleagues after they showed the movie with feedback from users. <br><blockquote>  - I liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreceiving feedback from the client in the form of a survey recorded on video, since we (methodologists and other team members) do not work directly with the client every day, we do not hear the "live" voice of the client.  The video allowed to hear completely unexpected opinions about banking services and communications with the client.  Such video sessions (on various topics) make it possible not to splurge on trifles, but try to think about the needs of the client more widely. <br><br>  I think it would be cool to make such a format: customers are asked the same question, and then different answers follow in a row. <br><br>  Elmira, Methodologist </blockquote><blockquote>  - I liked the format (such informal communication).  I would ask more questions and more specific questions about Mobile.  Interesting look from customers.  Useful for us as a whole and for developers;  this is something that you can adopt. <br><br>  Nikolay, methodologist </blockquote><blockquote>  - I like it!  Especially Alexander.  I would subscribe to his youtube channel.  And it‚Äôs better to make him the face of Alfa-Bank for 2018. <br><br>  Anton, Android developer </blockquote><blockquote>  - Useful feedback from users, you can catch what you really lose sight of.  Useful information to project on the interfaces that I will do in the future.  I want to see negative reviews, a solid negative :) Colleagues will help, because without feedback, they will not carve a great application. <br><br>  Vika, designer </blockquote>  As you can see, by and large, everyone was satisfied.  Developers and not only received feedback from users in a format that allowed, in 35 minutes, to convey the basic wishes and minuses to the maximum accessible circle of people. <br><br>  And we are pleased that the idea itself has worked.  A new series of plans will be released in early March.  In the following posts we will talk about the continuation of the experiment. <br><br>  Do you conduct UX testing?  How then convey to the developers all the pros and cons of their decisions, collected from users? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349612/</a></p>
