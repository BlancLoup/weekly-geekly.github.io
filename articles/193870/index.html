I tried a lot of things, but I didn‚Äôt stop at anything on anything.  RAID does not like the fact that the thing is quite capricious, inflexible and demanding to disk space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c40/9ff/7a7/c409ff7a7e4c367dd7af32ccbb9136cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What I generally want: <br><ol><li>  Merge disks with data into one massive array so that you do not have to manually sort the files - which occurs with several disks (even if you mount them in folders). </li><li>  Have the ability to add / remove / replace disks at any time without disrupting the array. </li><li>  Independence of information on disks from each other - so that the death of one of them does not lead to the inaccessibility of the others. </li><li>  Ideally, some method of storing a single file on multiple disks.  Backups are good and I do them, but it‚Äôs better when you don‚Äôt have to resort to them. </li></ol>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Drive extender </h4><br>  The closest thing to the ideal was Drive Extender from the Windows Home Server - all four points were implemented.  But the computer with WHS I did not live long and went to another host, and the usual Windows Server (then WWS2008, then 2008R2, now 2012) settled on the new home server.  Yes, Drive Extender itself also did not last long, MS did not finish it until trouble-free operation - sometimes it shifted unfinished files, sometimes it spoiled metadata ... I myself did not encounter this, but I heard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/493/c66/6cd493c66fc44ab26b29fd1c6f1467cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Composite disk </h4><br>  After leaving the usual Windows Server, I used a spanned disk for some time.  Implementation of the first item, part two - you can add disks (regular) and replace them with large ones (not very regular), parts of the third one - if one disk is dead, then you can pull out information from the rest with almost any program to recover deleted files - if there was no serious fragmentation . <br>  In shortcomings, it is impossible to remove a disk from an array, it is impossible to replace a disk in a regular manner, the death of one disk is shamanism with file recovery. <br>  Refused just after the death of one of the disks of the array.  Fortunately, he just began to pour in, and not suddenly died, because I managed to calmly copy the information and disassemble the composite disk. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/363/aaa/fba363aaa7e2004dd5b5cfea8b46ac26.png" alt="image"><br>  Taken at <a href="http://finders.cnetcontentsolutions.com/BestBuy/turn_old_drives_into_one_drive_windows.html">finders.cnetcontentsolutions.com/BestBuy/turn_old_drives_into_one_drive_windows.html</a> <br><br><h4>  FlexRAID View </h4><br>  The next attempt was the FlexRAID View, I even wrote a short review - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/113708/">habrahabr.ru/post/113708</a> <br>  Implemented the first, second and third points, with some stretch - the fourth.  But I stopped only on the functionality of the array, not paying attention to the RAID part.  Generally it worked, but it didn‚Äôt look very neat - text configs, periodically falling or forgetting to start the service, the permanent status of ‚Äúbeta‚Äù ... I stood for half a year.  It seems like today he grew up in a more complete solution, with a graphical configurator, and even for money, but I don‚Äôt want to go back to the past. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c5/6df/ef4/7c56dfef44cc73474c3ea76ecb166b65.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Taken at <a href="http://www.flexraid.com/screenshots/flexraid-on-windows/">www.flexraid.com/screenshots/flexraid-on-windows</a> <br><br><h4>  Storage spaces </h4><br>  With the transition to Server 2012, I had hopes for Storage Spaces, but as it turned out, this is just another name for the old OS functionality - software RAIDs and multiple disks.  Is that otherwise decorated.  Something better, but all the same - I have already tried this, did not like it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/4f9/5b2/8324f95b2f3c06ed11bf53b1d9ff1988.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Taken at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/10/storage-spaces-explained-a-great-feature-when-it-works/">arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/10/storage-spaces-explained-a-great-feature-when-it-works</a> <br><br><h4>  StableBit DrivePool </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c40/9ff/7a7/c409ff7a7e4c367dd7af32ccbb9136cc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A few months ago, when I was conducting a scheduled replacement of double-byte-by-three on three-byte, I wondered once again: what if there were any new options?  And it turned out that yes, there appeared.  <a href="http://stablebit.com/DrivePool/">StableBit DrivePool</a> .  By possibilities, this is practically what I need, all four points are fulfilled.  Chased the program a couple of test dates, and then bought, the benefit is only 20 bucks. <br><br>  The usual NTFS disks are combined into a pool; they remain visible to the system and programs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/829/23e/0bb/82923e0bb0d72e928bab14654770c30e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The file system of the pool lives in hidden folders. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b8/cd2/72a/0b8cd272ac16c8559b32073c308baf1b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The files themselves are stored as usual, there are no proprietary storage formats.  If the OS suddenly fell, the motherboard died, etc., but the disks survived, they can be connected to any other computer and get access to the data. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf7/8a7/d68/bf78a7d688e39fd7898a857c9107e0fd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Disks can be easily added and deleted; no formatting is required. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f1/b9c/4d6/5f1b9c4d6e22e2311b6ae8602e5096af.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Storage of copies of files on multiple disks is supported - by the number of disks in the array.  Two disks - you can store two copies.  Ten discs - you can store ten copies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/9c9/2d4/7ac9c92d41d5b3071c09a49393ae6a02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All versions of Windows, starting with Vista, are supported, both 32bit and 64bit. <br><blockquote>  StableBit DrivePool 2.X Features: <br>  Windows 7 (32 bit), Windows 8 (32 bit), Windows 8.1 (32 bit), Windows Vista (32 bit) <br>  Windows Server 2008 (32 bit) <br>  Windows Vista (64 bit), Windows 7 (64 bit), Windows 8 (64 bit), Windows 8.1 (64 bit) <br>  Windows Server 2008 (64 bit), Windows Server 2008 R2 (64 bit), Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2 <br>  Windows Home Server 2011, Windows Small Business Server 2011 Essentials, Windows Storage Server 2008 R2 Essentials * <br>  Windows Server 2012 Essentials, Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials * <br></blockquote><br><br>  In general, I got everything I wanted and even a bit more in terms of file duplication.  Although it does not cancel backups.  :) <br>  I tested the program for about a couple of months, and now I bought it and let it go into production.  Who wants about the same as me - I recommend.  Glitches during use did not notice.  The hardware resource takes a minimum - at AMD Turion 1.5GHz - approximately 10% of the processor during its tasks (balancing, duplication). <br><br>  Ps.  Of course, DrivePool is not the only program of this kind.  There is, for example, <a href="http://www.drivebender.com/">Drive Bender</a> .  But I left the site even without having read the list of features, but after looking at the screenshots of the interface.  Not that horrified, but terribly overloaded.  And the reviews are not very. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd0/6a0/0a2/cd06a00a249bd5a484ac944362b4e935.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pps.  No need to write about Linux, LVM and other zfs.  I know, under Linux for about the same for several years using mhddfs.  But it needed a simple and convenient solution for windows.  I found it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193870/</a></p>
