In addition, Anton Voitsekhovsky supported this idea, and under the electron microscope a variety of objects were already visited: from flowers to shadows.  Therefore, this publication will be far from IT-related issues, but, firstly, I think it is useful in order to broaden my horizons, and, secondly, a drop of IT is still contained in it - all this would not have happened without such rapid development of computer technology and its application in electron microscopy.

      Under the cut there will be a lot of pictures and quite a bit of text to clarify what is happening. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>This article was published on the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù blog for the purpose of accessibility for the entire Internet ...</i> <br><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br><p>  <i>There's a lot of space down there ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Richard Feynman, 1959.</i> </p><br><br>  All photographs were obtained using a scanning (also referred to as a raster) <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF">electron microscope</a> from samples without any sample preparation, that is, without deposition of a conductive coating on the samples.  Therefore, I can attend some artifacts on micrographs.  For example, charging provokes distortion of straight sections in the image and does not allow to shoot at high magnifications, charged areas are usually lighter, etc.  However, in my opinion, such a shooting is much more interesting from the point of view of practice.  So for a rose it was possible to observe ‚Äúblowing off‚Äù cells damaged by an electron beam, whereas this would not be possible if the sample were ‚Äúdusty‚Äù with gold. <br><br><h4>  "Bytovuha" </h4><br>  Let's start with a simple and, I think, a little less interesting.  They come in different qualities, different colors and designs, but we use them almost every day.  Meet the usual napkin: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4a/08b/390/b4a08b390186673a1914418031c8ff73.jpg"><br><br>  The micrograph shows individual fibers, which are intertwined with each other and thus form a single mass. <br><br>  Something looks like a napkin on a napkin, though the latter consists of ‚Äústrings‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/491/56a/d43/49156ad434035948f1baa5eea7172490.jpg"><br>  <i>Networks ...</i> <br><br>  Now a little harder - the razor of a well-known manufacturer (so that it does not look like a clear advertisement, I can reveal the brand in the comments): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/0fc/b50/5dd0fcb50fec59102c86c2e9195cc2cb.jpg"><br>  <i>A razor blade and pieces of leather on it ...</i> <br><br>  Since there was no new blade at that time, the photos were taken from a fairly well-used machine.  The photographs show clearly visible skin particles.  Yes, dear ladies and gentlemen, this is what is accumulated in the form of a light, barely noticeable white residue on your razor (maybe after that everyone will stop shaving?).  By the way, on the images of the edge of one of the blades, I think there is a coating.  It is said that the blade itself is covered with a thin layer of hydrophobic substance, which reduces the coefficient of friction and, accordingly, irritation. <br><br>  Of course, when scientific and technical progress did not reach our kitchens, many of us, when dealing with gas stoves, used matches.  Someone used them not quite as intended, for example, burned a match and ate the salty residue of a match head.  But not many people imagined that in this way they would actually eat ‚Äúnanotechnologies‚Äù (nanoparticles that are formed after combustion). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a25/e58/213/a25e5821382abb752e0568cf42b3085c.jpg"><br>  <i>Micrographs of a match head before (left) and after (right) ignition</i> <br><br>  I hope that among all of us there are many representatives of the beautiful half of humanity who often use the shadows, often, of course, for the mercenary purposes of attracting the attention of the strong half.  However, I don‚Äôt think that cute girls wondered how, at the micro level, what they like to put on their face looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/905/16f/24c/90516f24c3e7623ee1a7ae4565807110.jpg"><br>  <i>These "pancakes" girls put on their face every morning to wash off in the evening</i> <br><br>  Meanwhile, the shadows consist of individual scales, with a thickness of 100 nm, which is easy to see: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/ef5/63c/5a7ef563c7bd1de052ebbb593adbcc98.jpg"><br><br>  That's all for now with the household part, and now let's move from the world of "inanimate" objects to the world of our favorite flowers and animals. <br><br><h4>  Plants </h4><br>  Someone swallows them together with grapes, someone diligently ‚Äúcatches‚Äù them and separates them from the pulp, but perhaps nobody has seen them from such a viewpoint - grape seeds: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31b/2b1/efb/31b2b1efbfc70f09b5ed17865b7ae715.jpg"><br>  <i>Embryo inside the grape seed</i> <br><br>  Inside the seed kingdom: huge spherical cells waiting in the wings to begin to divide, multiply and, eventually, turn into a vine with a new bunch of grapes.  But for this they need reliable protection in the form of a kind of shell, the "shell": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56c/b48/d0c/56cb48d0cd05edfefcca8c1735154c5b.jpg"><br><br>  Notice that the cells of the envelope are coarser: they are elongated perpendicular to the surface of the shell and protrude out of the bone with their sharp corners, like guards ready to open the way for the inside to create new life with a favorable combination of circumstances: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c6/c16/673/4c6c1667389199d79b22dca07641878c.jpg"><br>  <i>Guardian of the seed enclosed within the grape seed</i> <br><br>  Does anyone remember what a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">violet</a> looks like ?!  These are such blue flowers, slightly wooly and from that very, very soft.  And all because on the surface some cells allowed growths: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/694/a03/f54/694a03f546802972d1bd979a450f4837.jpg"><br>  <i>A married couple on the surface of a violet flower clarifies the relationship ...</i> <br><br>  And the rest of the surface - countless ordinary cells: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3a/31c/148/c3a31c1482d5edcefe69cc65b7c6323f.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the conditions for organic objects inside an electron microscope are not the best: high vacuum, drying everything without residue, a strong electric field and local heating under an electron beam.  The latter, by the way, well demonstrates the bottom right picture.  While I was ‚Äúinduced‚Äù (customized focus, astigmatism), that is, the electron beam ran through the same rather small surface area many times, it hurt the cell ... <br>  Although without this, due to a combination of factors, biological objects inside an electron microscope do not last long: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40c/e2c/9be/40ce2c9bed8ca4c550a80e5036af464f.jpg"><br>  <i>Completely healthy, alive (left) and damaged, dying (right) cells</i> <br><br>  Perhaps, it was worthwhile to place these microphotographs somewhere at the beginning, for it was from them, or rather from a joke: ‚ÄúLet's take a rose!‚Äù - all the works presented here began: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02d/5dd/2f3/02d5dd2f3e44f842deb4b6032b0829a1.jpg"><br>  <i>Rose petal: looking for answers outside, and answers inside ...</i> <br><br>  The rose is just beautiful.  She is a rare example of a combination of inner and outer beauty.  See how strikingly different the surface of violets and roses.  In violet - smooth cells, and roses - rough.  One interesting property of a rose leaf is connected with this.  If the violet (I think, because of its adaptability to the high-mountainous and temperate climate) the surface of the flower "collects" water, the rose pushes it away, clearing the surface.  And these roughness plays a key role in this behavior of the rose flower.  The air is retained in the folds, creating additional water-air interfaces, making the surface more hydrophobic than it actually is.  This phenomenon has been called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_effect">the Lotus effect</a> , which is now finding more and more widespread use (for example, self-cleaning paints, car windows that are not fogged up, etc.). <br><br>  And here is a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">gerbera</a> with beautiful large and bright flowers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/920/51e/28b/92051e28baa64052421a49ac6280f1ce.jpg"><br>  <i>Modest and unassuming gerbera</i> <br><br>  And inside - the very modesty.  It‚Äôs not even interesting to discuss something, but let's compare ... <br><br>  A gerbera with a ‚Äúwinter‚Äù <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">aster</a> (as it was presented to me, but, I suppose, it is more correct to call it an alpine aster).  It seems that the petals of flowers are similar, and the structure of flowers resembles each other (after all, they belong to the same family), but in fact: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3d/ff4/9b2/a3dff49b2a8d4ac7f8310ed87fc9fbcc.jpg"><br>  <i>Astra seems more like a rose than its closest relative - a gerbera</i> <br><br>  The only similarity is the elongated cells.  I would even say that the aster looks more like a rose flower, only the cells are more elongated along the petal itself.  In addition, the place of attachment of such a petal to the inflorescence itself looks intriguing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/135/3f8/a26/1353f8a26a7193cfcd1b0fd9f5f99d75.jpg"><br>  <i>And then there are smooth cells.</i>  <i>Agree, funny ?!</i> <br><br>  And I think that these "hooks" - the cells protruding from the stalks - are given by Nature to this plant is not casual, can someone think of for what? <br><br>  The next houseplant should love the weaker half of the audience - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC">spathiphyllum</a> or in the common people "Female happiness". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80c/fd0/e6f/80cfd0e6f71c16dbead1703415343ec2.jpg"><br><br>  It seems to be nothing interesting.  But the respiratory pores in the flower are absolutely amazing (nervous and impressionable, and also it is better to miss this moment for children): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/be1/7e5/028be17e533f844e4c6782c6b2d6786a.jpg"><br>  <i>Respiratory pores</i> <br><br>  Since I caught the plant by surprise: it just wanted to shed its flower along with the seeds.  By the way, it is possible that the garbage in the previous images is due to the dying of the flower and the beginning decomposition, that is, the devouring of the flower by various microorganisms.  So, the seeds, but rather one single "seed" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34d/d17/657/34dd1765720b7e5e494e6e5b4e7e9523.jpg"><br>  <i>Spathiphyllum seed - all around the cell</i> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt even know what these small particles found in the place of attachment of the seed to the plant belong to (can there be any pollen residues ?!): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b0/8f8/2e0/6b08f82e065cfa5ba855dc58ef742ea2.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, a little about animals, but rather about their external cover - hair and feathers ... <br><br><h4>  Animals </h4><br>  Let's start with some trivial - human hair (had to be sacrificed from a beard): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c2/d50/5d4/1c2d505d4e1d387b6069b9e433ffc9e9.jpg"><br>  <i>The hair didn‚Äôt fit completely into the place allotted to him, I had to cut it ...</i> <br><br>  Of course, we all, at a minimum, saw in the advertisement that the hair has a scaly structure (in the upper photo you can see it well), but absolutely few saw the hair in the section ... Our hair looks like this or so after going to the hairdresser.  If it is interesting, then you can look <a href="http://animalworld.com.ua/news/news_445">at the</a> parts of the human body in color <a href="http://animalworld.com.ua/news/news_445">here</a> - many beautiful SAM micro-micrographs. <br><br>  One of my friends decided to start a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">budgerigar</a> , and when I came to her to show photos of the rosette, I was immediately handed a feather, just thrown out of my body by the parrot either from the wing or from the tail.  But this is understandable, pay attention to the number of microorganisms and other filth in the down: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/999/5ea/568/9995ea568847791bd3eb563984bb2284.jpg"><br>  <i>Micrographs of the budgie down close to the base of the pen</i> <br><br>  Although the main part of the pen (ostevaya) is preserved in excellent form.  See how perfectly ‚Äúhairs‚Äù are laid in the feathers - this is all so that the birds can fly and maneuver in the air, so that their wings are not a sieve for the air, and, of course, this also has its aesthetic function: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/039/2ae/bba/0392aebbaadb56b98775ba5b1b784110.jpg"><br>  <i>The rest of the pen wavy parrot</i> <br><br>  Well, when one of the researchers at our laboratory at Moscow State University found out about these photos, a small <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">peacock</a> feather was given to me to be torn apart.  Apparently, it once belonged to a young individual, since it was no more than 10‚Äì15 cm in length. <br><br>  Let's start, as in the case of the parrot, with the "undercoat" in which microorganisms also live.  Unfortunately, at that moment Wojciechowski was not there, eager to see the running "green men" on the surface of biological samples.  Here they, however, do not run, but simply stuck to the hairs of fluff: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c3/67e/adb/0c367eadb0c2594de9e7ad1cd877257a.jpg"><br>  And also a few micrographs of down, more precisely that part of the hairs, which is removed from the core of the pen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/783/a6e/dbd/783a6edbd7558a7ede0599b8a91395d0.jpg"><br>  <i>Like the "hairs" are inserted one into the other.</i> <br><br>  The main part of the pen looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/214/4fc/582/2144fc582d018db3b497601bac1810d4.jpg"><br><br>  Here, wide flattened ‚Äúhairs‚Äù are stacked on each other overlapping, which ensures monolithic feathers, lower air permeability and its beauty, both in battles between males and in relationships with members of the opposite sex. <br><br>  But that's not all.  If we compare it with a wavy parrot, whose hairs are short (about 100 microns in length) and rigid and do not have links with each other, then in the peacock feather such hairs are longer (up to 300-500 microns in length) and, accordingly, less rigid .  And so that they do not mess up when wearing such a chic feather costume, Nature has come up with the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec0/9df/3d9/ec09df3d97a0c334963e5151c53bf304.jpg"><br>  <i>The progenitor of zip-lock, created by Nature</i> <br><br>  Separate hairs are linked at the ends between themselves and with the help of such devices can link with adjacent feathers, etc. <br><br>  Finally, the hairs inside the feather have an interesting structure with broadening and thinning along one hair.  This determines the iridescent color, the play of colors and the peacock feather in the sun: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe9/23c/356/fe923c3567f79c617ddd45a3ede84d3e.jpg"><br>  <i>It is precisely such thickenings of individual hairs that are responsible for the play of the light of the peacock feather.</i> <br><br>  You can read about the structure of feathers <a href="http://www.origins.org.ua/page.php%3Fid_story%3D183">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  At the moment I have everything.
