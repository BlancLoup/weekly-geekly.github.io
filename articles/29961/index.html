  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transplant office on Macs: what problems?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that in the west small enterprises have been successfully using Apple products in their work for a long time.  It should be noted that large companies are gradually moving to Macs.  For example, recently read on Habr√© how it happens in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/40109.html">IBM</a> . <br><br>  However, the world of PC and Windows still reigns in Russia.  What prevents the domestic business from implementing mass switching? <br><br>  This article is primarily devoted to those who already use Mac for personal purposes, appreciate the charms and advantages of this platform, but do not dare to use it for office work.  I mean the leaders of typical small and medium-sized businesses whose activities are related to trade or the provision of services.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Problem number 1: adaptation </h2><br>  We are all familiar with Windows.  Today it is quite difficult to find an employee who will have to explain what the Taskbar is and where to look for the Microsoft Word launch icon.  With Mac OS, things are somewhat different - almost everyone has heard about this operating system, but not everyone has worked with it.  The user will have to find out what the Dock is, that the RU / ENG layout is stopped with the help of Cmnd + Space ... Actually, that's all.  Because the rest does not have to remember - the interface Mac OS X is designed almost flawlessly.  From the experience of cooperation with enterprises from various industries, I can say that almost every manager (lawyer, secretary, etc.) masters basic Mac OS X tools within an hour (5 minutes for introductory briefings, the rest is self-study).  But after a month or two, dragging him back to Windows is not an easy task.  :) Of course, there should be a person in the office who has experience in Macs - he will certainly have to answer some questions.  However, this does not take much time. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> to master the Mac in the shortest time possible for each employee. <br><br><h2>  Problem number 2: lack of necessary software </h2><br>  The main problem that keeps domestic companies from switching to Mac is that popular Russian software is sharpened exclusively under Windows.  First of all, we are talking about the software package from 1C, the system "Garant" and banking programs.  If from the Guarantor, specific banking software and 1C: Accounting is difficult to escape, then the system of sales management, customer relations, production, etc.  easily implemented using FileMaker Pro - a more powerful analogue of the famous product "Access" from Microsoft.  Yes, the accounting and legal department will most likely have to be content with a PC or work on Macs using <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/">Parallels</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> .  But these departments in most firms occupy no more than 20% of the total number of users.  Therefore, the remaining 80% can work quite comfortably under Mac OS X. <br><br>  The advantages of solutions on FileMaker Pro over popular ready-made products for Windows are as follows: <br><ul><li>  Support for Windows and Mac, as well as accessibility through the web-interface. </li><li>  Simplicity of finalizing applications - to work with FileMaker does not necessarily have to be a programmer;  it is enough to have a brain and elementary computer skills. </li><li>  Adaptation of the solution to the needs of the enterprise - complex individual projects based on FileMaker Pro solve specific tasks of the company and do not contain anything superfluous. </li><li>  Truly easy integration and support for system performance. </li></ul>  Solutions based on FileMaker Pro can interact with web-sites, 1C databases and other software.  For example, you can easily update an online store assortment using an application created on the FileMaker Pro platform. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> in most cases, the software problem is solved, and the solution is superior in efficiency to many standard designs. <br><br><h2>  Problem number 3, where are you? </h2><br>  He tried with all his might to find the third problem, but he could not.  All the issues of private switching have been discussed on the Internet more than one hundred times, and I don‚Äôt want to once again embark on hackneyed topics. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> not a lot of problems.  Save money.  :) <br><br>  <font color="#b10000"><b>UPD:</b> In the discussion there is an urgent question about why switch to Mac.</font>  <font color="#b10000">I think that those who are already working on this platform, everything is clear without words.</font>  <font color="#b10000">And those who are not in the subject <a href="http://www.macvspc.ru/">here</a> .</font> <br><br>  <font color="#b10000"><b>UPD 2:</b> I don‚Äôt need to ask questions about the reasons for switching to Mac.</font>  <font color="#b10000">I focused the article on those who are already thinking about the transition, but face some problems.</font>  <font color="#b10000">Already wrote in the comments and repeat here: I do not consider the price a problem.</font>  <font color="#b10000">I am convinced that working on Macs is a comfort.</font>  <font color="#b10000">In the concept of "comfort" I put and ergonomics, and the absence of viruses, and software quality and much more.</font>  <font color="#b10000">More comfortable conditions are more expensive, and it seems to me that this is true.</font>  <font color="#b10000">I am not campaigning for Mac, but only express my opinion and I want to indicate the solution of the technical side of the transition.</font>  <font color="#b10000">It is her that I am ready to discuss.</font>  <font color="#b10000">In fact, the Mac will suit even the majority of companies, but not all.</font>  <font color="#b10000">Do I need a particular company to move to a new platform - to think and decide not for me.</font> <font color="#b10000"><br><br></font>  <font color="#b10000">If someone fundamentally disagrees with me - you have the right to turn the remnants of my karma into ashes.</font>  <font color="#b10000">:)</font> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29961/</a></p>
