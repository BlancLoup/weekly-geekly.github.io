      Coach found online.  Four hours of online classes can be purchased for $ 50.  On contractor sites like Gamer Sensei or Bidvine there are more than a thousand Fortnite trainers.  These tutors themselves are not much older than their wards: ‚ÄúFor me, this is truly surreal,‚Äù said 18-year-old Logan Werner, a Fortnite trainer from Utah and a member of the professional Gankstars team.  ‚ÄúMy dad never paid me for video game lessons.‚Äù <br><br>  WSJ writes that for many modern children, Fortnite has become not just a game, but a social platform.  Here, players show what they can do.  Of the hundreds of players on the battlefield, only one team or one winning person remains. <br><br>  In modern society, winning at Fortnite becomes as much a cause for pride as it used to be at school sports.  Teenagers evaluate each other by the quality of the game - and even the authority at the school is built on the basis of the player's capabilities, says Englishwoman Ally Hicks, who hired a Fortnite coach for her 10-year-old son.  According to her, "there is a certain pressure on the players not only to play, but to be a really good player." <br><br>  Some parents buy Fortnite lessons for their children, and then sit down on the game themselves.  But often dads play worse than sons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/d0/4h/l2d04h1iatvvu5-olbmojepy-se.jpeg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Ian Robertson (Euan Robertson), an insurance specialist from the city of Arzier-Le Muy (Switzerland), plays in Fortnite with two sons, Andrew and Alexander</font></i> <br><br>  In the old days, only adults or older teenagers who sought to become professionals in eSports resorted to the help of trainers to upgrade the skill in a game.  Now this phenomenon is of a completely different level.  Increasingly, ‚Äútutors‚Äù are looking for parents for children of primary and secondary school age. <br><br>  However, even now some parents have a hope that the son‚Äôs extraordinary playing abilities will pay off in the future.  For example, in future commercial tournaments.  Epic Games recently promised to organize tournaments with a total prize fund of $ 100 million. In addition, some colleges and universities in Western countries offer special scholarships to applicants with abilities in a computer game.  Cybersport is now equated to a regular sport, so these preferential terms work for gamers just as they do for athletes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/xq/7p/ctxq7pgdqhzs7gvyinuqqo__j9u.jpeg"><br><br>  Fortnite has already been <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/us-digital-games-market/">recognized as the</a> most profitable free game in a single month.  In May 2018, the game earned a crazy 318.3 million dollars.  This is an absolute record in the history of computer games.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Epic Games is ready to spend $ 100 million to pay out prizes in tournaments.  This is her profit in just one or two weeks, and such tournaments will be an excellent marketing campaign and can greatly increase the popularity of the game. <br><br>  Now the global audience of Fortnite exceeds 125 million people.  According <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-of-a-videogame-sensation-joy-1532704017">to</a> the WSJ columnist, the game Fortnite ‚Äúsatisfies the need of young people for innocent confusion‚Äù (young people's need for innocent mayhem) - and this is the secret of its success.  In other words, here violence is presented not in a rigid bloody form, but in a soft form, practically in an animated "cartoon" interface.  Thus, even children can enjoy the game without traumatizing the psyche. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419029/</a></p>
