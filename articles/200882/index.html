I would like to shed light on this misconception and tell you about the six golden rules of effective ‚Äúlead generation‚Äù when promoting in social media. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Effective management of promotion in social media will expand the list of potential customers, and based on the results of research on their activity, you can significantly increase sales, which is why all social channels provide fertile ground for ‚Äúlead generation‚Äù, because you can‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.  The key point in this is only an erroneous commitment to use any one of the social networks: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or VK due to the fact that the audience of the chosen network seems richer to you, or because of the simple reluctance to hear your consumer. <br>  The time spent on promotion in social media always gives results that exceed even your wildest expectations.  Few marketers are seriously taking promotion in social media right now.  For many, this activity is optional in traditional customer search channels.  Using the six golden rules of effective "lead generation" when promoting in social media, I want to shed light on this misconception. <br><br><h5>  Rule number 1: Work with each client individually </h5><br>  Make your brand cute for promotion in social media, and for this, stop taking yourself too seriously.  It should be obvious to you that social media allows you to work with each client individually. <br><br><h5>  Rule # 2: Use different combinations of marketing methods. </h5><br>  There is no need to be limited only to the methods of ‚Äúoutbound marketing‚Äù (exhibitions, series of seminars, acquired email lists, internal cold calls, telemarketing and advertising).  Combine them with the methods of "incoming marketing", which allow you to get new customers through social networks, the blogosphere, and search engines.  Do not underestimate also paid opportunities to promote your business through contextual advertising.

    <h5>  Rule number 3: Adjust the production of attractive content </h5><br>  You must have good content and solid trade offers.  Without a well-established production of attractive content, any methods you use are likely to be doomed to failure.  With the help of "inbound marketing," customers themselves will generate you new attractive content. <br><br><h5>  Rule number 4: Clearly define what you want from your audience. </h5><br>  You need an urgent call to action.  An insistent call to action is a proven technique that is important not only in social media, but in other areas (television, radio, newspapers, magazines).  Clearly define what you want from your audience to get after reviewing your sales offer on the site or after drawing attention to your brand. <br><br><h5>  Rule # 5: Create only customer-friendly trade offers. </h5><br>  Always add value to your sales offers.  In the end, if you do not provide any value for your potential and real customers, then you get the costs in social networks that will never work for you.  Here is a simple test: put yourself in the shoes of your potential customers and ask what is valuable in your offer from their point of view.  If there is no value for them in your offer, you can start creating an offer again. <br><br><h5>  Rule number 6: Promotion in social media - it is always a two-way street! </h5><br>  Never forget that social media promotion is always a two-way street!  When dealing with customers, always respond quickly and sincerely.  Confidently send your messages using various combinations of key phrases and sentences.  Never forget to support communication lines in both directions.  Exchange information not only with those who actively say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to your trade offers, and is a loyal customer.  The main thing to do it sincerely, with pleasure and humor. <br>  Regardless of anything, you have to create your content with which people want to interact (share, ‚Äúlike‚Äù or comment), and you have to create it consistently and as often as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200882/</a></p>
