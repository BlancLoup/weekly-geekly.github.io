  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recommendations for interviewing HR specialists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past six months, I managed to visit several dozen interviews.  Not so much because I was looking for a job, but more for the sake of curiosity.  I was interested to know exactly how employers select and evaluate specialists.  During my small experiment, I managed to talk with specialists in recruitment, and directly with the heads of departments or divisions.  I have been to small companies where interviews are conducted by the director himself, as well as in large federal corporations, where 2-3 or even more interviews with various services precede the interview with your direct manager.  But almost always the first step in finding a job will be a conversation with a specialist personnel service.  I would like to dwell on this question in more detail, since it is HR professionals who decide to a greater degree whether you are suitable for a company or not. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I want to immediately warn you that this article does not claim to be true.  I just describe my experience in interviewing, typical questions from HR specialists and give recommendations on how to answer them. <br><br>  So, let's begin.  First - you came to the interview and go into the office.  Never sit strictly opposite the interviewer.  If possible, move the chair a little to one side to be on the side of a company employee.  Or millet turn the chair to sit half turn to it.  Whatever opponents of psychology would say, but this moment is very important and that is why: a posture when two people (especially those unfamiliar with each other) sit strictly opposite, is always perceived on an unconscious level as opposition.  You need it?  I think not, because it is much more effective to cooperate with personnel officers.

      <br>
      Next, I want to dwell on some basic questions that are likely to be asked.  And understanding what the HR specialist wants to hear on this question directly depends on the successful outcome of the interview. <br><br>  Usually the first question is: <br><br>  <b>Tell us about yourself?</b> <br>  Here, I think, everything is clear.  You need to talk about your work and success, and not about the fact that you have three children and how you spend your weekend. <br><br>  <b>Why do you want to change jobs?</b> <br>  When answering this question, there is one rule that I recommend to follow: do not speak badly about the previous employer.  These answers are pretty good: tell you that in the past work the development potential is limited for you (even if it is not so), and you want to grow as a specialist.  Or that the activity you are currently engaged in does not quite correspond to your desires, and working in a company where you want to work is exactly what you have been dreaming about all your life. <br><br>  <b>What do you know about our company / why do you want to work with us?</b> <br>  A partial answer to this question is outlined above.  However, before you go for an interview you should look for information about the company.  You should have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhy you came here.  Accordingly, it should be said that this activity is extremely interesting for you.  It would not be superfluous to mention how you can be useful to the company.  However, this is the next question. <br><br>  <b>How can you be useful to us?</b> <br>  Here it is desirable to give specific answers.  For example: raise sales of the product, improve the efficiency of the department.  And you do not need to go into details, rather general formulations.  As a rule, the recruitment specialist does not know all the subtleties of your work, he assesses what contribution you can make to the development of the company.  But at the same time, of course, you have to imagine what you are talking about, since your words will almost always be transferred to the head of the department, where you want to work ... <br><br>  <b>Do you pass professional trainings / How do you upgrade your skills?</b> <br>  If you have already mentioned your own development before, then this issue is practically unavoidable.  Therefore, it is not bad to prepare for it in advance.  Even if you have not attended any trainings / seminars / events over the past couple of years, you still need to tell you that you constantly communicate with colleagues from your field, read books, participate in discussions. <br><br>  <b>Who do you see yourself in 5 (10) years?</b> <br>  It is also a fairly common question.  They are understandable, no one wants to get involved with a person who himself does not know what he wants and does not set any goals for himself.  Moreover, the employer will not have to expect anything good from you.  Therefore, you need to tell who you see yourself in a few years and what tasks you would like to perform. <br><br>  <b>What do you like most about your job (what's not to like)?</b> <br>  Trick question.  After all, if a person cannot answer what he liked to do at the previous work, then most likely one should not expect any significant achievements from the applicant.  Yes, and dedication to work in general.  In addition, this question well helps the personnel officer to understand what you expect from work.  So what about the phrase phrases better to forget, and tell you what is really interesting. <br><br>  <b>Do you think you can handle the responsibilities?</b> <br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>What are your strengths / weaknesses?</b> <br>  The purpose of this question is to check how objectively you can assess yourself from the outside.  Therefore, it is advisable to tell about yourself more strengths and less weak ones, such that they do not interfere with this position. <br><br>  And yet, the main thing in the interview is not to be silent.  Even if you do not know the answer to the question, you need to talk out loud, show how you are looking for solutions, but not to be silent or say ‚ÄúI do not know.‚Äù <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that sometimes it seems at interviews that you are being asked completely idiotic questions (often the way it is), but still, in most cases, Eycharshiki assess how well a person is suitable for the company and how comfortable he will work there.  So if you are refused, perhaps this is for the best. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285458/</a></p>
