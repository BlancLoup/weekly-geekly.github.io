The IT industry is no exception: the user looks at the photos, studies the characteristics of the product, the terms of payment and, most importantly, the reviews of other customers.  It is the people's opinion that becomes the decisive factor and helps to make the final choice among the many proposals. <br><br>  Obviously, in a highly competitive environment, reputation is one of the most important assets of a company.  The experts of the studio Plarium Krasnodar will tell how to protect it and whom to entrust such a responsible business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/ej/gi/jgejgie537ajkjknaknwvishyze.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Risks in the global network </h3><br>  Many people think that it is enough to start advertising, create your website or accounts in social networks - and the target audience will learn about their company.  And learns only good.  Typically, managers who hold these views may put the reputation of the managers of SMM and PR, or even their secretary.  However, things are not so simple.

      Being in the Global Network means being at risk.  Any information that goes on the Internet, overnight becomes the property of the general public, which forms an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyou as a bona fide (or not) producer.  In game development, and in any other sphere, delay is an unaffordable luxury, so it is better to protect yourself and isolate the wiring, relying on competent specialists, rather than wait for a fire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j0/gm/ot/j0gmotyohvw0q9hynihuxee98l8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Competences of an ORM specialist </h3><br>  Who is the online reputation manager (ORM), on whose shoulders falls such a serious task?  What does he do and what secret knowledge does he have?  The first and most obvious function is to keep track of all references to the company and its products, as well as preserve a positive image. <br><br>  This requires unconditional technical literacy and analytical skills.  In addition, the reputation manager should: <br><br><ul><li>  be proficient in monitoring tools; </li><li>  to distinguish between types of negative references and methods of their processing; </li><li>  have the skills of a diplomat, be able to localize and eliminate conflicts; </li><li>  to be guided in the national and international legislation, to understand, according to which laws it is possible to act in this or that situation; </li><li>  if necessary, provide technical support to users. </li></ul><br><h3>  Analytics Mentions </h3><br><h4>  Pyramid rule </h4><br>  Getting started, first of all it should be understood that the "healthy" information field is a set of references of different nature.  Neutral statements that contribute to the popularity of the project should prevail: if a large number of reviews and reviews are published online, then there is an opportunity to learn about the product.  At the second stage - positive comments and recommendations for other users, and at the third - a small blotch of negative. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/ck/iz/1kckizsomznmtj4r67dwo8-epey.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The latter is important, since in the complete absence of negative comments, it seems that the company has ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù something.  Certain characteristics of the product may not suit one person and please another, therefore such comments are always there.  In addition, according to statistics, people are more inclined to leave feedback in a negative emotional outburst: in case of failures and failures, they write much more often than when everything is functioning correctly. <br><br>  It is important to understand that even a negative reaction speaks of the caring for the project, and is also a valuable resource for the company.  You need to listen to users and implement their proposals, if the balance allows.  It should be borne in mind that the feedback and wishes are contradictory.  So, in our gaming communities, some subscribers ask for a respite from endless battles, while others write: ‚ÄúWe want to fight more, let us all make war‚Äù.  In such situations, we try to keep in mind the difference in gaming experience (that a newcomer is dying, then to a seasoned person is a joy) and deduce the general tendency. <br><br><h4>  Monitoring </h4><br>  For searching and processing information, as well as for rapid response, a lot of time and effort are required.  The ORM specialist will not be able to fully cover the network space with the speed of the machine algorithm, which reveals about 80% of references to the company and its products.  Programs such as Brand Analytics, YouScan or SemanticForce are great for monitoring.  You can also use the free Google Alerts tool to keep up with the latest indexed resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5w/a3/q2/5wa3q2hhsbl29lc0h0znlr09uza.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Programs aggregate a huge amount of data and in addition help to get additional information about the audience and sites.  However, they often fail to assess the tone of the messages: they do not recognize ironic or joking statements and define some words as negative, although these are neutral references in the overall style of the project.  Such negative words as ‚Äúthreat‚Äù, ‚Äúwar‚Äù, ‚Äúdefense‚Äù, ‚Äúmenacing Vikings‚Äù, ‚Äúget ready to fight‚Äù can be considered negative.  All of them are characteristic of the setting of our game Vikings: War of Clans. <br><br>  It is necessary to competently introduce into the work analytical tools, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages.  That is why, firstly, we manually monitor the search engines (we estimate the results according to the most popular requests about our projects and studios) and markets (we check large sites for communication with users and receiving feedback).  Secondly, we collect mentions in social networks (VK, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and on third-party blogs and sites. <br><br>  The most important thing at this stage is to work out all potential sources of information: social networks, forums, blogs, video services, otzoviki sites.  And of course, keep your finger on the pulse. <br><br><h4>  Typing and response </h4><br>  To ensure effective protection of reputation, it is not enough just to quickly collect data ‚Äî before making a decision about a reaction, references must be typed. <br><br>  Mostly ORM specialists work with constructive and non-constructive negative comments.  The first are comments and suggestions that can be transferred to other departments for further consideration.  We take them into service, and we thank the authors and encourage them for their desire to make our projects better. <br><br>  Non-constructive comments are divided into several subtypes: <br><br><ul><li>  Emotional negative: disgruntled players want to express everything that boils and get feedback from the company's employees with the promise to understand the situation. </li><li>  Trolling: unreasonable attacks that should not be responded to, as any attempt at dialogue will be the pretext for new charges. </li><li>  Black PR from competitors seeking to spoil your reputation and spreading negative reviews from third-party accounts (you can point to the positive qualities of the product or ask for a more detailed description of the problem). </li></ul><br>  In all three cases, brand advocates and loyal users often come to the rescue, drawing attention to the benefits of the project. <br><br><h3>  Other reputational threats </h3><br>  An ORM specialist is a guru for identifying hidden and not very hidden threats.  Protection of copyright, protection against fraudsters and against information leakage is provided by a number of departments, but often it is reputational managers who are the first to sound the alarm. <br><br><h4>  Copyright </h4><br>  There are cases when unscrupulous development companies copy interface elements (icons, their location) or design and content completely.  If a copyright infringement is found, you must immediately contact Google Play and the App Store so that your company account is blocked without the right to restore.  Intellectual property is strictly protected: judging by our experience, the markets always go forward and the issue is solved in favor of the affected party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/qx/sf/hqqxsfrzwju6xquejb4zudsfgd4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Scammers </h4><br>  On social networks and on various websites, users are sometimes offered to provide their username and password or install software in order to return the money invested in the game or get some advantages.  This serves someone else‚Äôs commercial gain: personal data is stolen, and the device is infected with viruses.  Such pages can be blocked by contacting the hosting providers or the social networking technical support service, and if the information appears inside the game or on official resources, it is necessary to immediately block the scam accounts and delete their messages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/53/eq/cl/53eqclbewxu9ugtxwbw1qi-qgt8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Information leak </h4><br>  In a highly competitive environment, leakage can lead to serious financial losses.  Remember the rule of three seconds: what happened on the Net for at least three seconds is scored, copied and already distributed. <br><br>  Sources of Intentional and Unintended Leaks: <br><br><ul><li>  employees (publishing photos from private presentations, revelations in a friendly conversation); </li><li>  partners (publishing photos from private events, occasional references to internal business processes); </li><li>  competitors (targeted insiding). </li></ul><br>  In the field of innovative developments, where it is important to be proactive, we need serious protection mechanisms.  The ORM specialist, in turn, tries to detect leaks in time and promptly respond to them. <br><br><h3>  Summing up </h3><br>  Today, the information field around the product is no less important than the product itself, and reviews on the Web are more weighty than estimates by official sources.  The tasks of a reputation manager are quality analytics, rapid detection and elimination of threats, as well as maintaining loyalty to the target audience.  Do you have an ORM specialist in your company? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351696/</a></p>
