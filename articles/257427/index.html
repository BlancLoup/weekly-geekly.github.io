One of the many cheap 300W P4 ready.  I hope you don‚Äôt need to be reminded that in reality this 300W means no more than 150, and that with the appearance of the smell of roast in the apartment. <br><br>  I expect that my experience will be useful to someone from a practical point of view, and therefore I will focus on theory.  Without it, it will still not be possible to remake the BP.  in any case, there will be some differences in the scheme and difficulty in setting up. <br><br>  <b>ATX power supply circuit</b> <br>  To begin with, let's go through the ATX power supply circuit on the TL494 controller (and its numerous clones). <br>  All schemes are very similar to each other.  Google gives them out quite a lot and it seems I found it almost corresponding to my copy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e4/b6b/07a/5e4b6b07aba3425fb2c2bbe28466008f.gif" alt="image"><br>  <a href="">Full size link to the diagram</a> <br><br>  Structurally, we divide the BP into the following blocks: <br>  - mains rectifier with filter <br>  - standby power supply (+ 5V standby) <br>  - main power supply (+ 12V, -12V, + 3.3V, + 5V, -5V) <br>  - Basic voltage control circuit, PowerGood signal generation and short-circuit protection <br><br>  Rectifier with filters is all that is in the upper left corner of the circuit to the diodes D1-D4. <br><br>  The source of standby power is assembled on the transformer T3 and transistors Q3 Q4.  Stabilization is based on feedback through the U1 optocoupler and the TL431 reference voltage source.  I will not consider in detail the work of this part.  I know that too long articles are not very fun to read.  At the end I will give the name of the book, where all the details are discussed in detail. <br><br>  <i>Please note that in the circuit, by mistake, the TL494 PWM controller and the TL431 stand-by power supply ion source are designated as IC1.</i>  <i>In the future, I will mention IC1 meaning precisely the PWM controller.</i> <br><br>  The main power source is assembled on a transformer T1, high-voltage switches Q1 Q2, a control transformer T2 and low-voltage switches Q6 Q7.  The whole thing is swinging and controlled by the IC1 PWM chip.  Understanding the principle of operation of the controller and the purpose of each element of its strapping is just what is needed for the conscious refinement of the BP instead of blindly repeating other people's recommendations and schemes. <br><br>  The mechanism of operation is approximately as follows: the PWM controller, alternately opening the low-voltage switches Q6 Q7, creates an EMF in the primary winding of the T2 transformer.  See, these keys are powered by low voltage from a standby power source?  Find on the diagram R46 and understand what I mean.  The PWM controller is also powered by this duty voltage.  Just above, I called the transformer T2 a control, but it seems he has some more correct name.  Its main task is the galvanic isolation of the low-voltage and high-voltage parts of the circuit.  The secondary windings of this transformer control the high-voltage switches Q1 Q2, alternately opening them.  With this trick, low-voltage PWM controller can control high-voltage switches in compliance with security measures.  The high-voltage switches Q1 Q2, in turn, swing the primary winding of the transformer T1 and the main voltages of interest arise on its secondary windings.  High-voltage, these keys are called because they commute rectified mains voltage, and it is about 300V!  The voltage from the secondary windings T1 is rectified and filtered using LC filters. <br><br>  Now, I hope, the whole picture you imagine and we can go on. <br><br>  <b>PWM controller TL494.</b> <br>  Let's see how the PWM controller TL494 works. <br>  It would be better if you download the datasheet <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl494.pdf">www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl494.pdf</a> , but in principle I will try to <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl494.pdf">extract</a> from it the most important thing with the help of pictures.  For a deeper understanding of all the subtleties I advise this document: <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva001e/slva001e.pdf">www.ti.com/lit/an/slva001e/slva001e.pdf</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dc/f16/84f/8dcf1684f16f468d9b85fd8742acb54c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's start, oddly enough, from the end - with the output part of the chip. <br>  Now all attention to the output element OR (marked with a red square). <br>  The output of this element at a specific point in time directly controls the state of one or both keys Q1 Q2. <br>  The control option is set via pin 13 (Output control). <br><br>  Important thing number 1: if the output element OR log 1 - output keys are closed (turned off).  This is true for both modes. <br>  Important thing number 2: if the output element OR log 0 - one of the keys (or both at once) is open (enabled). <br><br>  The following picture emerges: on the rising front, the previously opened transistor closes (at this moment both of them are guaranteed to be closed), the trigger changes its state and on the downward front another key is turned on and will remain on until the rising edge comes again and closes it, the moment again, the trigger is fliped over and the next descending front will open another transistor.  In single ended mode, the keys always work synchronously and the trigger is not used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/f1e/0f2/023f1e0f2e7c40928b63e265e2a6c0b1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The time when the output is in the log.  1 (and both keys are locked) is called Dead time. <br>  The ratio of the pulse duration (log. 0, the transistor is open) to the period of their repetition is called the duty cycle (PWM duty cycle).  For example, if the ratio is 100% then the output element OR is always 0 and the transistor (or both) is always open. <br><br>  Sorry, but I try to explain as much as possible and almost on my fingers, because this can be read in an official dry language and in a datasheet. <br><br>  Oh yeah, why do we need Dead time?  In short: in real life, the top key will pull up (to plus) and the bottom down (to minus).  If you open them simultaneously - there will be a short circuit.  This is called through current and because of parasitic capacitances, inductances and other features such a mode arises even if you open the keys strictly in turn.  In order to minimize the through current, dead time is needed. <br><br>  Now let's pay attention to the saw generator (oscillator), which uses pins 5 and 6 of the chip to set the frequency. <br>  A resistor and a capacitor are connected to these pins.  This is the very RC generator about which probably many have heard.  Now at pin 5 (CT) we saw from 0 to 3.3V.  As you can see, this saw is fed to the inverting inputs of the Comparators Dead-time and PWM. <br><br>  The terms and operation of the output part of the PWM controller are more or less defined, now we will deal with what it saw and why do we need all these comparators and error amplifiers.  We realized that the ratio of the pulse duration to the period of their sequence determines the fill factor, and hence the output voltage of the power source because  The more energy is pumped into the primary winding of the transformer, the greater the fill factor. <br><br>  For example, let's look at what needs to be done to set the fill factor to 50%.  Do you still remember about the saw?  It is fed to the inverting inputs of the PWM and Dead time comparators.  It is known that if the voltage on the inverting input is higher than on the non-inverting input - the comparator output will be log.0.  Let me remind you that the saw is a signal that rises smoothly from 0 to 3.3v, after which a sharp drop in 0v. <br>  Thus, at the output of the comparator 50% of the time there was a log.0 ‚Äî half of the saw voltage should be fed to the non-inverting input (3.3V / 2 = 1.65V).  This will give the desired 50% duty cycle. <br><br>  We noticed that both comparators converge on the very same OR element, which means that as long as one of the comparators issues log.1, the other cannot prevent it.  Those.  priority is the comparator, which leads to a lower fill factor.  And if at the Dead time comparator voltage is supplied from the outside, then the PWM comparator can be signaled from the outside (3 pins) or from the built-in error amplifiers (these are ordinary opamps).  They are also connected according to the scheme OR, but since  we are already dealing with an analog signal - the OR circuit is implemented using diodes.  Thus, the control over the fill factor captures that error amplifier, which asks for a smaller fill factor.  The state of the other does not matter. <br><br>  <b>Feedback.</b> <br>  Well, now how to build a power source on all this?  Very simple!  It is necessary to cover the BP negative feedback.  The difference between the desired (specified) and the available voltage is called an error.  If at each moment of time we influence the fill factor so as to correct the error and bring it to 0, we obtain stabilization of the output voltage (or current).  Feedback is negative as long as the control action reacts to the error with the opposite sign.  If the feedback is positive - write gone!  In this case, the feedback will increase the error instead of reducing it. <br><br>  All this is work for those error boosters.  A reference voltage (standard) is applied to the inverting input of the error amplifier, and a voltage is applied to the non-inverting input power supply.  By the way, inside the PWM controller there is a 5V reference voltage source, which is a reference point in all measurements. <br><br>  <b>Feedback Compensation</b> <br>  I do not even know how to explain this in a simpler way.  With feedback, everything is simple only in an ideal world.  In practice, if you change the fill factor - the output voltage does not change immediately, but with some delay. <br><br>  For example, the error amplifier registered a voltage drop at the output, corrected the fill factor and stopped interfering with the system, but the voltage continues to increase and then the error amplifier is forced to adjust the fill factor again in the other direction.  This situation is due to a delayed reaction.  So the system can go into oscillation mode.  They are fading and non-fading.  A power supply unit in which sustained oscillations of the feedback signal may occur will not last long and is unstable. <br><br>  Feedback has a certain bandwidth.  Suppose 100kHz band.  This means that if the output voltage oscillates with a frequency higher than 100 kHz, the feedback will simply not notice this and nothing will be corrected.  Of course, we would like the feedback to respond to changes in any frequency and the output voltage was as stable as possible.  Those.  the struggle is to ensure that the feedback is as broadband as possible.  However, the very delayed reaction will not allow us to make the band infinitely wide.  And if the bandwidth of the feedback circuit is wider than the capacity of the BP itself to test the control signals (direct link) - at some frequencies negative feedback will suddenly become positive and instead of compensating for the error it will increase it even more, and this is precisely the conditions for the occurrence of oscillations. <br><br>  Now, from delays in seconds, let's move on to frequencies, gains and phase shifts ... <br>  The bandwidth is the maximum frequency at which the gain is greater than 1. <br>  As the frequency increases, the gain decreases.  In principle, this is true for any amplifier. <br>  So, in order for our PSU to work stably, one condition must be met: in the entire frequency band, where the total gain of the forward and feedback link is greater than 1 (0 dB), the phase lag should not exceed 310 degrees.  180 degrees introduces the inverting input of the error amplifier. <br><br>  By entering feedback, various filters ensure that this rule is fulfilled.  If it is very rough, then the feedback compensation is the adjustment of the bandwidth and the frequency response of the feedback for the response of a real power source (for the characteristics of a direct connection). <br><br>  This topic is not very simple, under it lies a pile of mathematics, research and other works ... I just try to state the essence of the issue in an accessible form.  I can recommend to read this article, where, although not so on the fingers, but this question is also presented in an accessible form and references to the literature are given: <a href="http://bsvi.ru/kompensaciya-obratnoj-svyazi-v-impulsnyx-istochnikax-pitaniya-chast-1/">bsvi.ru/kompensaciya-obratnoj-svyazi-v-impulsnyx-istochnikax-pitaniya-chast- one</a> <br><br>  <b>From theory to practice</b> <br>  Now we can look at the PSU scheme and understand that there is a lot of excess in it.  First of all, I dropped everything related to the control of output voltages (Power good signal conditioning circuit).  Neutralized the error amplifiers built into the PWM controller by supplying + 5vref to the inverting inputs and setting the non-inverting to GND.  Removed the nominal short circuit protection circuit.  I cut out all unnecessary output voltage filters that are not used ... I replaced the output diodes with more powerful ones.  Replaced the transformer!  Vypayal him from a quality power supply where the written 400W really mean 400W.  The difference in size between what stood here before it speaks for itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e5/2f9/55f/7e52f955f4a34736898aea9fd18a039e.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Replace the chokes in the output filter (from the same 400W power supply) and put the capacitors on 25V: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/863/13d/e7e/86313de7ed094c10abd38dfda862c73c.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, I developed a circuit that allows you to adjust the stabilization of the output voltage and set the current limit of the output power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/160/c8d/e4c160c8d48740bcad1590420a6641c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The circuit implements external error amplifiers assembled on LM358 operational amplifiers and several additional functions in the form of a shunt amplifier (INA197) for current measurement, several buffer amplifiers for outputting the value of installed and measured current and voltage to another board where the digital display is assembled.  I will tell about it in the next article.  Issuing signals to another card as is - not the best solution because  The signal source can be quite high resistance, the wire catches noise, making it difficult for the feedback to work steadily.  In the first iteration, I ran into this and had to redo everything.  In principle, everything is signed on the scheme, I see no point in commenting on it in detail and I think that for those who understood the theory above, everything should be pretty obvious. <br><br>  I will only note that the C4R10 and C7R8 chains are the feedback compensation I mentioned above.  Honestly, the fine article embedder under the nickname BSVi really helped in setting it up.  <a href="http://bsvi.ru/kompensaciya-obratnoj-svyazi-prakticheskij-podxod/">bsvi.ru/kompensaciya-obratnoj-svyazi-prakticheskij-podxod</a> This approach really works and after spending a day or two I was able to achieve stable operation of the BP method described in the article.  Now, of course, I would have done it for about two hours, probably, but then there was no experience and, through carelessness, I blew quite a few transistors. <br><br>  Oh yeah, pay attention to the capacity of the C7!  1uF is pretty much.  This is done in order to clamp current feedback in speed.  This is such a dirty hack to overcome the instability arising at the border of the transition from voltage stabilization to current stabilization.  In such cases, apply some more sophisticated techniques, but I did not bother so.  I don‚Äôt need super accurate current stabilization, besides, by the time I ran into this trouble, the BP rework project had a great deal of annoyance! <br><br>  Under this scheme, a laser iron was made board: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abc/e18/957/abce18957dda49fd9f176d31c2c4742f.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  It is built into the BP in this way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc2/541/b5e/dc2541b5e12748548ad16d71a1881c01.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  As a shunt for measuring the current, a piece of copper wire of a length of 10 centimeters probably was selected. <br><br>  I used the case from a fairly high-quality Hiper PSU.  This seems to be the most ventilated hull I've ever seen. <br><br>  Also there was a question about connecting the fan.  BP is regulated from 0 to 24V, which means that the cooler will have to be powered from the duty rooms.  The duty is represented by two voltages - stable 5V, which go to the motherboard and not stabilized, service power of about 13.5V, which is used to power the PWM controller itself and to swing the control transformer.  I used the usual linear stabilizer to get stable + 12V and started them on a small scarf thermoregulation speed of the cooler, vypayannuyu from the same Hiper'a.  The scarf was fastened to the radiator with a screw simply for reasons of ease of connecting the cooler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51d/4c0/9f1/51d4c09f1caa45fea632f8364279a3cb.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Radiators by the way had to bend because they did not fit into the body of the new format.  It is better to heat them with a soldering station before bending, otherwise there is a chance to break off half of the teeth.  Thermistor regulator secured on the throttle group stabilization because  This is the hottest part. <br><br>  In this form, the PSU underwent long-term tests, powering a bunch of automotive high-beam bulbs and withstanding loads of current of about 20A at a voltage of 14V.  He also proudly charged several car batteries when we turned off the lights in the Crimea. <br><br>  <b>The future is near</b> <br>  In the meantime, I conceived a bit of a nonstandard system of indication of operating modes of the PSU, which I later regretted a little, but it still works! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/446/ec2/78d/446ec278df62435f97beabe83abc62bd.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  So in the next article, you will find ATMega8 programming in C ++ using template magic, various patterns and a self-writing library for fixed-point calculations on top of which ADC averaging is implemented and converted to voltage / current using a table with linear interpolation.  By some miracle, all of this fit into 5 with a penny a kilobyte of flash. <br><br>  Do not switch the channel should be interesting. <br><br>  By the way, the book promised at the beginning: <br>  Kulichkov A.V.  "Switching Power Supply for IBM PC" <br>  <a href="">radioportal-pro.ru/_ld/0/15_caf3ebe8f7eaeee.djvu</a> <br><br>  PS I hope the above will be useful.  Do not judge strictly, but constructive criticism is welcome. <br><br>  <b>Added for RO users who can not write comments:</b> email: altersoft_poss_mail.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257427/</a></p>
