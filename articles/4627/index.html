  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online gambling industry in shock from USA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The law against online gambling was <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/307/">passed by the US House of Representatives in July 2006</a> .  The new bill prohibits banks as well as credit card issuers from making payments in favor of gambling websites.  The government also reserves the right to put pressure on Internet providers to block the traffic of such sites.  The only outlet for gambling Americans are horse racing and lotteries, to which the ban does not apply. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In early October 2006, the law was nevertheless approved by the US Senate, although the game lobby was hoping to slow down the adoption of the law until the November elections, and then it would be postponed until next year.  But the US Republican Party nevertheless managed to bring the matter to the end and, thus, lay a brick on the foundation of its election program, built around the protection of American moral values.  On October 13, 2006, President Bush signed the Internet Gambling Enforcement Act.  This Friday of the 13th was the most unlucky day in its entire history of the online gambling market. <br><br>  The ban on online gaming in the United States delivered a powerful blow to the global gambling industry.  Half of its annual turnover of $ 12 billion is still provided by the American players.  The world's largest bookmakers, online casinos and poker sites <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/business/01gamble.html">count losses</a> . <br><br>  Large corporations whose shares are listed on the stock exchange have already lost billions of dollars in market capitalization.  Only on the London Stock Exchange, the cumulative decrease in capitalization for them was $ 7.6 billion. Corporations are trying to find a way out of the crisis to unite with each other.  American firms, quite naturally, are buying back their European competitors in order to escape to the European market.

      In the meantime, small gambling firms that have declared their readiness to circumvent the prohibitions of US law and, in spite of everything, remain in the US market, remain in the black.  For example, the poker site <a href="http://www.pokerstars.com/">PokerStars.com is</a> not going to curtail its activities in the United States and says that the ban will not affect online poker. <br><br>  Great Britain is also in the black, which in its time became the first large western country to completely legalize the bookmaker business.  Now the world's largest bookmakers are based here, such as <a href="http://www.ladbrokes.com/">Ladbrokes</a> and <a href="http://www.willhill.com/">William Hill</a> , and the budget receives hundreds of millions of pounds of tax deductions from them.  American firms that are banned in their home countries are now moving to the UK. <br><br>  By the way, the British parliamentarians very critically perceived the actions of their American colleagues and even organized a special meeting inviting representatives of thirty countries to find a solution to this conflict.  The American side, despite the invitation, never sent its representatives to the meeting. <br><br>  Perhaps the Russian online gambling giants will soon have to move to the UK too.  As you know, recently the State Duma introduced a draft law ‚ÄúOn state regulation of the organization and conduct of gambling‚Äù, which provides for a <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1026/">total ban on gambling on the Russian Internet</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4627/</a></p>
