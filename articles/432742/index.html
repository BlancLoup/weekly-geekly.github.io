  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate time trouble</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The atmosphere at the training after dinner always resembled a beach seal.  In ordinary life, when everyone regulated the amount of food eaten, such gluttony did not happen.  And here, when both the first and second, and compote will be served to you ... And there is no point in refusing - everything is paid for. <br><br>  People settled on chairs and couches along the walls, someone was nodding, someone was picking on the phone, some were having a lazy conversation, even smokers were here - too lazy to be dragged outside.  There was still about fifteen minutes left before the end of dinner. <br><br>  Suddenly, the door opened abruptly, and entered ‚Äî or rather, ran in ‚Äî an excited, slightly pale owner.  It is impossible to say that there was no face on it - it was present, but the sight of him immediately drove off the afternoon nap from those present.

      - Colleagues, trouble!  - out of breath, blurted out the owner.  - Urgent all in the hall! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Nobody argued - they silently moved to the chairs.  Following Kurchatov, Olga entered the hall, conducting the first half of the training.  Realizing that now it is not up to her, she went into a corner, on one of the cozy sofas, sat down and began to observe what was happening with interest. <br><br>  - I just called Appolinaria Gerhardovich.  - began Kurchatov, when everyone sat down on the chairs. <br><br>  - Who?  - quietly asked Sergey Garayev, the new director. <br><br>  - They'll say right now ... - Sergey whispered. <br><br>  - For those who do not know ... - squinting at Garayev, the owner continued.  - This is our man, who occupies a very high position in the procurement unit of our key client.  It is no secret that it was Appppolinaria Gerhardovich that provides ... More precisely, it provided us with 75% of the sales volume.  So, he was fired. <br><br>  Whispers, oohs, ahs swept through the hall, a word was heard from several ends, ending in "dec" ("well done"?).  The owner endured a theatrical pause - or maybe he just decided to finally catch his breath and calm down. <br><br>  - Do we have any other contacts?  - timidly asked Garayev. <br><br>  - Yes, but they do not solve anything.  - the owner replied gloomily.  - Everything was decided by Appolinary. <br><br>  - And for what it? <br><br>  - I don‚Äôt know for sure, but there some unpleasant story happened ... Roughly speaking, he was fired, and not carried out with honors.  Apparently, now they will dig his case, and we have nothing more to do there.  Actually, this is a problem. <br><br>  - What's the problem?  - began Garayev.  - More precisely, I understand what the problem is ... How to explain ... <br><br>  - Yes, say, do not hesitate.  - supported the owner.  - The situation is fire, not to rituals. <br><br>  - As I understand it, the situation is insoluble?  - convulsively swallowing air, said Garayev.  - The loss of 75% of sales is equivalent to the loss of the company.  Need an exit strategy. <br><br>  - Strategy of what?  - Kurchatov asked, his head slightly squinted and squinting. <br><br>  - Exit.  Urgent staff reduction, sale of liquid equipment, remnants of finished products and materials, the elimination of ... <br><br>  - Woah woo woa.  - Kurchatov waved his hands.  - I see, Nikolai, that you are a big specialist in crisis management (here Garayev smiled rather), or rather, on crisis liquidation.  We will always have time to discuss this plan.  Now we are talking about something else - how can you adequately, without loss of personnel and assets, get out of this situation? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, if you want to play these games ...‚Äù Garayev shrugged.  - It seems to me a waste of time. <br><br>  - OK I understood.  - Kurchatov smiled unkindly.  - You will stay, will you take part? <br><br>  - Yes of course.  - nodded Garayev. <br><br>  - Wonderful.  - Kurchatov clapped his hands, as if summing up a little discussion.  - So, friends.  We need strategy and tactics, and moreover, it is extremely urgent, today, now.  I am very glad - if in such a situation one can rejoice at all - that we are all gathered here together, and we will not have to waste time preparing the meeting.  First, we need ideas, plans and activities for the coming days that will allow us to stay afloat.  Shipment to the key client will no longer be, even this month.  We urgently need money, any sources, any sales, any customers - old, new, lost.  Think, search, right now. <br>  Some movement began in the hall.  People took out their phones, notebooks, laptops, demonstrating their readiness to participate in the rescue of a drowning company. <br><br>  - Yes, colleagues.  - continued the owner.  - Tactics, I am sure, we will come up with you.  But we also need a strategy.  Tactics will tell us what to do today, tomorrow and in a week.  The strategy will tell us what to do in a month, a year, and ten.  Well, I hope so. <br><br>  - So we have a strategy.  - Sergei cried.  - I saw, hanging near the toilet, such a beautiful, framed. <br><br>  Marina, who was sitting next to him, prodded Sergei with her elbow to the side. <br><br>  - Sergei.  - the owner sighed.  - I am very glad that you keep your presence of mind and sense of humor in the face of a serious challenge.  And I understand perfectly well that this situation is not at all terrible for you, because in a week you will leave our company.  For payment do not worry, in which case I am ready to repay the debt to you from personal funds.  But now, please make a decision. <br><br>  - What?  - Sergey asked puzzled. <br><br>  - You either participate or not.  - Kurchatov said seriously.  - If you participate, then come without a banter, but really help.  If you don't participate, then go home. <br><br>  - I participate.  - without hesitation, Sergey answered, and added in a whisper.  - When will such a cool challenge be ... <br><br>  The work was already in full swing in the hall.  Interest groups gathered, something was vigorously discussed, argued, but, in general, the situation seemed to be working.  The director sat alone, somewhat indifferent to what was happening.  Sergey wrote something quickly in his notebook. <br><br>  - Evgeny Viktorovich, we have an offer.  - In one of the groups Gorbunov, commercial director, rose to his feet.  - We have a fairly large amount of spare parts made for a key customer, we can sell them to other buyers. <br><br>  - There is another CD.  - A terrible voice of the chief designer by the name of Jubrak came from another group.  The voice was formidable, probably because Jubrak was a former boxer, two meters tall and of appropriate build. <br><br>  - So what?  - asked Gorbunov.  - Do not fit? <br><br>  - I told you, the CD is different.  - repeated Jubrak. <br><br>  - Yes, you got with your CD.  - could not resist the commercial director.  - You do not see what, the situation is stalemate?  We need any options to ensure revolving. <br><br>  - Where did I get you?  - Jubrak rose from his seat.  - You got me, trafficker, just to push it, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if some plunger breaks during operation. <br><br>  - Anton.  - the owner turned to Jubrak.  - We understood that the CD is different.  How different? <br><br>  - Yes, not much.  - answered for Anton the chief engineer who was sitting nearby.  - There, the steel grade is different, of increased hardness. <br><br>  - And the size, geometry?  - asked Kurchatov. <br><br>  - One to one. <br><br>  - Other customers can use these parts? <br><br>  - Yes of course.  It is necessary to agree, really ... They have serious design services, just like that ... <br><br>  - And we - not a serious design service, or what?  - asked the nearby Jubrak. <br><br>  - Sit down, Anton.  - pulled his sleeve chief engineer.  - Evgeny Viktorovich, everything is fine, we will coordinate, we will ship.  We can start right now, I'll call them ... <br><br>  - No, not yet, let's first work out all the options.  - Kurchatov shook his head.  - And then we promise, and then we change our mind.  Great idea, thanks. <br><br>  - Yes, there it is necessary to work out all the options.  - continued the chief engineer, turning to the owner. <br><br>  - You, Alexey, do not contact me, but to Vladimir Nikolayevich, the commercial director.  - the owner pointed at Gorbatov.  - And they are accustomed, as children, to solve all questions through the teacher. <br><br>  - This is Svetlana Vladimirovna taught.  - Sergey responded.  - We called it "call mom." <br><br>  - I see.  - smiled the owner.  - Alexey, Vladimir, let's be more friendly, unite your groups, work.  Perhaps we have some other stocks for a key customer that can be shipped to other customers. <br><br>  Alexey got up and moved to the group of sellers.  Jubrak, and the production manager sitting next to him, remained in place. <br><br>  - Friends, and why are you?  - the owner has addressed to them. <br><br>  - Our business is small.  - smiled Pankratov, production manager.  - They will do what they say. <br><br>  - And in general.  - Jubrak nodded his head. <br><br>  - What is it?  - The owner asked. <br><br>  - This is not our business, that's what.  When we speak, we are not listened to.  And now let them decide. <br><br>  - Anton, now is not the time for whims and old offenses.  I understand that salespeople and techies are always hostile, but you see the situation.  Maybe in a few weeks we will all be without work. <br><br>  - I will not stay.  - Jubrak shrugged.  - Now a good designer snapped up. <br><br>  - Well, at least you can participate?  Suddenly some useful idea will tell?  Yes, and your technical expertise will not be superfluous. <br><br>  - Of course, you are sorry, Evgeny Viktorovich.  - began Jubrak.  - I personally have no complaints against you, but I will not go on reconnaissance with these guys. <br><br>  It was said so that there was no doubt - once upon a time, most likely, this guy had to be in real intelligence. <br><br>  - Damn, Anton, are you a man or who?  - Marina, director of quality, entered. <br><br>  - And you do not take me to the man.  - smiled Jubrak.  - I have a talker before you, how much of my blood you drank, with your processes. <br><br>  - So, stop, colleagues.  - the owner has stopped the discussion.  - This is a voluntary matter.  If Anton does not want to participate, then this is his choice.  Similarly, like Sergei, I suggest you just go home. <br><br>  Jubrak was silent.  Sergey, who had been furiously scribbling something in his notebook, looked up and, like most of those present, stared at the chief designer.  He well knew this guy - he was best described by the phrase from Vysotsky‚Äôs song ‚Äúit was gloomy and angry, but it went.‚Äù  Yes, he liked to argue, he often used strong words, even started and developed open confrontations, but in order to fall down ... Hardly. <br><br>  - I will stay.  - finally said Jubrak.  - But to the nouveau riche not sit down. <br><br>  - Good.  - the owner exhaled with relief.  - Sergey, what are you doing? <br><br>  - Strategy, what else.  I do not know how to sell. <br><br>  - And what happens?  Are you doing IT strategy? <br><br>  - Oh, well, you do not know him, or what.  - Marina grinned.  - The strategy of saving the world, no less.  Or how did you tell?  In Klingon? <br><br>  - Marina, please.  - almost prayed Kurchatov.  - Do not distract, neither Sergey, nor me, nor yourself.  Do something. <br><br>  - I'm busy.  - Marina answered offended.  - I remember that we were taught in a crisis management course when I was studying for an MBA. <br><br>  - Well, how many remembered?  - the owner squinted. <br><br>  - Not yet, I would go for the materials home ... I remember that we must act quickly. <br><br>  - Thanks, Cap!  - Sergey smiled.  - As we said in the village, we must hurry in two cases: when diarrhea and when you catch lice. <br><br>  - Oh, well, it starts.  - Marina smiled in response.  ‚ÄúI missed your incredibly seductive humor.‚Äù <br><br>  - Sergey, what's the strategy?  - impatiently interrupted Kurchatov.  - What do you write in a notebook? <br><br>  - Activity. <br><br>  - Why in a notebook? <br><br>  - And where should I go? <br><br>  - Aloud, voice, discuss ... <br><br>  - So time trouble is ... <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - Well, not enough time.  To discuss it will take an hour, the proposal will go away, everyone will be clever, they will hang their snot on the fence, and it will not be clear without a strategy ... <br><br>  - I do not understand ... - frowned proprietor.  - How is this strategy without strategy not going to be clear? <br><br>  - Eck, you are looping ... So in the dump not long to fall. <br><br>  - Sergey, I asked ... <br><br>  - Yes, I beg your pardon ... - Sergey was embarrassed.  - I wanted to emphasize the difference between strategy and action plan.  In notebook - the plan. <br><br>  - Where is the strategy?  - asked Kurchatov. <br><br>  - In my head.  But it is short, I can write. <br><br>  - That is, I don‚Äôt understand all the same ... What do you propose to do? <br><br>  - Yes, it is, in general, it does not matter what to do.  More precisely, my specific offers are worthless, I‚Äôm not a seller, and not a manufacturer. <br><br>  - Seriously?  - Marina smiled.  - And to listen to you, so you and this ... And at the game a fighter, in short. <br><br>  - The main thing is not what to do, but how.  - not paying attention to the attack of Marina, Sergey continued.  - Or how ... Right now, I will formulate ... The strategy answers the question "how", these are like principles, perhaps ... The formula of our movement, and the achievement of our goal.  And then concrete actions are strung on these principles.  Something like that. <br><br>  - Let us suppose.  - nodded Kurchatov.  - In management theory, a more precise definition is given, but now is not the time to argue.  What is the strategy? <br><br>  - write to you?  Or say? <br><br>  - Write.  On the desk. <br><br>  - OK. <br><br>  Sergey got up, put the notebook on a chair, and walked over to the board.  Seeing the movement, the people in the groups stopped the discussion and stared at the action.  Moreover, when Sergei performed, there was always something to see - like in a circus. <br><br>  - Well, I have two definitions.  - Sergey lingered at the board.  - One decent, the other - not very, but more intelligible, in my opinion. <br><br>  - Give both.  - the owner nodded with interest. <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey answered and began to scratch on the board with a marker. <br><br>  First, he held a vertical line in the middle of the board, dividing it in half.  On the left side, after thinking for a few seconds, he wrote: ‚Äúpull your head out of your ass.‚Äù  Chuckles swept through the hall.  Turning to the second half, Sergey became thoughtful. <br><br>  - Cheat sheet forgot?  - Marina shouted from her seat. <br><br>  - Shh!  - the owner said seriously. <br><br>  - No, I'm not kidding, can I give a notebook? <br><br>  - Do not.  - Sergey dismissed.  - I pick up the words. <br><br>  - So you already picked up about the head out of your ass.  Short and succinctly.  True, we have objections here ... <br><br>  - Marina!  - shouted Kurchatov. <br><br>  The hall fell silent, staring at Sergei.  He thought for a couple more minutes, whispering something under his breath, and finally wrote: ‚Äúnot to interfere‚Äù. <br><br>  Sergey put a marker, moved a little to one side, admiring his scribbles.  People in the hall were waiting for further developments. <br><br>  - I'm afraid I have to explain.  The owner frowned. <br><br>  - Easy.  - Sergey smiled and turned to the hall.  - There is nothing new.  Who remembers the procurement project that I did a couple of years ago? <br><br>  - Well, I remember.  - answered Kurchatov. <br><br>  - He, however, was later saved, replacing it with a kind of new-fashioned category purchase, but not the essence ... In short, friends, since such a situation has arisen, you have to pull your head out of your ass and stop interfering. <br><br>  - To interfere?  - the owner began to lose his temper. <br><br>  - To disturb the money.  - Sergey was not at all embarrassed.  - Prevent the flow of money to move through our company. <br><br>  - And who's stopping him? <br><br>  - All present, anyway. <br><br>  - There are examples? <br><br>  - Yes, right now.  - Sergey ran to his chair, picked up a notebook, went back to the board. <br><br>  - Here, for example, Argentina.  Argentina beckons Negro, a palindrome, not heard? <br><br>  ‚ÄúSergey ...‚Äù the owner said sternly. <br><br>  - Yes ... If you remember, Gena traveled to Argentina six months ago, and brought back from there a frantic need for our equipment and spare parts.  They recently found oil there. <br><br>  - Is there oil in Argentina?  - asked bored Garayev. <br><br>  - Yes, in huge quantities.  - confirmed Sergey.  - So ... Gena, how much will our piece of iron be there? <br><br>  A well-built fellow with a beautiful suit and a sour face on his face rose from his seat. <br><br>  - There the price in dollars, if recalculated for rubles, the profitability is twice as high.  This is taking into account the transport.  I have all the calculations ... <br><br>  - Wait a minute.  - Sergey stopped him.  - And the prices of competitors? <br><br>  - Twice as high as our price in dollars. <br><br>  - We all remember this, Gennady.  - interrupted Kurchatov.  - This is a very important direction, especially in the framework of diversification, and it should be very quickly and carefully worked through. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNoticing anything?‚Äù  - slyly squinting, asked Sergey. <br><br>  - No, why?  - asked Kurchatov. <br><br>  - Well, you say - you need to work very quickly and carefully.  You said it six months ago.  Half a year.  Very fast.  Half a year.  Very fast. <br><br>  - So after all, and carefully.  - Marina shouted from her seat.  ‚ÄúQuality is more important than speed.‚Äù <br><br>  - Come on.  - Sergey smiled.  - People are sitting somewhere in Argenitin, they want to buy our piece of iron.  Take, they say, we will pay you.  Well, there are risks, not to send the car right away, but at least ten could be sent?  In extreme cases, one. <br><br>  - And what, still have not sent?  - asked Kurchatov a little stunned. <br><br>  - Yes, I zadolbalsya already ... - Gena began. <br><br>  - Wait a minute.  - Sergey stopped him again.  - Now we are looking at the left side of the board and doing what is written there. <br><br>  All together looked at the inscription about pulling the head out of the ass.  Someone smiled, someone frowned, someone clicked his tongue. <br><br>  - Here they are money.  Here it is the flow of money that could begin.  Here it is, the real diversification.  Gene will not lie - oil is everywhere.  Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, something else ... And what are we doing with this stream of money?  We don‚Äôt even give birth to him. <br><br>  - Wait, Sergey.  - Kurchatov raised his hand.  - What exactly is happening with this question, about Argentina? <br><br>  - That's what's happening.  As it should be, we made our standard contract.  Gena, being a master of all sorts of languages, personally translated it into English and sent it to the Argentines.  Those, of course, something in it corrected.  Gene in legal matters is not a whale, and went on the beaten path.  Which one? <br><br>  - Which one?  - turning to the hall, asked Kurchatov. <br><br>  - Agreement process.  - It came at once from several places. <br><br>  - Agreement process.  - Sergey nodded.  - And our lawyers, alas, are not international experts, so what? <br><br>  - What?  - continued to play along with the owner. <br><br>  - Sent to a certain office, outsourcing lawyers. <br><br>  - Well, a normal move.  - nodded Kurchatov. <br><br>  - Of course normal.  Gene, agreed to the contract? <br><br>  - No, not even started.  - filtered Gena. <br><br>  - Why?  - could not stand Kurchatov. <br><br>  - Because outsourcers have requested prepayment.  - answered for Gena Sergey. <br><br>  - Well, so what, this is a normal practice. <br><br>  - This is normal for you.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here, if the terms of payment differ from the standard ones, what is started? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Agreement process. - again responded from the audience. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Moreover, it is not only about agreeing payment terms. It is necessary, after all, to conclude an agreement with these international affairs specialists. And the gimp went ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, I understood. - Kurchatov sighed. - Gennady, if we quickly make all the papers, how soon will you arrange the shipment? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Within a week, ten pieces of equipment, and a container of spare parts, to form a consignment. They need spare parts, they are poorly able to use the equipment, so they often break it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well! - Kurchatov clapped his hands. - I will personally give instructions to lawyers and financiers. Sergey, thank you for paying attention to this question! Do you have everything?</font></font><br><br>  - Not. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How ... Oh, well. Come on, what else? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do you understand the principle? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Which one? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Damn, what are we talking about here, Evgeny Viktorovich? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- About Argentina and bureaucracy. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, we are talking about the strategy, pulling the head out of the ass and the flow of money. Argentina is just one example, very simple. There are more interesting cases. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- For example? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- For example, our unhappy customers. Those that are not key. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhat's wrong with them?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Have you ever repaired a car? This is not an idle question, because you are not a poor person, and you probably don‚Äôt do such nonsense. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I imagine the process of repairing the machine, Sergey. - smiled Kurchatov.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, we have the same thing. More than half of our sales are equipment parts, right?</font></font><br><br>  - So. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Approximately the same story from auto centers, only there still services make up a significant proportion. So, when your car broke down and you need, for example, a boot, what are you doing? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Going to the car wash. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what do they tell you? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What do they say? I, Sergey, really have not been there for a long time. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- They say - damn it, you must wait two weeks from Europe. Anther! Which costs 400 rubles! I'm not lying, he personally recently changed me! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what, waited two weeks? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, of course, bought an analog. And our clients do that. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, they have two ways - either to buy from competitors, or on the black market. You know how it is developed in this sector. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes I know. - nodded Kurchatov. - And why? Do we have to wait two weeks too?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Guys, how long do we have to wait? - Sergey turned to the hall. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The room whispered, but no one dared to answer the question. Kurchatov looked from one to the other, but, without waiting for an answer, he looked again at Sergei. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Pancake. - Sergey blurted out, shook his head contritely, then turned to the commercial director. - Vladimir Nikolayevich, why are you silent? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I do not own the information. - he got up from his seat. ‚ÄúI think delivery times are much shorter.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHe thinks ...‚Äù said Sergey angrily, and began leafing through his notebook. - So, here ... I know these numbers well, because I stare at them every day. So, half of the orders are shipped in two months. Another quarter - a month. The rest, on the little things - who after a week, who after six months.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- This is not true, Evgeny Viktorovich. Shouted Gorbunov. ‚ÄúI know the numbers well, and this is ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äù ‚ÄúYou just said that you do not have the information.‚Äù - smiled Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But I see frank lies from afar! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Blin, Vladimir Nikolaevich. - blurted out Sergey. - You need to see from a distance, and look under your nose. I showed someone a report a week ago? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is the report? - frowned Gorbunov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Such a report. - Sergey mocked. - Which "Iceberg" is called. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How how? - asked Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, it does not matter ... This is the method of this, calculating the duration of negative states ... In short, in this particular case, it shows how long the orders are shipped.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But managers regularly report to me, and there are completely different numbers! - Do not let up Gorbunov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Vladimir Nikolaevich, re-read on the board on the left. - Sergey pointed at his strategic masterpiece. - You told them that the orders should not be shipped for a long time, so they adapted themselves. As soon as the shipment is delayed, they close the order, create a new one, transfer the balance, and they show you. Respawn orders. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How did you find out about it? - asked Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So they are it, not strongly brainy. - Sergey smiled. - There is a field there - the document number according to the customer. It comes out then in pieces of paper - overhead, etc. Managers cannot remove or change it - they will not accept the goods. Therefore, creating a new order, they leave this number. Well, I compared.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hunchback stood silently, and gradually began to blush. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kurchatov looked at him first, then, realizing that there would be no intelligible answer, he returned to Sergei again. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Understand what is happening?</font></font> - Sergey asked.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- A client comes with money, says - well, guys, take my money, give me iron. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we tell him - uh, wait, man. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We don't need your money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Come in after a month or two. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe we deign to take your money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exactly the same as with Argentina. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Clear. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Kurchatov answered evenly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Reason only in the sales department?</font></font><br><br>  - What?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sergey raised his eyebrows. - Sellers have nothing to do with it! Well, except that they conceal the seriousness of the problem from you. They would be happy to ship on the same day, but after all, they need to produce the pieces of iron, or they must be purchased - those we are doing on the side. And here we are building obstacles in the way of money ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Come on, tell me. - Kurchatov sighed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And what to tell ... Vasya! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vasily Lunin, purchasing director, got up from his seat - a cheerful guy, about forty years old, although he looked younger. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Come on, tell me, and where am I at all. - Vasya smiled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You're a great guy, just pull your head out of your ass. - Sergey smiled in response. - He poured me the whole purchase of TOS, now we are clearing up.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Categorical purchase is much ... - Vasya began to rant, but Kurchatov with a gesture cut him off. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What about purchases, Sergey? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Jubrak, you have the floor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The chief designer rose from his seat and stared at Sergei in bewilderment. The pantomime lasted a few minutes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What do you need? - finally asked the chief designer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, the help of the hall is required. - Sergey smiled. - When we want to order the production of a piece of iron on the side, what is required to initiate? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Agreement process. - almost in unison answered in the hall. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, what's wrong? - asked Kurchatov. - When a new supplier, coordination is needed. Counterparty evaluation, contractual work, and so on.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And when the supplier is old, long known, and this detail has been sharpening us for five years, what is required for ordering it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Agreement process. - the hall answered cheerfully. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Coordination of what? - the owner asked puzzled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Jubrak, what coordination is required? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, there you are. - Anton's face brightened. - This is, Evgeny Viktorovich, every time there is a need to sign a drawing. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I do not understand ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, I did not understand. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Evgeny Viktorovich. - Marina suddenly rose from her seat. ‚ÄúWe made changes to the procurement process a few months ago.‚Äù Now for each specification, that is, for each batch of purchases, approval of the drawing is required.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why? - exclaimed Kurchatov. - These drawings were developed a few years ago, there are no changes there for a long time, everything is settled and works! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I will answer if you will. - Sergey entered. - Once, one eccentric with the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù could not provide the necessary roughness in his production, and without further ado, he smeared our parameters with a stroke on the drawing and drew his own. That inflated precedent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What kind of supplier? The owner frowned. - We work with him? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Of course not! - blurted out Marina. - We worked with him for the first time, and after the investigation broke up the relationship. But in the process of change made. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Fuck? - shouted Kurchatov. - Are you out of your mind? I understand, of course, a precedent, but not to the same extent! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So you signed these changes. - Marina said quietly.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, you never know! .. - began Kurchatov and stopped. A few seconds thought, and continued. - I can not get a grasp of each letter of the documents that I sign! You are not children, you must understand! I'm not plywood to cover my ass! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOkay, let's cancel ...‚Äù Marina said even more quietly and sat down. Zhubrak landed next. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What else, Sergey? - Kurchatov asked, massaging his forehead with his fingers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Many things. So, Vasya, do you think DECO will ship us a hundred sleeves for tomorrow? - Sergey addressed the procurement director. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, it is excluded. - Vasya shook his head. - The production cycle of such a batch of sleeves is a month, and this is subject to the availability of materials and timely inclusion in the plan. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Call them. - suddenly blurted out Sergey. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of?</font></font> To whom? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, who is the sales manager, who do you work with? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Lech. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, dial Lyokha on the speakerphone, ask about one hundred bushes tomorrow. And we sit quietly and listen. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sergei. - entered Kurchatov. - Let's not make a clowning, there wasn‚Äôt enough to ruin a relationship with a key supplier. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I insist. - Sergey answered firmly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kurchatov stared at him for a few seconds, thinking hard at something. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Come on. - he said, finally. - I will call myself, but not Lech, but the director. Good for you? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, it's even better. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Good. Please silence. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kurchatov took out his phone, rummaged through contacts, found the number he needed, dialed, turned on the speakerphone. There were several long beeps.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hi Zhenya! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- There was a voice from the phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I have not heard you for a long time! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Like myself, like a spouse? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sing, I'm sorry, I'm on the case, and besides - on the speakerphone. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, sorry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Come on, what have you got? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We have a small crisis situation here, and you can help out great. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It sounds strange, do not be offended if you send to hell. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Could you ship us a hundred sleeves tomorrow?</font></font><br><br>  - Yes of course.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you take it yourself? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes ... Stop, wait.</font></font> Is it possible <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, if it is a hundred. Maximum - one hundred and ten. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But as? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is it like? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How do you manage to make a hundred sleeves per day? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- They are ready, they are in stock. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Our sleeves? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, while ours. - the voice in the phone laughed. - When you pay, your will. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of our drawings? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, and for whom else? You also have unique sleeves, no one else needs these in our region. Under you did. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- when? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, we constantly do, and we keep the stock. Just a hundred. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Listen, sing, you surprise me ... How long have you been keeping sleeves under us? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes, a year or two, I do not remember exactly. And not only bushings - and axles, and dies, something else like ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And why?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Zhen, well, you surprise me ... Because you are our key client. I told you that half of the sales come from you. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I know that. Why hold the sleeve? Whose idea? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In general, like, programmers, I do not remember exactly. They came to me with a proposal, I agreed, tried, it seemed to have gone fine, and left. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Programmers? Yours? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And mine, and yours. Your boyfriend even came to us. I forgot what my name is ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sergey? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes exactly! A lively such, market, cheerful. Here he is with our programmers and all muddied. And I just glad. Bounce is no longer necessary for your ragged demand. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, yes, I understand, sing.</font></font> Thank! <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You would come to visit - I feel we need to talk about many things. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Required! Tomorrow! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- All right, come on, not distract. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Thank you, Peter! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kurchatov hung up and was silent. Vasya, still standing on his feet, slowly sat down. Sergey smiled contentedly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, tell me. - finally said Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, nothing special to tell. - Sergey shrugged his shoulders. - When our TOC purchases took off, we installed an insurance margin for the sleeves, just one hundred pieces. Shipped to customers on the same day. I was so happy that I went to the conference to talk about the experience. There I met these guys by chance, with DECO, programmers. They decided that I would visit them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well. - nodded the owner.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, I drove. Potryndeli, explained everything to them, they say - damn, cool, we also want. I left, they went to the authorities. Then they write - everything has been previously agreed, come again. I - to them. Let's say integration is muddied. We have an insurance reserve, and at any moment there is an understanding of how much is missing. Well, if there are 30 pieces in the free balance, then 70 more is needed. This information has become almost online for them to enter the system. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- and? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And that's it. They twirled their production plan, tweaked it under the safety stock, and began to replenish it. How much we miss, they do so much. Immediately, on the same day, as the buffer fell in our place, for example, if a client made an order. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So wait. - raised his palms Kurchatov. - We have an insurance reserve - a hundred, they also have a hundred. Total - two?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, there are always a hundred in total. It‚Äôs just that, as I said, we lost this system, and now our safety stock is zero. And they have a hundred. All the buffer moved to them. We have been living for several months and are shipping the sleeves on time at the expense of DECO. And his programmers. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It turns out, the consignment? - asked after a few seconds of deliberation Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well yes. And this is what we need now, in a crisis. Consignment at DECO warehouse, consignment in the area where the main customers are concentrated in the North, consignment in Argentina, or in Latin America in general. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Of course, I'm sorry. - suddenly Vasya got up from his seat. ‚ÄúBut why do programmers decide where we have some consignment?‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Because you, Vasya, eccentric. - Kurchatov said harshly. - And remember once and for all: I do not care what position a person holds. If he has a head on his shoulders, and he comes from the interests of the company, and not from his selfish and career, then I will listen to him. If the programmer comes up with how to improve the supply, and it will work, I will support him with all the resources available. It's clear?</font></font><br><br>  - Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Vasya answered offendedly and proudly, with a straight back, sat down on a chair. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Evgeny Viktorovich. - Sergey began hesitantly. - In general, the procurement system has disappeared with your tacit consent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You did not surprise me, Sergey. - unexpectedly agreed Kurchatov. ‚ÄúI know you wrote me about it several times.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Including, about integration, and about DECO, and about programmers, and about safety stock. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, I remember. - nodded Kurchatov. - And do not relieve myself of guilt. I, like you, love to experiment. Vasily proposed another system - categorical procurement. Both he and I heard about this system on the MBA, from the same speaker. He was very persuasive. I tried, did not work. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yeah I do not mind. - Sergey was embarrassed. - But now, in terms of time trouble, not up to experiments, agree?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes of course. Tomorrow we are returning your system to action. How long does it take? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Five minutes. - Sergey shrugged his shoulders. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So you did not delete it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who is this good will delete ... Just next to put another. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well! - smiled Kurchatov. - Do you have everything?</font></font><br><br>  - Not. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- How ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So I say, this is a strategy. If you understand the principle, then to come up with events and changes - it's a simple matter. Especially since we have, excuse me, there is so much shit in the processes that has accumulated, which prevents money from customers from getting faster, that at least you can rake out a bulldozer. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Explain ... About ... Well, about the interference in the processes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Abstractly? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes, we already understood the examples. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The client came with money and need. This is the entry point. Closed needs, received money - this is the exit point. Between the points of entry and exit - the length of the path of money in our company. The shorter it is, the better.</font></font> Do you agree? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Suppose yes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Those who are closer to trade, understand the term "turnover". One thing is to wrap money in a month. Another thing - to wrap money five times a month. Because the company, any, lives with this turnover, right? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes, this is the alphabet. With each turnover we have a profit. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, plus - the higher the turnover, the lower the share of fixed costs. Like the rent of premises, the salary part of salaries, some taxes and so on. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It's all clear. - left Kurchatov. - Come on next. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Turnover is a bad word because it is passive. One gets the impression that she lives her life, according to her own laws, and nothing can be done with it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I do not agree. - Kurchatov shook his head. - Turnover is growing, if sellers move well, look for customers, enter new markets, and so on. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, this is the second mistake. - Sergey smiled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? - frowned Kurchatov. - I'm wrong, or what? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúIt's not that they are wrong ...‚Äù Sergey was a little confused. ‚ÄúBut your words are so beaten up that much of the truth is hidden behind them.‚Äù It seems to everyone that turnover is the business of sellers.</font></font> So? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, not really, it's not only business ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, you yourself just said that it depends on sellers. Sellers, tell me how much in our shipping depends on you? - Sergey turned to the hall. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No one was in a hurry to answer. Kurchatov was clearly impatient to continue the dialogue, so he did not wait. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, I understood, Sergey. You just gave a few examples of how internal processes interfere with sales. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Right. - Sergey nodded. - We have excellent sellers. At least, it seems so now, while all the other guys are disturbing them as much as they can. That's why I wrote in the strategy ‚Äúnot to interfere‚Äù. This is not forever, and at the time of the crisis period. It is necessary to remove the maximum of unnecessary, ungrounded obstacles from the path of money.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, now I sort of understand. The point is to reduce this segment, from need to payment? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, quite right. This distance, more precisely - time, should be reduced to a minimum. As in a supermarket, a client came, chose, immediately bought. Our business is similar, at least in the context of spare parts for our equipment. Ideally, this time to receive money can be reduced to zero, or even made negative. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What is it like? The owner frowned. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, as DECO does, just a little more forward progress. To keep the safety stock not with DECO, not with us, but with the client. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, they need spare parts for repairs? And repair is a spontaneous thing. Broken - it is urgent to repair. They also need to extract oil, downtime is extremely destructive. Here and offer them to create a consignment in their warehouse. We determine the list of positions, it will be stable by 80%. They are working, we are replenishing their warehouse, quietly, silently, without too much running around and bouncing around. A piece of iron broke from them - they went and took it from their warehouse. And we get the money - and, before they learn about their needs. So it turns out negative time - money before needs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Vladimir Nikolaevich, what do you think? - turned Kurchatov to the commercial director.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The idea is interesting. - rose from the chair Gorbunov. - I was already offered similar mechanics, they even asked. They have exactly the problem that Sergei described. When the equipment broke down, and there are nowhere to take spare parts, they begin to run, call, search. We have two weeks delivery, or a month ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Or two. - smiled Kurchatov. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, yes, or two. The competition is not less. Take as a result on the black market, for cash. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Will you work the question?</font></font><br><br>  - Yes of course. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Excellent thank you! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kurchatov was silent, thoughtfully looking at one point. Then he began to stroll along the board. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou know ...‚Äù he stopped and turned to the hall. - I like this strategy. Both her options. I take it as the main one. Now this is our company's strategy. Marina, arrange everything as it should be, and convey to all employees. Sergey, what else is needed? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Need to talk to people. - Sergey answered. - The managers have a lot of information about what is stopping the money, and its employees have even more. Only they have no one to talk to. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Got it, be sure to talk! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Better me. - Sergey said quietly. - Excuse me ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why? But, well, okay, you better know ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúNot better, but you have spoken to the staff many times already.‚Äù Anyway, you are from another world. And I - my own board. If you do not mind, of course. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, no, no problem. Start tomorrow, right in the morning. All other duties I remove from you. - Kurchatov was silent again, after a few seconds he asked suddenly. - Are there really a lot of problems? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Rest assured. - Sergey nodded. ‚ÄúI used up several pages in half an hour, from RAM. Let's listen to the production manager here ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Evgeny Viktorovich! - suddenly Olga's voice came from the corner. - It's time! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, yes. - confused for a couple of seconds Kurchatov. Then he shook himself, smiled broadly, and spoke almost tenderly. - Guys, I want to ask you for forgiveness. With Appolinarium Gerhardovich everything is fine, no one dismissed him.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In terms of? - Marina stretched. - This is a joke, or something, was it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Not a practical joke, but a new training format! - Olga, who approached Kurchatov, smiled. - You climbed over the wall in the morning, managed it, but then one of your colleagues ... But what is there to breed shuras-muras, Sergey clearly showed me that the sense of such training was exactly zero. And I decided to change the format, bring it closer to reality. Yevgeny Viktorovich agreed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, colleagues. - continued the owner. - I apologize again, I doubted for a long time, but decided to take a chance. And now, looking at the results, I'm not at all sorry! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And Sergei, it turns out, was in the know? - Marina asked. - And prepared in advance? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, Sergey did not know. - Kurchatov shook his head. - And I, frankly, very happy about it. I now have a lot to talk about with him.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, you still have a week. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Marina smiled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And about that too. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Kurchatov smiled in response.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432742/</a></p>
