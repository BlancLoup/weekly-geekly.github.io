  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hana kitten. Why do employees hate CRM?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In comments to a recent article, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ncix/" class="user_link">ncix</a> raised the issue of sabotage of CRM by employees and noted that he would be happy to read about it.  In the first minutes we were even confused - didn‚Äôt we write about it?  They wrote, but somehow scraps and by the way.  And the problem is really important.  We collected the experience we had, analyzed and decided to cover the issue with utmost fairness and not very long.  Yes, employees sometimes hate CRM, sabotage the implementation, ignore the use - in general, arrange a mini-revolution.  Which takes away business nerves, money and takes away forces.  To deal with this phenomenon is difficult, but possible.  About some ways - under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/350082/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1c/7ae/6c4/b1c7ae6c44354b208023267481989899.png"></a> <br>  <font color="#999999"><i>What else, your mother, CRM?</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>Well, now, therefore, went, Kalabukhovsky house was gone!</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What do the staff gossip about </h2><br>  It is necessary to pass the first rumor that a CRM system will be introduced soon, the company's employees are in panic.  And the more information is hidden, the higher the decision is made about both implementation and configuration, the more unpleasant emotions are manifested in the team.  Well, it seems like this - they will put a program on a PC in which it will be even more convenient than in Excel and old shared folders.  Nevertheless, fear has large eyes, and this very fear takes on very bizarre but logical forms.  We spent several thousand <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">regionSoft CRM</a> implementations and could not help but gain the most selective experience, including the reasons for the boycott.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h3>  What are workers afraid of? </h3><br>  <b>If there is more work</b> , you need not only to spend time on training, but also to enter data, fill in a bunch of fields and forms, prepare reports, monitor the correct operation of the new system, and do not forget to use it regularly.

      <b>Each step will be controlled</b> - now the manager can collect a report on all actions of the manager with a single button in the CRM system, look at the logs, at what time and what actions he performed, on which days he did not even launch the program, etc. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúAnd if I can't cope with the training?‚Äù</b> - by the way, a fairly common reason.  Even among managers born in 1970-1990, there are many guys who use the Internet and PC to ‚Äúyou‚Äù - simply because they did not have to interact with computers at school and university, and at home it is used for social networks, YouTube and simple games.  It is not so much the wine of a generation as it is a wine of non-technical education.  Sometimes it is really difficult for employees to understand how the system is organized, to realize what a client is and what a server is, where the storage is located.  For them, it's just a screen with a bunch of fields and buttons. <br><br>  <b>The work will see other employees</b> , they will hunt for each other's mistakes.  CRM-system, designed to implement in-company automation, its goal is precisely the exchange of data between departments in order to work more efficiently and productively.  Accordingly, part of the data will be available to subdivision groups, and this, in theory, can create civil strife (the struggle between salespeople and marketers is particularly active). <br><br>  <b>There will be staff reductions.</b>  This is a very common phobia, which has a basis in the form of precedents.  Moreover, some vendors build their marketing precisely on this thesis.  We will say one thing: to reduce the cost of trained employees to yourself, a competent manager will simply redistribute the vacated time for other tasks and allow companies and people to earn more. <br><br>  <b>Psychological resistance to new.</b>  This is a normal reaction of the human psyche: we tend to consider all changes, the nature and the result of which is not entirely clear to us, as a potential threat.  The team will certainly build the most bizarre hypotheses about their fate after implementation.  The lack of information ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù will only aggravate the situation. <br><br>  All the listed motives lead to the only right decision from the point of view of a frightened team - to sabotage.  By the way, various motives can be transferred from the employee to the employee with the speed of the flu virus, everyone begins to believe in the arguments of a neighbor and convinces him of his own. <br><br><h3>  How are employees sabotaged? </h3><br><ul><li>  <i>Do not use a CRM system.</i>  Employees simply do not start the system time after time and ignore reports.  As a rule, they motivate their behavior by the fact that the new system is inconvenient and work in it takes too much time. <br></li><li>  <i>They don‚Äôt add part of the data to CRM</i> - but the main part, necessary for work, is kept in their files or in the head.  As a result, the CRM-system completely loses its meaning, because it does not contain relevant and accurate data. <br></li><li>  <i>Make data with your notes and "encryption"</i> .  Thus, the system is filled with meaningless data and absolutely useless reporting. <br></li><li>  <i>Actively protesting against the use of CRM in the company or division</i> .  The protest is expressed in active communication with management, inciting innovators and early followers among the employees (who they are, we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/346694/">wrote here</a> ). <br></li></ul><br>  The task of the leadership is to enlist the support of loyal employees and competently, without hysteria, repression and cut bonuses to resolve the situation.  By the way, do not forget about the most powerful front of a temporary opponent - the sales department. <br><br><h2>  Separate front - sales managers </h2><br>  As you can see, the CRM-systems have a whole division of opponents.  Most of them, of course, among sales managers.  They cite, as one man, a report unknown to the world, according to which research has shown that salespeople spend 28-31% of their work time on ‚Äúempty administrative work‚Äù (what accuracy!).  At the same time, history is silent that this very administrative work is included.  Of course, salespeople are cunning, although they really do have a reason to be an opponent of CRM systems.  Let's divide the managers into groups and into groups and define their motives. <br><br><ol><li>  Office sales managers.  This group of employees is afraid of control - since they are not familiar with the technical aspects of the CRM system, for them it represents the ‚Äúeye of the sovereign‚Äù, that is, it is able to control everything from calls to visiting sites on the Internet. <br></li><li>  Sales managers "in the fields" are outraged by the fact that they have to enter customer data in small mobile device interfaces.  They completely refuse to use the remote access or application, citing the refusal as a waste of time and inconvenience. <br></li><li>  ‚ÄúSales Stars‚Äù - leading experts, managers, etc.  Their motives are the most serious for the company: ignoring CRM, they retain their customers.  That is, they work for the company, build connections with the name and money of the company, but they keep the customer base in their phone - this is their serious asset, which they use, for example, to find work from competitors (if they noticed, in some descriptions vacancies there is such a requirement - "accumulated customer base").  And in their situation, CRM really breaks off all the raspberries, since the customer base is recorded in the database and is wholly owned by the company. <br></li></ol><br><h3>  How to deal with this in the sales department? </h3><br>  Obviously, the struggle with the third group will be bloody.  If the employee is not too loyal and has the back ways, you will most likely lose him.  However, there are several ways to negotiate with the "star": <br><br><ul><li>  offer increased bonuses for the implementation of the plan, change the KPI - the employee will understand that you are proposing to share income with him and will be ready to increase this income, will agree to work in CRM;  money for salespeople is a powerful motive; <br></li><li>  offer to lead private clients (there is such a function, for example, in our RegionSoft CRM).  He will receive a pool of clients who will not be available to other managers, but will remain at the base of the company and will be visible to management.  As a rule, working in a company is in many ways more profitable than it is for themselves, and many salespeople understand this. <br></li></ul><br>  With the first two groups, the situation is much easier.  Enough to hold several explanatory meetings: <br><br><ul><li>  explain the main thing that the CRM-system for the line sales person is an assistant.  That it allows you to organize and organize your own work, plan working hours, not to forget about important arrangements and be punctual.  That the correct use of a CRM system leads to an increase in work efficiency, consequently, to a greater number of transactions and an increase in salary; <br></li><li>  show the principles of the CRM-system and demonstrate that it is not able to follow the input from the keyboard and the sites visited (although such anxiety of employees is a reason to review the processes and analyze the workload, but already beyond the scope of CRM); <br></li><li>  clarify that only baseline data can be entered into the mobile application, and all other information added to the office;  However, the situation when the manager ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù desperately needs a full-featured CRM is quite rare; <br></li><li>  demonstrate how much faster the seller‚Äôs communication with the customer is due to CRM - any employee will appreciate a thrifty attitude to his time; <br></li><li>  assure (and execute!) that the implementation of CRM will not lead to staff reductions.  Reducing the number of employees due to automation is a huge management mistake.  A competent leader will always find how to occupy a free labor resource and how to obtain additional revenue from this. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  What should not be done in any case: </h3><br><ul><li>  to motivate with money directly for the use of CRM (such as having got 100 clients - get a bonus);  motivation should occur indirectly and meet business goals; <br></li><li>  to gamify the use of a CRM system - any gamification will make you your hostage: employees will get used to the game bonuses and will work exclusively for them, and not for business goals; <br></li><li>  blackmail and threaten a CRM system (‚Äúif you don‚Äôt enter data, you‚Äôll dismiss"); <br></li><li>  allow not to use the CRM-system, that is, to go on about the boycotting employees.  The CRM system is the same tool as IP-telephony or PC, it is not necessary to create a stir around it.  We put it - we work, simply because it is faster and more convenient. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  Protest, do not protest ... CRM anti-boycott check list </h2><br>  We have analyzed the reasons and forms of protest, analyzed in detail the policy regarding the protest group itself.  Things are easy - to collect all the methods in one list so that you can discuss the most successful solutions.  Let's go for the points. <br><br><ul><li>  Make CRM interactive.  Let managers track their performance in the system and keep all their work plans there.  Since the CRM system sends notifications and helps to see its tasks within the collective, the employee will quickly get used to convenience.  Other mechanisms can be implemented: for example, in our <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM,</a> each employee can see the progress bar of his KPI and thus pull the tail in time and not allow the tip to get bogged down. <br></li><li>  Let the CRM-system be a way of interaction within the company.  It is often said that a CRM system is a repository, a database.  In fact, this concept is outdated (although technically it is), now the emphasis is on communication between employees and employees with customers. <br></li><li>  Form internal experts who will help employees within the company.  It is always easier (and cheaper) to ask a colleague a question than to a vendor‚Äôs employee.  Free up the time of early followers to study - in the near future it will pay off in full.  Record video tutorials, mini-instructions, print out the CRM-system documentation (if the vendor is not ready to provide it, you are mistaken with the choice of vendor). <br></li><li>  Speak with the staff of their problems and present the CRM-system as a way to solve them.  For example, ask employees what problems they see in working with data, communications, and planning.  After you get all the information from them, present CRM as a way to solve these problems. <br></li><li> Carefully consider the choice of <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">CRM-system</a> .  In general, this should be the first point - if CRM does not correspond to your business or is not able to automate business processes, it will cause maximum dissatisfaction.  Check that the system has basic things: planning, telephony, contacts, convenient creation of entities from any section, etc. <br></li><li>  Implement a CRM system based on employee requirements, report on each stage by mailing or in-person meeting, let them ask and be open.  About why this is important and how to collect the requirements, we wrote in a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/348404/">separate article</a> . <br></li><li>  Minimize the number of required fields in the interface, focus on data quality.  If the vendor has many required fields, reconfigure the interface and leave the really critical fields to be filled. <br></li><li>  Conduct serious training, do not turn it into a profanity.  During vendor training, do not hesitate to ask to turn off the phones, provoke questions, check the learned material.  Try to take into account that the pace of training and abilities of each employee are different. <br></li><li>  Show the success of CRM.  If you have succeeded in completing a successful newsletter, a share, you have closed several important and long transactions, report it to the general meeting, emphasize the role of CRM in the process. <br></li><li>  Do an experiment.  If things are really bad, ask one employee to use CRM for a month and not use another.  Track compliance with the conditions of the experiment and summarize. <br></li><li>  Make sure that in your chosen CRM there is a mechanism of private clients and each manager can manage his own pool of contacts (not only salespeople, but also logisticians, and marketers, and support). <br></li><li>  Do not allow some units to dominate over others.  For example, if marketers request eye color and a favorite sport that salespeople need to explore, and your company sells rolled metal products or software, suppress such phenomena at the root.  Information must be accurate, adequate and consistent with the objectives of the employees. <br></li><li>  Do not punish the ruble - so you only escalate the hatred of the system.  Show that with the help of CRM employees will be able to earn more at the expense of a clear plan and well-thought-out KPIs (where they apply!). <br></li></ul><br>  According to Sirius Decision research, 25% of databases in the B2B sector contain critical errors, and each such contact costs the company $ 100.  There is one more bad news: the client base belongs to the company, but if the salesman or manager really wants to lead her away, he will not be stopped by anything, one way or another he will find a way.  But the CRM-system uniquely disciplines, increases productivity, reduces dissatisfaction with customer service and works for you.  Be patient, adapt employees according to the strategy and do not be afraid to waste time.  From hate to love one step. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>And we are slowly swaying <a href="https://t.me/bizbreeze">our channel in the Telegram</a> , in which, without advertising, we write not quite formal things about CRM and business.</i>  <i>Come in, sometimes there is a light.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350082/</a></p>
