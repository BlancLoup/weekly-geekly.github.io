  <section class="page js-page"><h1>eMachines E732G: the same, but cheaper</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> There is nothing more interesting than to write reviews of the most-most powerful pieces of iron.  Yes, and usually read about them is also very entertaining.  But when it comes to buying, you, all so well-read, estimate the real financial possibilities and take the easier option.  It‚Äôs far from the fact that it will turn out to be worse (at least within the framework of the problems actually solved on it), but cheaper - undoubtedly. <br><br>  This approach works when choosing anything from video cards to winter shoes.  And, what is the most annoying, reviews of the flagships are a dime a dozen, but it‚Äôs not often possible to read about sensible middle peasants.  Having taken care of recently buying a laptop for my wife, I decided to tell about the winner of the ‚Äútender‚Äù eMachines E732G, and at the same time about the general approaches to choosing a home mobile computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5e/0c7/405/f5e0c7405cb5b4eb003d0909ff2cb82b.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Until now, the Acer TravelMate 3022, bought four years ago, was at the disposal of the spouse.  For his rather respectable age by computer standards, he was preserved not badly: he was not peeling off, all the "native" parts were in place, he had never been asked to repair.  There are two reasons why I had to think about replacing.  The first is related to the fact that in the past year and a half the laptop was subjected to daily curiosity from the side of a small child, and for this reason he lost keys, received powerful pokes, was left without rubber feet, and once even firmly zhahnulsya from the table.  The keys came back into place, the rubber feet didn‚Äôt fool around with them, and there were no cracks from falling, but a small spot appeared on the screen in the lower right corner.  That is, you can use it, but there remains a feeling of being battered.  The second reason is more serious: the battery of increased capacity, with which the laptop was operated from the very beginning, actually ordered to live long - instead of four hours, it began to pull forty minutes.  Yes, and the staff keeps the strength of the hour, which is frankly not enough.  You might think that when used inside an apartment there is no need anymore, but this is not true: if the laptop is in the nursery, the connected power cord increases the risk of flying to the floor by orders of magnitude.  Therefore, it is just necessary for three hours - on cartoons and on my mother's surfing, while the child pretends to fall asleep diligently.  And better is more.  Of course, I tried to buy a new high-capacity battery, but due to the antiquity and small popularity of the model, it wasn‚Äôt possible to find one.  After that I decided - the time has come. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9c/dd4/775/d9cdd477533e537b8da57d8c08d5930c.jpg" alt="Acer TravelMate 3022"><br>  <i>By the look at once, you will not say that the device is four years old.</i> <br><br>  From the laptop I needed the following: <br><br>  - battery life of at least three hours <br>  - Modern and as little as possible ‚Äúcut-off‚Äù dual-core processor ( <i>cheap CPU series is normal in terms of speed, but their energy saving opportunities are minimal. Poorly affects the implementation of the first requirement</i> ) <br>  - How can a large screen diagonal with a reasonable weight ( <i>to watch from a certain distance, without squinting</i> ) <br>  - Support 802.11n ( <i>I have a home network for a long time on this standard, it is very convenient to watch movies and cartoons in HD from NAS through the air, without copying to a hard disk</i> ) <br>  - Convenient keyboard with a minimum of additional buttons on which children just love to press, cutting down the sound and opening twenty windows of the player. <br>  - Price within 25,000 rubles.  Not because I'm very greedy - just the child's enthusiasm is growing day by day and, if something bad happens to a laptop, it should not be too pitiful.  Addition to this point - as low as possible, and at the same time resistant to external influences. <br><br>  I will say right away: I immediately started searching among Acer laptops.  It's not about religious preferences, no.  I also treat other brands with respect, but at home there are three Acer'a, and everyone likes them.  I already mentioned one, the second - the Acer D250 netbook, which has already flown a good half of the globe with me and my wife, and the third - a purely desktop Packard Bell LJ65 with a 17-inch screen, on which I usually work and play something not very hard .  Do not pay attention to the name Packard Bell: this is the same Acer, only with a more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù design.  I emphasize once again: very decent models are also produced under other brands, but so far Acer will not let me down - I don‚Äôt want to look good from the good.  At least at my own expense :) I don‚Äôt consider the demise of the battery after four years as a set-up: for most of my acquaintances, the batteries were given oak and earlier. <br><br>  Revising several options with a diagonal from 13 to 15 inches and noted that the more - the cheaper.  Options for Core i5 / i7 rejected - a little expensive, and, given the tasks, is not very useful.  I decided to focus on laptops with Core i3, which turned out to be relatively few.  In fact, in a proven company there were only two Aspire, 5741 and 5742, differing in the frequency of the processor and the breed of the video card (also an important nuance: you can want anything, but if the object of desire is brought in at best in two weeks ...).  Thinking, he stopped at Acer Aspire 5742G-373G32Mikk for 24,500 rubles (it is worth emphasizing that in the two weeks that have passed since the upgrade, the prices for laptops in Moscow fell a little - apparently, the sellers exhaled about the sharp exchange rate of the ruble and stopped hedging).  A bunch of 32-nm (read, cold and long-playing) Core i3-370 processor (2.4 GHz), a 15.6-inch screen (1366x768), 3 GB of memory, a 320 GB hard drive and a discrete Radeon Mobile 5470 adapter seemed very nice. it seems to be not very important, because no one was going to play on a laptop, but, looking at how the GPU was recently used even for acceleration of web surfing, I decided it wouldn't hurt.  Keyboard - lovely sight, curb weight 2.6 kg. <br><br>  Very much going to take, but then knowledgeable guys advised to look at eMachines laptops.  At first I was indignant: yes, eMachines is also an Acer brand, but what was sold under it earlier was very similar to the love fruit of a box of grapes with an Ikeev toolbox.  My wife, of course, is unpretentious, like many people from Zamkadya (I‚Äôll clarify - I myself am), but not so much!  However, upon closer inspection, it turned out that the exterior of eMachines has noticeably straightened.  Of course, I am still a connoisseur, but it‚Äôs not a shame to show such a woman. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a3/d70/0b3/7a3d700b32361eb4ab91d87e434c470d.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/895/f6c/a7a/895f6ca7a9756917109bfff17db45adb.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br>  <i>Left Acer, right eMachines</i> <br><br>  I was surprised by another thing: in the eMachines lineup, I found a total clone of the Aspire 5742G, but by 10 percent more cheap!  His name is E732G-373G32Mnkk, and the difference, in fact, only in the logo on the top cover and the location of the card reader.  The rest - the twins, but the price is no longer 24,500, and 22,000. Being a suspicious guy, I began to look for a catch.  Maybe the warranty is less?  No, and there, and there is 1 year.  Service centers are the same.  Can it be done on the night shift by tired Chinese for half the salary?  Yes, it seems no less good looks.  The keyboard is one to one ... I thought, I thought, and that‚Äôs how eMachines took it.  I think even an inveterate macophile would have been seduced by a 10% discount because a peach or a melon was painted instead of an apple on the lid of a macbook.  In this case, the difference is of this magnitude. <br><br>  At home, before giving the unit to the tenacious hands of his wife and son, he tinker with him a little.  I was extremely pleased that the pre-installed Windows 7 (Home Base, but 64-bit at once) was not littered with pseudo-useful software.  In fact, I only had to take down Norton Internet Security, which I didn‚Äôt really like, and there wasn‚Äôt really anything extra there, except for a few pre-installed arcades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3a/eda/6ac/d3aeda6ac8968e7be1af3576cd08ff29.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  When connected to the network, there was a discrepancy with the stated characteristics: it was written on the price tag that the Ethernet here is 100 Mbit, in fact - gigabit, as in Aspire 5742G.  I thought it was also ‚Äúdeceived‚Äù with wireless, but no, the Atheros adapter only supports 802.11g.  Well, nothing, with this drawback, I still reconciled in the store, because a miniPCI adapter with n support can be found for 800 rubles. I will change soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62c/4ba/7b6/62c4ba7b6e136c0273ce0ae782e3711e.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br>  <i>The location of the Ethernet port is inconvenient.</i>  <i>Soothes that no one is going to use it.</i> <br><br>  I launched the puzomerka built into Windows and, I confess, I was a little sad.  I considered my Packard Bell to be quite a powerful laptop, but the eMachines middling does it on time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cd/a48/73d/2cda4873d77121e4c4f48f6a3f309b03.gif" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/991/0e7/efb/9910e7efb372657acf0c7b026fe0b5b1.gif" alt="eMachines E732G"><br>  <i>Packard Bell at the top, eMachines below</i> <br><br>  Okay, the processor, but even the video card in the game tests turns out to be faster than my GeForce GT130M, where the memory bus is twice as wide, and the memory itself is twice as large.  It is clear that the chip released a year later (this is me about the Radeon) and made using more advanced technology could not be slower.  But all the same - sad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbd/c9b/144/bbdc9b1446d45df0294e100af3e0b741.gif" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  And I really missed it when I launched a benchmark built into WinRar: Core Core i3-370 from eMachines squeezed out almost twice as much against Core 2 Duo: 1567 points instead of 800. Obviously, an additional 300 megahertz (my Core 2 Duo T6500 runs at 2.1 GHz) do not give such an increase - here both the advanced architecture and the presence of the Hyper-Threading technology make themselves felt.  In general, it turns out, the most powerful laptop in the family is no longer with me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/013/29c/13a01329c97915f2bb15c37cda7425c1.gif" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  Well, at least the presence of the state test station with the Core i7-965 Extreme Edition allows you to maintain respect for yourself. <br><br>  Without load, the laptop is almost silent, under load, in general, is also not a screamer.  The cooling system removes the hot air from the right side, and the iron itself does not heat up much inside - at least, the knees are not hot at all.  The frequency of the processor and video chip resets thoroughly: Core i3 instead of 2.4 GHz in Word + ICQ mode drives itself up to 900 MHz, and a GPU up to 175 MHz instead of 750. From a standard 6-cell battery, the laptop in surfing mode lasts just under four hours.  The movie in SD makes it run out in three and a half hours, and HD in two.  It is quite acceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18d/f06/b1a/18df06b1aed02a9f94bc69119b24d80f.png" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  The margin of brightness at the screen is simply monstrous, it immediately set it at half brightness, and that is quite enough.  The built-in speakers from the sky of stars are not enough - the usual ones are loud.  3 USB 2.0 ports, HDMI, card reader, DVD cutter - everything is in place. <br>  I am far from considering the eMachines E732G to be the best laptop in the world - of course, there are more beautiful and faster.  I would not even venture to say that it is the cheapest in its class, although I have seen a lower price only for options on the AMD Athlon II Dual-Core with a frequency of 2.1-22 GHz.  But this is definitely a sensible workhorse with decent performance, without strange quirks and, it seems, not without grace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/090/12f/9c2/09012f9c2d171dbec567275ef9e04d34.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  When I wrote this post, I suddenly discovered that these laptops with Linux instead of Windows 7 HB appeared everywhere, and even cheaper - from 19,500 rubles.  Two weeks ago, I saw this only in one online store, and then they said that it was not available.  Of course, I persuade myself that I saved a lot of time on installing the OS and drivers, but, on the other hand, to save 5,000 rubles instead of 2,500 is also a passion as pleasant and useful.  Well, who knew? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ec/f2c/ccd/3ecf2cccd9d04eb67c2c2d42933d8add.jpg" alt="eMachines E732G"><br><br>  But now I can calmly switch to thinking about upgrading my working laptop, a single-core processor that already does not even cope with web pages.  If there is something to write by the results, I will certainly do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108114/</a></p>
