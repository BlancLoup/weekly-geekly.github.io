This is done so that providers can freely install their equipment in apartment buildings, without the approval of two thirds of apartment owners.  Now, without such approval, the provider does not have the right to install equipment in the house, so in most cases it is necessary to settle these problems with management companies, which takes about 2% of revenue per year.

      The proposed draft law obliges the authorities and local governments to ensure the realization of the right of citizens to access communication services.  Developers are obliged to provide homes with appropriate infrastructure that allows the installation of network equipment, and management organizations will have to work with operators who have contracts with tenants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conclusion by the apartment owner of the contract for the provision of services with the operator will now be considered as the realization of a citizen of the constitutional right to access information.  ‚ÄúThus, the implementation of its constitutional law rests on the need to hold a general meeting of tenants of an apartment building and to obtain the approval of two thirds of votes from the total number of owners of the building‚Äôs premises.  Practical implementation of this duty in most cases is practically impossible, ‚Äùthe draft document says. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has been trying to simplify the work of providers in apartment buildings not for the first year.  But this required cooperation with the Ministry of Construction, and there was no understanding of the situation on the part of this ministry.  A few days ago, President Vladimir Putin instructed the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Communications, the Federal Antimonopoly Service and Roskomnadzor, together with interested agencies and the Media Communication Union, to submit proposals on non-discriminatory access to apartment buildings for providers by June 1. <br><br>  Russia's largest telecommunications companies have already expressed their approval for this initiative.  At the same time, the Ministry of Construction does not agree with the proposal, and puts forward its own.  Its essence is the re-holding of a meeting of the owners of the premises with the agreement of the conditions for operators to access common property, and the implementation of the decision will be carried out by the person responsible for managing the house. <br><br>  But telecom operators do not agree with this proposal.  ‚ÄúIn addition to the obvious difficulties of collecting a quorum, the proposal does not solve the problem of abuse by management companies.  The right of a property owner to choose a provider is primary and should not depend on the will of the Criminal Code and, moreover, on the other residents of the house, ‚Äùsaid Dmitry Solodovnikov, MTS representative. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355948/</a></p>
