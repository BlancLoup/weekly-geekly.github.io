  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Despite the economic downturn, the city of Shenzhen plans to become the Chinese Silicon Valley</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In June 2015, the Chinese stock market reached its peak over the past seven years, then <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18988/">collapsed by</a> almost 40%.  The exception was the stock exchange and the city of Shenzhen. <br><br>  However, in the Chinese venture capital market, interest in high-tech start-ups continues.  From 2006 to 2013, China averaged only 9% of the global venture capital market.  And in 2014 - already 18%.  China overtook Europe on this indicator and became the second market in the world after the United States.  According to <a href="http://www.avcj.com/">AVCJ</a> , in 2013, venture capital investments in start-ups amounted to $ 953 million, in 2014 rose to $ 2.28 billion, and in 2015 jumped to $ 7.66 billion. <br><br>  Due to the fact that Shenzhen is one of the most promising cities in the world for the development of high-tech start-ups, the fall in stock markets does not greatly influence the formation of the Chinese Silicon Valley.

      The city has the Simply Work Technopark with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5000 square meters, which houses more than 40 companies.  Soon, about 20 more should join them. <a name="habracut"></a>  The industrial park is located close to the local industrial park and, in particular, the headquarters of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent Holdings</a> , one of the three largest Chinese Internet companies.  This is one of the advantages of Simply Work. <br><br>  The inhabitants of the technopark are mostly engaged in developments in the field of mobile Internet. <br><br>  Among them is <a href="http://startupsalad.com/">Startup Salad</a> , which creates a social network to coordinate the activities of start-up entrepreneurs, mentors and investors.  One of the company's founders, Shan Lu, admits that he, like many of his colleagues, is inspired by the example of Chinese businessmen who have become landmark figures of the local IT market, including the head of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba Group,</a> Jack Ma and the head of Tencent Pony Ma. <br><br>  Shenzhen authorities intend to position the city as a Chinese Silicon Valley, more promising than similar centers in Beijing and Shanghai.  In January, it was announced that more than 1,000 large IT companies should operate in the city by 2020, and the number of qualified specialists to grow by 600,000. Chinese authorities are trying to support the development of the techno-hub in Shenzhen - especially during the economic downturn. <br><br>  At the end of 2015, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Shenzhen <a href="http://www.chinapro.ru/rubrics/1/13611/">reached</a> 1.75 trillion yuan ($ 269 billion).  This is 8.9% more than in 2014.  By 2020, the city authorities intend to increase the figure to 2.6 trillion yuan. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that the share of the four leading sectors of the city - high technology, finance, logistics and culture - in Shenzhen‚Äôs GDP is 63.6%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInvestors are becoming more cautious and discriminating,‚Äù complains Liang Liang, the founder of start-up Mami Zhidao, who supplies health IT-services.  ‚ÄúIn the spring we had less than two months to organize a round of financing and get $ 10 million, and negotiations with potential investors, which began in November, dragged on for a long time.‚Äù <br><br>  Nevertheless, according to Yan Yan, co-founder of Startup Salad, interest in entrepreneurship remains high: ‚ÄúThe explosive growth continues.  When investors see that the stock market is not very stable and brings disappointment over and over again, they often decide to turn to the technology sector, ‚ÄùVedomosti newspaper quoted a businessman with reference to The Wall Street Journal. <br><br>  In January 2015, <a href="http://fastsalttimes.com/sections/obzor/410.html">it became</a> known about the plans of the Chinese government to establish a venture capital fund aimed at supporting companies that operate in new industries, such as high technology and the production of clean energy.  The amount of the fund was to be $ 6.5 billion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298716/</a></p>
