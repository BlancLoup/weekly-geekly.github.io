  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three startups who work in coworking and change industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 7, we opened our coworking, and the first residents drove onto the site.  All of them are professionals, passionate about their work and creating non-standard projects that change the usual course of things.  We decided to tell about them in more detail and asked three teams three questions: what is your project, why did you decide to work in coworking and what are your expectations from working here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Alexey Lazorenko, BlaBlaCar </h1><br>  I was one of the founders of the <a href="http://podorozhniki.com/">podorozhniki.com</a> project, which was recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/bla-bla-russia/">absorbed by the European BlaBlaCar service</a> .  Now I develop BlaBlaCar in Russia and Ukraine and form a team.  <a href="http://www.blablacar.ru/">BlaBlaCar</a> is the world's largest ride-sharing service (more than 6 million users in Europe), uniting drivers and passengers along the way.  A simple and convenient way for drivers to "share" the free places in the car and find interesting fellow travelers who will pay for fuel costs for long-distance trips.  Passengers also have the opportunity to travel with reliable drivers in a comfortable car at a much lower price than by public transport. <br><br>  The theme of coworking is in principle close to us in spirit.  We develop the service from the category of the economy of joint consumption, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãco-working is also about this - joint and reasonable consumption of working space.  I learned about <a href="http://ditelegraph.com/">DI Telegraph</a> completely by chance from a post on Facebook from one of my friends.  I did not think long, and here we are very happy about it.  Work here is really great, I sincerely recommend. <br><br>  All that we want to get from working in the DI Telegraph, we are already actively receiving - a creative spirit and a desire to work a lot and fruitfully in the environment of talented and interesting people.

    <h1>  Art of AD </h1><br>  Our project is called ‚Äú <a href="http://artofad.ru/">Art of AD</a> ‚Äù - we make interactive gamified advertising.  The bottom line is that any passer-by from a phone or tablet via wi-fi can connect to the video wall, for example, in a shopping center, and immediately start playing the game branded for the customer, and in the end get some bonuses in the form of prizes, coupons, discounts, etc. <br><br>  Now there are 5 people in the team.  We have been working together for 3 years, and during this time we managed to get a patent for an invention, make a scientific publication, win five hackathons, make five games and six interactive installations with Kinect. <br><br>  For us, co-working is a cool and atmospheric place with very interesting people. <br>  Simply fantastic people, professionals in their field; <br>  Very useful dating; <br>  Parties - the first was from <a href="http://twice-agency.ru/">Twice</a> ; <br>  A huge hall where you can ride a skateboard or scooter; <br>  Interesting conferences almost every day; <br>  Wonderful banana soap)) <br><br>  We work a lot and are around the clock in coworking.  Therefore, we dream of all sorts of household trifles that will make our life more convenient - for example, ottomans and coffee drippers at each workplace. <br><br><h1>  Moscow Coding School </h1><br>  <a href="http://moscoding.ru/">Moscow Coding School</a> is a new school where cool young developers from progressive Internet companies and start-ups introduce representatives of creative industries to programming.  School teachers include the creator of the world-famous <a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> plugin Sergey Chikuyonok from <a href="http://inn.ru/">Innova Systems</a> , Misha Reislin from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> , Roman Gordeyev from <a href="http://exchang.es/">Exchang.es</a> , the creator of <a href="http://gifpumper.com/">Gifpumper</a> Slava Balasanov (aka Slava) from New York, leading <a href="http://w-o-s.ru/">WOS</a> web engineers Mika Nalbandian and Artem Legotin , PayPal Battle Hack winner Sergey Pronin from <a href="http://empatika.com/">Empatika</a> , Anton Domashnev, Nikita Komarkov and Boris Goryachev from <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/">Look At Media</a> , Roman Garin from <a href="http://boloid.com/">Hyperboloid</a> , developer of the acclaimed <a href="http://glitche.com/">Glitch√©</a> application Boris Golovnev and others. <br><br>  Courses take place on weekends at the DI Telegraph and collect a lot of people who want to upgrade to web and mobile development.  For a relatively small number of classes, students not only understand the basic concepts of a particular programming language, but also personally write their own projects.  Many come to us without any programming knowledge and thanks to our teachers overcome the fear of practical coding and revise their views on who they want to be. <br><br>  Being in the DI Telegraph, we feel absolutely no difference in the atmosphere with co-working and startup incubators in San Francisco or New York.  Here, everything is spick and span - ideal conditions for work and communication.  The unique atmosphere that attracts interesting creative people. <br><br>  We became the first residents of the DI Telegraph and are proud of it.  We hope that working here will give us even more new acquaintances and new breakthrough projects resulting from them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220637/</a></p>
