  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual Reality at the White Nights Game Devils Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just last week, the gaming industry business conference ended - White Nights St.  Petersburg 2017. This year Shoukeys has significantly expanded its borders, including for VR projects.  The industry still understands that this direction will be in demand and is still trying to grope an approach, learning to work with already existing devices.  For VR, it is not the first time the conference has been allocated a separate nomination within the framework of the Indie Game Cup.  In our blog of the program " <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of game projects</a> " we publish a report on the conference from our author - Mikhail Pimenov, about VR in White Nights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/304/ba5/b4b/304ba5b4b14949cc926571de39002314.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Obviously, it is more difficult to install a stand for a VR project.  Firstly, the stand requires much more space than a project on the mobile or desktop platform - you need more space for the player‚Äôs movements and maneuvers so that he doesn‚Äôt accidentally hurt any of the visitors.  Again, the wires that usually go through the upper mounting of the stand and thus allow more or less to move freely.  It is possible that this was one of the reasons why the organizers of White Nights this time decided to choose Lenexpo instead of Baltic House, despite the fact that the conference itself also expanded compared to last year.

VR is not an exception here - HTC Vive, Mobile Headsets, Cardboard - the games were presented for different VR formats, genres, and the readiness of the projects at the same time was very different.  From those already running and operating to those that are still preparing to launch the beta version, are testing or even thinking about multiplayer at an early stage.  We tried to cover all the submitted projects on White Nights and describe the details of each of them. <br><br><h4></h4><h3>  Runaway vr </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJi7PSm-Fjg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Runner from Ponoramic Inc has already passed the Greenlight (yes, there were such times when it had to be passed) and is preparing to appear in the stores in the near future.  This is a typical runner, transferred to the VR-rails - colorful graphics, several levels, collecting coins, rating and buying boosters.  All that players have already got used to on the mobile-platforms.  Let's see how relevant this will be for VR.  By the way, the studio plans to release the game including on mobile. <br><br><h3>  Qbike </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geGrzDFlNcw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Gexagon VR decided to implement the mechanics of virtual bikes from the Tron universe.  Different stories with different features will allow fan competitions, including in multiplayer mode.  The game is in early access on Steam and supports HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. <br><br><h3>  Aliens in the Yard </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJtpMeFHHg8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Kazan Studio Fair Games (GD Forge) presented the game with defense-mechanics.  The general concept is to protect your yard from flying saucers with the help of fireworks.  Uncomplicated graphics and simple gameplay with a shooting experience, the developers explain by wanting to find the VR market rather than go into creating a unique experience. <br><br><h3>  High noon </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSFakE4ETHA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The VR-shooter for HTC Vive from Octobox, which presented the gaming industry with Paper Knight on mobile platforms, was held on February 15th with Greenlight.  Colorful graphics, the choice of weapons, bosses and various features of the shooting range, which vigorously interact with each other and draw down with terrible force.  Developers plan in the future to transfer the project to Oculus Rift, and a full release is scheduled for the autumn. <br><br><h3>  Cyber </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nxw7d9mJIn0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The project was developed primarily as a sci-fi-style shooter for the virtual reality club in St. Petersburg - VR Game Club.  Dar Studio focused on the early part of the Unreal Tournament series - the dynamics of the gameplay does not allow to relax, especially when playing in multiplayer mode.  Interestingly, one of the key features of the game is a ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù body image.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãsupports a joint mode of up to 8 players, and already this week the game will be available on Steam on the HTC Vive platform.  The developers are planning to release on the Oculus Rift, but the exact timing is not reported. <br><br><h3>  Point war </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZUtIpcSamc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In Viroomir, they focus primarily on such series of games as Counter-Strike and Battlefield.  The game is created on the Unreal engine under the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.  It is planned to upgrade weapons, complete simulation of realistic weapon behavior, charging, shooting, realistic body rendering and other integral elements of a truly military simulator.  Expected 8x8 multiplayer with further optimization of up to 32 players at a time.  The development team, including the ambitious task, is to connect players of the PC version and the VR version on the same server.  It will be interesting how this experiment will be crowned!  At the moment, an alpha version is available, and by the end of the year, the developers promise to release a beta for testing all the features they have planned. <br><br><h3>  Road of Life (Iceroad of life) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMCA8gKzs1A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  One of the main areas of Piligrim XXI is the work on projects in the historical setting.  The studio develops VR and AR projects for the sphere of culture and education.  Several projects were presented at once.  In this case, interactive elements are not present in all, for the most part it is more of an experience, giving the opportunity to observe some historical event.  The Road of Life is just one of these scenes in which the user can observe in detail how Soviet troops are conducting military operations during the Great Patriotic War.  Piligrim XXI is focused on mobile headsets and cardboards - all applications are now available on Google Play and the App Store. <br><br><h3>  Let's ball VR </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNthtbB9tOY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Rising Fun Games decided to take the time-tested game and just translate it into VR format.  The mechanics themselves are obvious and have not undergone major changes, however, everything feels so authentically and intuitively that the player is ready to almost sincerely believe in a real bowling ball in his hand and in a cast that matches all the canons of real-life physics.  By the way, Let's Ball VR won the Indie Game Cup nomination, as the best VR game! <br><br>  By the way, the game was Greenlight and prepare for the exit 07/07/2017 on Steam.  Including, it is expected the version for Oculus Rift and Gear VR.  The presence of in-game purchases is planned, and a full-fledged multiplayer, which is scheduled for release in August. <br><br><h3>  Slave of war </h3><br><br>  The project with a full-fledged Immergity story in the Action / Shooter genre is already the second game of the team.  In the setting of the ancient world, players will have to fight with the Minotaur, Medusa Gorgon and other representatives of ancient myths, simultaneously saving Hermes himself.  The game has both close and long range, diverse interaction with the environment.  The team conducted a large-scale work with the feedback of the controllers, which allows the game to give a really interesting experience.  There are elements of pumping, as well as different types of weapons.  Among the projects of the conference, Slave of War stands out due to the abundance of features and the presence of a fully-fledged story campaign.  Release on Steam, Oculus Store and Viveport is expected on July 15. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b0/b52/0f2/3b0b520f2074401a9f4782e8422723a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the near future, we will post on our blog on Habrahabr summaries and recordings of interesting lectures about VR and game play.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/miip/">Subscribe</a> to get notified when they exit.
