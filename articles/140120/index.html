Usually I am very sensitive to the cleanliness of my computer equipment and spend regular cleanings every six months.  But all did not reach the laptop hands.  I noticed that the laptop in the mode of medium load began to heat up quite strongly.  The audit showed that the average CPU temperature ranges from 70-80 degrees.  Therefore, it was decided to disassemble the laptop to clean the cooling system, and at the same time to see what it was like inside my little animal. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  UPD: Fixed photo sizes.

    <h5>  Training </h5><br>  After reading the domestic and foreign forums, I did not find any manuals regarding the disassembly of this model.  Only one forum in one of the posts said that cleaning the cooling system is impossible without removing the motherboard. <br><br>  I prepared a small set of tools and got to work.  Disassembly, assembly and cleaning took me about 4 hours.  I want to share my experience gained in the process of disassembling / assembling a laptop. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8758.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Directly disassembly </h5><br>  I have broken the laptop disassembly into paragraphs, most of which will contain some comments. <br><br>  1. Unplug the card reader plug. <br>  2. Disconnect the battery. <br>  3. Unplug the cover that covers the compartment with RAM and hard drive. <br>  4. Disconnect the keyboard. <br><br>  This operation requires some manual dexterity and the necessary tools.  I had a rather flat little screwdriver from a set of watch screwdrivers and an office knife.  The keyboard is mounted on the bottom with the tabs on the keyboard itself, and on the top, left and right with the tabs on the case.  The upper ledges of the hull also have the property of embedding into the hull.  So, with a screwdriver, press the leftmost ledge, then slide the blade of the office knife between the keyboard and the case.  Next, do the same with the next protrusion, move the blade to the right, and so on until the end.  After that, you can pull the keyboard with your fingers by the central part so that it bends slightly.  Due to this, the keyboard will be released to the left and to the right.  After that, free the keyboard from the bottom. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8752.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  5. Disconnect the keyboard cable. <br>  6. Unscrew the six bolts that you will see under the keyboard. <br>  7. Open the hard disk and RAM section. <br>  8. Unscrew one m2.5x4 bolt near the RAM and two m2.5x8 near the hard disk. <br>  9. Remove the 5 bolts from the front of the cover. <br>  10. Unscrew the m2x3 bolts in the battery compartment. <br>  11. Unplug and remove the drive. <br><br>  The drive is fastened with three bolts - two near the side and one at the end of the drive (approximately the middle of the laptop case) from the front. <br><br>  12. Disconnect the power supply and touchpad cables from the motherboard. <br>  13. Remove the top cover of the laptop case (which is under the keyboard). <br><br>  Some explanations are needed here.  The cover is fastened with ordinary snaps, be careful not to break them.  I started removing the cover from the right USB panel, because  there was a big gap from the CD drive.  It is necessary to press the lid in the center, then the latches open by themselves (opening the bottom, push the lid up, etc.). <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8739.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  14. Open the compartment of an incomprehensible destination. <br>  15. Disconnect the RAM. <br><br>  It is necessary to bend the fixing legs left and right, respectively.  Also immediately remove the hard drive.  It must be pulled from the power connector and SATA2.  My long did not give in, be careful.  I also put the adapter from the mouse into the slot between the case and the hard drive to soften the impact of the hard drive on the case. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8703.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8704.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8706.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  16. Disable the wifi module. <br><br>  Also immediately release the white wire from WiFi - it passes through the motherboard and will interfere with its removal. <br><br>  It is necessary to unscrew the fixing screw, then disconnect the wires.  They are not soldered, just pull them up. <br><br>  17. Disconnect the retaining fasteners of the mounting tape. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8698.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8699.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  18. Disconnect the speaker and microphone connectors. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8694.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8695.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8696.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  19. Disconnect the external USB cable. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8702.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  20. Disconnect the display connector. <br>  21. Unscrew the fixing screws on the motherboard. <br>  22. Pull the motherboard out of the case.  Do not rush, there is another connector! <br>  23. Disconnect the above connector (powered by charging). <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8713.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8714.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8717.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  24. Loosen the cooling system (4 screws near the processor, 2 - near the video card chip). <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8720.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8721.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8723.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8724.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8725.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8726.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  25. Clean the processor and video card chip from the old thermal paste. <br><br><img src="http://bernackiy.name/habr/IMG_8731.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  My part of the thermal paste was semi-dry, but the chips themselves were still liquid.  Use alcohol to clean the chips from the old thermal paste. <br><br>  26. Apply new thermal grease to the processor and video card. <br>  27. Disconnect the cooler from the radiator and blow it. <br><br>  You can vacuum, you can still brush clean.  There was not much dust on my cooler.  And indeed, expectations regarding the pollution of the laptop have not been confirmed.  I expected at least a small traffic jam near the air duct. <br>  Also, it was necessary to clean all the surfaces of the motherboard and case to remove a small layer of dust.  Also, a lot of garbage was on the hinges of the display;  there is lube, which the garbage collects on itself. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  After cleaning the cooling system and changing the thermal paste, the processor temperature dropped by 20 degrees, now it does not rise above 55.  Also, the laptop has become much quieter.  And I made sure that the screen mount is quite reliable (two small loops caused doubts).  In addition, the build quality is not bad (it happened that after disassembling half of the latches did not work). <br><br>  <u>Remember that all operations with your laptops you do at your own peril and risk, this article covers only my experience and is not an official guide.</u> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140120/</a></p>
