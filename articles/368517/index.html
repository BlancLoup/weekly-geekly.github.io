  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The human factor in online trading systems or when Escrow from AliExpress does not work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite a few types of fraud are developed in online stores, but they are built on the carelessness and ignorance of buyers.  As a rule, all these schemes are broken into dust with timely appeal to arbitration. <br>  However, the human factor can ruin any good thing.  In this essay, I will share the tragedy that has developed around my five-dollar cable, ordered on AliExpress back in June, as a scheme built on the negligence of arbitration.  In the end, Skype has already been run over, than AliExpress is worse ?! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/5da/427/e4c5da42757647d1bc603dc01f116041.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, this is not a complaint.  Of course, the loss of $ 5 has knocked me down, my brain has boiled over and claimed justice, but I resisted, rehabilitated and am already learning to live with it further. <br><br>  In order not to torment, I will immediately explain the essence of the scheme. <br>  a) the seller sends the goods and gives a non-working track. <br>  b) the buyer does not immediately begin to worry, because anything can happen. <br>  c) the buyer does not receive the goods in the calculated period, requires to give the correct number, the seller dynamite. <br>  d) the buyer initiates a dispute, the arbitration obliges the seller to give the correct track number. <br>  d) The seller gives the left track number, from someone else's parcel to your city and received by another person.  The weak point is that the AliExpress arbitration is sufficient the fact of having a track and receiving a parcel.  No other factors - the place and date of departure, the weight of the parcel, the name of the recipient - are not taken into account by the arbitration.  The only evidence that the arbitration requires in accordance with the screenshot above is an <b><i>official document</i></b> from the post office that you did not receive the parcel :) Of course, no such post will be given in any country, the dispute ends with the seller‚Äôs victory, the curtain! <br><br>  Why does this work?  I can assume the following.  Ali, like all other similar organizations, has auto-sorting of tickets.  Cheap tickets get to low-skilled staff, as a rule, trainees or outsourcing companies in general on a contract.  These people are the most loaded, they have the minimum allowed time to process the ticket, and the qualification is so-so.  They do not have time to punch the track, check the parameters, + surely there is a clear and stupid instruction where to poke the mouse.  Initiative is punishable. <br>  In my lifetime, a similar situation was with a single cellular operator that supported small business on an outsource.  Any new operator reached the company with a delay and customers often received incorrect advice.  And that is why this situation seems to me exactly a hole in the system.

I will not insert them into the text so as not to spoil the page, for the huge ones who want to open it themselves.  If suddenly representatives of Ali appear here and accuse me of being unfounded, and I know that they monitor the runet, order 67577811566571. <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/560/ea3/58f/560ea358f00a4092864c9829b884ebef.png</a> <br>  The dispute itself.  The dispute was conducted from sports interest, to understand at what stage it will reach arbitration.  It did not come :) Now I have been given again 12 days to provide the very official certificate from the post office. <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/c65/f29/ccf/c65f29ccf8a7476bb62cafa0755e63e8.jpg</a> <br>  Fake receipt that the seller gave.  EMS mail for freeshipping 150 grams and $ 5, yeah. <br>  Errors in the spelling of English words (FORM, COSTOMS declaration, etc.) are delivered separately. <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/41f/9d3/62f/41f9d362fccc41de965273b40807b750.png</a> <br>  A screen from the Bogotan post office, where you can also see another (compared to the seller‚Äôs receipt) the place of departure, the weight is 1280 grams and other inconsistencies. <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/23e/c0c/8e0/23ec0c8e048d44f4aefe85443bd92b1b.png</a> <br>  The screen from the Chinese tracker, where you can also see the recipient's name and the date of shipment - one month after the date specified by the seller. <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/1bc/fdc/ad0/1bcfdcad012244aba5bf63d4c683c2c7.jpg</a> <br>  Finally, the color scheme with circles!  :) Drew when the arbitration did not reach the first time.  Did not help‚Ä¶ <br><br>  So, in this particular case, it is rather a game who is who.  Social experiment.  There are still 12 days to come up with a plan for revenge, subject to the availability of mood and time. <br>  But if this happened to a large order (my personal record is $ 4,100 per machine), it would be much sadder. <br>  It remains only to hope that my couch analytics are correct, that a large order gets to other arbitration experts, and the threshold of ‚Äúlargeness‚Äù of the sorting system will not grow rapidly. <br><br>  UPD.  10/26/15.  The battle ended in victory for the beaver forces. <br>  I decided to conduct an experiment and glowed the most primitive piece of paper, taking the corporate format of the daily report as a basis and replacing the header with the logo from the mail site.  Specially left everything in Spanish, except for the main text, which stupidly translated into Google and did not rule.  Signature dabbled, stamp slapped from a set of repayment of documents with an overdue date.  In general, the falshak obvious.  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/ad2/3ed/48a/ad23ed48ad2548ca9e64d263b06577e8.JPG</a> <br>  And sho you did think?  Gobbled up <br>  Not right away.  Sold responded counterclaim, filing a similar falshak, only with a star: <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/d88/0c1/b96/d880c1b9643f4e719008205fd6bb5284.jpeg</a> <br>  Next week we threw the same pieces of paper at each other: <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/3fd/392/c36/3fd392c3677a455da678a09e286e7554.png</a> <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/files/ee6/0be/bc2/ee60bebc2460462d8fbedc9d1f7737ca.png</a> <br>  There was even the impression that the arbitration had scored on us and was waiting for someone to break the patience first.  But somewhere in the third iteration, it was decided in favor of me.  The dispute with the obvious fault of the seller took six weeks ... <br>  What conclusions can we draw? <br>  1. Arbitrage eats any candy wrapper.  I admit that they cannot know all formats of all countries, but some documents are obviously false and obviously cannot be received. <br>  2. Arbitration does not study evidence, but only the fact of their presence looks.  If I scanned the playboy turnaround, it would have come down. <br>  3. The buyer's protection system for Ali does not work and you should not hope for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368517/</a></p>
