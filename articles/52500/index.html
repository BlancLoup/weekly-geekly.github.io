      Mark will be denoted by the letter M, Charlie Rose (presenter) - the letter H, which seems logical to me ... <br><br><hr><br><br>  Ch. Mark is here.  He is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in Silicon (aka Silicon as per wikipedia) Valley.  He founded and sold two companies, each for more than $ 1 billion. The first was Netscape.  She made a revolution in web browsing before AOL was sold in 1999. His second company, Opsware, was bought by HP in 2007. He now has 2 new companies - the Ning social networking site and a venture capital investment fund.  We want to talk about it about everything.  Welcome Mark. <br><br>  About Facebook <br><br>  Ch. First I want to talk with you about something in which you have 1.6%.  This is Facebook. <br><br>  M. Well, actually I have less ... <br><br>  Ch. Seriously?  Oh no! <br><br>  M. But I was lucky to be in the Board of Directors. <br><br>  &lt;easy blah blah on the topic of how much money Mark swallowed in FB - Charlie insisted on $ 260 million, Mark unlocked.  &gt; <br><br>  M. FB is a fantastically successful company with great potential.  I do not want to compare with Google.  FB need to evaluate yourself. <br><br>  Q. FB is really estimated at $ 15 billion? <br><br>  M. Well, in the round of investments in which preferred shares were sold, the price of the shares was determined on the basis of an estimate of $ 15 billion ... (that is, investors believed that the value of the company is no less - note) <br><br>  H. Was it a Microsoft investment? <br><br>  M. Microsoft and some other investors.  And some people were actually in frustration with respect to this assessment, as it was LOWER than when it was the placement of ordinary (unprivileged) shares.  Well, of course this is all nonsense, because the company is still private and ... <br><br>  H. .. and does not bring any profit? <br><br>  M. Well, financial indicators were not disclosed ... <br><br>  Ch. Well, are you on the Board of Directors ?! <br><br>  M. Yes, I am in the Council ... <br><br>  Q. Well, let's tell us, damn, we called you here! <br><br>  M. In short, the company is all zashib.  All internal targets are in order.  Already more than 175 million active users.  HALF of them use FB every day.  And many users log in 50 times a day.  I think, right now generates non-sour loot, to be honest.  And I suppose it will generate more dough in the coming years. <br><br>  Q. Did you read an article in Fortune?  Right on the front page dude!  They write FB already practically rules our everyday life, but is this a real business? <br><br>  M. Of course, I read.  People in general are always interested in new companies ... They ... <br><br>  H. They monetize it! <br><br>  M. Yeah ... Count up the current, they already have 175 million active users.  Well this is the size of the population of the 6th country in the world already, when compared with countries.  They are on the way to 500 million finally ... It will be a multi-billion dollar success. <br><br>  Q. So what's the monetization trick? <br><br>  M. Ok, in this place the little people just cease to understand what is happening.  It is actually very interesting ... <br><br>  Ch. Yes, yes, not a damn thing is clear with monetization ... <br><br>  M. Right now I explain to him, although I myself, too, somehow do not really get it yet ... So, FB intentionally does not deal with the usual brand advertising, which other sites are happy to do.  For example, pozyr on Yukha - they, too, dough row by row by the way - and they have all these banners all the way up to them as they can.  And the FB has made a strategic decision not to deal with such pop music, but will build its own type of more organic business model.  And they are still in the process of creating this model.  And if they finally solve this problem - and I think they decide - then they will become very successful and fat.  But if Che, you can always turn on the back and start giving ordinary advertising ... If the FB right now were giving up the usual banner advertising, they would have already cut more than $ 1 billion in revenue a year.  So here, dude, is a long-term strategy question ... <br><br>  Ch. That is, if they wanted to make a loot instantly, they could? <br><br>  M. Yes, without a bazaar!  They could sell the first page for advertising and would already begin to make a giant loot.  But there is a huge potential, and the question is how they decide to use it.  And what is important, Mark (Zuckerberg) rested his horn on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a long-lived company.  And you know, old man, in Silicon Valley there are people who love to cut them down quickly, and there are people like Andy Groove, Bill Gates, the guys from Google, and I think Mark is also in this company who want a long-running business to do.  He (Mark) has plans for the distant future ... <br><br>  Ch. That is, if other dudes in his place would sell out to some media giants, Mark wants to remain independent and develop his company as he wants? <br><br>  M. And, like any company in the Valley, they received various offers to sell and decided to send everyone.  Mark has a very cool vision ... <br><br>  Ch. Well, well, what is his vision there for him? <br><br>  M. Prikin himself - this is the type of idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeveryone on this planet!  175 million people now, and crowds of new come every day.  6 billion heads throughout the world.  Probably 3 billion of them have electricity and maybe even a telephone.  That is, the entire market for the FB may be 3 billion people.  It is not a sick challenge.  And great opportunities. <br><br>  Well, I understand.  Now about your business.  What are you doing with Ning? <br><br>  M. Soon there will be 20 million users.  And every month comes another 2 million. Ning is such a thing that gives everyone the opportunity to create their own social network, and soon we will have 1 million of such networks on Ning.  It's free and easy.  All the loot we chop on advertising.  We are already in the black and the loot continues to drip faster and faster.  News Corps is feeling very good with MySpace right now.  LinkedIn too, and I'm there angel investor by the way, and they already have more than 20 million resumes in the database.  Literally, everyone first uses LinkedIn today to find work or employees.  Very hot topic, old man. <br><br>  &lt;bla-bla about the fact that even politicians are creating their networks in Ning, that Obama‚Äôs company also used the principles of social networking, Obama puts his performances on YouTube, etc.&gt; <br><br>  Ch. By the way, Youtube makes money, do you not know? <br><br>  M. I do not know for sure, she is a Google now.  But even if she doesn‚Äôt do it, trust me, man, I could easily.  These are all non-monetarized assets! <br><br>  &lt;...&gt; <br><br>  M. ... I constantly hear about fresh innovations.  For example, cloud computing. <br><br>  Ch. Well, this is not a new idea even once, it is old ... <br><br>  M. Yes, I founded the Loud Cloud company back in 1999.  I'll explain right now.  Amazon has a Cloud service.  And companies instead of stupidly buying their own servers can simply upload their software to Amazon‚Äôs servers and run it there, and their websites too ... And you can imagine that there will be a whole generation of startups that will be a couple of programmers and a couple laptops, and they will upload everything to Amazon, and pay toko for using their facilities as vodka at the bar, as for electricity ... And it turns out that there will be a lot of Internet startups who don‚Äôt need money to start, cool no?  This is an innovation, damn it!  Any student from Harvard or just a schoolboy now thinks that he can become the next Mark Zuckerberg, and in fact, now with cloud computing he has such a chance! <br><br>  &lt;...&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52500/</a></p>
