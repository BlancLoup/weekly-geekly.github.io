He worked with autistic children, children who did not speak, and tried to find a method of treatment.  I did some research on how the brain works in this situation.  For example, these children, as a rule, were quite thinking - they had a special kind of ‚Äúthinking‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know if you remember ‚ÄúRain Man‚Äù, where the hero of Dustin Hoffman, in fact, Rain Man, possessed exactly this type of computer thinking, but he had some problems with emotions. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      In one study, I discovered that our impression of a word ‚Äî about any word, be it ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, ‚Äúlove‚Äù, or ‚Äúmother‚Äù - is made up at the very first moment.  There is always the first moment when we are faced with something new.  As soon as you understand the meaning of the word for the first time, you create with it some connections on the mental level that will remain for the rest of your life.  But to create these connections you need a little emotion.  Without emotions, neurotransmitters will not be produced in the brain and communication will become impossible.  That is, each word must have its own mental freeway.  I call it code.  The code of the unconscious. <br><br>  Part of my research was conducted in Switzerland, where I worked with children who tried to learn French, Italian or German.  And my second discovery was that different associations arise in different cultures.  I found that each culture has its own code.  The word "coffee" in Italy means not the same as "coffee" in America.  I want to say that if you usually drink American coffee, and then switch to Italian, but continue to drink it at the same pace as American coffee, then you will be covered before evening.  That is, obviously, the same words can for us completely differently correspond with what they mean, with what stands behind them. <br><br>  And so, once I taught at the University of Geneva and one of my students invited his father to attend a lecture.  And at the end of the lecture, this dad told me: ‚ÄúYou know, doctor, I have a client for you‚Äù.  And I replied: ‚ÄúThis is a boy, a girl, this child does not speak?‚Äù He said: ‚ÄúNo, no, this is Nestl√©‚Äù.  I was very surprised and said: ‚ÄúNestl√©?  How can I use Nestl√©? ‚Äù  "Well, we tried to sell our coffee to Japan and, apparently, used the wrong code, because they did not achieve much success."  Today, after more than 30 years, it seems completely natural, but at that time they were just starting to ‚Äúshoot‚Äù the Japanese from tea and ‚Äúsit down‚Äù for coffee.  And of course, if you know that the Japanese have a very strong emotional connection to tea, there it is almost at the religious level, then you understand that it will be very difficult to develop a strategy on how to switch them from tea to coffee. <br><br>  In general, I took a vacation, went to Japan, found out what code for coffee should be applied in Japan, the companies informed that and they immediately began to put it into practice.  When I worked with autistic children, I never managed to achieve great results.  This is hard work, but these results are almost impossible to achieve.  And this depressed me greatly, since my American part ‚Äî and my consciousness was already quite American ‚Äî required a concrete result.  Then I went to Japan, started working with Nestl√©, and in just a few months, women, I got the result.  I said, ‚ÄúWow, so fast and already results!  Wow".  I never returned to psychiatry again.  I created my first company in Japan, then in Switzerland, in France and in America - in this way. <br><br>  <b>What was your job at Nestl√©?</b> <br><br>  In fact, I simply told them that the Japanese had no associations with coffee.  The corresponding associations they have tea.  That is, if we move forward into this category, into what we call the system (taxonomy), the mental system, we will not be able to compete with it, since this mental category already exists.  That is, we must create our own category.  That is, to begin, for example, with children's desserts with coffee taste.  Thus, we would create a certain association with the taste of coffee.  And they started with this type of product.  They began to sell coffee, but in the form of desserts, sweets and other things, which gradually accustomed people to coffee taste, and brought up an entire generation.  And when they were teenagers, the company began selling coffee, which, at first, was only with milk, and then the usual one appeared and today there is a huge coffee market in Japan. <br>  <b>Should these associations arise in childhood?</b> <br><br>  In general, yes.  But with the exception, if the first association you didn‚Äôt work out in your childhood or it happened later - for example, I try to speak English, but my first language association is French, since I was born in France during the war.  I began to learn English later.  By that time, I was already an adult, that is, I could not have the same associations with English that I had with French.  In most cases, if children do not learn a foreign language before they turn 7, they speak with an accent.  At an early age, the brain is most malleable to create mental connections. <br><br>  When we are born we have a reptile brain (reptilian).  We have it initially.  It is necessary for survival;  it provides breathing, nutrition, and other natural needs.  But then, communicating with the mother, we develop a second brain, the middle (limbic), which is responsible for emotions.  And in different cultures, emotions can also be different.  When you communicate with your mother, you have associations, mental connections in relation to what it means to love, what mother means, what to feed, what home means, and other things that are necessary for survival.  It is transmitted to you from the mother and these mental connections appear in your mind - like the reference system that you use all the time.  For example: ‚ÄúYes, this is a house;  unequivocally, this is home. ‚Äù  Well, in general, there are many people in the world for whom this is not a home for any reason.  The house can be a tent, the house can be made of ice or something else, and this does not fit into their system of references.  For some, it may be completely different. <br><br>  Then, after seven years, a cortex appears on the scene.  The cortex is the part of the brain that we develop last, and it‚Äôs the one that is responsible for what is called the ‚Äúmind.‚Äù  We are scientists - well, you understand: numbers and all that jazz.  Now, everyone is interested in the cortex, we are simply absorbed in its study.  We are trying to be reasonable, but we are absolutely not worried about the territory of the reptile, and the middle part, which is also largely subordinate to the unconscious. <br><br>  In different cultures, these levels can be very different.  Some cultures are very reptilian, which means elementary instincts.  American culture is riddled with elementary instincts: I want to get rich right now, let's get down to business.  Moreover, with an emphasis on active action.  At the moment, America is like a teenager, while other cultures are more tied to the cortex, they have everything under control, control and control again.  The Germans and the French control in the first place.  They prefer that everything be controlled by the government, from the state to the bureaucracy with the administration.  The ideal life from the point of view of a German, is simply to obey: the administration is aware of all things, everything is under control and you have absolutely nothing to worry about.  For us, this is not good.  We are Americans, we need to be able to choose: this is my own life and I want to become who I really am;  who exactly is not so important, the main thing is that I want to become myself, and not who I want someone to become.  But this does not mean that some cultures are better and others worse, they are just different. <br><br>  <b>What are codes?</b> <br><br>  If you understand the code, you understand why people do exactly what they do.  For example, the code for the French: if you understand the code, you can understand the reaction of French President Jacques Chirac to President Bush.  The thing is that for a Frenchman, the code is ‚Äúthink‚Äù.  Exactly;  think.  ‚ÄúI think, therefore I exist‚Äù - not ‚ÄúI act‚Äù, but ‚ÄúI think‚Äù.  The French believe that they are the only thinkers in the world, and they should think for the rest of the world.  They believe that Americans never think;  they just do things without knowing why.  That is why, when Bush says, ‚ÄúGo ahead guys, do it!‚Äù, The Frenchman says, ‚ÄúNo, wait, let's think first.‚Äù <br><br>  That is, to understand French culture, it is enough to know that their code is ‚Äúthink‚Äù.  You do not have to do anything with your own thinking.  The French philosopher would say ‚ÄúI think, therefore I exist,‚Äù but in America there is the company Nextel, which launches a fantastic campaign called ‚ÄúI act, therefore I exist‚Äù, but not ‚ÄúI think‚Äù.  I think they correctly identified the American code. <br><br>  ( <a href="http://ravve.habrahabr.ru/blog/8844.html">read more ...</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Translation from English to:</b> <br>  <a href="http://blog.worldwebstudio.com/">blog.worldwebstudio.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30954/</a></p>
