Everything <b><a href="https://habr.ru/p/304086">went well</a></b> then, and the conference on December 11 will arrive in Moscow, and we'll talk about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In part of the conference venue under the sun, nothing has changed: this is still a ‚Äúpure JS‚Äù conference.  I don‚Äôt confuse with the conferences about the frontend (of which there are many), we are talking about JavaScript in all its manifestations: from the web and backend to programming microcontrollers.

      Here is a preliminary list of topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Architecture of modern JS applications; </li><li>  Node.js: best practices, performance, memory management; </li><li>  JS and ECMAScript specification; </li><li>  The practice of using ES6 and ES7; </li><li>  Optimization of JS applications; </li><li>  Functional programming on JS; </li><li>  Client server synchronization; </li><li>  Application Testing; </li><li>  Work with graphics (WebGL, D3.js, etc.); </li><li>  Web API (Bluetooth, Network API, IndexedDB, Web Notifications, etc.); </li><li>  WebAssembly; </li><li>  JS engines; </li><li>  JS on devices; </li><li>  Progressive Web Apps; </li><li>  Desktop apps (Electron, etc.). </li></ul><br><h3>  Feedbacks </h3><br>  The main news is that we finally have something to work with :) The first conference we held with the guys from SPb Frontend, wandering in the darkness of ignorance, and now we have over 300 reviews from our participants from St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35c/4d5/ffe/35c4d5ffe4bb4911a9f64e753c0e2936.jpg"><br><br>  So let's see what our members would improve: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Little "hardcore."</b>  Conducting the first conference, we, right, were afraid to go too far with heavy reports.  As it turned out, nothing!  Apart from the ‚Äúanti-hipster‚Äù report by Alexey Simonenko, Vyacheslav Egorov, who told about the performance of JS engines, took the lead in assessing the listeners.  This time there are a lot of ‚Äúbison‚Äù in the program, over whose reports there will be an opportunity to break your head. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Little communication with speakers.</b>  Despite the fact that in June the expert zones started their work in pre-format, many participants said that they did not have time to interrogate any speakers closely.  Well, we will fix it: now, after each report, the speaker will move to the expert zone and spend there ... more than an hour!  Not a single question will remain unasked. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Little coffee.</b>  Yes, the conference takes a lot of energy, and you can only draw from the "black gold" of developers - coffee :) Despite the fact that coffee flowed like a river at several coffee breaks and at lunch, the participants were not enough.  At this time, coffee on the site will always be available, even during the reports. </li></ul><br><h3>  Reports </h3><br>  Ok, coffee and networking, that's good, but what about the reports?  - you ask.  Despite the fact that the conference will be already in December, we already have a couple of news that I am sure you will like: <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/6c3/850/86d6c38500ca4c9f82ce91460e6b9955.png">  <b>Feross Aboukhadijeh</b> , the founder of Study Notes and PeerCDN (successfully bought by Yahoo six months after the release), a member of the board of directors of Node.js, and the author of many of his own projects, including WebTorrent and YouTube Instant, will talk <b><a href="http://holyjs.ru/talks/build_cross_platform_desktop_apps_with_electron.html">about the development of cross-platform desktop applications</a></b> based on Electron, Node .js and npm. <br><br>  There will be a bomb! <br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c9/38c/442/6c938c4429794d0abf17a6b4bea96084.png">  <b>Nikolaus Graf</b> , open source developer and one of the creators of DraftJS Plugins &amp; Carte Blanche, organizer of ReactJS Vienna, will speak on the topic of <b><a href="http://holyjs.ru/talks/rich_text_editing_with_draftjs.html">rich editing on the web</a></b> .  It will be a question of the Draft.js framework, which was released in 2016: let's talk about the data structure and how decorators, block renderers and style maps allow you to implement drag &amp; drop, access via and hashtags.  And in continuation of this report, <b>Arthur Stolyar</b> will speak on ServiceWorkers: how and when it is better to use them, what things you can do with their help, which libraries to use, and what new features ServiceWorkers are waiting for us in the near future. <br><br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/67a/619/c3367a61947f4973a642ec1813458bf3.jpg">  A series of headliner reports continues with <b>Max Stoiber</b> , an open source developer from Thinkmill, creator of the react-boilerplate and organizer ReactJS Vienna. <br><br>  The theme of his speech: <b><a href="http://holyjs.ru/talks/offline_is_the_new_black.html">‚ÄúOffline is the new Black‚Äù</a></b> , and, as you understand, it will be a question of ‚Äúoffline‚Äù web applications. <br><br>  As you can see, the set is more than interesting: here is both hardcore and on the edge.  But there is more to come, there are some more interesting things. <br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/720/cb7/ade720cb7a20a6edb4d694fa43ac3a77.jpg" alt="image">  For example, an architectural report by <b>Viktor Grishchenko</b> , the creator of swarm.js, dedicated to solving the problems of version control, updates and caching of sprawling and fattening web applications. <br><br>  The speaker will talk about experiments with ‚Äúcutting‚Äù web applications into small pieces with separate version histories and clearly written dependencies, as well as what these experiments have led to. <br><br><br><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca0/fcc/159/ca0fcc15949e9e86f4c11f1516941f7f.jpg" alt="image">  Well, "for dessert", keynote from <b>Dr.</b>  <b>Axel Rauschmayer</b> , author of 2ality.com blog and several books on JavaScript (‚ÄúSpeaking JavaScript‚Äù, ‚ÄúExploring ES6‚Äù, etc.), on the latest ECMAScript releases and what's coming next. <br><br>  On <b><a href="http://holyjs.ru/">the conference website</a></b> we have not had time to post all these reports, but there you will find the <a href="http://holyjs.ru/tickets.html">conditions for registering and participating in the conference</a> .  The price of participation will gradually grow, so do not postpone the purchase indefinitely. <br><br><br><br><h3>  Become a speaker </h3><br>  If you want to tell about something technical Russian JavaScript-community - <b><a href="http://holyjs.ru/callforpapers.html">give us a report!</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/8ab/d57/c588abd5705b4963938386a4b2246705.jpg"><br>  If you have already spoken somewhere and have met a warm welcome from the organizers and the audience, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.  Class performances in the past is one of the important criteria that traditionally guides our program committee. <br><br>  Beginners should not be afraid either - we will definitely communicate with everyone.  Moreover, if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the technique of performance, timings and presentation, in general, to prepare the perfect report with you. <br><br>  PS The program committee also plans to organize a round table, and here we would need the help of the community: tell me <b>which topic requires discussion in the framework of the conference program and in which composition</b> .  Suggestions and suggestions write directly <u>in the comments to the post</u> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307972/</a></p>
