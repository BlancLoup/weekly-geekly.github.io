The main task of Almaz was to conduct photographic and electronic reconnaissance, control ground military facilities and counter the orbital military targets of a potential enemy.

In particular, a unique camera with a focal length of 10 m and a mirror diameter of about 2 m, comparable in resolution with the modern American Hubble telescope, was to become the main means of observation from orbit. <br><br>  The crew of the station "Almaz" consisted of two astronauts, the station, in addition to photographic equipment, was equipped with special radio equipment, a descent capsule for delivering the film to the Earth.  The armament consisted of an aircraft cannon mounted along the axis of the station. <br><br>  The stations of the Diamond series were put into orbit by the Proton carrier rocket (UR500K). <br><br>  For the delivery of the crew and the reserves to the station, their own supply ship (TKS) was developed, designed to be outputted by the same UR500K missile. At first it was supposed to supply the station and the TKS with similar return vehicles designed to descend the crew from orbit, but this idea was soon abandoned.  The returned device remained only on the transport ship. <br><br><h4>  Tks </h4><br>  Brief characteristics of the ship TKS: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/198/792/bec/198792becb8261d0e1182b58e6a6faa9.png" alt="image"><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Crew </th><td>  3 persons </td></tr><tr><th>  Autonomous flight duration </th><td>  up to 4 days </td></tr><tr><th>  The duration of the flight as part of the station "Almaz" </th><td>  up to 90 days </td></tr><tr><th>  Mass in orbit </th><td>  17.6 t </td></tr><tr><th>  Payload mass </th><td>  up to 12 t </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The structure of the TKS consisted of two units - FGB (functional cargo block) and VA (returnable vehicle). <br><img src="http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/236/Pult-1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The VA was intended to return three astronauts or 500 kg of cargo to Earth.  After a successful landing, the heat shield could be restored and the VA used again, the estimated life was 10 flights.  This allows us to speak of the TKS as a reusable ship. <br><br>  In the future, it was supposed to increase the size of the BA and the crew size to bring to five or six people. <br><br><h4>  TKS flights </h4><br>  All TKS flights are tabulated: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Flight dates </th><th>  The official name of the ship </th><th>  Purpose of flight </th></tr><tr><td>  December 5, 1976 </td><td>  Cosmos-881 and Cosmos-882 </td><td>  testing of descent vehicles </td></tr><tr><td>  March 30, 1978 </td><td>  Cosmos-997 and Cosmos-998 </td><td>  testing of descent vehicles </td></tr><tr><td>  January 5, 1979 </td><td>  -

current year </td><td>  Functional cargo block "Dawn" (ISS) </td><td>  flight as part of the International Space Station </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The not very good fortune of the TKS, the absence of manned launches, although all the necessary permits for manned flights were obtained, are primarily associated not with the ship itself, but with its Proton carrier rocket. <br>  The toxicity of the Proton LV fuel (asymmetric dimethylhydrazine known as heptyl and nitrogen tetroxide) is used at all rocket levels is higher than that of the Phosgen type chemical warfare agent, therefore any accident at the start could lead to the death of the entire crew. <br>  The leadership of the space industry has not decided on manned launches on the Proton, either as part of the lunar program or under the Almaz program. <br>  But this did not prevent the TKS-y from serving the cosmonautics quite well even after the official closure of the program - the remaining ships were converted into Mir station modules, and one, called Zarya, is still in orbit as part of the ISS. <br><br><h4>  Sources: </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/236/41.shtml">www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/236/41.shtml</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/238/33.shtml">www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/238/33.shtml</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/244/39.shtml">www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/244/39.shtml</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80 %D1%82 %D0BB%D1 % 8B% D0% B9_% D0% BA% D0% BE% D1% 80% D0% B0% D0% B1% D0% BB% D1% 8C_% D1% 81% D0% BD% D0% B0% D0% B1 % D0% B6% D0% B5% D0% BD% D0% B8% D1% 8F</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7_%2528%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B7_%28%D0%BE%D1%80% D0%B1%D0% B8% D1%82 % D0% B0% D0% BB% D1% 8C% D0% BD% D0% B0% D1% 8F_% D1% 81% D1% 82% D0% B0% D0% BD% D1% 86% D0% B8% D1 % 8F% 29</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.astronaut.ru/bookcase/books/afanasiev2/text/11.htm">www.astronaut.ru/bookcase/books/afanasiev2/text/11.htm</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.astronaut.ru/bookcase/books/afanasiev2/text/12.htm">www.astronaut.ru/bookcase/books/afanasiev2/text/12.htm</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82748/</a></p>
