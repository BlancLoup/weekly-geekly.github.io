In the new version of Android, a test function has been added, the runtime ART. <br>  On Habr√©, this has already been written: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/201346/">ART is replacing Dalvik</a> .  I switched to this runtime environment and found some bugs that I would like to talk about.  Who cares, I ask under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After installing the ART runtime, I did not feel any changes in my device.  If the speed of the animation in the device changed, it was not noticeable to my eye.  Filling the device allows you to use it in the Dalvik runtime environment without any glitches and brakes.  But I wanted to believe that ART is faster than Dalvik and that in some games and applications it will be noticeable and I believed in it, because I used this test function.

    <h2>  Bug # 1 </h2><br>  Not all applications on my device from the Play Market, I also have some cracked games installed, for example The Room, and if some applications fell on the screen too hard or just wrote a mistake another time - I didn‚Äôt pay attention.  Well, this is Android, I thought, it‚Äôs more likely to have its programs falling than, for example, in iOS.  Although Google is taking swift steps to solve these problems, they still exist and they are not small.  As a result, after installing the cracked Navitel 8.7 (before that, I somehow used Navital 5 and Navitel 7, I just wanted to have an offline navigator, but then I had a mobile Internet, I switched to Yandex Navigator and forgot about Navitel).  Navitel 8.7 fell when trying to find a building at: as soon as you hit the keyboard, the application crashes.  Navitel also fell when trying to enter regional settings.  I tried to install the application from the Play Market, but the error did not disappear.  I wrote to the support service and rummaged from the Internet.  it turned out that the problem was in the ARM runtime.  It would be possible to wait until Navitel corrects the problem or simply to score on this navigator, if not the feeling that not only Navitel can fall on ART. <br><br><h2>  Bug # 2 </h2><br>  I drive a car and sometimes I need a BlueTooth headset.  I had one simple headset, but later the girl gave me a slightly better headset (Jabra).  Yes, China, but it was important for me that there was a microUSB charging, there was a battery indicator and it showed that there is a connection.  In general, the headset as a headset and should work on all devices without complaints, but it was not there.  Some conversations on the headset were excellent, but in some conversations the signal was lost.  That is, I did not hear the interlocutor, but the interlocutor did not hear me, while a signal was sounded on the Android device (pii-pii).  I could not understand what was going on, but with the headset everything was obviously OK.  I tried to connect to other devices.  As a result, when I returned to the Dalvik runtime, this problem was gone. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Suddenly, someone also had similar problems, perhaps you will also be helped back by Dalvik.  There are rumors on the Internet about a possible update of Android 4.4.3, which will be sent to remove the glitches of the previous version and, perhaps, this will also solve glitches with ART.  Let's hope and wait.  If you had any problems with ART, please write in the comments, we will further develop this topic. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219019/</a></p>
