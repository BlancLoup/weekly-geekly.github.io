  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Principle of relativity ‚Ñ¢</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/parables/42824/">this</a> topic. <br><br><h4>  Part I. </h4><br>  In the very topic of the parable, the answer of the ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù to the student, illustrates the following thought: <br><blockquote>  - How true are the words that happiness is not in money? <br>  He (the master) replied that they were completely correct.  And to prove it is simple. <br>  For money you can buy a bed, but not a dream;  food, but not appetite;  medication, but not health;  servants, but not friends;  women, but not love;  housing, but not home;  fun, but not fun;  education but not mind. <br></blockquote><br>  In the comments, I allowed myself to write a continuation of this parable, illustrating the following thought: <br><blockquote>  the second student approached the same Master and asked: <br>  - Is it true that without money life is not life? <br>  The master replied: <br>  true.  and it's easy to prove.  sleeping in bed is more comfortable than without it.  hunger without food is not quenched.  a disease without a cure cannot be cured.  love loves wealth.  hearth is impossible without dwelling.  joy is rare without entertainment.  Few people teach you for free. <br></blockquote><br>  And now, attention, question: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Who is the master who makes the grass green ?! <br><img src="http://mind13.org/_out/prometej_image43.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Part II. </h4><br>  We ask questions to this mysterious master, and we get the answers that follow from these questions. <br><blockquote>  According to Dr. Leonard Orr, the human brain behaves as if it consisted of two parts: the Thinker and the Prover.  A thinker can think of almost everything.  As history has shown, he may think that the Earth rests on the backs of endless turtles, or that it is empty inside, or that it is floating in space.  (c) R.A. Wilson. <br></blockquote><br>  Accordingly, it is very important to be able to ask the right questions, and to understand that what you get is just the answer to your question, and nothing more.

    <h4>  Part III. </h4><br>  Actually, about the crisis: <br><blockquote>  One Frenchman moved to America and took up the wholesale trade in French wines.  His firm flourished, grew and became very famous.  By the 25th anniversary of the company, he gave a big celebration, to which numerous distinguished guests and journalists were invited.  One of them asked him a tricky question: <br>  - You managed to organize your business, in the years of the global economic crisis, to put the firm on its feet and expand it.  What is your success system? <br>  ‚ÄúYou will laugh at me,‚Äù the Frenchman replied, ‚Äúif I tell you this.‚Äù  In the first years after my arrival in America, my knowledge of the English language was so meager that I could not read the newspapers at all.  Therefore, I knew absolutely nothing about the crisis. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  UPD. </h4><br>  To the question of the name of the topic.  Pay attention to how different comments on this topic.  Even opinions about what this post is diametrically opposite would seem to be.  This is an illustration of the Principle of Relativity.  A bunch of subjective opinions about one thing. <br><br>  <strike>Objective</strike> A more objective (less subjective) opinion is made up of many subjective ones.  It is like inspecting an object from all sides - from above, from below, from the side, studying the different opinions of different people (belief systems, points of view).  The result is a more holistic, more objective picture. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42827/</a></p>
