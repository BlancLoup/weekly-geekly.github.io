They met at noon, but did not stop, but each continued to walk at the same speed, and the first came ( ) at 4 pm and the second (at A) at 9 pm.  What time was dawn on that day? <br><br>  I suggest you <a href="">listen to (MP3)</a> discussion of this problem on the <a href="http://govoritmoskva.ru/">radio ‚ÄúMoscow speaks‚Äù</a> (S.Dorenko, A.Onoshko), and try to solve it, before crawling under the cat, to compare ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first option: the system of equations</b> <br>  This is how I solved it, first writing a system of equations like this (s is the distance from A to B, x is the time from dawn to noon): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aff/500/a71/aff500a71efb4107bc3f25a5fd397c6b.png"><br><br>  I did not succeed for a long time to solve either it or a similar system (there were always one more unknowns than equations, and it didn‚Äôt work out to get rid of the extra).  Finally, writing a system of two equations for the distances of AO and OB (O is the meeting point at noon): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ad/a2c/49f/5ada2c49f1874a56830a573863c2d77b.png">  , <br>  managed to get rid of the "extra" unknowns (velocities), multiplying the left and right sides of the two equations.  As a result, the product of speeds was reduced, and from the remaining equation t <sup>2</sup> = 36, the time sought was easily found: <br>  12-t = 6.

      I must say that I was busy for an hour or two, and then, a few days later, when I returned to the task, I completely got confused and went to the Internet to get a solution, where I found ... <br><br>  <b>Second option: proportion</b> <br><br>  Since the task is ‚Äúchildish‚Äù, the solution is quite childish.  If we make a proportion of the lengths of the segments of the AO / OB path in terms of the first and second old women, we obtain: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f65/33c/17e/f6533c17e29f4f3f845cbde88866af23.png">  , <br>  whence immediately follows the equation t <sup>2</sup> = 36.  (Even speeds are not needed in proportion, it is enough to understand that the length of the path is proportional to time). <br><br>  Thus, an elementary school student can also solve the problem: this is a typical olympiad problem, which I hate since childhood (I have to, at least, kill a lot of time to find a solution).  Meanwhile, the task is simple, and, if viewed from a practical point of view (getting an answer, rather than finding an elegant solution, which is undoubtedly option 2), today I would use ... <br><br>  <b>The third option: a quick numerical solution.</b> <br>  I will give it in the form of a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nerepetitor/blog/247999/">Mathcad</a> document: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a56/fb3/3d1/a56fb33d1b29408d89a972db2fd26242.png"><br><br>  First, the initial approximations to the unknowns are specified (including the estimated value taken from the ceiling, s = 20 km).  Then the standard numerical algorithm searches for a solution to the very system of equations that we wrote out at the very beginning, taking only a couple of minutes.  Here s is considered as an unknown variable, resulting in a result equal to the initial approximation of 20 km. <br><br>  Repeating the calculations for a series of different reasonable s, we find that the solution for s remains equal to the initial approximation, and the desired time x is always 6 hours.  This is a very strict solution to the problem (since it is easy to scan the entire interval of reasonable distances AB), which, I confess, I like the most, although it looks a bit dull. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will give the same calculations for s = 50 km (and using units of measurement in the calculations): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d64/8e4/753/d648e47535bb45fdb4829e982d68667d.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255061/</a></p>
