In the first film, ‚Äúsurrogate‚Äù is a humanoid robot that completely replaces a human being and is operated by an operator located at home through a special ‚Äúterminal‚Äù.  In the film Avatar, the carrier of human intelligence is a biorobot made from human DNA and the DNA of an alien humanoid creature, completely subordinate to the will of the remote operator.  But back to reality. <br><br>  Have you ever had cases when you needed to be in two or even three places at the same time?  We live in the age of high technology, when it is difficult to surprise a person with any new technology.  And, of course, the issue of remote presence in our day has long been resolved.  Let not to the extent that we can see in science fiction films. <br><br>  Today I will talk about the remote presence of the RBot 100 domestic manufacturer, since I managed to touch it myself, to see what was happening.  It allows you to be remotely in a meeting, exhibition, school (yes, even such an application is possible).  How it works, what it can do, where it applies and whether it can be rented or purchased - all of this is below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d0/66d/aaa/8d066daaa5e7d9b62c297f637a0dcfe2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A little about Western counterparts.</b> <br>  Among similar Western solutions, Anybots and their latest QB model are worth mentioning.  The first model of the robot, the Anybots QA device, appeared in 2008.  The height of the robot - 152 cm, weight - 25 pounds.  The cost of the Anybots QA model is $ 30 thousand. A more modern model, Anybots QB, is now at the testing stage.  The QB model weighs only 16 kilograms, and its cost is from $ 10 thousand to $ 15 thousand. It moves according to the principle of operation of the Segway device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/810/9df/fcd/8109dffcd623addc6e92b8d75aaa67d1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Jazz, presented by the French company Gostai, is a meter-high machine consisting of a ‚Äúbody‚Äù and a ‚Äúhead‚Äù and moving on wheels. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/285/c76/c52/285c76c523a55cb3f7d974c087ed6719.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Tilr from RoboDynamics.  The robot looks like a flat monitor.  A feature of the TiLR is that its camera moves independently of the body of the robot itself.

      <b>Russian robot</b> <br>  R.Bot is the first Russian robot that allows you to provide remote operator presence in the place where the robot is located via the Internet.  Being at his computer, the operator can easily control the movement of the robot and communicate with other people through multimedia capabilities.  Management is carried out via the 802.11 b / g WiFi protocol.  The robot is equipped with a built-in camera with a resolution of up to 640x480 (more advanced cameras are used for medical purposes), a highly sensitive microphone and stereo speakers.  A distinctive feature of the domestic manufacturer is the ability to turn around its axis and turn its head in the desired direction.  The operator interface provides for both controlling the movement of the robot in space and changing the position of its head. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/222/662/40b/22266240b85d888c4f39f4a2ad31a325.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Unlike QB, RBot moves based on three wheels - two leading ones, one small for stability.  The first robots moved at a speed of 1.9 km / h, but not so long ago the company finalized the mobile platform and is ready to offer robots with a speed of 4.6 km / h.  At the same time, the new platform makes much less noise.  By the way, when used in medical institutions, the new platform is almost never used.  Imagine a grandmother who suddenly sees a robot quietly passing by near ... the consequences can be unpredictable, including such as in this video: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAKBr9PrzMo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIs_gzm71i8S2gXfJcmUIOfb9LEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The robot can be equipped with an LCD touch screen, thanks to which interactive interaction between the operator and, for example, exhibition visitors is possible.  It is worth mentioning the operating time of the RBot 100. On average, it is 8 hours, after which the robot must be sent to the outdoor charging base (I wonder when he will look for the base in automatic mode, like iRobot Roomba?).  The height of the RBot is about 1 meter, and the diameter of the base is 55 cm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/707/ecd/134/707ecd134910e51a93e5f0da2ec08ad3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There is a modification with hands, due to the complexity of the maintenance and repair of additional nodes, the manufacturer temporarily does not produce such models. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed8/6fd/c1f/ed86fdc1f91c3d7f6595cc1fa80dca12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Application</b> <br>  Telepresence systems are constantly evolving and in the near future, with a decrease in the cost of equipment, will be used everywhere.  The main purpose of the robots-telepresence - remote participation in the meetings of large companies.  The main foreign companies position their products in this way.  RBot also went a little different way.  In particular, it has long been actively used at trade shows to attract customers.  Such developments for many more new, which allows you to gather a crowd of people next to the robot, and therefore your booth.  For these purposes, additional trays with flyers can be hung on the robot, a sticker can be made, or the case painted in the colors of the company. <br><br>  Theoretically, remote presence robots can be used in completely different areas of activity.  For example, in medicine.  Such robots can be remotely controlled by workers during operations, or as a caretaker. <br><br>  Here is an interesting RBot application.  In the video below, the student could not be in the classroom due to illness.  He came to the aid of a robot. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rIiCkdwZO9Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-fM8Cv0v50PBtuv6MJaMSCpm4KQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Robots can be used as room guards (it is more accurate to say an observer, while the gas cartridge and the stun gun were not attached).  In particular, Jazz Gostai has such a modification, which is characterized by the presence of a night vision camera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37f/6f6/5a1/37f6f65a17201289d62a21ace5f7538b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Where is such a miracle to take?</b> <br>  The Russian manufacturer rents a robot RBot for rent for various periods of time, ranging from 3 hours to days.  In an interview with the manufacturer, it turned out that in exceptional cases such a robot can be purchased at a price that is several times less than foreign counterparts.  The price is not announced and in each case is negotiated separately.  But the main thing is that if you really fired up to get such a miracle, nothing is impossible.  You can order a robot, both on the website of the <a href="http://www.rbot.ru/">RBot</a> manufacturer and from partners, in Moscow a robot shop: <a href="http://roboticslab.ru/">RoboticsLab</a> , in St. Petersburg a robot shop: <a href="http://nanojam.ru/">NanoJam</a> .  And in the case of an order through partners, you can get an additional discount. <br><br>  If the robot is ordered in order to participate in the exhibition, the manufacturer provides with its full support, including: delivery, configuration, full support during the event, etc. <br><br>  The cost of production of such products remains high due to the lack of an established conveyor system.  So far, the robots are assembled by hand.  But after some 5-10 years, we will be able to purchase such a miracle of technology for no substantial cash outlay. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118374/</a></p>
