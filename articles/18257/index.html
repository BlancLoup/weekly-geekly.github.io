  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Looking for a job for a project manager (Moscow) - Part II - U-Soft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first interview was on December 13th at U-Soft.  We were invited to the interview while I was in Novosibirsk; after the vacancy we talked with a nice girl - assistant to the personnel manager. <br><br>  U-Soft company is initially engaged in consulting and helps to implement Consultant Plus.  Their site is <a href="http://www.usoft.ru/">usoft.ru</a> .  Within the company there is a division (separate legal entity?) U-Soft consulting, which works from the web.  Their site is <a href="http://www.u-soft.ru/">u-soft.ru</a> .  In general, quite confusing naming for sites - I think I'm not the only one that gets confused :). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A job description for a <a href="http://usoft.ru/vacancies/rukovod_web/">project manager</a> is on usoft.  The requirements are written very loyally (men / women, high school, current institutions, experience in project management, knowledge of the technology of creating websites; welcome experience in a web studio), but the word ‚Äúmanager‚Äù is a bit alarming.  Of course, there is no fundamental difference between the ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù and the ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù, but nevertheless the manager assumes more skills and experience than the manager.  Well, since U-Soft themselves came to me, this question did not bother me too much.

      The meeting with U-Soft began with filling out the questionnaire.  Unpleasantly surprised a couple of moments: <br><ul><li>  computer literacy question.  in other questionnaires I saw this question also in the form - ‚Äúwhat programs do you have‚Äù.  Of course, you can take the Debian repository and start writing out all the familiar programs - but why? <br>  The questionnaire is again aimed at work experience, and not at realized projects.  Projects are significantly more important in IT than formal attributes like education and company time. <br>  After filling out the questionnaire, I had to wait almost an hour in anticipation of the head of the studio, who met with the client.  It is unpleasant - but if it took you almost an hour to get to the office, then you can probably wait.  In addition, the first interview. <br><br>  The interview focused more on work processes (what they did, in what sequence) than on projects.  From the questions I remember - did MS Visio use to draw software interfaces?  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdoing so is certainly not a bad one - but I always preferred to simply register the list of functional elements in the technical task.  Simply by drawing the elements, you already pre-arrange them in some kind of visual order and set the basic tone of the designer with this.  And this is just the job of the designer to locate the controls so that it is convenient. <br><br>  A good question was about CustomCMS (we used them on several projects) and the possibilities for further development of such sites, but in our work we made websites on CustomCMS if it was immediately clear that the site does not imply significant functionality, and used Bitrix or OpenSource for serious projects. <br><br>  The interview ended on the fact that in fact there are 3 possibilities of working with the company: <br><ul><li>  Transfer all current and future projects to create websites (in large quantities online shopping), but then the question arises confidence in the qualifications of the future project manager.  In my opinion, this question was not solved in U-Soft.  Or just my experience is not enough to cause such trust - but I have already spoken about this. <br>  Transfer me projects that need to be done through freelancers, in particular, complex flash projects.  But in this case, it is not clear why working with U-Soft.  If a person is so talented that he is ready to do large projects worth&gt; $ 10,000 completely through freelancers, then it‚Äôs time for him to organize his web studio. <br>  Work as an account manager and engage in contextual advertising.  Yes, I can do it and I can (there is even a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/begun/">Runner</a> certificate, which I have never been sent by mail!), But this is of no interest to me.  If I decided to move away from contextual advertising and search promotion in the direction of web development - then we need to go there and move <br>  After the interview, we agreed that we will contact in a week if there is interest.  I left the phone on which I did not call.  In my opinion, and after the interview, everything was clear, but in a week my opinion did not change. <br><br>  Pros: the first interview in the last 2 years - and how many of them have yet to be and how many you will read :) <br>  Cons: not the company, not the vacancy. <br><br>  PS <ol><li>  In my favorite Novosibirsk we have already written about the <a href="http://bonin.ru/post/161">upcoming multi-volume :) ballad about interviews</a> <br>  <a href="http://leonid.habrahabr.ru/blog/33252.html">First part, introductory</a> </li></ol></li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18257/</a></p>
