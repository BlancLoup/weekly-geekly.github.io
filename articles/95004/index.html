      <br>
      But first things first. <br><br><h2>  Understanding the role of the brain </h2><br>  There is no ignorance worse than ignorance about yourself. <br><br>  The brain controls almost everything in our body - from breathing, the work of the senses to complex thought processes and imagination.  There are many methods and development tips, however, as I have seen, few emphasize the role of the brain in the process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The brain is a well-studied organ, and, having knowledge of the brain, one can understand how certain techniques affect the brain and whether to use them.  In addition, you can develop your own approaches based not on theoretical reasoning, but on scientific knowledge. <br><br><h2>  Nutrition </h2><br>  The brain is an extremely energy-demanding organ.  Therefore, food should be uniform throughout the day, and include very special substances.  There are many of them and they are different, but on the whole, proteins, complex carbohydrates, and omega-three fats are recommended.  For example, my breakfast usually consists of apple and scrambled eggs (sometimes from pieces of fish), lunch - from vegetables / fruits and meat, dinner - also from vegetables and meat.  I also drink vitamins every day, drink plenty of water (about 2-3 liters) and 2-4 cups of green tea. <br><br>  Here it must be said that the power and work of the brain are directly related.  If you deal with other things while eating, the food will not be absorbed, since for full digestion you need to perceive all the senses, and allow the brain to focus on this complex process. <br><br>  Also, if you eat a lot at once, the brain will not receive energy properly and run smoothly.  You can compare with fire - or you keep the fire uniform, throwing a little firewood over a certain amount of time;  or wait until everything burns down, then again throw a heap over the coals and rekindle the fire again, wasting too much time and having an unevenly distributed flame. <br><br>  In addition, as I will write later, a healthy diet makes it easy to perform physical activities, and it is very useful for the brain. <br><br>  Therefore, food should be taken very carefully - it is necessary that the volume of food at a time is small, the food itself should be filled with energy evenly throughout the day. <br><br><h2>  Environment </h2><br>  First of all, air.  In addition to food, which we deal with every day (remember the Parerto rule, that 20% of the causes give 80% of the result?), It is very important that the air we breathe is full of oxygen.  Therefore, it is necessary to ventilate the room, if possible, to sleep with the window open, and periodically do gymnastics with deep breathing. <br><br>  Secondly, the order.  Oddly enough, it is the order outside that allows you to put things in order inside.  In this order, I call this state of the surrounding objects and people when the situation is not annoying.  Sometimes, however, aggression is hidden - let's say, the presence of order is determined by whether you want to be in a certain situation or not. <br><br>  Further, this is the number of distracting and annoying factors, and the number of relaxing and inspiring.  They each have their own, but usually the first group includes extra noise, unpleasant odors, uncomfortable furniture, randomly arranged objects in the field of view, too bright or dim light, too bright or faded colors around, and so on.  It should be noted that the brain is able to adapt and ignore them to constantly available factors - like noise from a window.  And for others, such as repairs beyond the wall, it is very difficult for him to adapt. <br>  And as for the inspiring factors - they each have their own. <br>  In general, you need to keep this in mind and strive to create such an environment around yourself that it was easy to concentrate <br><br><h2>  Sleep </h2><br>  Sleep is one of the most important factors for healthy brain function.  The following points can be highlighted: <br><ul><li>  Sleep should be enough.  On average, it is 7-8 hours of sleep without waking up </li><li>  Sleeping should be such that you can fall asleep after 15 minutes in bed. </li><li>  Sleep should be in a decent setting.  Fresh air, darkness, silence is desirable. </li><li>  Sleep should coincide with the internal clock of the person (usually starts before 12 at night and ends at 6-10 am). </li></ul><br><br>  I try to sleep for 8-10 hours and get up early in the morning. <br><br><h2>  Physical exercise </h2><br>  They say harmony is the lack of imbalance.  In this case, talking about the fact that for the brain the best rest is a change of activity, for example, a change of mental activity to physical.  I have a setting in Ubuntu that blocks the computer for ten minutes after every fifty, and I have to go and take a walk.  (the ratio in the region of 10-50 is established by science and recommended for those working at a computer).  Every evening I try to take a walk in the fresh air for at least half an hour, or take a bike ride (1-1.5 hours). <br>  I also like push-ups in between activities, work with dumbbells. <br><br>  In addition, exercise during the day plays the following roles.  First, as a means to maintain the body in an active state - physical activity increases the temperature of the body, and the brain works better.  Secondly, it relieves psychological stress - it is known that muffled emotions turn into clips in the body, physical loads and sports remove it along with stress, and so on.  Thirdly, regular exercise leads to the production of endorphins - the hormones of joy and happiness - and thus the person engaged during the day improves his mood.  Therefore, by the way, charging so invigorates well - accelerates blood, as they say. <br><br>  A lot more there.  For example, switching and going for a walk, you give the task to your subconscious, which will solve it better than you.  In addition, regular exercise keeps the body in good shape and allows you to look as slim as you decide. <br><br>  Thus, a regular combination of the usual activities for the computer with different physical culture dramatically increases the efficiency of work and life in general. <br><br>  On my own - skating regularly for at least 5 hours a week, doing different physical activities, and quitting drinking alcohol in general, I was sick for only six weeks during these six months.  Against a month at least earlier. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  Everyone probably read the articles when long-livers are less likely to lose their mind if they work and are engaged in intellectual work.  And this is true, and at any age - if the brain is not developed, then it begins to grow stale, figuratively speaking.  The brain is our most important talent, and we must be sensitive to it. <br><br>  For a good state of his brain, it is advisable to regularly teach any new activities in various fields, mental and physical.  In this case, over a long period - from a month to a year.  A very good influence on the brain: the development of new complex physical actions (dance, martial art, a new sport), music, the development of new languages. <br><br><h2>  Perception of the world </h2><br>  The brain perceives the world in a distorted way, and it is very important to know and constantly know.  The square picture at the beginning of the article is an example of this. <br><br>  However, the distortions in perception at the level of consciousness are much stronger (I already wrote about this in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/91904/">‚ÄúModels of reality and their role in people's lives‚Äù</a> ).  In fact, it is these distortions that cause more conflicts and misunderstandings around the world.  That is why it is important to always question both the facts and truths coming from outside, as well as beliefs and ideas about the world and about oneself. <br><br>  For me personally, the following case was a revelation.  I always thought crows were cunning, and, seeing these birds, I searched and found something tricky in their behavior.  One day, passing by several birds, I looked into the eyes of the crow - and found nothing cunning, nothing human;  only an incomprehensible feeling remains.  And I understood that by giving the object some properties in my mind, I began to see it in the same way in reality.  Since then, I have been trying to constantly overestimate people, understanding that current perceptions may be erroneous. <br><br>  This consideration can be made to work for oneself as follows.  Realizing that you can control your perception of reality, and that it will always be incomplete, shape it to your liking.  Take what you don‚Äôt like ‚Äî people, work, home, and so on ‚Äî then find the positives, and strive to further perceive the events related to the phenomenon in question only in a positive way.  And, having convinced yourself that what is happening is positive and useful in some sense (even learning how to joke about this topic), you will notice how your attitude will change to a positive one - previously unloved people will like it, respect for them will appear;  tedious tasks will arouse interest and sparkle with new colors. <br><br>  And if you didn‚Äôt see a positive look, then again, you are able to change not only the model of the phenomenon in your brain, but also the reality.  Just change what is annoying for what is desired - yes, you have to make an effort, but it's worth it. <br>  I quit smoking and drinking that is why - the positive moments were harder to find, and the losses in the form of money, health, time were obvious and negative for my life. <br><br>  As a result, we can say that the constant and active development of new fields of activity comprehensively influences a person in a positive way - both on his outlook, respect for himself, for his personality, awareness of his versatility, and on the brain, which generously thanks they give him new food for the mind, as they say. <br><br><h2>  Character development </h2><br>  In the last section, I slightly touched, and here I will try to more fully reveal the topic of work on myself.  It turns out that almost 100% of a person‚Äôs life is the work of his hands, or rather his brain.  Our thoughts are what determines our actions and our character.  It can be said that responsibility for almost all aspects of a person‚Äôs life lies on him, whether he realizes this or not. <br><br>  Practical moments that turned out to be useful to me (I continue to work on the big ones now): <br><ul><li>  Speech control.  We hear almost everything we say.  And if we constantly repeat something out loud, we soon begin to believe it ourselves, and with our actions do it in reality.  It means that if you constantly tell others that you are sick and hear your own words yourself, you will eventually fall ill;  the same thing about the lack of time - time will be missed, and so on.  Therefore, I try to speak confidently, positively, and little. </li><li>  The control of thoughts is all the same.  It is thoughts that determine lifestyle, and right thinking immediately gives a huge advantage over 95% of people who do not know about it.  It is difficult for me, but I try different ways - from meditation for relaxation, music for creating a positive attitude, a notebook and psychological readiness for generating ideas, to volitional efforts to curb thoughts of excitement, failure, anxiety, fear, and so on. </li><li>  Emotional control.  You can choose which one to surf.  ¬© Jonatan M√•rtensson.  A sense of humor helps a lot - I always try in a sad position to recall some anecdote or aphorism to smile.  It also helps to be calm, for example, in the queue at Sberbank - over time, I began to wonder why people are so annoyed by waiting.  The fact is that emotions are poorly compatible with concentration and concentrated mental work, therefore it is worth learning how to control oneself in order to let the brain work in full force. </li><li>  Volitional qualities, leadership qualities.  Perseverance, will, the ability to go to the end, patience - it helps a lot.  Once I solved an 8-hour ‚Äúzavalny‚Äù task of an oral VIC exam, in order to post a decision on the forum and get satisfaction with myself.  Useful quality helps to achieve results and enjoy them. </li><li>  Ability to communicate.  I began my life as a black sheep, and at school it was difficult to communicate, was a closed and depressed person.  Over time, he made himself optimistic, cheerful, and learned to find a common language with almost any people.  It all came down to the development of adequacy and the ability to listen to the interlocutor in combination with empathy, and of course - the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpractice. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Literature </h2><br>  I read a lot, but from books you can always pick out the ones that influenced me the most. <br><ul><li>  Robert Anthony, "The Secrets of Self-Confidence."  The book, after which I quit drinking, moved out from my parents, and in general the hair became smooth and silky :) Seriously, the book was in some way comparable to ‚ÄúPerfect Code‚Äù for me to the density of useful information and detail.  It has recipes for uprooting almost all types of cockroaches - low self-esteem, feelings of guilt, subjectivity and condemnation of other people, fears, feelings of loneliness, and so on. </li><li>  Matthew Macdonald, "Teach your brain to work."  Scientific substantiation of the many points that I read about in other books and articles, in tch.  Anthony's books.  Everything in detail and with taste. </li><li>  Timothy Ferris, "How to work 4 hours a week."  Infected by optimism, approach to life, and just attitude to time management. </li></ul><br><br>  A list of three books, in fact there were hundreds of them.  Even in Asimov‚Äôs science fiction and the works of Hesse there is always something to think about and change in yourself or the world around you. <br><br>  I wish you success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95004/</a></p>
