  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warranty Service Logitech - this is horosho</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll start from the very beginning - a couple of years ago I got into racing simulators.  Of course, by chance - I just wanted to try F1 2012. I tried.  On the keyboard, it seemed complete nonsense, and I decided that even an inexpensive steering wheel would allow this simulator to unfold in front of me in all its glory.  In practice, this was never a simulator, and even more, but it's not about that.  So, having googled and smoked many, many forums on this topic, it was decided to buy an old but good Logitech Momo from the hands.  On Avito, we managed to find several options, and the first of them turned out to be successful - almost new, dusting in the corner, for 1,500 rubles - just a dream! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/9fd/a4c/d939fda4c1db478c85b3074457ff0a87.jpg"><br><br>  So a couple of months passed, I forgot about F1 2012 long ago, at first Assetto Corsa got carried away, but then got hooked (and still sit tight) on iRacing.  And everything was good, I was learning, building up, so to speak, a skill, but the steering wheel interfered with the transition from simpler and slower to faster and more complicated cars - the design is still outdated, an angle of 240 degrees ... As a result, I gave myself a birthday on my own advice friends beautiful thing - Logitech G27.  It was even before the last financial crisis, plus it hit the share of a major seller of equipment, eventually bought it for only 8,000 rubles.  Logitech Momo, by the way, did not disappear and was bought for the same money all through the same Avito as a brave 56-year-old retiree from nearby villages who planned to diversify his pension by traveling with tangerines in Euro Truck Simulator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everything was fine, but this summer I noticed that the center had already become too empty and the feedback was very weak.  It should be noted that the empty center is characteristic of this model (as well as the predecessor of the G25), and the settings of the simulator can be smoothed over, but not completely removed.  In my case, these things were already very pronounced, and the suspicion about the demise of one of the engines in the steering wheel crept in (there are two of them).

      Comrades in arms (and in general comrades) have already managed to whisper about the affectionate and silk technical support of the company Logitech.  At least, she easily changed the mouse-keyboards with new ones sent from sunny Holland.  So, on September 9, 2015 at 4 pm 18 minutes (+5 GMT) I called technical support.  I explained everything as it was, listened to the girl with a slight accent, made a request to the support service and said that further instructions would be sent to the post office.  The instructions came and read the following: <br><br><blockquote>  Please provide S / N or P / N numbers and PID, which are indicated on the back of the device. <br><br>  Please follow the troubleshooting steps and let us know the results. <br><br>  Uninstall and re-install Logitech Gaming Software. <br><br>  The G27 racing steering wheel has a built-in temperature sensor that stops or reduces feedback if the G27 steering wheel heats up too much.  This prevents damage to the steering wheel.  To prevent the sensor from activating, follow these steps: <br><br>  Do not block or interfere with the heat holes in the upper part of the G27 steering wheel. <br><br>  Do not use the G27 steering wheel in a room that is too warm or where it is in direct sunlight. <br><br>  Make sure all cables are properly connected. <br><br>  Try connecting to a different power source. <br><br>  Check the steering wheel on another computer. </blockquote><br>  I registered at support.logitech.com, uploaded a photo of the receipt from the store and filled out the serial number of the steering wheel in my profile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f19/1bc/194/f191bc194a5a4d909de43c3398d92355.jpg"><br><br>  Days after a few replied the following: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello.  I fulfilled all the recommendations - I reconnected everything, reinstalled the Logitech software, tried to turn the steering wheel into another computer - into the laptop, opened the window and thoroughly aired the room (in general we had a very cold summer and it was not hot in principle - I live in Tyumen) .  I did not notice the changes.  I must note that a couple of weeks ago I practically did all this already - I reinstalled the system, switching from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Everything remained the same. </blockquote><br>  The answer was almost lightning, i.e.  after 4 days: <br><br><blockquote>  Please specify if this problem appears in all games. <br><br>  Windows 10 - on all computers on which you tested the device?  The problem began to appear after upgrading the operating system or was it before you switched from 7 to 10? </blockquote><br>  I sustained a Mkhatov break in one day and spoke to the tech support service as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  Good day.  The problem is in Windows 10 and Windows 7 on a regular computer (desktop) and Windows 10 on a laptop, in iRacing and Assetto Corsa games.  On other computers and systems check, unfortunately, there is no possibility. </blockquote><br>  After 6 days (I just rolled onto Turkish beaches), mobile Yandex Mail brought me the following message on my mobile wings: <br><br><blockquote>  For further consideration of your application, please provide: <br><br>  - photos of the device from different angles;  One of the photos should show the PID or S / N, P / N, M / N numbers on the device. <br><br>  All photos in the frame should contain application number 01096333, written by hand on a piece of paper <br><br>  Please send only photos in .jpeg format. <br><br>  Please note that we can deliver only to certain cities in Russia: Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br>  If you do not live in one of them, please specify if you can provide the address of a trustee who will accept the package in case of replacement of the device. </blockquote><br>  I was wary, right in the middle of the Turkish beach.  The mention of ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù was alarmed, although it wasn‚Äôt stated what, but I sensed that a possible replacement of the steering wheel with a new one is possible (pun intended).  Arriving home, I made and uploaded the required photo onto the site and clarified the address of the trustee (my brother) living in North Palmyra. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/5e9/1d0/3845e91d060743ae9ab2dede49b3bc90.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  Hello.  I took a photo with a numbered application and uploaded them here.  In addition, photos are available here: <a href="https://yadi.sk/">yadi.sk</a> ********.  As for the trustee, my brother lives in St. Petersburg, his data ********. </blockquote><br>  Of course, there were several photos, but I think one is enough.  After 4 days, the Internet connection brought the following text: <br><br><blockquote>  Thank you for providing information.  Your application will be reviewed by the warranty department within 3-4 business days.  We will inform you about the result. </blockquote><br>  Many days passed, more precisely, 14, but nothing happened.  I decided to call, talked with tech support, and, oh miracle, the answer immediately came (by the way, I advise you, as you write the answer, call me back immediately, everything will happen much faster): <br><br><blockquote> We can replace your device under warranty.  However, I have to warn you about some things. <br><br>  We can replace your device with a G29 steering wheel.  Since replacements are sent from Holland and the price of the device + delivery is more than 200 euros, the customs of Russia has the right to require you to clear the goods and fill out some documents.  They may also require an extra charge for this. <br><br>  In connection with the above, we can offer, instead of sending the helm, you can choose any other devices for a total amount of up to 350 euros from our website <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-roeu/home">www.logitech.com/en-roeu/home</a> (The offer does not work with already discounted products - please look at the full device cost).  We will be able to send the selected devices to you either in two different parcels with an interval of several days, or to two different addresses in order not to exceed the customs quota of 200 euros. <br><br>  When choosing the second option, send me a list of selected devices with a price, for example <br><br>  1. Performance Mouse MX - ... EUR <br><br>  2. ... <br><br>  Please note that the Z906, Z506, Z5500 and Z623 speakers are not delivered to Russia due to their dimensions. <br><br>  Regardless of the option that you choose, for the replacement design, we need: <br><br>  1. In response to this letter, please confirm that you and your authorized representative agree, if necessary, to complete a customs declaration and provide additional information that will be requested by the UPS courier company and that you have read the following information: <br><br>  Due to changes in customs processes, delivery may be delayed.  Please note that you or your authorized representative may need to complete a customs declaration to receive the parcel.  In this case, the courier company UPS will send you or your authorized representative an SMS with a link to the form, which must be filled in by providing a copy of identity documents. <br><br>  This form is not provided by Logitech, it is sent to the courier company UPS, if it deems necessary, as soon as the package arrives in the territory of the Russian Federation.  This form is a statement of the recipient of the parcel, in which he confirms that the product is not the subject of commercial activity and is not intended for sale, but is a guarantee replacement. <br><br>  2. Proof of destruction of defective device.  Please provide a photo showing that the device is not suitable for further use.  The photograph in the frame should contain the application number 01096333, written out by hand on a sheet of paper.  Method of destruction at your discretion, the main thing - do not harm yourself and others. <br><br>  You must save the defective device until you receive a replacement.  The replacement is covered by the original device warranty. </blockquote><br>  I did not like both points - and about the possible customs duty, and about the fact that the device still needs to be destroyed and photographed this sadism.  I called, asked how you would advise to destroy, to which the guys were even slightly scared and answered that now the party‚Äôs policy is such that they cannot advise exactly how it‚Äôs important that I don‚Äôt cause damage to myself.  In previous years, as the study of the situation showed, all the same advice was given (hammering or drowning a mouse in a glass of water), but everything changes, and after the <s>first corpse,</s> changes in the conditions for providing a guarantee have to think how to destroy it.  The hand simply did not rise breaking the favorite wheel, so for the beginning I decided to use scissors and some special effects in order to demonstrate that I cut the wire of the wheel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa5/353/7ef/aa53537ef1194c74932ff35066d8ec3d.jpg"><br><br>  I accompanied it to some born in creative torment with the text: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello.  I thought and decided to send me a new steering wheel of the Logitech G29.  1. Accordingly, I confirm that I and my trustee agree, if necessary, to complete a customs declaration and provide additional information that will be requested by the courier company UPS.  I will write again the data of the authorized person: ***** phone: +7 *******.  Proof of the destruction of a faulty device - I upload a photo, plus it is available at the link: <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/">yadi.sk/i</a> ******** Please, while sending the parcel, somehow do so that I do not have to pay a fee. :-) For example, in July, a friend from a German online store ordered a steering wheel worth more than 200 euros, he did not pay any duty.  Thank! </blockquote><br>  Three days - and the answer came: <br><br><blockquote>  We can replace your device with a model - G29 + shift lever, as a separate device ... Since the replacement is sent from Holland and the price of the device + delivery is more than 200 euros, the Russian customs have the right to require you to clear the goods and fill in the declaration.  In addition, they may require additional charges for this.  It has nothing to do with Logitech, and we cannot do anything in this case.  These are laws of the Russian Federation and the customs of a particular country, so if any problems arise from the customs, then you will need to solve this yourself.  We send parcels around the world and nowhere is this situation observed, only in the Russian Federation.  For details, I can recommend contacting the UPS office and ask a question about the amount of the duty. <br><br>  In addition, I report that the evidence for the destruction of the device is not enough.  Be so kind as to provide other photos showing that the device cannot be used anymore.  Do not forget to include the application number in the frame and save the parts of the destroyed device until the receipt of a new product. </blockquote><br>  At the UPS office, the staff call center talkers could not explain anything (by the way, I‚Äôll tell you about this wonderful company below), but the main sadness was not that.  The hand did not rise to beat my faithful combat friend with a sledgehammer or cut with a grinder ... The flour of creativity gave the following post-production: <br><br><blockquote>  I have already called USPS, they said that they do not advise on fees.  As for the photos of the destruction of the device - I made new ones.  Unfortunately, I could not break everything into small pieces with a hammer, because the steering wheel was surprisingly strong, a piece of plastic flew into the eye, and neighbors began to look out at the noise entrance:: (I hope these photos will be enough, otherwise I will have to look for a helmet and jumpsuit with gloves and go to the <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/">open field.Photo</a> in the application or here: <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/">yadi.sk/i</a> ****. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/d2b/146/b4bd2b146c4b413eb368cc4712b6b032.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4b/cc5/038/f4bcc503804148b0a540b616dbdf944a.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, everything is not as sad as it seems in the photo.  And they answered me! <br><br><blockquote>  Unfortunately, proof of destruction is not approved. <br><br>  Please provide a photo of all parts of the device: the steering wheel, the pedals, and the shift lever with the cut cables.  The photo should show the serial numbers on the steering wheel and the application number written out on the sheet of paper. <br><br>  Thank you for your patience. </blockquote><br>  With a note about ‚Äúpatience,‚Äù they were right on point.  It was at the end and all the time I wanted to crouch on the viscari and throw the steering wheel out of the balcony.  But I restrained myself: <br><br><blockquote>  I send a photo in which all parts of the device are visible: the steering wheel, the pedals and the shift lever with the cut cables.  As for the serial number on the steering wheel, it is simply impossible to distinguish it on such a close-up view, since I take pictures with an ordinary phone, and not with a professional camera.  In general, I made an additional photo with a close up, which clearly shows the serial number. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/200/ea6/8c3/200ea68c3a0d4354b30acbac1f49f306.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/991/099/ad5/991099ad592542c39819bd4fdf47317b.jpg"><br><br>  This time, the guarantors arranged this epic canvas: <br><br><blockquote>  I inform you that the application for the replacement of the product was created and sent for processing to the appropriate department. <br><br>  In advance, the application will be processed within 5-7 business days. <br><br>  As soon as the product is sent, you will receive an automatic letter informing you about it.  Further, within 12 hours, you will be given a parcel number, according to which you can track its status on the UPS website. </blockquote><br>  Then the guys again slightly forgot about me and my beaten friend, I had to call and remind about my existence.  Two identical letters came at once: <br><br><blockquote>  This notification is sent automatically.  It indicates that the product you returned has entered our return center, and the product that replaces it is ready for shipment. <br>  - When the replacement item is sent from our issuing center, you will receive a notification with the number of the shipment by e-mail. </blockquote><br>  At first I did not attach any importance to this, but it turned out that heavy artillery in the person of UPS had entered the work.  Since in the old G27 the gearshift lever was included in the kit, and in the new G29 it wasn‚Äôt, it wasn‚Äôt in the box, but apparently under the terms of the warranty, it was supposed to be for me, and the Logite members also sent it to me, but in a separate box and with a separate track number - it's hard to say why it was impossible to just roll them up with scotch tape for example?  And from that moment on, these two boxes (heavier and lighter) started all sorts of magical movements, changing statuses, hanging at customs several times, clearing customs, then back, apparently, cleared, and so on: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/931/5de/08d9315de735482683c884303012b988.jpg"><br><br>  Needless to say, how many times have I called UPS, including a customs broker at Vnukovo Airport?  One way or another, the deadlines were met and after the stated eight days my brother in St. Petersburg received both parcels.  To transport them to me the nearest truck was a trick. <br><br>  <b>Fees, by the way, there was no.</b> <br><br>  So, further personal impressions on the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f30/cc9/7d1/f30cc97d1bc54e40a915109e32e2d538.jpg"><br><br>  New model steering - new software.  Now we have a new universal Logitech device profiler, and here came the first surprises.  The old version had the following settings for the steering wheel itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08e/baf/c0d/08ebafc0dcab4cfba6d3f371fd1ed272.jpg"><br><br>  In the new it became so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/ec8/fa0/316ec8fa02a74266adb717046f168363.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a43/4dc/b1b/a434dcb1b31b4dee82b8ecab21b2f243.jpg"><br><br>  That is, two settings.  It is not clear what the sensitivity slider is responsible for (it defaults to 50%).  Whether feedback has changed compared with G27 - until I realized, purely subjectively, the steering wheel became denser and less play in the near-zero zone.  For the rest, except for a slightly heavier wheel, this is the good old G27.  But the steering wheel itself is extremely convenient, just do not want to let go. <br><br>  The gearshift lever is now pristine clean, all the buttons from it moved to the steering wheel and even almost did not lose in quantity.  I will say more, now there is a wheel that turns ala a real sports steering wheel, the other buttons are different and are also located with ergonomic manners - at the peak of their predecessor, where there were 6 identical geometrically aligned buttons.  Of course, they were right under the fingers, but they did not differ from each other by touch, and the convenience of using them was due only to skill - in a year and a half and the chimpanzees probably would have worked on the reflexes of pressing what was needed.  G29 - everything is different, it takes some getting used to, but it is more convenient to order - you do not have to reach for the gearbox, for example, to press / release the speed limiter button at the pit stop - everything is on the steering wheel itself.  Blue buttons slightly play, but they are pressed without problems, as well as others.  There are questions only to the very same twist - the fixation of the positions is not very clear, and you can easily twist two divisions instead of one, plus when you rotate the button inside it, it also scrolls slightly: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yM-qEM2fz_4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbwmHlQ8WNqUY7MT2W9lVR7SnBAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here are my iRacing button settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/067/23a/d72/06723ad729a3473e8ff365a8de65d15e.jpg"><br><br>  All the most important is easily located, and for the rest, and the keyboard is enough. <br><br>  And about the pedals a few words.  In addition to the color of the plastic cylinders behind the pedals (the G27 is red, the G29 is strictly black) the only difference is the mod in the brake pedal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/ec9/b47/12bec9b476b9458a9514a3b77aed52e4.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the cylinder at the beginning and end of the white plastic insert, and inside the spring rubber rectangle, a little denser than a school eraser.  75% after the pedal is depressed, a rubber band comes into play, and it becomes very hard to burn the pedal.  In general, a sort of budget tuning from the factory, especially since the simraising enthusiasts have not made this happen for many years.  The taste and color, as they say, but for me personally, this mod has not particularly liked. <br><br>  The rest is the good old G27.  The steering wheel is easy-to-use, the buttons are all on it, the pedals (except for the mod) are one-on-one, even, according to reviews, both the pedals and the shifter are easily suited from the G27.  In fact, before us - G27 version 2.0 <br><br>  Would I buy such a device for "real money"?  At today's prices - no, 30 thousand is a bust, especially since you can buy the old G27 for 12 thousand rubles.  When the price tag drops thousands to 15 - it will already be a great purchase. <br><br>  I take my leave for this and say thanks again to Logitek for excellent <a href="http://support.logitech.com/">service support</a> and generally good attitude towards customers. <br><br>  <i><b>Disclaimer: friends, I am not responsible if, after reading my text, someone runs to break the keyboard / mouse / steering wheels / etc.</b></i>  <i><b>etc.</b></i>  <i><b>I just told my story.</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369101/</a></p>
