  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer virus - the pursuit of the living?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Man instinctively and quite consciously compares the elements of the world around him with himself.  And now, it turns out, the pig has a heart similar to a human device.  The social structure of monkeys is a rough model of human society (and for some groups and individual elements of this society, not even a rough one, but quite an approximate one).  The computers that appeared (earlier the abbreviation of the computer - electronic computers) were more common, immediately caused the person to associate with his main function - the thinking one.  Therefore, jargons and quite official terms with the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù component ‚Äî computer brains, memory, etc. ‚Äî went into action.  And very soon, humanity realized that electronic brains could pick up an infection similar to the one that threatens people.  Yes, we are talking about viruses, computer, of course. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first virus, more precisely, its prototype, appeared back in ... 1961!  Then in "Bell Telephone Laboratories" created the game "Darwin", the essence of which was that several programs written in Assembler fought for system resources.  Translated into biological language - several organisms struggled for food in the conditions of its shortage. <br><br>  After 9 years, the ‚ÄúCookie Monster‚Äù program (written by Chris Tavares) was written, destroying the MULTICS operating system (UNIX progenitor) installed on an IBM 2741 computer. <br><br>  And three years later, in 1973, Bob Thomas wrote a full-fledged virus, called "Convolvulus", distributed in the network ARPANET (the predecessor of the Internet).  Based in the next car, he gave the message: ‚ÄúI am a bindweed.  Catch me! ‚ÄùAnd then the first anti-virus program‚Äú Reaper ‚Äùwas written, which destroyed Bindweed.

      And after 22 years, rapidly evolving, the famous Win95.CIH virus, also known as Snee, also known as Chernobyl, which erased the BIOS, ‚Äúkilling‚Äù motherboards, appeared.  That is, it has already become similar to the human virus that kills the human body in which it settled. <br><br>  Currently, viruses have already piled up all the devices that have at least some kind of processor: computers, smartphones, communicators and ect.  More recently, viruses have taken the attack RFID scanners used in trade for reading a bar code.  Potential losses can now amount to hundreds of billions of dollars! <br><br>  What's next?  Sure, viruses will evolve following the evolution of computers.  Not for nothing at the beginning of the article it was said about the similarity of certain elements of the world with a person (and computers have already become part of our world, and quite significant).  Therefore, we can assume that computer viruses will more and more resemble biological viruses. <br><br>  According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia ( <a href="http://www.bonaen.ru/">http://www.bonaen.ru</a> ), viruses are the causative agents of infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, breeding only in living cells. <br><br>  What is the fundamental difference between a computer and a biological virus?  In my opinion, the second affects the body, but only indirectly affects the human mind (in the form of fever, blood saturation with toxins).  In other words, a virus cannot command a person.  A computer virus, representing, in essence, a program, causes a computer to perform certain actions: send spam, destroy databases, etc.  Or if it is even shorter, then the virus is a virtual reality. <br><br>  The evolution of computers leads to the fact that in the future the information carriers in them will become elementary particles.  And if so, then they will obey the law of quantum mechanics.  And according to modern quantum field theory, the interaction of elementary particles (and the work of the computer of the future - this is the interaction of elementary particles) should be considered as the absorption of one free particle of other (virtual) particles.  And the life of an elementary particle is a continuous process of emission and absorption of virtual particles. <br>  That is, computer viruses of the future are programs that will become part of the hardware of the computer!  And directly affecting it, that is, behaving like biological viruses.  Fantasy?  We'll see.  Wait a maximum of 20-30 years. <br><br>  PS By the way, why not biological viruses evolve to computer viruses and take control of the human brain? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121805/</a></p>
