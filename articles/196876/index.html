The Verge article contains an interesting story about why they did it and how they were able to customize the process of testing experimental solutions for the percentage of the audience in the native application.  I wonder if the massive wave of sidebar rejection will now go - the higher screen of modern iPhones makes it possible to use the bottom panel again.
