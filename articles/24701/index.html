  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The reaction of the humanities girl to her newly installed Ubuntu. Second day.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And now, at the request of commenting on some continuation, which includes a review about Windows.  This note is somewhat specific, so children under 16 should not be read.  Please do not kick.  If you need to move immediately to Holivory - just say so, but I'm trying to just show the <strong>creative</strong> person‚Äôs reaction to the abrupt shift of an already not very familiar environment.  Let's get started <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy boy and I learn and get used to each other.  I feel that our life will be full of difficulties and omissions (which is most important, because this beautiful rubbish is already beginning to make decisions without my knowledge ...).  Well, God bless him, the main thing is to make me happy with health and beauty, because I used to live with the most interesting woman ... I don‚Äôt remember those times as the black page of my life.  By no means.  Co-living with Winda - yes, that was her name - it was certainly difficult, the girl was still, it seemed to me all the time that my opinion did not touch her, and the easy mess in my head (which in general echoed my creative disorder ) made itself felt.  With age, this mess was getting worse and more intricate ... Winda resembled a demanded whore, hated by almost everyone, but still using each other, and killing herself with free drugs, expanding her limited consciousness, and terrible diseases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But back to my beautiful boy.  We are afraid of each other.  Perhaps the fact is that the baby was accustomed to strong and skilled male hands, who know how to tame the wild nature of the Shaman?  We saw each other only once, our meeting lasted exactly three weeks and was overshadowed by many events, but it was still interesting.  And for that one meeting, I could not decide on serious steps, so I feel insecure when I touch his black skin and click on the dots on his anthracite-orange body.  I'm afraid not to touch what you need, and spoil everything.  And he does not encourage me, occasionally allowing himself only scant comments!  Just looking, proudly turned away.  Well, nothing, I will not give up. <br><br>  I remember how my friend brought me my boy.  He himself has his own Shaman at home, only older and a little more educated (although the character is still the same, judging by the stories of the scratches received).

      Oh, the nature of my kids showed up right there!  Sometimes it seems to me that it was created by a person with a perverted fantasy ... therefore my Shaman reacts to any touches with a well-concealed hostility.  He is so cunning and insidious that it may seem submissive and affectionate, open up, allow the tamer to be on top and have fun.  But in his ink eyes there is a thirst for revenge, sophisticated and terrible.  All this illusion of victory is given only in order to bite more painfully for the most expensive, repaying for the humiliation suffered.  My wild boy ... One has only to let go of the leash, to show that you don‚Äôt know something, as he immediately pretends not to remember your language, and refuses to do what he did a while ago with great pleasure. <br><br>  Well ... I'm waiting.  In the evening, a fearless tamer of exotic animals like my Shaman will come.  Of course, I understand that this is violence against my boy, but let him cut his wings slightly. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>Upd.</strong>  Some explanations.  In quotes - a <strong>girl</strong> 's tip about Ubuntu, which I recently gave her.  Settings did not have time to do everything at once, therefore, the reaction is in some places strange.  Please do not call the writer siih notes "the near fool." <br><br>  <strong>Upd.2</strong> Gentlemen, minus my karma (I agree - there is something, not everything is in the subject).  You have a great chance to make sure that the continuation - with a list of real problems of several days of work in a new environment - does not appear in the collective blog.  Just one more minus. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24701/</a></p>
