If you interpret it briefly, you get something like ‚Äúthe practice of full awareness of the present.‚Äù <br><br>  Most likely, each of us felt it in one way or another.  Remember how once you were so passionate about working on a project that you spent half a day or half a night on it, and you didn‚Äôt even notice how time passed by.  This was the real working Zen.  As you can see a very useful process that brings with it a lot of advantages.

      But can you learn to catch Zen every time you sit down at the workplace?  The experienced <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/freelancers/">freelancers</a> in this regard have some practical advice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Tidy work area </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/jb/oc/knjbock7y8fp24logsh4bcoqfxm.png"><br><br>  How many would not talk about creative disorder in a positive way, but in reality - it interferes and even distracts.  When a table is cluttered with different things, it is constantly necessary to spend time searching for something important.  This significantly affects the mental state and, in particular, causes stress.  And the latter is definitely not a friend for a peaceful immersion in the labor process. <br><br>  That is why it is better to spend a few minutes restoring order before starting work, in order not to be distracted and thus fly off the zen wave. <br><br><h2>  Ease pressure of responsibility </h2><br>  While working on voluminous or complex projects, sometimes the thought comes to our mind that we cannot cope with this task.  This gives rise to a feeling of anxiety, which entails a certain amount of stress and depression.  Labor becomes uncomfortable, because the brain constantly signals that you may not cope. <br><br>  It is necessary to fight this state of affairs immediately, without waiting for a shaky state.  And you need to start with a reason that makes us doubt.  Typically, this is: <br><br><ul><li>  strict deadline; </li><li>  a large number of tasks per unit of time; </li><li>  or self-doubt. </li></ul><br>  In fact, one must learn to avoid this kind of pressure of responsibility.  Learn to "format" thoughts at the stage of their occurrence.  Be confident in your abilities, and if you do not know something, think about where you can find information about it.  Finally, ask yourself the question: what will happen if I postpone the implementation of this project until later?  Or even give it up? <br><br><h2>  Get rid of distractions </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-4/h_/jd/-4h_jdz-hnpcvi-3paudrjavpli.png"><br><br>  The state of Zen itself implies a complete concentration on the process of work.  That is why, in order to tune in to it, it is necessary to minimize the influence of distractions.  These include a lot of things.  This is constantly mumbling TV, reminders on the phone from social networks, smoking cigarettes and much more. <br><br>  Just select the hours that will be devoted exclusively to workflows, while remaining inaccessible for phone calls, messages from instant messengers, cigarettes and endless cups of coffee. <br><br>  Do the work, and only then solve other issues.  This approach will significantly increase the number of tasks performed per unit of time. <br><br><h2>  Stop rushing and slow down </h2><br>  Starting work on the project, do not think about deadline.  Do not be in a hurry, but rather take up work in a quiet rhythm, focusing on the process.  It will seem to many that they will do less in this way, but in reality everything will turn out to be exactly the opposite. <br><br>  This is a purely physiological process.  Agree that, for example, playing sports in a calm rhythm is much more efficient and useful than an active strain at the limit of possibilities.  Slow down and you will be surprised how easy and easy the work will be done. <br><br><h2>  Accept and love the monotony </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/9a/oj/ps9aojbktqfnomopwwrily0rphq.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, each new project brings with it not only a creative task, but also absolutely routine processes.  That they want to do the least.  And to catch Zen on their implementation is very difficult, because they initially cause a feeling of depression and rejection. <br>  There is only one way out in this situation, and it is quite obvious.  You just need to love the monotony.  As they say, accept, accept and receive pleasure from it. <br>  At first glance, this seems impossible, but psychologists say that thinking correctly can move mountains.  And here they cite as an example athletes who have to work a single movement or element of technology thousands of times.  Thus, they persistently move to the medals and the first places. <br><br>  Methodism is not bad.  This is the path to excellence and outstanding results, because with each practice you will perform routine tasks faster and more efficiently.  And how can you not love what you do best? <br><br><h2>  At last </h2><br>  In itself, the concept of "Zen" is a very useful and wise thing.  And it is in the labor process that it is very relevant and in demand.  After all, work for us is eternal tomorrow. <br>  Tomorrow I will be paid a fee for my work.  Tomorrow I'll get a dream project.  Tomorrow I will work more.  Tomorrow the client will offer me a promotion.  And so on to infinity. <br>  And you need to learn to be and work here and now, enjoying every moment of the labor process.  Complicated?  Without a doubt!  But perhaps, if there is a desire to enjoy every minute of time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460054/</a></p>
