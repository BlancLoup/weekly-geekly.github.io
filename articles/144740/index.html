I hope that the discussion will clarify the situation and I will move the topic to a more suitable hub. <br><br>  The task of this topic is to find out, is it necessary what will be described below? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      So, let's begin. <br><br>  I proceed from the assumption that many people would like to study abroad, particularly in Europe or even more specifically in Germany.  This desire is opposed by many factors, the most significant of which, in my humble opinion, is uncertainty.  Namely, it is not known where to start, where to look, what to be able to and have, etc.  Even after you have found an institute, where you would like to study, get in touch with him and get a place there, there are still a lot of questions, like for example: <br><br><ul><li>  Who will meet me? </li><li>  Where to live at least the first time? </li><li>  Where to run / go, what to do? </li><li>  What is important, who would ask? </li><li>  ‚Ä¶ etc. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now imagine the following.  You want to study in Germany.  You come to our site, fill out a form with data, such as name, surname, date of birth, education, etc.  Upload scans of your documents (not passports, of course, only education certificates, plus there may be certificates, such as proof of language proficiency).  You indicate in a free but brief form where and who you would like to study.  We translate your documents into German, fill out the necessary forms and send it to educational institutions that match your profile.  You will see all the answers from these very institutions in your personal account on the site.  If the answers are positive and they suit you, with your permission, we send a request for enrollment. <br><br>  After you got a place, you need to deal with a visa.  This is a completely different, serious and long work.  For our part, we provide you with all possible information.  You are expected to fulfill all the requirements of the German authorities. <br><br>  If everything is good, you have a visa (residence permit) and a place at the institute.  You arrive in Germany, we meet you and bring you to the hotel (the hotel is reserved in advance and by you (in your name), so that in case of force majeure you would not be left outside).  The next day, we take you to the institute, where you get all the papers, then we go to the real estate agency, where you sign the rent papers, for a period of 3-4 months, so that you can then decide this question yourself.  Naturally, super conditions and super cheap prices will not be promised for obvious reasons, which are not a small number and which will be explained clearly and in detail.  If you can solve the housing problem yourself (friends, relatives, etc.), all the better.  From us you get a quick guide on what and when to do in the first months, including a map with the nearest stores.  This is where our collaboration ends. <br><br>  And now about the money.  We sign an agreement according to which, after receiving a student card at hand (attention, not enrollment, but receipt of a student card, which can only be done personally at the institute in Germany), you agree to transfer a certain amount to our account, for example, one thousand euro.  Up to this point we are not asking for money.  Thus, you are protected from incorrect behavior on our part, and we are sure that we will also receive our money, because  without a student card, it will be bad for you here, and with a signed contract we can always go to the police if you don‚Äôt transfer the money. <br><br>  To the question, what will happen if it does not burn out or a person changes his mind, but have we already incurred expenses?  My answer is: nothing will happen, these expenses are included in the risks, everything is still for you, payment only upon receipt of a student ticket. <br><br>  Naturally, everything here is written only a rough description of the process, the subtleties and problems associated with them will be, and I understand it perfectly.  My question to you, or rather two: <br><br><ol><li>  Would you find this interesting? </li><li>  Is the amount up to 2 thousand euros for such services adequate?  if not, how much? </li></ol><br><br>  And please consider another point.  In my opinion, you need an amount where around 10 thousand euros in any case, because  Only the German authorities will demand a pledge of 7.5 thousand from you (which you will get back if you don‚Äôt have a trouble here. This is just a pledge in case you make a small disaster here).  There are of course other options, but rely first on this one. <br><br>  Well, one more thing from my side. <br>  I do not have good connections, finance in sufficient volume, experience in legal terms <br><br>  If you are interested to participate and you have something that I do not have, then I will be very happy to talk with you. <br><br>  And finally, I would like to repeat once again: <br>  The task of this topic is to find out, is it necessary what is described here?  Those.  not whether it will work, because  There are problems, but is it necessary? <br><br>  Thank you in advance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144740/</a></p>
