(I'll tell you about the differences separately) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/518/feb/1b3/518feb1b3dda9f8f5ded8f48ae5032cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1.

      The book is packed in a box of high-quality cardboard with good printing and decorated under the cover of an ordinary book.  Information on the package is complete, including specifications and phone those.  support <br>  The only censure - colors, could be more fun to do. <br>  If you choose a book as a gift, you will only have to tie up a beautiful ribbon - additional packaging is not required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/452/5bd/43f/4525bd43f2d8825ae17e66ea3c30626d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Packaging.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd9/c04/ce7/fd9c04ce7f7f506d357a0a43d5a636fa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the open form.</i> <br><br>  Included with the book comes the cover of the skin.  deputy with dense inserts, which can serve as a stand when watching videos or photos.  The presence of the cover pleases, because  Not under all devices can be found in the retail sale of a suitable case / cover.  This is a definite plus. <br>  Also included is a charger, sync cable, headphones, warranty card.  The presence of charging with its own connector always surprised me, this is a trend of this manufacturer.  Given that the book is charging via USB, you could simply insert a universal adapter with a USB port.  Well, oh well, there is a good thing to eat.  We assume that this is a duplication of charging functions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c02/842/027/c02842027d8ce239171fcb1b1d475c50.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Inside the box.</i> <br><br><h4>  2. Appearance, connectors, communication. </h4><br><br>  The body of both books is made mostly of black plastic with soft-touch coating, the ends are made of matte plastic, painted in silver color. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/5a4/8a4/e3a5a48a48be5c098bdf94932677d53d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lexand LT-115 in the expanded form.</i> <br><br>  If you keep the book in portrait orientation, there is an on / off button in the main menu below the screen, in fact, these are two buttons hidden by a rocker button.  If on the younger model the button is pressed clearly, without a squeak and backlash, then in the older one it is bigger, which is why a bit of backlash and a feeling of unreliable construction.  I will say right away that it did not cause any false positives or other problems, so it‚Äôs more of a sensation.  To the right of the screen, the up / down buttons, in the main menu, perform the functions of changing the volume; in the read mode, they can scroll pages. <br>  At the bottom there are all the available ports, the device off lever, a slot for a memory card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b5/7fb/69c/5b57fb69c60e178d9a2b6bfa2d058993.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Ports, connectors Lexand LT-115</i> <br><br>  Wireless communication modules are not provided, communication with a computer is via USB-miniUSB cable. <br><br><h4>  3. Functions: </h4><br>  The younger model has the following menu items: Books, Movies, Music, Photo, Explorer, Voice Recorder, Settings, Calendar, Player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/545/350/f12/545350f1223a0ad23c09756439e6c354.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Menu LT-115</i> <br><br>  In the older one - the FM radio item was added, and the Player item was removed.  Which is logical, since  it duplicates the item Music, it‚Äôs the same thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c2/25f/6bb/9c225f6bb1121f8839ee4363b89687cb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Menu LT-117</i> <br><br>  By the way, how to replace the background image in the main menu, I never figured it out ;-) <br><br>  Books: For a list of supported formats, see the table below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b89/e09/ede/b89e09edecee59aeaa2e8156ee0a7a0d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Reading mode</i> <br><br>  In any of the applications that provide full-screen viewing, the menu is invoked by a long tap on the screen.  You can change the font, color, size, etc.  The settings are standard and similar to those in other multimedia books.  The icons are large, the sensitivity is normal, easy to adapt. <br>  The page turning speed is high compared to e-ink. <br>  Plus - you can read in any light, minus - your eyes get tired with any brightness and font. <br><br>  Music: nothing particularly wise, choose music through a guide and listen.  According to the logic, the picture of the album is supported, but I did not find out how the file should be named and where it should be located. <br><br>  The radio does not work without headphones. <br><br>  Films: it is very interesting here - not only many formats are supported, but also soft-subs.  A nice plus for language learners or anime lovers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1fe/dad/55e/1fedad55ee01f311f4e837c617f6b2ea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Video player, cover as a stand.</i> <br><br>  Photo: You can view photos either simply in the explorer or in full screen, in the ‚Äúlarge active photo + thumbnails of other photos‚Äù mode, as well as in the slideshow mode, for which various effects are set.  I did not like the icons in the photo viewer settings, because  it is not clear by the icon what exactly it should do, although the size of the icons is convenient for touch control and they are drawn qualitatively. <br><br><h4>  4.

Guys may not take a bag at all, but put a book in a jeans pocket, for example. <br><br>  The 7-inch book is already a standard-size book; you can see one on the metro every day and not just one.  It has a more capacious battery, but the power consumption of the screen is also higher. <br><br>  On average, a full charge is enough for 2 days of not very active use.  You can charge both from USB and from the network through the charger. <br><br>  The book is probably not suitable for younger children, because  It does not have built-in games and there is no possibility to install them.  In any case, it is quite a decent gift option for little money, but with great potential.  Packaging can be called a gift without stretch, and a set - redundant. <br>  Would I take such a book to myself?  I think no.  I would buy for the same money a PDA with a large number of network modules. <br>  But for advanced users, I would advise something similar - simple operation, simple menu, easy viewing of movies and even with subtitles, if necessary. <br><br>  Photos in higher resolution can be viewed <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/ragnamaniac/album/177788/%3Fp%3D0">in the album on Yandex</a> . <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135004/</a></p>
