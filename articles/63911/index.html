      Does the VAZ GLONASS? <br><br>  In the wake of the latest news <br><br>  On May 21, 2009, the Russian media was overtaken by the news that AvtoVAZ OJSC plans to begin installing navigation equipment with GLONASS support for LADA PRIORA and LADA KALINA cars produced in 2009.  The news provided links to specific project documents.  Also at the ‚ÄúNavitech-EXPO 2009‚Äù exhibition, which was held in Moscow in mid-May 2009, the public was presented the LADA PRIORA car with a working GLONASS-GPS navigator integrated into the front panel.  The car had a state.  numbers with the region 163 (Tolyatti), which indirectly confirmed the veracity of the news. <br><br>  The reaction to the news about embedding GLONASS into domestic cars was significant - almost all media outlets (both news and car) got around the news, the topic was actively discussed on radio, in blogs and forums.  But the essence of the reaction was different.  There were quite expected reviews: ‚ÄúIt would be better if a car was built into LADA‚Äù.  There were also positive responses, including those who pointed to the global economic sense of the news: such integration of GLONASS into domestically produced cars could give not only a number of competitive advantages to the domestic auto industry, but also become a real impetus for the development of GLONASS, which recently quite significantly "stumbles", also due to the lack of a full-fledged commercial market of installations. <br><br>  Soon the theme of installing GLONASS navigation on LADA was continued in the form of new information ‚Äúbursts‚Äù.  I tried to collect all the additional information I had on the topic in this document, which I want to share with you. <br><br>  A few hours after the release of the first news, the press service of AvtoVAZ OJSC in the person of Natalia Sidoruk contacted me.  The essence of the conversation was as follows: "Our technical experts refute the essence of the news about specific plans for presetting GLONASS in LADA."  My objections to the fact that the news was based on specific project documents, fell by chance into my hands, and when asked to speak with these unnamed ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, the press officer hesitated and promised to call back later.  Nobody called me back later. <br><br>  On the same day, in the evening some (not all!) Reporters were sent the following document: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/783/066/2cd/7830662cd5df13d7b94d93994b194b25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let me, I will focus on it in more detail. <br><br>  First, the document is not signed.  Instead of the signature, there is the ‚Äúpress center of AvtoVAZ OJSC‚Äù.  That is, not a specific official of the company, but the entire press service.  The personal author of the document is not.  There are no feedback coordinates on the document.  The document itself is composed in MS Word.  In the properties of the document there is someone named Metalnikov DA, but at the same time the subject of the document is designated as ‚ÄúThe Board of Directors of OJSC AVTOVAZ‚Äù was held in Moscow.  What does the Board of Directors have to do with this? It is not clear. <br><br>  The most interesting thing about the document is the essence.  The essence can be interpreted in two ways.  On the one hand it is clearly written that "work is being done."  On the other hand, that JSC AVTOVAZ "... currently has no contractual relations ...".  That is, it is not clear: whether the document confirms the existence of the GLONASS installation project in LADA, or refutes it.  There are no questions to ask for - collective creativity, no author! <br><br>  I tried several times to arrange a meeting with Mrs. Sidoruk in order to get information in full and first-hand.  The position of Mrs. Sidoruk regarding the meeting several times changed from interest in the meeting, to the impossibility of that.  Thus, I did not understand, whether VAZ has something to say on the subject of concern to the public, or there is nothing to say. <br><br>  In one of the telephone conversations, an explanation was given to the position of VAZ regarding the problems of introducing GLONASS navigation, which is as follows: We are not here for your (my?) GLONASS.  We have other problems now.  As a problem, zakarka of dealerships was named by new cars, the demand for which fell sharply with the onset of the crisis. <br><br>  I would like to note that it was LADA PRIORA that was mentioned about embedding GLONASS, there is no tuck for it, the number of cars in the dealer network is minimal - this was explained to me in one of the large LADA dealerships.  Warehouses are packed with older and less competitive models.  Accordingly, it is not entirely correct to interfere with everything in one pile (both old and new models) and to explain the inhibition in the development of the new model range by problems with the implementation of the old one ‚Äî this is unlikely to contribute to the rapid and effective development of competitive products. <br><br>  Having made an unequivocal conclusion that the question is in fact much more complicated than it seems at first glance, I tried to get additional information.  What is going on with GLONASS at VAZ? <br><br>  At first I applied for official comments to the Russian company AvtoAudioTsentr, the owner of the Ural trademark, under which the receivers and other car sound systems were produced.  Judging by the documents I had, they were the developers of the first navigation for LADA PRIORA.  All that I was able to learn from them was reduced to the official: <i>‚ÄúThe project has a place to be.</i>  <i>Yes, we showed the solution at the exhibition.</i>  <i>We cannot disclose the details without the consent of VAZ, since this is a commercial secret. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Meanwhile, on June 4, the following news was released: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.automobili.ru/news/param/1563/">www.automobili.ru/news/param/1563</a> <br><br>  In contrast to the first information that came to me, here it is a question of a project that is scheduled for implementation ‚Äúfor later‚Äù, or rather, for autumn.  Here the start of production is directly stated.  Right now.  In fact, the news, however, has a lot of questions. <br><br>  Firstly, GLOSPACE is the first ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù autonavigator with GLONASS support.  In quotes - because in fact it is domestic conditional: one of the Sino-Korean serial GPS navigators was taken and the receiver was replaced with a similar one with GLONASS support from the famous developer of GLONASS electronics KB Navis, and the GPS antenna was replaced with a similar GPS - GLONASS antenna manufactured by FSUE ‚ÄúNII KP‚Äù, which is the developer of the whole project.  The navigator turned out to be a niche, since it could not compete with GPS analogs in terms of TTX and, most importantly, at the cost (at the time of the release of the order of 23,000 rubles).  The scheme of the possible placement of the mentioned GLOSPACE navigator in cars is also unclear - the navigator has considerable dimensions and you just can‚Äôt ‚Äúenter‚Äù it into the car.  In addition, the production of navigators "half-piece", so that the solution is also not a conveyor.  There are also doubts as to how the installation of the navigator without a tie-in to the instrument panel or the front panel will meet the requirements of the VAZ (safety, sufficient viewing angles, etc.) <br><br>  The news also quoted the words of Anatoly Perminov, the head of Roscosmos, that <i>‚Äúthe new device adds only 12,000 rubles to the cost of the car‚Äù</i> .  In fact, the rise in price is significant, since the cost of the simplest navigator in retail networks now is 3000-4000 rubles. <br><br>  I called the Institute of Space Instrumentation, the developer of the device GLOSPACE.  Their response: <i>‚ÄúWe do not confirm the news.</i>  <i>The source of the information is not clear. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  That is, the news was misinformation.  I wonder who might need to joke with the theme of the national project, and even drag the esteemed head of Roskosmos here? <br><br>  A week later, the following news appeared: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.lada-auto.ru/cgi-bin/pr.pl%3Fid%3D0%26id_article%3D79083%26prev%3D1">www.lada-auto.ru/cgi-bin/pr.pl?id=0&amp;id_article=79083&amp;prev=1</a> <br><br>  Official information from AvtoVAZ.  In the version that fell into my mailbox, the press release was signed as a joint from the press service of AvtoVAZ OJSC (why not the press center, like last time?) And from FGUP RNII KP. <br><br>  This news also has questions. <br><br>  First, it refers to the conduct of research.  What works, who and why should be carried out, when there is already a finished car with navigation?  The web even showed a link to a GOST R 52456-2005, describing the technical requirements for car navigation receivers: <br><br>  <a href="http://complexdoc.ru/lib/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2%2520%25D0%25A0%252052456-2005">complexdoc.ru/lib/%D0%93%D0%9E%D0%A1%D0%A2%20%D0%A0%2052456-2005</a> <br><br>  That is, standards all have a place to be. <br><br>  Secondly, the news mentioned the creation of a ‚Äújoint with the FSUE‚Äú RNII KP ‚Äùworking group to coordinate actions on the project of equipping LADA vehicles with integrated GLONASS / GPS receivers‚Äù.  However, it is worth noting that, as far as I know, FSUE RNII KP itself has no experience in developing exactly consumer navigation devices.  In contrast to the same FSUE "NII KP" (these are two different structures, although both are engaged in GLONASS and are located at the same address: Moscow, Aviamotornaya Street 53).  FSUE "RNII KP" itself also has never been seen in any kind of work related to regular automotive electronics.  GLONASS-GPS receivers do not produce navigation of FSUE ‚ÄúRNII KP‚Äù either - they purchase them from other companies.  In the same CB "Navis".  What is the point of creating a working group in this very composition - the news is not deciphered. <br><br>  I contacted the press service (or press center? J) of JSC AVTOVAZ to clarify the essence of what is happening.  She asked again: ‚ÄúIs there a project or not?‚Äù In response, it was said that, most likely, ‚Äúthere will be a tender‚Äù.  When asked what kind of tender is planned to be held, if there is already a joint statement with FSUE RNII KP, it was said that this means nothing, and FSUE RNII KP was apparently chosen because ‚Äúwe have been cooperating with it for a long time‚Äù.  But the tender will still be. <br><br>  The essence and objectives of the planned research also could not explain to me.  The direct question ‚ÄúDid the joint working group study the developments of other companies - FSUE‚Äú NII KP ‚Äù, AvtoAudioTsentr?‚Äù Was answered that nothing was known to the press center. <br><br>  I note that this is a summary of telephone conversations, comments on the mail on this issue refused to give me. <br><br>  From my point of view, the thesis of the press release also sounded dubious that ‚Äúa large set of issues must be resolved ... Thus, the development of Russian cartography is required, since LADA cars are operated throughout the country, including in regions for which there has not yet been compiled detailed maps. <br><br>  The fact is that the development of cartography is just limited by the fact that in the regions there is no installation base of navigation devices, there is not enough market for these devices on which these navigation maps could be used.  That is, map makers are not interested in investing money in covering regions where navigation devices have missed themselves once or twice.  But Russian companies in the commercial sector have long ago mastered the production of nautical charts of various scales and very deep information content.  The issue of covering with normal maps of most regions is a technical and commercial question, but in no way requiring any deep, lengthy and expensive research.  Here, as commented Alexander Sobkevich, director of sales in Russia and the CIS for TeleAtlas, one of the two largest navigation map developers in the world: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúFor navigation, you need accurate maps with the correct geometry of roads, restrictions on travel, speed, interchanges and other road attributes.</i>  <i>To collect them you need to drive on each road.</i>  <i>Navigation companies collect navigation data for commercially attractive regions, covering regional centers and major highways.</i>  <i>For small towns and most roads, there are only basic, unspecified maps on a scale that excludes detail.</i>  <i>Bulk installation of GLONASS - navigators can stimulate map manufacturers, as the navigation market expands.</i>  <i>In addition, modern technologies allow us to update the geometry of roads and make the majority of the necessary navigation attributes based on data from users.</i>  <i>Thus, an increase in the number of GLONASS navigator installations will lead to a qualitative improvement in the maps. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  To summarize, a joint working group has been announced to conduct some surveys, the essence of which, the goals and the timing of the questions raise a lot of questions. <br><br>  One journalist friend, having read the latest news, commented: ‚ÄúWell, so what?  Well done - organize research.  Normal deal!  And what is R &amp; D?  NIR is a) long;  b) expensive, because you have to pay for it;  c) without guarantees of the result.  Have you never seen many years of research projects, the only result of which is a ‚Äúplump‚Äù document with a report that is poorly applicable in practical work? ‚Äù <br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from all this history?  I would venture to make my assumptions: <br><br>  Firstly, the topic seems to be really hot.  And not so much for AvtoVAZ itself, but for those who are "spinning" in the GLONASS topic. <br><br>  Secondly, AvtoVAZ, it seems, has not yet decided on its attitude to GLONASS.  Or, as often happens in large companies, one hand does not know what the other one is doing. <br><br>  One thing is clear - GLONASS is definitely interesting for the state.  Namely, the state is now almost entirely, albeit indirectly, but controls the VAZ, including subsidizing its development with very small money (the last tranche was, it seems, around 25 billion rubles).  VAZ is really the largest manufacturer of domestic cars, namely the automotive market is able to provide quick installation of hundreds of thousands of GLONASS receivers right now.  That is, the VAZ can really stimulate the creation of the mass consumer market GLONASS, which can spur the development of the entire navigation industry in Russia. <br><br>  But the main question is still open: will there be a GLONASS at VAZs in 2009 or will we see just a couple of new research projects without a concrete practical result? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63911/</a></p>
