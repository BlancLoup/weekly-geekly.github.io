  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern foreign series</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, if we watch TV all day, we‚Äôll have to watch about 5 TV shows, which are either soap operas or detective stories.  And all these series are filmed by Russian television companies.  Many people watch these TV shows with pleasure and want to watch the next series, but they don‚Äôt know that somewhere in the west much more interesting television stories are being filmed.  All these stories are translated into Russian by several companies, such as Novafilm, LostFilm, KvadratMalevicha.  I would like to tell you which of the many TV shows I find the most interesting and why. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  House md </h4><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/ad/25/ad25de37c7cf38c9438bd41abceb4168.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h5>  Content </h5>  The content of each episode of this series consists of two parts: the main story and the secondary.  The main part is interconnected with the previous series, in contrast to the secondary one.  Dr. House is a very interesting person who constantly takes narcotic medications in order not to feel the constant pain in his leg that prevents him from living.  It makes him different from ordinary people.  At the same time, House is the most famous diagnostician in America. <br><h5>  What did you like? </h5>  The main reason why I got hooked on this series is the charm of the main character and his attitude to everything.  It is very interesting to watch such a person, and even sometimes you want to imitate him.  As well as viewing each series is quite informative, since it not only shows how a particular disease is treated, but also explains why it appeared.  And all this is not presented as a boring documentary, which makes it even more exciting to watch.  I advise everyone to first of all this series! <br><br><h4>  Heroes </h4><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/5b/c9/5bc907f694b0c9f4c15776b8a939f255.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h5>  Content </h5>  Who among us does not dream of reading other people's thoughts, flying, throwing lightning bolts, or moving objects by force of thought?  Encouraged by these desires, the authors created a series in which we can see the confrontation of people with abilities with other such unusual people.  A kind of civil war, where ordinary people turn out to be observers, victims or simply do not know anything about the existence of super-people.  The war of people with huge abilities, of course, can be deadly for the entire planet. <br><h5>  What did you like? </h5>  Actually, nothing unusual and surprising in this series is nothing - the usual fiction.  But at the same time, many of the actions of the characters are very unexpected, which adds interest, and also the usual childish desire to know "who is stronger?" Or "who will win?"  I do not even know why this particular series is one of my favorites ... Probably because it tells about something that you will never see in our daily life.

    <h4>  Prison break </h4><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/ab/57/ab57518b95a1ded3d26b2cd5ff5ab185.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h5>  Content </h5>  Who really controls America?  The president?  Parliament?  In fact, the main personalities in this country are the union of the richest entrepreneurs who are ready to do everything, if only this fact would not be exposed.  In order to protect itself against exposure, the Company has set up a man who was accused of killing the vice-president‚Äôs brother.  The accused was sentenced to death, but at the same time he was lucky, because his brother was a real genius who thought out the escape from the prison of Fox River, where they kept the prisoner. <br><h5>  What did you like? </h5>  In the series there are a lot of moments where the main characters ‚Äúhang on a string‚Äù, but they always find a way out.  I often say to myself: "I would not have thought of this."  And also attracts the intelligence of the protagonist and how he finds a way out.  And also in the series there is a good storyline and this is probably the only series that I would watch and watch series after series.  This is a must see for everyone! <br><br><h4>  Dexter </h4><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/fe/bf/febfc435702e278f0b24959127e704f8.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h5>  Content </h5>  There are cases when the most real killers are released from prison due to lack of evidence, witnesses, etc., but it is clear to everyone that this is the one who needs to be imprisoned for life.  The police cannot do anything because of the constitution, but one person decided to quench their thirst to kill just such unworthy criminals.  Thirst to kill him appeared due to the fact that he saw how cruelly killed his own mother in 5 years.  The policeman who arrived at the crime scene was terrified of what he saw and he took the young killer of killers to foster children.  When the child began to manifest a desire to kill, the adoptive father decided to send this force to the mainstream, where it would benefit.  Thanks to him, the child did not grow up as a murderer, but as a ‚Äúhero‚Äù who would kill only those who would have killed many innocent people. <br><h5>  What did you like? </h5>  I liked the uniqueness of the plot - I have never seen anything like it anywhere.  And also quite interesting is the situation in which all the events take place - Miami, summer, etc.  Each season has its own main storyline, which provides the desire to watch the next series, although the first season did not attract me much, unlike the second one.  Therefore, if, perhaps, some will have the desire not to watch the 2nd season after the 1st, it is better to overcame yourself - you will not regret;) <br><br><h4>  Fringe </h4><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/06/03/0603ac26880cb6182afbd91b9e2e6d25.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h5>  Content </h5>  The series began recently, so it‚Äôs hard to describe the content well, but a general impression and understanding may already be formed.  "Beyond the Boundary" is another fantastic series in which the investigation of paranormal phenomena is shown, but the reason is not any supernatural forces, but science.  When the government of America opened a top-secret section called "Sample", in which new scientific discoveries were developed, such as: radiation of radiation from a person, cure of incurable diseases, a huge speed of maturation, etc.  But this project is closed.  One of the main scientists was placed in a mental hospital, and the other became the owner of the richest corporation in the world.  A few years later, someone resumed his scientific activities, and the FBI had to rake the consequences.  But the special agent of the FBI, who lost a loved one because of this, will do everything to find out who is behind this, but only with the help of a scientist from a psychiatric hospital and his son. <br><h5>  What did you like? </h5><br>  I have only one reason why I watch this series - to find out what else there were discoveries, because most of them are explained on a scientific level, and I am quite close to science because of my place of study. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  I will cite several sites where you can find various TV series translated into Russian: <br>  Dexter, Prison Break, Fringe - <a href="http://novafilm.tv/">NovaFilm.tv</a> <br>  House, Heroes - <a href="http://lostfilm.tv/">LostFilm.tv</a> <br>  All - <a href="http://torrents.ru/">Torrents.ru</a> <br>  All serials are downloaded via torrents. <br><br>  I hope you will find some interesting series for you;) Or maybe you are already watching some?  Why? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45725/</a></p>
