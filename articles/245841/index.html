At least you should not try to get all the information at once. <br><br>  At the starting stage of a new project, especially if a product is managed not so long ago, there is a great temptation to know the opinion of all users on a particular issue.  But most often this haste is erroneous.  In addition to haste, most professionals engaged in the promotion of certain products, make 5 basic mistakes that are repeated again and again.  The presence of multiple feedback services makes getting information from users an extremely simple process - but you should not get carried away with getting it for any reason.  <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/">We have</a> prepared for you five tips related to the use of feedback from potential customers.

DO NOT CONTACT ALL USERS IMMEDIATELY <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d7/3d3/e92/1d73d3e920bc065733bbe4602f37b0c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Investigating the opinions of all users at once, you ignore the behavioral specifics of each of them.  Agree that for the purposes of the product-management it is silly to lump together those who came to you a couple of days ago and those who have been working with you for many years.  Those who use your product every day and those who log into the system once a month to update billing data. <br><br>  To solve this problem is not so difficult.  Split users into segments, for example: <br><br>  If the task is to improve the ways of attracting new visitors, then it is necessary to interview those who have signed up relatively recently. <br>  If you need to modify this or that functionality - contact those who use it. <br>  Want to figure out why customers do not use a particular service?  Ask those who do not apply it. <br>  If it is necessary to conduct a "test" of the product and establish problem areas, then make contact only with active users who constantly use all the functions of the product. <br><br><br>  2. MAKE A FEEDBACK TO CONSTANT <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a69/1a6/841/a691a68411ad37fcb623732747dcc6a3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The essence of the feedback suggests that the product developer himself initiates its receipt.  This means that after the need for feedback has appeared, you need to wait a while and do nothing while receiving and analyzing feedback.  To compensate for this, you accumulate and ask users even more questions, after which you wait for a long time to answer.  Especially stupid will be the reaction to each review, instead of waiting for all the data and analyze their entirety. <br><br>  The problem here is twofold: firstly, the information from the users does not come at the moment when it is needed, and secondly, the feedback from users comes only when you ask them a question.  This is how you can miss the moment when the product requires immediate improvement. <br><br>  Solution: Conduct customer surveys regularly.  The easiest, but very effective way is to ask the user to send their feedback and suggestions, for example, on the 30th, 60th, 120th, 365th day of using the product.  Modern services allow you to carry out this setup in a couple of minutes, and a similar approach pays off in just a couple of days. <br><br>  A more complicated way is to get feedback on the frequency of using individual functions.  For example, if your product has a calendar, then you can ask users after the 15th, 30th, and 60th access to a particular function ‚Äî this is how you can get more meaningful and structured feedback: when you first use, a person will tell you that it is not clear, on the 15th ‚Äî what he would like to change, on the 60th ‚Äî what restrictions your product has. <br><br>  3. DIVIDE THE FEEDBACK OF THE PAID AND FREE SUBSCRIBERS <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1e/f0d/79f/b1ef0d79fc1da52bd22b1a780cc1660c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is easy to trace the connection with the council number 1.  Of course, the easiest way to consider the entire set of reviews without regard to the type of subscription.  In general, this can be done up to a certain threshold (for example, for customers who pay 500-3500 rubles per month), but the difference between requests from free and paid subscribers is still significant.  Users of free services will certainly be able to improve your free packages, but your business is hardly focused on that.  Most often, free packages are created to attract new users, so that later they will switch to a paid subscription.  Do not pay attention to the reviews of the following type: <br><br>  I will go to a paid subscription if ... <br>  I will go to the paid when ... <br>  Taking promises in business is not productive.  Pay attention to what is really happening. <br><br>  So, a few tips for solving: <br><br>  To improve the terms of use of products for paid subscribers, contact only paid subscribers. <br>  To find out the motivation for the transition from a free to a paid subscription, please contact only those who have been referred. <br>  To improve free packages, contact only free users, but try not to follow them - such users do not bring you profit, but, most likely, simply request more free features. <br><br><br>  4. DON'T LISTEN TO A LITTLE MINORITY <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01e/9ad/df7/01e9addf7496c94e3a48e48b176c5dd2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A common joke among marketers is that the plural from the word ‚Äúopinion‚Äù is not at all ‚Äúdata‚Äù.  This, of course, does not mean that the opinion of one client is necessarily useless.  But if one day you will be approached by 10 users with a request to improve, for example, calendar management, then you should not immediately begin a project to finalize the product.  First you need to find out how this ten clients represent the general opinion by interviewing all users of this functionality. <br><br>  Solution: each received feedback from users should be perceived first of all as a hypothesis that needs to be tested.  But even after you find that all users agree, you should not immediately begin the implementation phase of the proposal. <br><br>  A more thorough analysis should be carried out - this is what our last advice is about. <br><br>  5. DO NOT READ BY DEFAULT THAT ALL USERS PROPOSE THE RIGHT DECISION <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/c1b/99b/98ec1b99b2fc661ce577dcdda0daef94.png" alt="image">  rocket <br><br>  Let's rephrase Confucius a bit: <br><br><blockquote>  When a customer points to the moon, a naive product manager examines his finger. </blockquote><br><br>  Henry Ford's notorious story about consumer opinion (‚ÄúIf I asked people what they want, they would ask for a faster horse‚Äù) is often used as an excuse to ignore customers.  But not in our case: if the client needs a horse quickly, then in fact his key requirement is the speed of movement.  It's time to sit down and think about how to implement it.  In the last example with the opinion of 10 people, we talked about their request to improve the management of the calendar.  You can immediately sit down and adjust the shape and content of the product, but very often it does not make any sense.  Having interviewed all users, we will most likely find out that the point is not the complexity of the calendar management form, but the frequency of its use. <br><br>  Solution: it must be remembered that each user request is the most complex combination of the client‚Äôs personal skills, the degree of his acquaintance with the product, as well as the peculiarities of problem perception and fantasy.  The client does not know your vision of the product and does not represent the complexity of the implementation of a service.  That is why the client's opinion is not a guide to action, but only an opportunity to look at the problem from another point of view and find the solution that will be profitable for you and convenient for users. <br><br>  Of course, many of the advice of your customers will be perfectly combined with other properties of the product and ideally fit into its concept.  In such cases, it is necessary to include an intuitive understanding of what you are offering to users, so that together with them you can easily find ways to improve the product. <br><br>  We hope that the described errors will help you to build effective communication with your users and improve your service. <br>  Good feedback and cool products! <br><br>  Yes, and come to us, leave your feedback.  Let's build together a <a href="http://carrotquest.ru/">system of communication with users</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245841/</a></p>
