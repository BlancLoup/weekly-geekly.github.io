    <h4>  <b>About touchscreen and its responsiveness</b> </h4><br>  When friends asked me what the advantages of the iPhone are in relation to the HTC, I answered that the sound on the iPhones is cleaner, the screen quality is better and it is more responsive to the touch of the user's fingers.  Now the last point has become a bit controversial.  From communication with the screen Iolita is a pleasure!  The weakest touch is not ignored.  It does not matter whether you click on the labels and menus, or scroll the page with fingerprints, comfort is felt everywhere. <br><br>  Of course, you can once again begin to talk about the fact that a <a href="http://tr.im/lUrk">resistive</a> touch screen cannot compare in quality with a capacitive one ... However, I will not argue with my own eyes.  And whatever technological differences between them stand, the output is pleasant and competitive!  Of course, we are not talking about multi-touch and related functions.  But according to my observations, the multitouch in its current form so far only has the character of ‚Äúwow effect‚Äù and nothing more (on my eeePC 1000H I found no special use for it, except maybe scrolling through the pages in the browser).  The problematic place is the angle of the screens, also become more responsive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The quality of the screen at altitude.  Good colors and brightness.  The only thing is that I sometimes turn off the auto-adjustment of the backlight.  Sometimes stupidly decides how much light to give to the screen.  Although it is possible that these are my cockroaches, because I like it when the screen shines brightly. <br>  Another pleasant moment is the height of the screen ... The fact is that the protective glass of the display is not deep inside, as it has become fashionable to do on many devices, but is at the same level.  The sides at the edges of the screen are not what protrude outside (ala Nokia 5800), but on the contrary they are hesitated on the sides.  Trifle, but nice.  True, perhaps this is not so great in terms of phone safety. <br><br><h4>  <b>In the living corner of film fans</b> </h4><br>  Communicator easily swallowed a 16-gigabyte memory card and did not even hiccup.  Before that, I managed for 2 years with a 4Gb card.  For this purchase I was inspired by the ability of Ayolita to play full-fledged DVD-rips.  How zadolbalo I recode movies under the screens of smartphones.  Thought it would never end.  But no, this handsome man twirls films with 700 and 1400 mb without a twinge of conscience, moreover, without any delay and with some sound!  Therefore, as soon as the card came, an overlooked series of House and Battlestar Galactica flew to it.  )) The only caveat, CorePlayer still does not support the format of AC3, until you have to be content with MP3. <br><br><h4>  <b>Navigation</b> </h4><br>  Since the device was brought to me from Russia, and I live in Israel, pre-installed on the Navitel Navigator device was not relevant for me.  Therefore, I started searching for a working version of iGo for the HTC Touch Cruise, I tried many different assemblies, nothing worked.  But after discussing this problem in one small forum, people helped me and I managed to launch iGo 2008 on the new ‚ÄúCruise‚Äù.  Everything immediately worked like a clock, without any glitches and brakes.  The device easily displays even three-dimensional models of buildings and does not think about drawing objects.  I wrote about eating a battery in GPS navigation mode in the previous part of the review, I will only say that consumption is very economical! <br><br><h4>  <b>GPRS, 3G, HSDPA</b> </h4><br>  Without any difficulty, I fed my Touch Cruise II both 3G and HSDPA networks.  It was written on the forums that supposedly while working with 3G networks, problems with the GSM-module begin and calls simply do not come.  I didn‚Äôt notice any problems while surfing, which I wish for you!  ))) <br>  The communicator is smart, so it monitors the most optimal connection on its own.  If HSDPA and 3G network are within reach, it is always connected to the first one.  If, on the other hand, there is a choice between GPRS and 3G, he chooses the second, respectively, as a faster and more optimal for the user.  Without any problems, you can disable the connection option via the UMTS-module (HSDPA and 3G) and use only GPRS, without fear of receiving bills for a substantial amount at the end of the month. <br><br><h4>  <b>Photography</b> </h4><br>  I didn‚Äôt expect anything special in terms of photography from HTC, because I knew that this was a weak point of a Taiwanese company.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the pictures taken.  See which, you can below ... <br> <a href="http://img4.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimag0013czf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9be/7f1/bc5/9be7f1bc58b422a24726f0330f946c55.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img9.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimag0021c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/93a/391/ef393a3919d39c477c40d798a2343940.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img21.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimag0017hue.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52f/d53/dc4/52fd53dc41e49a3aaa02da65ca538c1d.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img22.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimag0028u.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77a/9d5/908/77a9d5908d01b8eeb47a2457f8b13ade.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img17.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimag0037dko.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cc/634/c55/3cc634c55c74b8f9c1d561764918b553.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The board has a 3.2 megapixel camera, which corrects the situation.  One thing I can say for sure - these are far from the pictures that are obtained on the HTC Touch.  Of course, there can be no talk of any night shooting, since the device simply does not have a flash, but in the afternoon and in the evening I was rather pleased with the photos.  It is clear that they do not equal the pictures taken on Canon's soap cases, but you can manage to capture or capture documents of average quality without any problems. <br><br><h4>  <b>Disadvantages and wishes</b> </h4><br>  So that the review does not seem too cloying, I‚Äôll add a couple of tar spoons ... First, there is no accelerometer (G-sensor) in the device.  Having it today is certainly not critical, but at least interesting!  The model is far from cheap, but for some reason, it was not put in the basket.  Secondly, iolite sometimes freezes.  No, not so every day, but once a week it happens.  I suspect that some third-party program is to blame for everything, but which one has not yet figured out.  Because there was no such problem on a clean system.  But I believe that in time I will catch the parasite and cut off my ears.  )) <br>  * I started writing this part of the review a day ago.  During this time, the stability of the apparatus improved and the problem of suspensions disappeared.  Conclusion: check the new software well, it often brings us many surprises. <br><br>  <b>For dessert,</b> I would like to recommend to all Windows Mobile lovers, and especially to owners of HTC devices, one wonderful software.  We are talking about the <b><a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D85178">Second Today program</a></b> , which, as you might guess from its name, adds the second Today screen to you.  Which in turn can be put on one of the mechanical buttons.  Thus, you do not have to give up not on Manila, not on your favorite desktop plugins, such as SPB Pocket Plus, notes, alarm clocks and other things.  Highly recommend! <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/56/3709984_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709979_240x320.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>On this, let</b> me <b>sum up the series of articles</b> on the HTC Iolite aka Touch Cruise 2009. The device turned out glorious.  I would recommend it to people who appreciate compactness and good design, but are not ready to give up the capabilities of the communicator.  Pleasant to the touch materials of the case will not leave you indifferent to the new device.  Mechanical buttons and a scroll wheel will decorate and make more enjoyable the process of using the device.  These are not the thin and scanty buttons that some cell phone manufacturers have been trying to teach us for quite a long time.  On them it is really convenient and pleasant to reap.  Although, I would not make them doubled, because there are cases of wrong pressing. <br><br>  In any case, you get used to and love this device in a fairly short time.  )) The relatively weak sound from the speaker and the reset button, tucked under the cover, is the brightest minus of HTC Iolite.  But to film fans, for whom the mobile device is the main means of watching movies, I would still recommend looking more towards the HTC Touch HD and iPhone 3G.  There, you and the screen an order of magnitude more, and VGA-format with better color reproduction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61554/</a></p>
