Almost useless. </p><br><p>  Then, when I discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> video courses, I continued to use the same <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">anti-patterns</a> as in school days, but not so ugly: with the help of <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">VimWiki</a> and later with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> . </p><br><p>  Records were still poorly structured.  Look at this: I don‚Äôt even have enough <strong>motivation</strong> to simply open and look at what‚Äôs inside: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcf/0b4/d64/dcf0b4d64826e619391bb33d3aaad133.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  At some point, I understood what method of record keeping works best for me, and I want to share it. </p><br><p>  The basic idea is to <strong>project</strong> <u>our</u> memory into a <strong>recording</strong> (and not the lecturer's memory) using the principles of program development. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ed/5cf/f7d/9ed5cff7d96b3c486471bcb670e359ec.svg"></p><br><h1 id="neobhodimye-usloviya">  The necessary conditions </h1><br><p>  I guess you already know about <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dtake%2Bnotes">basic advice</a> , such as expressing thoughts through your words (from your vocabulary, with simpler terminology) or focusing on questions, answers, conclusions and evidence. </p><br><p>  I also assume that you are familiar with the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/nUOhG/2-1-introduction-to-chunking">technique of "chunking"</a> from the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">"Learning to learn"</a> or from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/">"Think like a mathematician</a> . <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/">"</a> </p><br><h1 id="sdelayte-tak-chtoby-horosho-chitalos">  Make it readable. </h1><br><p>  We, software developers, take code quality very seriously.  We do not like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code with the smell</a> . </p><br><p>  We communicate using code and invest extra time and energy <strong>in writing</strong> elegant code so that other developers can effectively read it.  Including ourselves: in the future, we literally become other people. </p><br><p>  The same approach seemed convenient to me for personal notes: you can <strong>optimize the search and reading of notes</strong> , applying a little more effort to writing. </p><br><h2 id="syroy-chernovik">  Raw draft </h2><br><p>  Write the title and sources (books, articles, scientific works, videos, whatever you use) in a specific block of information.  Start analyzing the first source.  While analyzing - add some key details. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/29f/032/cc529f032b09233b1ab060ae51c44314.gif"></p><br><h2 id="refaktoring">  Refactoring </h2><br><p>  Now select keywords, break long sentences, use a more complex hierarchy of bulleted lists, add subheadings.  Use Occam's Razor: Reduce the record several times without losing the original meaning. </p><br><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alopatindev/assets/master/how-to-take-notes-like-a-programmer/refactoring.gif"></p><br><p>  Continue to explore the rest of the sources and update the relevant records, add new information and specify the old. </p><br><p>  When a record becomes large, divide it into files or structure it altogether with folders. </p><br><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alopatindev/assets/master/how-to-take-notes-like-a-programmer/navigation.gif"></p><br><p>  How to choose a structure?  Choose one that will be convenient for <strong>you</strong> : imagine that you are looking for something in your notes.  How exactly will you search?  What is the shortest way to write fit? </p><br><h2 id="dobavte-podskazki-sebe-na-buduschee">  Add tips for your future </h2><br><p>  Tired of learning and you want to start doing something already?  Being pragmatic is good.  Add suggestions you might want to explore in the future with the TODO comment. </p><br><p>  Found a cool resource on a topic that has already been postponed?  Find the appropriate entry, add the source and continue doing what you did. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a67/97e/33c/a6797e33c5090269917fd09ae96eb8ed.png"></p><br><p>  TODO comments <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/%3FTodoCommentsConsideredHarmful">are considered antipattern by</a> some developers.  However, I still find them useful for personal projects and notes. </p><br><p>  You do not need to continue your research at the next review of the note.  A TODO comment is only a sign that you still do not know something well enough and you may want to improve your knowledge in a particular area if you meet it in practice. </p><br><h1 id="peresmotr-i-uluchshenie">  Revision and improvement </h1><br><p>  Suppose that it took some time and you decided to use your records.  You solve a specific problem and you need to quickly find something.  Being able to find information quickly is important: it lowers the chance of losing focus on the task you are trying to solve. </p><br><p>  Try searching in files: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a99/7f9/a5b/a997f9a5bf3d2f4204aa421fa08ea889.png"></p><br><p>  Did not find anything?  Possible reasons: </p><br><ul><li>  typo when entering a search query - check it first </li><li>  invalid keyword - the same idea has been described synonymously in the past </li><li>  typo in the recording itself </li></ul><br><p>  It's time to improve.  Find the entry manually and fix the problem with </p><br><ul><li>  typos corrections </li><li>  add keyword </li></ul><br><p>  The next time you get the same record quickly. </p><br><p>  In particularly strange cases, the recording will not be able to find again.  For example, recently I was looking for something related to mathematical statistics: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fb/30b/c6e/4fb30bc6e3fb2e76e908fb6d54f6a074.png"></p><br><p>  Not found  Wrote wrong? </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/030/d87/921030d874ff056e8bca102aa5c3bcb9.png"></p><br><p>  Nope  I googled something, but what the ... nonsense I found? </p><br><p>  Since I am not a native speaker of English, it took me a little more time to realize that it was a typo after typing. </p><br><p>  Misprints of rarely used words are normal, even if you are a native speaker.  A possible solution is to add a misspelled keyword so that you can quickly find such a record later. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2e/57e/9a8/f2e57e9a880f1040119174c33dc3c503.png"></p><br><p>  Another option is to use some clever search engine that supports fuzzy search. </p><br><p>  <strong>UPDATE</strong> : It turns out in <em>this</em> particular case it was, after all, a bad advice.  Instead of hurrying to write down a key word with a typo, it was first necessary to properly understand all these confusing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile">terms</a> for me and add ‚Äúquantile‚Äù as a valid keyword. </p><br><h2 id="obnovite-strukturu-zametok-v-sootvetstvii-s-vashey-pamyatyu">  Update your notes structure to match your memory. </h2><br><p>  Imagine that you could not find a note quickly, even when you tried to search for it manually.  Possible reasons: </p><br><ul><li>  the record is out of place </li><li>  the right place is difficult to determine <br><ul><li>  where would you put records about the notation ‚Äúbig O‚Äù: in the mathematical analysis or algorithms? </li></ul></li></ul><br><p>  How to fix it? </p><br><ul><li>  move the block or file to the right place </li><li>  add a link from one note to another </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a6/4b3/2f0/9a64b32f074ab160df15eeda95acb4f3.png"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/5b9/51d/8265b951dd1b4e7a4f2fa01cda1cffc9.png"></p><br><h2 id="otrefaktorte-esche-raz">  Reflect again </h2><br><p>  Suppose you did find what you were looking for, but it is impossible to understand what was written on the fly - then just simplify it again. </p><br><p>  Another common problem is to find a few notes, which should actually be one.  Simply merge such fragments into one note and put in the appropriate place. </p><br><h2 id="naydite-balans">  Find a balance </h2><br><p>  How not to overdo it all?  If you find yourself spending time searching for notes that are out of place - this is a sign that the structure is still bad.  Just fix every time you encounter this problem. </p><br><p> If you feel that it is difficult or time consuming - use something like the ‚Äúrule of three‚Äù: if you searched for this record two times in the wrong place, leave it as it is.  For the third time, refill. </p><br><h1 id="i-v-chem-smysl">  And what's the point? </h1><br><p>  You probably now say that I did not convince you that investing additional time <br>  writing quality notes is so important: they say it‚Äôs too boring or not applicable to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour work / study.  Maybe yes, maybe not. </p><br><p>  Recall the time when you were engaged in creative work, being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">in a state of flow</a> .  Sometimes you need to get some information and <strong>continue</strong> working without losing focus.  You can take this information from Google, but sometimes it is too specific: for example, your own conclusions about a particular topic or even project-specific things. </p><br><p>  Since it cannot be found on the net, you are using your notes.  And then the crucial point: if you can quickly find these notes - then you will not lose focus at work.  And if not - interrupt and still lose time on the search.  Technically, this is the same as being interrupted by someone. </p><br><p> <a href="http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/0ba/2f9/b6c0ba2f954230aac5669f40e578afe2.png"></a> </p><br><p>  And then you need to return to your creative state of consciousness and continue working.  Just imagine how much energy it takes from you. </p><br><p>  Does it still seem that writing notes in such a way takes too much time?  But you do have time to practice, right?  Think again.  Interrupts often steal from us a lot of time from practice. </p><br><p>  In any case, this is just a strategy: in some cases <strong>it may</strong> not be applicable, so use it wisely. </p><br><h1 id="cheklist">  Check list </h1><br><ul><li>  Write a raw draft with sources and poor structure. </li><li>  Periodically refactor your notes: <br><ul><li>  Highlight keywords </li><li>  Break long sentences </li><li>  Improve the hierarchy of bulleted lists </li><li>  Use subheadings </li><li>  Simplify the text, reduce it </li><li>  Too long documents?  - Split them into files </li><li>  Too many files?  - Improve directory structure </li></ul></li><li>  Add TODO comments </li><li>  Enjoy your creative work without losing focus!  ‚ÄúGrab‚Äù notes when you need them: <br><ul><li>  Can't find a note fast? <br><ul><li>  Fix typos </li><li>  Add keywords (sometimes incorrectly written keywords) </li><li>  The note is not in its place?  - Move the block / file to the correct place. </li><li>  Is the place ambiguous?  - Add links from other places </li></ul></li><li>  Can not understand what they wrote?  - Reflect again </li><li>  Found duplicates / fragments of the same note in different places?  - combine them </li></ul></li></ul><br><p>  Not so difficult, right? </p><br><p>  This publication is a translation of <a href="https://alopatindev.github.io/2018/01/14/how-to-take-notes-like-a-programmer">its own article</a> . </p><br><p> <strong>UPDATE:</strong> instead of <code>git grep</code> + copy-paste + search by page, now I use <strong><a href="https://github.com/jonathanklee/ngp">ngp</a> + <a href="">script</a></strong> (+ change in <a href="https://github.com/alopatindev/dotfiles/blob/caabfb381d369b63ef62557ff128cd4283cc80d4/common/home/.config/ngp/ngprc">ngprc</a> ) which opens Jupyter files in the browser and even <strong>goes to the corresponding anchor</strong> on the page.  Unfortunately, this project does not support <a href="https://github.com/jonathanklee/ngp/issues/37">Unicode</a> , but there is already a temporary solution. </p></div>
