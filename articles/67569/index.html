      I was forced to send the <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/%3Fpid%3D438">D-Link DSM-520</a> due to the fact that it does not support the rapidly gaining popularity of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264">H.264</a> codec and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKV">MKV</a> container.  Disappointed with the very expensive follower <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/%3Fpid%3D547">D-Link DSM-750</a> , which may be good as Microsoft Media Center Extender, but in the UPnP client mode it‚Äôs bad, I decided to change the brand and look for luck on the side. <br><br>  Devices without Wi-Fi (or with 802.11g) did not interest me, so the mainstream went right past.  After a month of searching in vain, a good friend (the developer of the UPnP AV server MediaTomb) said that some startup was making a killer piece of hardware that, in his opinion, satisfies all my needs.  This was Xtreamer. <br><br>  After 2 weeks, the baby Xtreamer (it is really surprisingly very small, slightly shorter in size, but slightly thicker than a videotape) was already in my house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b34/b67/b11/b34b67b1194f8d046a1ed25eaea55a24.jpg"><br><br>  Having unpacked (fans of deboxing, I'm sorry, I am very limited in time in life) I connected the device to my home system.  The connection did not take up problems, manufacturers carefully put the adapter with a plug under the Russian sockets in the kit (unlike the D-Link). <br><br>  Shock happened after clicking on Power.  The device screamed like a flock of mammoths that were simultaneously pinched by trunks.  Having recovered, I guessed that this sound comes from the cooling system fan, which is positioned in such a way that the turntable support prevents the flow of air out of the box.  I was not very pleased, but I found in the device options the ability to turn off the fan, which I actually did. <br><br>  Later, the manufacturer will release firmware 1.02, which will solve the sound problem of the propeller, but at the time of the appearance of my device, it was still in the project. <br><br>  Thanks to the second opus, I am writing a review of the device just now, and not a month ago, when I received it.  The fact is that there is also a UPnP AV server in the player, which requires a flash drive or a 2.5 hard disk. ‚ÄùSo, as it turned out, the player also cannot show anything without storage. Apparently there is no way to buffer. Since I don‚Äôt I knew, I could see nothing, until I began to update the firmware from the flash drive. After the update, I forgot to pull out the latest player from the player and it unexpectedly played the video. the moment Xtreamer started working on 5+, and I was finally able to  write about him. <br><br>  Summing up, I will say that the device has the following advantages: <br>  - Russian interface. <br>  - Wireless module.  (Of course, do not expect 1080p files to be played through the air) <br>  - A huge number of supported <a href="http://www.xtreamer.net/97/content-pages/Media-Files-Support.aspx">formats</a> .  (I personally did not find what the player would not digest) <br>  - Price and delivery. <br>  - Operational updates and support.  (the guys decided to take the market) <br><br>  From minuses while I can select only the popping fan. <br><br>  You can learn more about the device on the <a href="http://www.xtreamer.net/">official website</a> .  There you can also order a device with delivery via EMS / Russian Post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67569/</a></p>
