Usually for these purposes I used PostIt and / or lined notebooks of a small format, which is convenient, but very wasteful, both in terms of money (well, relatively, of course), and in terms of the resources of the planet and other "green" things, and backyard 21st century after all =) And then I came across a habra-news <a href="http://manni2.habrahabr.ru/blog/81913/">LCD replacement paper notepad</a> and I decided to buy such a thing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><br>

    <h3>  Cost of </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.myboogieboard.com/magento/">Official price</a> . <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  The tablet </td><td>  2 pieces </td><td>  $ 59.94 </td></tr><tr><td>  Magnetic mount </td><td>  2 pieces </td><td>  $ 4.96 </td></tr><tr><td>  Stylus </td><td>  2 pieces </td><td>  $ 5.94 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  Total </td><td>  $ 70.84 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  Sending and shipping (to Moscow) </td><td>  $ 42.50 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">  Total </td><td>  $ 113.34 </td></tr></tbody></table>  <i>* Data is given from the invoice.</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that 1 tablet costs $ 35, apparently bulk discounts =) <br><br><h3>  Clothes </h3><br><br>  I ordered it on the <a href="http://myboogieboard.com/">official website</a> with a set of "special stages".  In the conditions on the site it is written that the parcels are sent within 7 days and in a week the purchase was indeed sent.  Not quickly, comparing with other stores, but in general I was not in a hurry.  And now, a month later (I think, it‚Äôs not only our mail that distinguished) that the package was delivered to me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/298/c48/b6f/298c48b6f343eb92ab6bf7622a169582.jpg"><br><br>  As it turned out, the tablets themselves came, but the magnetic mounts and additional styluses were not put to me, although after contacting the support service, they were sent to me separately.  I will wait.  The tablets themselves (ordered a pair) are packed in non-dull cardboard boxes with a ring label, apparently a tribute to environmental friendliness.  But yes, I don‚Äôt drink water out of the box =) Inside the tablet itself, the instruction on one piece of paper, the screen wiping cloth (very good quality by the way) and the stylus (after walking around the site, I didn‚Äôt understand that it comes with it, therefore for some reason ordered additional). <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62a/fc2/88e/62afc288ef122f3900b1c0b46c6c7da4.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet itself is 222x140 mm in size, the drawing area itself is 183x125mm, generally comparable to a sheet of A5-sized paper.  The thickness of the main part is 3mm, the parts where the cleaning button and the battery are 6mm.  In general, quite compact and with this space is enough.  The stylus is telescopic, quite thick - 8mm in diameter, length from 117 to 170 mm.  The tip is rather thin and firm, like a pen of a ballpoint pen, only without a ball.  There is no place for mounting the stylus on the tablet itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/4a7/afc/2cc4a7afc389daa808c6bdd97ded7b4a.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/7392/thin.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Using </h3><br>  It is convenient to hold the tablet in your hand, but if you put it on the table it slides, because  there are no legs on the back, i.e.  need to hold your hand. <br>  Screen with a matte finish, no prints on it.  It is also easy to clean.  Because  It works on reflective technology, it is perfectly visible in the light, when there is insufficient lighting, the image loses contrast.  The stylus slides well on it, but I would like more lightness, now it looks like sliding a solid pencil over paper, apparently the matter is in the material / shape of the stylus.  The manufacturer promises a scratch-resistant coating, while I tend to believe it, there are no scratches from the stylus / nails. <br>  In general, it is not necessary to ‚Äúadjust‚Äù to drawing; it is slightly harder to write on it with this plan, since  the lines are obtained as from a marker on paper (thick), and you have to write quite large.  The screen is sensitive to the force of pressure, but I would have done so that at normal pressure the lines would be thinner.  Maybe try to buy a protective film to achieve this. <br>  When you click on the erase button, the screen is cleared, the procedure is very similar to rebuilding a page on electronic paper. <br><br><h3>  Verdict </h3><br>  In general, a very good product, if you are completely satisfied with its functionality.  You can draw diagrams, make notes, etc.  You can jot down a shopping list or a small tudu for the future, which I often use so that some working moments do not get out of my head.  Well, or just draw when you are talking on the phone or thinking about something. <br>  From what I would like: the ability to erase not everything at once, but in the eraser mode, and the ability to save the image to a computer would also be very useful.  Developers are aware of this, and perhaps in the future, such a product will be released. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Price </li><li>  Quality </li><li>  The convenience of use </li><li>  Environmental friendliness </li></ul>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Limited functionality </li><li>  Normally pressed lines are thick </li></ul><br>  <i>Photos by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/mi55er/">mi55er</a></i> <br><br>  <i>high-res photos with the Habr logo, to study the image on the screen, who cares <a href="">here</a> (4 meters)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97117/</a></p>
