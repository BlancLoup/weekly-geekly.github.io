  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sys.adminstvo as leisure or "Son, make already at home wi-fi"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The third school year I teach ‚ÄúSystem Administration for Schoolchildren‚Äù in 1C: Programmers Club ( <a href="http://club.1c.ru/">http://club.1c.ru</a> ). <br>  Definitely, our classes among others in the Club are the most fun.  Not without some pride, I would characterize the atmosphere in the classroom as an explosive mixture of ‚ÄúComputerra‚Äù of the sample of the year of 2002 and the lessons of work (hangover exhaust from the Trudovik, please subtract). <br>  And these awkward moments, when from other audiences they come to us to ask us to laugh more quietly ... <br><br>  But let's order.  When the time came to implement the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis course, a small competition among potential authors / teachers was organized at 1C, and there was a strict requirement - a purely practical orientation of the classes.  So, the first module is fully devoted to how to organize the work of SOHO, having at its disposal a handful of components, a couple of disks with software, a screwdriver and a crimp. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should be understood that 1C: The Club of Programmers is closer to the circle of young technicians than to any courses.  My opinion: if the subject is interesting, then the person will deal with them regardless of the difficulty of comprehension (taking this opportunity, I send my greetings to the guys from ‚ÄúAlgorithms‚Äù, we usually prevent them from doing so). <br>  Our "SysAdminism" is a bit different, programming is not enough.  We solve the problem of waking up and holding interest in IT for those guys who want to first ‚Äúsee what and how‚Äù, and then decide whether they like it or not.  I have in groups and those who are tired of programming and want a year to take a break from ‚Äúbackpacks‚Äù and other ‚Äúsalespeople‚Äù.  Therefore, you need to be cool and fun.  But it is also true that ‚ÄúSystem Administration for Schoolchildren‚Äù is not a fake discipline at all and not just hihana-hahanki.  Let's just say, these are the real skills of the PLUS ‚Äúhihi-hahanki‚Äù in the process. <br><br>  What is included in "real skills"?  The first module begins with the fact that the children are given a set of computer parts and a screwdriver with the task to turn the first one into a working unit by the second with the task.  Then the spiral is unwound: the OS is put, application software (simultaneously we deal with the console, batch files, MMC, registry, security, software licensing issues ...), the network is pulled (topologies, ‚Äúhow does the hub differ from the switch‚Äù, 8P8C, OSI model, TCP / IP stack, Wi-Fi ...).  Next, the router is configured and, finally, the children have at their disposal a ready-made infrastructure created by their own hands. <br>  Of course, each lesson is preceded by a theoretical-historical educational program.  And the teacher does the same as the students, and at the same time explains how he does it.  Or, if it fails, explains how it happened and how to fix it.  An important point: when a child asks, ‚ÄúWhat will happen if you do this and that?‚Äù - I always answer: ‚ÄúWhat to ask, do it and see for yourself, but be ready to fix it.‚Äù  The main idea that I am trying to convey to the students is a conscious approach to their activities.  No need to learn the algorithms of certain actions.  You need to understand exactly what you are doing and what consequences you expect.  A particular consequence is the mysterious ability to understand the interfaces and read the messages of the programs.

      By the way, about troubleshooting.  When a schoolboy thoughtfully ‚Äúhangs‚Äù over a half-assembled sistemnik, he does not ‚Äúpick at the giblets,‚Äù he ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">examines the response of a system with one variable parameter, other things fixed</a> ‚Äù.  Yes, we learn that the search for a bat of memory in its essence is a [scientific] experiment. <br>  In general, this is paying off, and the second module includes the majority with a large degree of autonomy and confidence in their own actions.  The second module is virtualization, ActiveDirectory with all companion, PowerShell, Linux (including integration into AD).  Separate individuals, using the skills acquired in parallel in the adjacent courses, do what I can not repeat without thinking.  For example, they independently write an http-server on PowerShell [here is a joke about bread and a trolleybus] and demonstrate the consequences of DNS being compromised and collecting data by phishing pages (PHP).  And it's very cool for me, as a teacher, to watch. <br><br>  Once, at one of the big 1C seminars, I was asked, they say, why should children know Windows Server and AD?  I was then amazed at the question.  After all, a person graduates from school, gets a job, and there, most likely, a directory service, and he doesn‚Äôt even know how his workplace functions.  "I changed the date on my computer, but now I can not log in with my account!" - adult uncles and aunts, programmers and testers, this is often done, what are you ... <br><br>  Here is an example of assembling a computer (open lesson before parents): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKx4M_j-4rAw">www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx4M_j-4rAw</a> <br>  Here's a crimp: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnonlwHAR6NI">www.youtube.com/watch?v=nonlwHAR6NI</a> <br><br>  From the very first day for me all the students are young colleagues.  You share your experience with a colleague!  And you do not decide what you can tell and what not.  With children, of course, not easy.  However, the return is great ... It is not true that modern children do not want to learn, you just have to find the right motivation.  The younger generation absorbs knowledge like a sponge. It is possible that after a while you will learn something from your wards yourself. <br>  And it is beautiful. <br><br>  Alexey Drobyshev, author of the course and sysadmin "1C" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236535/</a></p>
