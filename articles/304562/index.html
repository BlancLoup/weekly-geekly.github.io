  <section class="page js-page"><h1>June IT news</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Emoji to the movies</b> <br>  The news, which has little to do with the world of high technology, but will be of interest to today's young people: Sony Pictures has planned for August next year to release a cartoon about our good electronic friends and part-time bad habits - emoji.  It is known that the creators of ‚ÄúLilo and Stitch 2‚Äù and ‚ÄúIgor‚Äù work on the script, and the working title is ‚ÄúEmojimovie: Express Yourself‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea4/d7c/fda/ea4d7cfdae3887ecc5a510a6081e1580.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Windows got a wallet</b> <br>  This summer, Windows promises the world the first global update of its "dozens".  Under the qualitative improvement will fall and mobile platform.  In particular, NFC will finally start functioning normally.  Using the Wallet 2.0 application, you can manage your accounts and easily pay with your smartphone where it is provided. <br><br>  And if fate leaves you in the US, in some stores you will also receive a discount for using Windows 10. All top models, as well as those that go down in history Lumia 950 and 950 XL, will receive an update. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>MegaChip from Intel goes to the people</b> <br>  At the end of last year, Intel announced the start of production of a unique 72-core Xeon Phi processor, the most powerful in the company's lineup.  It was developed specifically for complex computing systems and artificial intelligence, but now this ‚Äúmonster‚Äù decided to start selling to simple PC users as well.

      For only $ 6300, you will receive this unique processor with 16 GB of internal memory MCDRAM and a possible expansion to 384 GB DDR4.  Efficiency in performance and power consumption is guaranteed.  Delivery starts in September. <br><br>  <b>The most powerful computer in China</b> <br>  15 years ago, in the Middle Kingdom, they began to build their supercomputer in order to once and for all get rid of technological dependence on the United States.  And finally, officially on Monday, this development was recognized as <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/2016/06/">the fastest computer in the world</a> . <br><br>  The performance in the operating mode is 93 petaflops, but if necessary, you can ‚Äúoverclock‚Äù and up to 125.4 petaflops.  Most surprisingly, this miracle was built solely on local ShenWei processors.  There is something to learn. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/dfe/191/4c1dfe19128fcc655ae72e8f04373be0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1000 core processor</b> <br>  At the other end of the world, the University of California at Davis tried to set another statistical record by creating a 1000-core processor.  The performance here is not so crazy, only 115 billion operations per second.  But another thing is amazing: the processor can run on a single AA battery, that is, in the nominal mode it consumes only 0.7 watts. <br><br>  However, the model is unlikely to go to the people, since even the creators themselves admit that beautiful figures have nothing to do with the effective use of this processor in desktop devices. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft sometimes admits mistakes</b> <br>  At the E3 gaming conference, Microsoft introduced its smallest Xbox One S. gaming console. At the same time, the developers officially acknowledged that they were too enthusiastic about reworking the platform, having missed both the aesthetic and the gaming component itself, literally giving leadership in the PlayStation 4 segment. <br><br>  Xbox One S, which is 40% less than the original, without losing performance, should save Microsoft from half the complaints.  From the other half will save the new part of the game God of War and Project Scorpio - a service for combining players with PCs and consoles. <br><br>  <b>WWDC 2016 without sensations</b> <br>  Apple, in turn, held the annual conference of developers WWDC 2016. The entire uninitiated world was waiting for the announcement of the new iPhone or at least the smart watches, but everything turned out according to the protocol - only software and applications. <br><br>  In particular, iOS 10 for mobile devices was announced, macOS Sierra for desktop, watchOS 3 for wrist and tvOS 10 for those who like to spend time in front of the TV.  Conference participants received beta versions of new products immediately, and mere mortals will begin to receive updates only in the fall.  In the meantime, modest news for another camp: iMessage on Android can not wait. <br><br>  <b>Dell launches Steam Machine to the masses</b> <br>  It seems that in the world of gaming consoles and computers a new small revolution is coming - the Steam Machine: computers on a Linux-like operating system SteamOS, optimized exclusively for games.  The first model was created in 2014, but only now the idea began to pay off. <br><br>  Dell, based on its popular line of AlienWare, created the Steam Machine series as a budget version ($ 449), popular ($ 749) and hardcore ($ 899).  At the previously mentioned E3 forum, a presentation was held, where representatives of the American corporation stated that the first batch of devices had been completely bought up on preorder literally within a few days. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d42/e6c/74a/d42e6c74a9476dde1546a0e42295408d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Moto Z as a killer of modular phones.</b> <br>  While Google is inspiring, it disappoints its fans with announcements about the modular phone Project Ara, Motorola took the bull by the horns and released Moto Z. The entire presentation earlier this month was held under the slogan "Other modular phones will fail." <br><br>  Possible improvements Moto Z: good old replaceable panels, a column, developed jointly with JBL, a projector, a projection keyboard and, of course, an additional battery.  In general, the minimum set for a person who wants to impress his geek friends. <br><br>  <b>Nokia is betting on IoT</b> <br>  The Finnish company Nokia, which seems to have finally abandoned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãre-capturing the market with smartphones, presented to the public a <a href="http://networks.nokia.com/portfolio/products/7368-isam-ont-g-240wz-a">unique hub</a> for combining all smart electronic devices under one roof. <br><br>  The uniqueness lies in the support of 80 thousand different devices (at the moment), among which are not only mobile gadgets, but also numerous sensors, from monitors to managers.  Nokia is thus hoping to occupy a fairly spacious IoT niche, once again becoming a technological dominant unit in the market for advanced technologies. <br><br>  <b>Driverless roads by 2035</b> <br>  According to a <a href="http://press.ihs.com/press-release/automotive/autonomous-vehicle-sales-set-reach-21-million-globally-2035-ihs-says">study by IHS Automotive</a> , by 2035, 21 million autopilot vehicles will roll onto public roads.  The whole theory is based on the plans of the USA, Japan and a number of European countries to actively invest in this technology.  At the same time, as IHS notes, by 2025 only 600 thousand models will be produced.  Further growth will be associated with a decrease in the cost of cars and the incredible popularity of autopilots. <br><br>  <b>Tesla Model X is going crazy</b> <br>  However, so far even cars with a driver behind the wheel get into an accident due to the fault of the autopilot.  At least, Puzant Ozbag claims this, writing a complaint to Tesla about Model X. In his words, when Puzant‚Äôs spouse tried to park at home, the car turned on the autopilot mode on its own, squeezed the gas all the way, and as a result rammed the wall. <br><br>  At the same time, Tesla claims that such an incident is impossible, if only because the autopilot is not activated at a speed of less than 29 km / h.  And the woman herself is to blame for the accident, she mixed up the gas and brake pedals.  In general, at the moment, Puzzant is collecting papers and preparing to go to court. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e9/608/502/3e960850238bab3fe67435b6117aca03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And what news of June would you mark? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304562/</a></p>
