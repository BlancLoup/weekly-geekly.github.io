  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DJI quadcopters from AliExpress on April 1 - a joke?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I haven‚Äôt written anything about copters for a long time, winter still drives equipment and me home with it.  Of course, I sometimes go out to <a href="https://vk.com/wall21489364_6964">flash light bulbs</a> , but in general there is nothing to talk about winter flights, except for complaints about a rapidly ending battery and freezing hands.  So recently there have been materials about anything but quadrocopters.  But, sunny days increasingly visit Moscow, that is, more and more pulls somewhere to fly and AliExpress really surprised with its landing page with DJI copters, where the prices were really divided in half ... a joke for April 1? <br><br>  I propose to refresh your knowledge of the current DJI technique and consider in more detail the 4 presented drons: Phantom 3 Standart / Advanced / Professional and DJI inspire 1 Pro.  And I will not forget about the most expensive "selfie stick" DJI Osmo, which is also <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/si">represented</a> there.  Flew. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/99c/be4/8f899cbe4f2f8895b604a3252507ba53.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <br><h2>  1. DJI Phantom 3 Standart </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84b/6f2/8a6/84b6f28a6126380925e9eafba0e8b6ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In my opinion, the capabilities of the ‚Äústandard‚Äù are enough for the absolute majority of amateur footage.  It flies 1 km, that is, much further than you will see it.  Can easily resist the wind of 16 meters per second.  Stabilization of the camera is 3-axis and works perfectly.  For one flight can overpower 25 minutes.  It removes it in the resolution, which can be found in few places where it can be reproduced in all its glory (2.7k).  True, if you are a fan of ‚Äúlooking to the future‚Äù, where all devices will be able to show 4k videos and people from the future will review your old videos for 2017 and admire that you take it into account, then the following options are more suitable for you.  And this kopter for those who live today, takes off his trips, his family, plays with his dog or even sometimes removes weddings for friends. <br><br>  As for the price, on the last day of the AliExpress sale it can be taken for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sb">$ 529.99</a> *, and if you do it through cashback and <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sc">return 7%</a> , then the final price will be $ 493 (~ $ 33,000).  So far this is the most advantageous offer I've ever met. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/726/ab7/71c/726ab771c7f6537c37d5ad897f702de3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  2. DJI Phantom 3 Advanced </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/453/0f0/31a/4530f031a242d1d0b40f5f12e649c04e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike the Standart version - this one already knows how to fly 2 times farther, that is, if you like to fly far away and you have enough 2 km radius, then this is your option.  The camera resolution is the same (2.7K), however, it is difficult to call it a disadvantage, but the flight time is 2 minutes less - 23 minutes, versus 25. It may not be very significant, but still unpleasant.  But it is equipped with GLONASS, that is, it will be useful for determining its position in difficult conditions.  He also has an ultrasonic sensor for flying indoors.  The rest is still cool: 3-axis suspension, 16m / s flight speed, FPV-broadcast during the flight to your phone or tablet and of course all the usual functionality for flight or automatic return. <br><br>  The price for this version is naturally more expensive, and will be <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sd">$ 790</a> , and if you do it through cashback and <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sc">return 7%</a> , then the final price will be $ 734 (~ 49,800r). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d3/a2d/f3f/2d3a2df3f1c8c303eaf1f9e687c9b4f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  3. DJI Phantom 3 Professional </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/500/944/e3f50094417d529611b924f424784d49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This option is for modest professionals.  Outwardly, he looks at all phantoms, so that a typical passer-by will not notice the gold mark on the case and will not appreciate the owner‚Äôs coolness.  But for a modest pro, it‚Äôs much more important that the camera on it already shoots in 4k and it‚Äôs good not only to look at 4k TV or show offspring, but also just to sprinkle the right moment when installing video without compromising the quality of the final FHD video.  Otherwise, it is very similar to Advanced: there is both a glonass and an ultrasonic sensor and the range of its flight is also 2 km and the suspension is also the same steep, 3-axis.  In general, you need to look at the Pro version because of its camera.  For this modification, they are now asking for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/se">$ 989.99</a> , traditionally I propose <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sc">to return 7%</a> via cashback and the final price will be $ 920 (~ 62,400 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c47/dde/620/c47dde620316f1c62f89ecd0839c8045.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  4. DJI inspire 1 Pro </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/582/b37/83a/582b3783a3615491fd223fd1a2215fde.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this quadcopter for the most ambitious pilots who even have their own manual operator to control the camera from the second console.  This monster can fly for 5 kilometers, so it is easy to work on the cinema without leaving the hotel.  The camera has a Zenmuse X5, which, of course, shoots in 4k and, in addition, it can change lenses for more suitable for a specific task.  But, since the copter turned out to be quite heavy, the time of its flight is not very encouraging - only 18 minutes, but this is, in general, sufficient for shooting almost any double.  As for the price, it bites even with discounts, amounting to <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sf">$ 4,199.99</a> *, but 7% of this amount, which <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sc">can be returned,</a> will be as much as $ 294 and the total cost will be "only" $ 3,905.99 (~ 265,000 rubles) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dcd/6b1/37a/dcd6b137aca7446ac36d86f46ee43caf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h2>  5. DJI Osmo </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9c/76a/a66/c9c76aa6633848633cd1e675184ce302.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you do not need to fly anywhere, but you want to take the most high-quality and smooth video from your hands - DJI Osmo comes to the rescue.  This is a boxed solution, where there is a camera and a stabilization system and a stick with a place to mount your phone.  The phone is here in the role of a screen for a live broadcast of what is happening.  There are several camera controls on the stick that will allow you to direct the desired degree of shooting to it or turn it into a ‚Äúselfie‚Äù mode.  My personal experience with this gadget showed that it is quite a handy device that is comfortable to hold in hand.  That is, its weight (201 gr.) Does not strain, and the buttons are very organic.  Naturally, the camera shoots at 4k (in general, this is a camera from DJI inspire 1) and absolutely no complaints about the quality of it.  There are <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sg">complaints</a> about the cost of Osmo - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sg">$ 589.99</a> *, which personally seems a little expensive for a selfie stick with a camera.  However, it does not have full-fledged analogs, so there is no choice, and with a <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/sc">cashback of 7%</a> it will cost us $ 548 (~ 37,000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d9/ea9/f85/5d9ea9f85e7369bccc533f8fa0b4dab6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
