      This feature is designed to organize high-quality live broadcasts on the Internet, in the Live Stream mode (live stream) <br><br>  <b>What is special about it?</b> <br><br>  A comprehensive solution of Torrent Stream, due to the use of peer-to-peer technology, now allows you to organize not only high-quality AVoD services (audio and video on demand) on the Internet, but also to organize live broadcasts in 720p and 1080p formats, at low cost, (The term ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù - This is Full HD + stable stream, at maximum speed for a custom Internet channel) <br><br>  The creation and maintenance of the AVoD service and channels with live broadcasts based on the Torrent Stream technology allows for savings of up to 99.9% in relation to all <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTT">OTT (Over the Top)</a> solutions based on centralized data delivery. <br>  <b>And a little bit of PR:</b> Today, the Torrent Stream software is superior in implementation and functionality to all existing analogues in the world that use peer-to-peer technology and, in particular, the Bittorrent protocol in organizing AVoD services (check how VoD technology works, you can use the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/torrentstream/blog/144046/">P2P</a> extension <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/torrentstream/blog/144046/">YouTube</a> ), therefore, we are confident that we will be able to present the Live Stream feature at the proper level and hope that our implementation will open up new opportunities for many and bring a new live broadcast on the Internet to a new level. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Software installation:</b> <br><br>  1. Uninstall the previously installed version of the Torrent Stream software (for those who already have the Torrent Stream software installed) Instructions for reinstalling the plugin <br><br>  2. Download and install the test version of Torrent Stream 1.0.6 Full software (currently only for Windows) <br>  <a href="">Direct link to download</a> or <a href="http://torrentstream.org/downloads/TorrentStream_1.0.6.0.exe.torrent">download via torrent</a> <br><br>  <b>Test # 1</b> Full HD (1080p) video codec (h264 / AVC) audio (AAC), bit rate up to 9 Mbps !!! <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  To participate in the test number 1, you must comply with the minimum requirements: <br><br>  - Internet connection speed should be at least 10 Mbit / c (Please, on lower channels, do not even try to start playing this test, in order not to spoil the impression of the technology and not mislead us with statements that something is buggy and .P ) <br>  - The power of your processor should allow you to play video in the specified resolution with the appropriate bit rate, using no more than 60% of the resources.  You can also try to turn on TS Player settings (desktop player included in Torrent Stream 1.0.6 Full installation package), the option ‚Äúuse video accelerator‚Äù to remove the load from the CPU (this option does not work with all GPUs, but you should try ) <br><br>  1. <b>Playing in the web player.</b>  Go to the test page <a href="http://torrentstream.org/stream/test.php">torrentstream.org/stream/test.php</a> and start playing <br><br>  2. <b>Playing in the desktop player</b> . <br><br>  Option ‚Ññ1 Download the test file (analog / modification of the torrent file) and start playing it in TS Player (desktop player included in the Torrent Stream 1.0.6 Full installation software package) Download file: test.tslive <br><br>  Option # 2 Copy the content ID (Content ID) and use it as a source by entering it in the appropriate field of the player (Media - Open Torrent Stream Player).  Content ID: 5260b3af34b6e043fc2e74bf4721dacac936e6f6 <br><br>  <b>What are we testing?</b> <br><br>  The main test is to test the software in terms of the efficiency of data exchange between peers. <br><br>  <b>For information:</b> We did not conduct any synthetic tests and have no idea how to simulate such a model.  Therefore, this is our first real test, therefore, if anything, do not judge strictly and treat with understanding.  (if someone has the knowledge and can provide us with the necessary software environment for conducting synthetic tests, we will be very grateful) <br><br>  <b>Important!</b>  The main broadcast goes on a regular 100 Mbps channel, so it‚Äôs very important that your equipment settings and your network be able to maintain a normal return, since without a full peering, I hope you understand, the channel cannot work with more than 10 people.  Therefore, before participating in the test, bring your equipment into a state that allows you to distribute streams, and not just work on reception (turn on UPnP routers, set up a firewall, etc., etc.) In general, consider participating in the test with maximum responsibility. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> We deliberately decided to use the test with such a high resolution and bit rate to limit the possibilities of our main outgoing channel as much as possible and to see in field conditions how our software will cope with the distribution of streams in a task where the channel is limited to distribution to a maximum of ten users. <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> .  If you have delays / departures on buffering during playback, look at the download speed, and if the picture slows down (frame / slideshow), look at the processor load, since the translation is very heavy and eats a lot of resources (not intended for weak computers) <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Campaign we got excited by issuing a test broadcast with such a bit rate.  We will select something simpler for the next test and then everyone will be able to test the software properly. <br><br>  Well, in order to attract the maximum number of testers in simultaneous connection, today (06/22/2012) at 9:45 pm Kyiv time, we will launch the retransmission of the EURO 2012 Germany-Greece semifinal match in test mode, and before the match there will be a broadcast music channel. <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  Test translation is changed, to broadcast with a more gentle bitrate.  To avoid confusion, I opened a new topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/torrentstream/blog/146386/">Test ‚Ññ2</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146358/</a></p>
