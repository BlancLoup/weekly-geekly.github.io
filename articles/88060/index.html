I will not describe the process of searching, finishing, adding, it is worthy of a separate, tearful article.  I would like to pay attention to one small, but rather important point. <br><br>  Surely, any company has a certain customer base.  As a rule, it is divided into 2 categories: physical persons and legal entities.  When the database is up to hundreds of customers, this classification is enough.  Actually, this amount can be kept in my head, remembering the names of the secretaries.  But if the base includes several thousand such clients, and yes even all kinds of resellers, partners, etc.? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <a href="http://www.hottelecom.net/">Our company</a> sells virtual phone numbers.  Customers are very different, ranging from individuals and small online stores, ending with corporations with branches in different countries.  Of course, the virtual number can be used in different ways.  Someone uses it to attract customers from other countries and cities, and someone launches scam and deceives unsuspecting citizens.  Unfortunately, this can not be avoided.  In order to separate <s>flies from cutlets of</s> normal clients from fraudsters, the following classification of clients was created and implemented in the CPM. <br>  <b>Usual.</b>  As a rule, it fills in a maximum of information about itself, the IP address is the same as the country of registration, the name on the credit card is the same as the name on the registration form. <br><br>  Regular customers, in turn, are divided into <i>blondes</i> , <i>thrifty</i> , and <i>brain eaters</i> . <br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/namalyshe/view/180825/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/743/fa5/ae3/743fa5ae343db1eda087aaa86d833ba0.jpg" width="500" height="327"></a> <br>  <u><b>Blondes</b></u>  Blondes, by the way, are men.  Such a client, as a rule, asks a lot of <s>stupid</s> questions, calls to the phone not the operator Sergey, but Olenka (since she has a very nice voice), etc.  There is one big plus from the blonde: she (he) is very talkative and the word of mouth effect works.  We are approached by girlfriends (friends) blondes. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/namalyshe/view/180827/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d34/e4c/a17/d34e4ca17a8248cf67549cd052c257b0.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> <br>  <u><b>Economical</b></u> .  Waiting for promotions, discounts and have time to successfully break into them.  They buy cheap promotional numbers, while demanding more discounts, promising to buy more in the future.  There are two ways.  Tell him firmly that the price is fixed, or go to meet him throwing off a bit (if possible).  As a rule, the customer will make a purchase in both cases.  BUT!  In the first case, he will buy and just be satisfied, in the second - he will buy and start shouting loudly on the forums or blogs HALYAVA!  And a stream of similar hunters will slowly flow to you for cheapness.  Of course, this does not always happen to everyone.  There is no universal recipe. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/namalyshe/view/180826/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a97/46a/79a/a9746a79a2c63018728cfe2420561eca.jpg" width="333" height="500"></a> <br>  <u><b>Brain eaters</b></u>  A species that is very common in nature.  As a rule, he preliminarily investigates all the competitors and comes to us with a good deal of nerves.  For a long time he tells us how expensive we are, or vice versa is cheap (no problem, we will sell more expensive), etc.  He diligently unbalances the support service, asks extremely many questions that are not in the business and do not always buy.  A person who is a priori aggressive, is unlikely to make a purchase. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/lpustobaeva/view/49937/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/363/658/d1f363658b8dc2a60d832131357dd506.jpg" width="333" height="500" title="Pensive)" alt=")"></a> <br>  It is difficult to distinguish a brain eater from a client <u><b>interested</b> .</u>  He also asks many questions, but more often on business.  He likes to pre-test the service, and if he is satisfied, he will make a purchase. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/la-ta-vi/view/240823/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2c/561/eaa/d2c561eaa206bde3a8c633c76727f016.jpg" width="333" height="500" title="Detroit 6 am" alt=" 6 "></a> <br>  <b>Company</b> <br>  The most pleasant client for us.  It is registered on a corporate e-mail, makes a prepayment by a wire for a long period and does not ask unnecessary questions. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/namalyshe/view/180824/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12c/d38/469/12cd38469d597649f6c60841956d1d86.jpg" width="500" height="375"></a> <br>  Of course there is a third category of customers, all kinds of <b>scammers</b> , carders, scammers, etc. <br>  They differ in that they fill in a minimum of contact information about themselves, are registered under the names Alexander Pushkin or Dmitry Medvedev and do not ask questions.  We try not to accept payments from credit cards of such individuals, since there is a high risk that the data will be stolen.  For such clients we have Liberty Reserve, Webmoney and Yandex Money, i.e.  systems are non-returnable. <br><br>  Now, when someone calls us in the call-center, the operator according to preliminary data fills in a brief information about the client, if this is a new call. <br>  If the call is repeated, a short business card with the caller's data will appear in the panel at the operator, on the basis of which further conversation can be conducted.  As practice has shown, it helps a lot.  And the client is more pleasant when they recognize him by his voice. <br><br>  To summarize, I can say that customers need different, thrifty and generous, advanced and not so important, the main thing is that they talk about your company, discuss, argue, leave feedback, and the more, the better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88060/</a></p>
