Abroad it is well understood, so the level of service there is incomparably higher than in Russia and the CIS.  Fortunately, now the situation is beginning to improve.  As a young company, we try to meet the maximum requirements of our users, and taking care of them is one of our top priorities.  Not so long ago, we read the book Customers for Life (C. Sewell, P. Brown) and highlighted in it the most important thing - the rules that any company should adopt when working with clients.  We also want to share these rules with an audience of a habr. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What are regular customers for? </h4><br>  1. It is much easier to sell services and goods to an existing client than to a new one.  Relationships with him have already been established, and you will not need to delve into the study of his needs (therefore, marketing costs are reduced). <br>  2. No need to spend time and effort so that customers will choose you again.  They will rather choose your new offers, because they have already had a positive experience of communication / cooperation with you. <br>  3. If customers buy from you, they do not buy from competitors.  By turning casual buyers into customers for life, you win, and your competitors who do not, lose. <br>  4. Regular customers are not so price sensitive.  You have already established a good relationship, and it is easier for customers to pay a little more to you than to spend time searching for another company that can serve them at the same high level. <br>  5. Your customers will more readily try your other products or services.  In this case, you are in a better position than other companies with whom they did not deal.  The trust that you won initially extends to your other offers.

    <h4>  If you are not trying to claim a long-term relationship with your client, then you lose money on it. </h4><br>  1. No need to promise too much.  If you do not fulfill what was promised, the client will be disappointed.  It is necessary to set high, but realistic expectations. <br>  2. It is necessary to take a clear position in the market, not the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù one, because there will always be someone who makes it cheaper or more expensive. <br>  3. Customers want to get products faster and easier.  Only those companies that run faster and better flourish. <br>  4. Competitive advantage is created only with the help of people and the service they provide.  Remember that innovations and the right technologies are copied by others very quickly. <br>  5. You should always ask customers what they DO NOT like in your work. <br>  6. The more carefully you watch how your competitors work, the better for you. <br>  7. Customer service is work 24 hours a day. <br>  8. If you have promised something to the client, this must be done the first time. <br>  9. If you want to survive, you need to constantly develop.  It is never too good. <br><br><h4>  It is necessary to strive to be the best, to be the first, otherwise almost all the actions that you will take do not make sense. </h4><br>  - if you treat your customers well, they will come back to you because they like you; <br>  - if they like you, they will spend more money; <br>  - if they spend more money, you want to treat them better; <br>  - if you treat them well, they will come back.  At this stage, the circle closes. <br><br>  Now you know what regular customers are for and can use the information obtained in practice.  However, this list of rules may seem incomplete.  Therefore, if you apply other rules in your work with clients, it will be cool if you share them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142011/</a></p>
