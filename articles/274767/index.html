One of the goals of the project is to support multiple architectures and operating systems.  Initially written in C / C ++, plugins support is included.  At the moment, is at an early stage of development, and is mainly aimed at MacOS.  Then I give the floor to the author of the post. <br><hr><br>  As known to those of you who follow me on Twitter, I don‚Äôt really like C ++.  He has his usual problems with header files, slop patterns, and so on.  And the big problem is finding an alternative.  I was considering switching to C #, but making it work well on all platforms seems like a very difficult task (for example, there is almost no x86 support on the Mac).  In addition, some people will not like this choice. <br><br>  I like (Common) Lisp.  I admire the device of its macros, it has that elegance that is not found in all languages.  However, it seems somehow alien to many people, so investing in a project will become much more difficult.  In addition, I want to use the language without a garbage collector whenever possible, and although Lisp can be greatly accelerated, this is not so easy to do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Rust entry </h3><br>  I followed <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> for several years, but I never wrote anything on it before version 1.0 was released in May 2015.  When I began to get accustomed to Rust, I wanted to understand whether there was something useful in it for me.  On paper, everything looked good (I will give a list of the most interesting moments for me): <br><br><ul><li>  Guaranteed memory security. </li><li>  Streams without race data. </li><li>  Minimum runtime. </li><li>  Effective binding to C. </li><li>  No garbage collector. </li><li>  Modules. </li><li>  Using LLVM. </li><li>  Compiled into native code. </li></ul><br>  I decided to see what use Rust will lead me.  I also made a presentation about Rust, which can be viewed <a href="http://prodbg.com/rust_pres/index.html">here</a> .

      At that time, I began to review the list of platforms supported by Rust.  It supports Mac, Windows and Linux.  Windows support is usually so-so, at least for ‚Äúnew‚Äù languages.  I was pleasantly surprised that Rust works fine on Windows, for which many thanks to the Rust team. <br><br>  My other question: ‚Äúis Rust used for large projects?‚Äù The transition to a language that will not be used anywhere in the next few years is a sludge, and although this is not the end of the world, the result can be quite painful.  It seems that Rust itself is written in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">Rust</a> , and it is quite large.  Mozilla's <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Design">Servo is</a> also a big project, and is also written in Rust. <br><br><h3>  Is Rust suitable for plugins? </h3><br>  My next move - by the end of the Christmas holidays, add Rust support for plugins (only C / C ++ is now supported) to find out how easy it will be to write plugins on it.  And it seems that wrapping Rust around a C API based on structures with function pointers works great.  Here is an (early) <a href="">example</a> . <br><br>  Although a lot of the code in this example can be improved if it is made more idiomatic for Rust, it does work with the C API, which I wanted to prove. <br><br><h3>  Can ProDBG be rewritten to Rust <i>without</i> complete rewriting? </h3><br>  I started playing, revealing the different parts of C ++ code and calling only ‚Äúprodbg_main‚Äù from Rust.  After fixing several link errors, everything worked!  This is one of the advantages of Rust: being a compiled language, it can be linked with C / C ++ code without glue in the form of a DLL. <br><br>  Then I began to reveal the rest of the code.  I wrote a ‚Äúplug-in processor‚Äù that loads dynamic libraries (plug-ins) and shows one of them on the screen.  At the same time I added a reload of the plugins, so now when I compile the plug-in (which can be written in Rust or C / C ++) it will reload on the fly, which is great. <br><br>  <a href="">Here</a> you can look at the test code with which you can play before a deeper dive into the main code <i>(at the moment the code is no longer available - approx. Transl.)</i> . <br><br><h3>  And now what? </h3><br>  After I played around a bit with Rust, the language definitely captured me.  This is a great language that offers great features (see <a href="http://prodbg.com/rust_pres/index.html">my presentation</a> ).  I especially want to mention the system of lifetimes and borrowing.  What is good about borrowing / lifetime is that the Rust compiler can be controlled with a truly immutable state, which allows the noalias of the LLVM phase to be turned on, so that Rust can even outrun the C code in performance. <br><br>  Participating in the Rust community and observing language development gives me hope for its future, so I decided to start writing ProDBG in Rust.  At the same time, I will rely on external C ++ code (like imgui, Scintilla, bgfx).  I have no reason to rewrite everything to Rust.  The API, which is also open to plug-ins, will still be on C. Thanks to this, adding support for other languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Lua, Python, JS, .NET) will become <i>much</i> easier in the future. <br><br><h3>  disadvantages </h3><br>  Switching to the language used by as many people as C / C ++ always has its problems.  A slower compiler (they are working on this problem), difficulties in debugging (there is no good front end yet, but I think this is a good motivation for me :), fewer people who know the language, and no one knows what will happen in the future.  Despite all this, I still think that Rust is on the right path, and it seems to me that going to it is the right decision. <br><br>  The biggest drawback is that the transition at the beginning will slow down the development of the project, which sucks.  I was hoping to have reached version 0.1 by now, but now the release is being postponed. <br><br><h3>  Afterword </h3><br>  That's it.  The decision was not easy, because it affects all project participants.  Notice that the API will be in C, and I accept input as plugins written in C / C ++. <br><br>  And yet I think the decision was right.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/274757/">Here</a> you can read about what happened to the language during 2015, and what awaits it in 2016. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274767/</a></p>
