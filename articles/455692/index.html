  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NSPA: restyling or theater begins with a hanger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The words of Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky that ‚Äúthe theater begins with a hanger‚Äù are also relevant after almost a hundred years.  Moreover, if earlier theaters were usually thinking about the image, and there were demands for the plants to fulfill the five-year plan for three years, now the situation has changed.  The appearance of a modern, technological enterprise begins, often on the Internet.  You go to the site, you see a convenient, ergonomic portal and you understand that this company is developing, business is booming: after all, in simple terms, if you have enough money and an image, then profit allows.  An old-fashioned pass office can make quite the opposite impression.  A small window where you need to shove your passport to get a pass, recalls the times of stagnation.  You must admit that no one would like to be characterized as ‚Äúobsolete bureaucrat‚Äù. <br><br>  Software "ASZP" allows you to automate the processes associated with the order, approval and clearance passes.  For more than ten years, a variety of companies - from giant fuel and energy companies to luxury housing complexes trust the product. <br>  LLC Gazinformservice.  This year a new, already the eighth generation of ‚ÄúAESZ‚Äù has been released.  The software has been updated, the user web interface has been completely redesigned using modern software development technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/2a/ok/p02aokhnnpowtuzq5q___m-wmuw.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/wj/ej/shwjej3hwiiumhtki6zygmez2z8.png">

      Many elements that increase usability have been added: at any given time, you can see which employee worked with the application and when.  For those companies where they have already appreciated the benefits of implementing Business Intelligence solutions, there is a powerful reporting mechanism.  For those who are still in the process of choosing such solutions, you can limit your work to Microsoft Excel or a similar table editor. <br><br>  With the help of data analysis from the "ASZP" system, you can track the checkpoint load, peak hours in the pass office, to subsequently optimize the work of the enterprise. <br><br>  Software "ASZP" has the necessary interfaces and mechanisms for integration with third-party software.  Here is just a brief list of what can be done in conjunction with the GRC platform Eplat4m (developed by OOO KiT, Yekaterinburg): <br><br><ol><li>  Create a personal account of the contractor, so that he can independently control the availability of permits and execute applications for the pass, as well as receive notifications of expiration; </li><li>  Keep a log of safety violations (or other requirements) and fill out a database of unwanted employees; </li><li>  Receive in an automated mode data about criminals and terrorists from the sites of relevant departments and prevent their penetration into the protected object. </li></ol><br>  Of course, this is not all functions.  The AIPP system integrates with access control and management systems, ERP and IDM solutions, allowing you to solve the most complex business tasks in the field of security. <br><br>  We understand that it is better to see once, so we included several screenshots in the text.  If this is not enough, we are ready to provide a demo version of the software and assist in the organization of trial operation for up to three months.  Is free. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455692/</a></p>
