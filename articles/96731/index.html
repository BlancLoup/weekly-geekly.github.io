Two books on change management that you definitely need to read.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dfb/234/691/dfb234691d8565ce9d9231a8ba094a40.jpg" alt="Adizes Books" align="left">  This post will be (I hope) interesting: <br>  1) employees who are interested in the direction in which their firm is developing <br>  2) managers of different levels and owners of companies <br>  If you work from 9-00 to 17-30, look forward to the weekend and you do not care what to do, if only the money was paid, then you do not need this post, do not waste your time on it. <br><br><h4>  Why these books hooked me and how did it happen </h4><br><br>  A month ago, Adizes appeared in my life.  On that day, our developers returned from the Software People 2010 conference. In one of the reports made by Askhat Urazbayev, Adizes‚Äôs methodology was mentioned and the company's life cycle from appearance to death was given.  My friend <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/seregap/" class="user_link">SeregaP</a> , the development manager of our company, immediately bought the book <i><b>‚ÄúManaging the Lifecycle of a Corporation‚Äù</b></i> . <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>

      Next, I acted like a fox in a fairy tale (let me on the bench, tail under the bench ...) - as a result, the book turned out to be with me.  And then I went to the store myself and bought another one, red (smile).  It was called <i><b>‚ÄúManagement styles - effective and ineffective‚Äù</b></i> . <br><br>  The following ideas are consistently and methodically worked out in these books. <br><ul><li>  The organization for its life goes through several stages (see figure). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b6f/ff2/414/b6fff24148d42558b21e041361db0643.jpg" alt="image"></li><li>  At each stage, she faces normal and anomalous problems, which Adizes distinguishes very precisely.  By the way, in my life I worked in several firms, taking different positions, and also had the opportunity to observe other companies.  In my opinion, Adizes in his classifications is damn right. </li><li>  During the transition between stages, the organization changes and can fall into one of the traps, Adizes describes them quite accurately. </li><li>  At each stage, managers with different combinations of productive (P), administrative (A), entrepreneurial (E), and integrating (I) are required.  In sum, the combination PAEI unfortunately unattainable for one person is obtained.  The absence or presence of these principles in the combination moves the organization forward, throws it backwards or drives them into traps. </li><li>  Each stage is characterized by a different combination of powers and responsibilities, which the organization gives the performers.  Their combination is referred to as CAPI and is also methodically considered by Adizesom. </li></ul><br>  All stages of the life curve of the company from birth to death, all the beginnings, powers and responsibilities Adizes describes in great detail and thoughtfully.  And what is interesting, everything he talks about does not contradict our Russian realities.  Most likely this is because Adizes describes universal things that go beyond countries and cultures. <br>  To summarize - the books are very useful, the average combination of ideas per page of text is an order of magnitude higher than usual.  At the same time, books are written in understandable and accessible language, and pictures and funny inserts make reading not only useful, but also enjoyable. <br><br><h4>  What books are useful to me </h4><br><br>  First, the books gave the key to recognizing their style and highlighting the point of the curve of life in which our company is located.  This knowledge makes it possible to understand what needs to be changed in oneself in order to become more efficient.  Also, this knowledge makes it possible to identify insufficiently strong components of PAEI and begin searching for people to strengthen them. <br><br>  Secondly, I received another confirmation that organizations are fundamentally different and the thing is not the people who work there, but deeper and deeper.  And therefore, in dealing with other organizations, you can try to adapt to their style.  At the same time, you can understand in advance what to expect and what to adjust to by simply identifying the place of the organization on its life curve. <br><br>  Thirdly, there is something that I have known for a long time, but I was ashamed of myself admitting this.  And now I have received confirmation.  So.  Problems are normal (if they are normal problems).  And do not suffer from the fact that they appear.  After all, if there are problems, then the company is alive. <br>  There are other utilities, but this is personal (smile). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96731/</a></p>
