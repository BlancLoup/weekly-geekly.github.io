On this site, we place increased demands on hosters and are very sensitive to all the shortcomings that we encounter on the site of the hoster and in its work.  This allows you to offer service providers who are responsible for their work and allow a minimum of errors. <br><br>  In this article I will tell you what criteria affect the appearance of the company in the catalog (or the disappearance from it), as well as what you should pay attention to when you first meet the hoster.  I will try not to do advertising to anyone or anti-advertising, all coincidences are random.  If any company was not found in the catalog, <s>it is not their fault, and our flaw</s> does not mean that it is bad. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/poiskvps/blog/422217/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/ut/4l/_yut4lkhpwoduepjnoyqsypepdw.jpeg"></a>

      So, suppose that we came across the site of host X, about which we had not heard before.  What simple steps can be taken to protect yourself from possible troubles in the future? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For starters, you can check the domain with any <a href="https://poiskvps.ru/whois.php">WhoIs service</a> to see that it is not registered yesterday (there may, of course, be cases when a company changes a domain for various reasons, but they can be neglected).  Companies with a ‚Äúyoung‚Äù domain are more likely to have some shortcomings and the percentage of failures in placing them in a directory is higher, so you need to be more alert when you see a young hoster. <br><br>  You can read the thematic forums or sites with reviews, to have an idea about the history of the company, its attitude towards customers.  Many hosters create threads on the forums (very popular, for example, searchengines.guru) and assign employees representing their company.  If there is no topic with reviews from the hoster, or none of the employees there is responding, then this may be an occasion to gather more information.  It is worth noting that the number of reviews, as well as their content does not always correspond to reality, since: <br><br><ul><li>  some hosters replenish the balance or make discounts to customers who leave positive feedback; </li><li>  other not very bona fide hosters can leave negative reviews about competitors; </li><li>  it is difficult to verify whether the review was left by a real client or written by the hoster itself, for this very reason I don‚Äôt want to add a section with reviews on hosts. </li></ul><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs worth seeing the site of the company whose services you intend to use: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qm/5d/x1/qm5dx1xpkg9hi21b-tvoeh5dkjm.png"><br><br>  The presence of a large number of typos or errors may indicate some neglect of your site, although it does not always directly affect the quality of services.  One mistake, naturally, can be forgiven, but you should not do this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/az/5k/hzaz5k-zxjxxsgjygr23cjv0p74.png"><br><br>  Well, if the hoster provides the opportunity to use the test period for their services.  Even a couple of hours may be enough to assess the performance and failure of sustainability.  It is worth knowing in advance whether a refund is possible in case you do not like something. <br><br>  I believe that the mandatory requirement for billing is to work through HTTPS, since billing stores information about the client‚Äôs account, funds in the account, can contain personal user data, and also allows access to subsequently ordered services.  Hosters that do not protect their users are not added to the directory, and I highly recommend using their services. <br><br>  When adding tariffs to the site, we try to make sure that there are no discrepancies between the information posted on the site and in the billing.  Often there is a situation when after updating the site hosters forget to update the billing, and there is confusion with prices and tariffs.  We write about all found errors to the host, and although errors are usually corrected in a timely manner, there are cases when they are ignored, after which the question arises of excluding the company from the catalog because such errors can be misleading for both users and editors. directory. <br><br>  After registering in billing, it‚Äôs worth asking a simple question to support (in this case, if round-the-clock support is stated, then the ideal time would be New Year‚Äôs Eve, Friday evening on the sysadmin‚Äôs day or, at most, Sunday to Monday night).  Well, if the response time does not exceed 3-4 hours, the permissible support response time is usually less than 24 hours.  If this is not the case, then it is worth thinking seriously about cooperation with this company.  From time to time we ‚Äúping‚Äù support, asking simple questions about services and weeding out those who answer longer than a day.  In my opinion, if a hoster cannot answer a simple question within 24 hours, then cooperation with it risks turning into not very good consequences in case of some force majeure situations, and in case of breakdowns, it will be possible to wait for an answer for several days. <br><br>  People seem to be working here with a sense of humor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g6/tv/ja/g6tvjaxeoi0gkjf-5jwr_bkqmwa.png"><br><br>  Or here is an excellent letter that came in the mailing list, which uplifted, leaving a positive impression of the host: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/2-/2p/nd2-2pyjuas3qcwe6udve8ru2ms.png"></div><br>  <b>Please tell us how you start your acquaintance with a new hoster, what you are paying attention to.</b> <br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y_/yt/-w/y_yt-wuvgsowt5sze71h8ccc9wm.png"></div><br>  <a href="https://looking.house/">LOOKING.HOUSE</a> - the project collected more than 150 points looking glass in 40 countries.
