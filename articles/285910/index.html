  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gary Millin: a domain master with domains for millions of US dollars that can be rented</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/5fb/adc/1a25fbadc2e84709a98fc0c5347989ee.jpg"><br><br>  I think it‚Äôs no secret that some domain names cost a lot of money.  It can be both thousands and millions, even tens of millions of dollars (same sex.com).  It is clear that once in this area there is money, but there are people who earn money on domains.  And one of these people is Gary Millin and his company, World Accelerator.  Gary and Co. have been working for 21 years in the domain sphere, during which time they managed to earn millions of dollars and accumulate domains for tens of millions. <br><br>  The biggest deals for Millin are selling or exchanging sound domains like world.com, usa.com, doctor.com, lawyer.com, comic.com, email.com, cyberservices.com.  Now it has domains that any domain manager wants.  How did Gary begin his journey? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turns out that he <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-man-squatting-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-domain-names">began</a> working with the Internet <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-man-squatting-on-millions-of-dollars-worth-of-domain-names">in the mid-90s</a> , in partnership with investment specialist Gerald Gromen.  Partners founded the company mail.com (it still works, this is a mailer), while still studying at Harvard Business School.  The idea behind mail.com is to provide a person with a lifetime e-mail address that the owner could work with for a very long time.  The idea really worked, and at one time mail.com was a very popular service - and this company is still making a profit.

      When the dotcom bubble burst, Gary had a pretty hard time, but then he took up another business ‚Äî buying and selling domain names.  He entered this business with his former partner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/88b/160/adb/88b160adb4d758007e22a8ddd5668e26.png"><br><br>  After names like Kosher.com, London.com, and England.com were sold for a couple of million dollars, Millin realized that you can earn more on domains, and not only with the help of buying and selling domains.  In 2007, he founded the company World Accelerator, which became involved in domains.  Only here the idea was no longer just for selling domains. <br><br>  Instead, World Accelerator gives a person the desired name, in exchange for a share in a startup that will work on a domain.  The rights to the domain still belong to Millin.  Now Millin practically does not sell domains, but is engaged in work according to the above scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/03c/fd8/51b/03cfd851b783a22fe88b8903627282f4.png"><br><br>  In principle, each of the doctor.com domain names can be sold for millions of dollars.  But Gary believes that making money by leasing or leasing domains can be much higher than with direct sales.  Like it or not, it is not clear now, but on some domains there are already working services.  For example, on Doctor.com there is a portal for doctors, on India.com there is a news portal of this country. <br><br>  There is nothing on the other domains, they are just parked, like this one: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/557/a5d/c3b/557a5dc3b0a010a7b708c2ee6216ee7b.png"><br><br>  According to Millin, he plans to earn a lot, a lot of money in the future, because he believes not in the sale of domains, but because of the brands that can be placed on such domains.  Gary says that he and his company are very patient and believe in the future. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf we can support any startup, and it will be successful, for me it is a big reward than just‚Äú hey, send me a check, ‚Äùsays Millin.  Well, if so, it remains only to envy the enthusiasm and optimism of this person. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285910/</a></p>
