  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Netorati, or when bloggers are in love</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems that the bloggers of America have brought a new model of gender relations - a love square.  Square, because, in addition to two people, their friends-computers are tightly included in the conversation.  The phenomenon was called the word "Netorati", synonymous with which is " <nobr>couple-surf</nobr> ", surfing in a pair.  They say the trouble is still. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the New York cafe there are two men sitting side by side - a man and a woman,‚Äù <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060808/tc_nm/life_cybercouples_dc%3B_ylt%3DAuzXE89ADXvN7YuvPxhdEpwjtBAF%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTA0cDJlYmhvBHNlYwM">says</a> journalist Sarah Ledwit.  - They pull beer, eat something, but conversations between themselves do not start.  Instead, they are typing intently, looking at the screens of their laptops. ‚Äù  Further from the narration it follows that these two are a pair of lovers who are simply more comfortable to communicate by sending each other instant message messages.  No wonder the virtual iMomus <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71074-0.html">called</a> them in Wired "non-goggles" and "infomaniacs". <br><br>  Around more and more friends, computers, and the behavior of a person is strangely changing.  For example, people transfer communication with their close ones online when they are sitting next to each other - what would that mean?  Perhaps science will take up the question soon, but for now, opinions.

      iMomus testifies: many people enjoy family internet leisure.  Someone finds a romantic e-mail communication with the addressee in the next room, someone sees this as a time saving.  Anyway, for most bloggers polled by iMomus, Netorati is a natural pastime.  People feel good, sitting together part of the day for the Internet - albeit in silence, diluted only with rustling keys and giggling.  Thoughts may be in another place - it does not interfere with enjoying the presence of each other.  By the way, more often sympathize with Netorati couples who met on the web. <br><br>  "It is difficult to diversify communication by throwing off a link to an interesting picture, melody or text without having the Internet at hand," Sarah Ledwith rightly notes.  She also leads a family story that solves personal problems on blogs ‚Äî for some, it‚Äôs easier to talk about the problem online than in person. <br><br>  In addition, many need public participation.  This is also an important feature of coexistence in Netorati - you can easily bring a third party to the situation.  Such a find is not always conducive to less traumatic problem solving.  But the people who dealt with this issue believe that the root of evil, if it exists, does not lie in the communicative environment.  They also tend to believe that everything will be fine, as long as both are online. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4265/</a></p>
