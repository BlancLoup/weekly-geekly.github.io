  <section class="page js-page"><h1>USB Batteries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More than 10 years ago, I read about the crazy idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome Western company to create a battery with charge from the USB port.  ‚ÄúWhat could be more ridiculous?‚Äù I thought then.  Time passed, the number of gadgets with batteries grew, I got a can to collect used batteries and started looking towards AA batteries.  But all my experience said that the promised 1000 cycles of work and does not smell.  Either the controller killed these batteries with a large charge, or the batteries themselves quickly lost their capacity.  Yes, and charging had to keep all the time at hand.  Everything changed when the batteries, which I read about a long time ago, were on my desk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/9a6/8b5/8179a68b51094244865564241b11237d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, there are AA batteries with a built-in charger and a NiMH-battery filling.  I will give a little <a href="http://forum.rcdesign.ru/f71/thread202602.html">theory</a> about the charge of this type of battery: <br><blockquote>  Most manufacturers of NiMH batteries provide the characteristics of their batteries for the case of fast current charging 1C.  Although sometimes you can find recommendations not to exceed the current 0.75C.  These recommendations are related to the danger of the battery vent opening when it is quickly charged under conditions of high ambient temperature.  The smart charger must evaluate the conditions and decide on the acceptability of the fast charge.  It is believed that fast charge can be used only in the temperature range of 0 ... + 40 ¬∞ C and at a battery voltage of 0.8 ... 1.8 V. The efficiency of the fast charging process is very high (about 90%), therefore the battery heats up slightly.  However, at the end of charging, the efficiency of this process drops sharply and almost all the energy supplied to the battery begins to turn into heat. </blockquote><br><br>  On the package, the battery capacity is 1450 mA and the recommended charging time is 5 hours, which indicates a charge current of about 300 mA.  Since the standard power supply of the USB port is 500 mA, this means that such a battery does not burn your device.  Well, the charge time at 5 o'clock is quite acceptable.  The capacity of USB batteries is less than the standard in size and is 1450 mAh due to the design features: the upper part of the case is used for the USB connector and LED indication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/755/61a/ad575561a2ae4c37b1f0120cea9e0721.jpg"><br><br>  The removable cap-plus contact keeps on an elastic band and will not be lost during charging.  As for the size, they coincide with the dimensions of an ordinary battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48c/7a4/85b/48c7a485b00247db821e510e79089cde.jpg"><br><br>  The most difficult question is to charge the whole set of batteries at once.  Often there are on the laptops closely spaced connectors, that even two flash drives can be a problem.  I tested this theory on my laptop and a separate USB hub.  And if there were no problems with laptops: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/173/7ac/fa71737acb734f218d57fa492ef1ade5.jpg"><br><br>  That with a USB hub was more difficult.  In it, USB ports are arranged vertically and oriented to connecting wires, rather than individual devices.  Therefore, it was not possible to turn on the batteries in the neighboring ports.  Even if you bend the caps, the housing will not allow them to be placed so closely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/145/423/d53/145423d533bd495bb887b7c718b74478.jpg"><br><br>  It's nice that these batteries have a built-in charge controller with light indication.  In the previous picture was visible red lights.  When the batteries are charged, it changes to blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79b/d5a/4d5/79bd5a4d5ea94963a7d20a9365c568fa.jpg"><br><br>  As for the work, we will check the operation on ordinary devices.  In addition to a good SLR camera, I have a ‚Äúsoap box for every day‚Äù in my bag, powered by two AA batteries.  This is convenient when you need to quickly remove something, and you will not be able to carry a bulky camera with you all the time.  And if suddenly the batteries are exhausted, then similar batteries are sold at every corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/5ea/e6d/7c45eae6d49f433984eab0ee064c932d.jpg"><br><br>  Instead of batteries, I use quite capacious batteries, which also need to be charged periodically.  For this house is the charger from the famous brand.  But there is a nuance: it is not always that the charger is near when the batteries are low.  Therefore, these batteries will be much easier to charge, the benefit of a computer or laptop is always at hand.  Yes, and the car has a charge with USB output for charging phones and gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fec/2c0/e81/fec2c0e812994217a28f751bf518ec28.jpg"><br><br>  For hiking I have a Midland radio.  It does not require certification, and its range is sufficient for communication in the forest or on a march between the machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e41/512/739/e41512739e9d4f82908dd8df62ba1d90.JPG"><br><br>  Its own battery has a capacity of 850 mA and consists of 5 AAA elements assembled in a cassette.  Charging the batteries takes 6‚Äì7 hours, which is unacceptable on the road, so you often have to insert regular batteries, thanks for this is adapted.  And since these batteries have a battery format, they also coped well with the work.  But we must take into account.  that the voltage of the batteries is 1.5 V, and that of the batteries is 1.2 V, that is, for 4 cells, the discrepancy will be 1.2 V and the radio will turn off earlier. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">All photos of the radio</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/291/3f3/4e2/2913f34e206e41d38e36fd05278ed6b6.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a8/96e/e6d/5a896ee6dacc45e0923c9d705b26606a.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cba/e83/1b8/cbae831b82ad4afd8f8b86dc87cb2479.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4a/58e/a2e/a4a58ea2e7424279972e95200bdb3328.JPG"><br><br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/418/052/e4e/418052e4ed0b4f929d335b079405b55d.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  AA batteries with built-in USB charging are really handy.  The number of gadgets that require batteries is steadily increasing, so the use of batteries will be a cost-effective solution.  Well, if these gadgets are often worn with them, then using such items without a separate charger will be a particularly valuable gift.  I'm really glad that such a device from the pages of old magazines got to my house and now it will replace ordinary batteries or rechargeable batteries. <br><br>  Buy USB-batteries can be <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/power-supply/usb-batareyki/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dusb-batareyki%26utm_content%3Dusb-batareyki%26utm_campaign%3Dusb-batareyki_145">HERE</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390641/</a></p>
