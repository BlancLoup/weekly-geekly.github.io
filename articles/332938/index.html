A high-quality network with reliable wireless access in the office today is a basic need not only for large corporations, but also for small businesses. <br><br>  How to build a reliable, productive, easy to operate network for little money? <br><br>  By selling the Linksys brand in 2013, Cisco has demonstrated its commitment to large-scale high-performance solutions for corporations that use rich functionality.  However, life is changing, and today the company sees big business behind small networks.

    <img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ce/586/fe7/4ce586fe7ce24f5fbee918e235094864.jpg">  Cisco launches a Wi-Fi access point line in Russia in the lower price segment - these are Cisco WAP150, WAP361, WAP571 models, and in a couple of months, the street version of WAP571E will appear.  These products support the latest 802.11ac standard and allow you to build networks with 50-500 users.  Solutions are widely used in offices, retail, to connect remote workers, in parking lots, in schools, swimming pools, warehouses, logistics centers and conference rooms.  In those places that require cost-effective reliable solutions without super-tasks in terms of performance and functionality.  These products are often chosen by telecom operators for the managed Wi-Fi service. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of Cisco wireless solutions for small businesses:</b> <br>  ÔÇß Reliable and easy to use <br>  ÔÇß Competitive functionality <br>  ÔÇß Affordable price <br>  ÔÇß Easy installation, web interface <br>  Cisco Cisco Technical Support <br><br>  Cisco's small business solution is complemented by switches and routers designed for the same segment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The novelty for Russia is not a novelty for other countries.  In the framework of a vote conducted by CRN Magazine, Cisco solutions for 5 consecutive years were ranked number 1 in the small and medium business segment.  The winner was determined by voting, and the ratings were set according to three criteria - technical solution, manufacturer support, price. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe3/113/36f/fe311336f4434dfebf78e16de275dbd6.png"></div><br>  Today, versions of products have become available that correspond to the GKRCh Decisions of the RF on the radio channels used and signal strength.  Cisco wireless SMB products fully comply with the Russian regulation for devices of this type.  Often, vendors do not adapt radio products by offering solutions in Russia with an American or European radio profile.  When buying such an access point, a client often does not suspect that it violates radio frequency regulation and may receive a claim from Roskomnadzor in addition. <br><br>  Depending on the type, the access points form clusters of 4, 8, 16 points without a separate wireless controller.  Having created a wireless cluster, the Single Point Setup functionality performs radio planning of the wireless network, reducing radio interference and increasing performance.  Single Point Setup also allows you to see the entire network in a single graphical interface for configuration and monitoring, as well as copy the generated configuration, security and management settings to all access points. <br>  All access points of this line have built-in antennas. <br><br>  <b>100 series</b> <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c8f/ed8/e46/c8fed8e46b984a088365e0a2292fe57d.png">  The WAP150 access point is the most inexpensive, it works according to the MIMO 2x2 scheme simultaneously in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.  Single Point Setup allows it to cluster up to 4 access points.  The point can be powered by PoE or using an adapter.  The point is compact, can be mounted on a table, mounted on a wall or ceiling.  From the fuctional can do simple guest access through the captive portal with the registration of guest information and the issuance of a unique user name / password pair. <br><br>  <b>300 series</b> <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/758/dd6/481/758dd6481c9341eaaf2b5dc37da386d5.jpg">  The WAP361 access point also operates on a 2x2 MIMO scheme in two bands, however it supports a cluster of up to 8 access points, it has 4 additional GigE interfaces for connecting external devices, one of which can be powered by PoE.  This access point is mounted on the wall on a special bracket and can be mounted with a secret screw to protect against theft.  The main segment of the use of this product - hotels, education. <br><br>  <b>500 series</b> <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/98a/113/448/98a113448e2043368817ec7cbc4d4b62.jpg">  The top series in this segment is represented by the access point of the WAP571 series.  This is the most productive and fully functional access point in the Small Business series.  It works according to the MIMO 3x3 scheme, forms a cluster of up to 16 access points, connects to the switchboard with two GigE links operating in the aggregation mode (static LAG).  The point has Spectrum Analysis functionality, which allows it to analyze the use of ether, supports IPv6 and QoS. <br><br>  The 100‚Äì500 Series Access Points are the most popular choice of Cisco employees and Home Office Partners! <br><br>  The lineup of routers is also a recharge - new RV130 / RV130W, RV320 / RV325 series are available, designed for small networks to connect up to 30 users. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of Cisco Small Business Routers are:</b> <br>  ÔÇß Easy installation, web interface <br>  ÔÇß Support remote office or VPN worker <br>  ÔÇß Wi-Fi interface <br>  ÔÇß Web filtering <br>  ÔÇß 3G / 4G as a reserve <br>  Cisco Cisco Technical Support <br><br>  Web filtering is a dynamic protection that automatically blocks sites from specified categories.  Unlike previous versions, this feature is now included in the cost of the router. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/18a/62e/ec9/18a62eec98224ea49fcfd53e8ab061cf.png">  The ruler is completed by the utility FindIT, developed for network management.  FindIT allows you to automatically discover devices and their parameters, manage, configure, and monitor all Cisco 100-500 series devices.  The software displays device information, network topology, network health indicators, provides real-time monitoring of network performance, and allows you to adapt the displayed data to the needs of a network administrator. <br>  Software is free for networks of 10 devices and less. <br><br>  A good network is a productive, reliable, stable network that is conveniently managed, implemented on equipment that is fully compliant with current regulations, and reliable support from the manufacturer.  On Cisco, you can build just that. <br><br>  <b>Materials</b> <br>  - <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/small-business.html">Link to the official website of the manufacturer</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFg_U_BjmaeY">Cisco WAP150 Video Streaming Test with 50 Clients</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332938/</a></p>
