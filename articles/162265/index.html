Others had already arrived, had time to cool down, leave and give in to newer ones, but this one remained.  I lack such a realized tool, so I decided to describe the idea publicly and hope that I will be given a license for the first professional version, and from the second million profits they will put a bottle of good cognac.  =) <br>  The idea is simple: I propose to cross a task management system (To-Do List) with a network access restriction system: <br><br><ul><li>  There are no important tasks - you walk on a habr, you play blackjack, you look at girls. </li><li>  There are important tasks - they are not allowed to blackjack and girls, but Habr itself is not limited yet. </li><li>  Expires important tasks - only allowed in the search engine, msdn and stackoverflow, disable messengers. </li></ul><br>  By the way, I also give the name of this system: ConcentrateOn (pronounced concentration). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Concentrate <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3f/ab8/f7a/f3fab8f7ab9a101ae4b92bea6ca329ed.png" alt="O">  n. </h4><br><h4>  Solvable problems </h4><br><ul><li>  Low attention in work </li><li>  Context switch </li><li>  Procrastination - deferring important matters </li></ul>

    <h4>  Existing solutions </h4><br>  Now some companies use in their network a permanent restriction of access to the list of Internet resources.  Such a constant, inflexible restriction is not applicable for personal use, and in a corporate environment also has disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  strong demotivating effect </li><li>  reducing the efficiency of a person without modern means of communication </li><li>  the inability to restrict Internet access completely and the inefficiency of partial restrictions </li><li>  replacement of prohibited resources by other entertainment sources </li></ul><br>  On the other hand, free and constant access to many Internet resources can significantly reduce user productivity. <br><br>  There was also a solution (with a similar name Concentrate) that allows you to disable access to network resources, but such tools did not offer links to the current list of jobs. <br><br><h4>  Proposed Solution </h4><br>  So, at the heart of the product ‚ÄúConcentrateON‚Äú, is a simple idea: <br>  <b>Enter restrictions on access to Internet resources and some local applications only depending on the priority of current tasks.</b>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>temporarily include the ‚ÄúConcentrateOn‚Äù mode, excluding sources of distraction for the period of priority work.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Access restriction should be controlled dynamically and adaptively, which will allow combining high work efficiency and employee loyalty, since the restriction is not permanent and unconditional, but is objectively determined by the solution of the tasks set and controlled by the employee independently.  A clear understanding of the tasks and goals, and the possibility of managing them, can themselves be additional motivational factors. <br>  And getting access to entertainment resources to complete tasks in some conditions can be a stimulus. <br>  Obviously, this is only the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product. <br><br><h4>  Functionality extensions </h4><br>  Additionally, you can take into account the data of scientific approaches to the organization of human activity, in particular, to structure its main work in blocks of 35-45 minutes, organizing breaks (on a schedule or at the request of an employee). <br>  For example, when performing a lengthy task, the concentration mode turns on for 40 minutes, after which a 15-minute free mode may follow, etc.  These policies should be customizable.  (See the description of the <a href="http://newgoal.ru/pomidornaya-texnika-upravleniya-vremenem/">Pomodoro</a> technique) <br>  The functionality of the product must be extensible by connecting plug-ins.  For example, relaxing exercises for the eyes, neck, hands, or training courses or modules for learning foreign words, etc. <br>  The modular principle also allows you to create different editions of the product: <br><br><h4>  Personal Edition (Professional): </h4><br><ul><li>  planning module, task descriptions, sequences and plans </li><li>  module describing strategic goals and associating tasks with goals, as well as helping to prioritize tasks </li><li>  task reporting module, blog integration </li><li>  a module for integration with information services, for example, an optional posting on Twitter of tasks to be solved, setting corresponding statuses in ICQ, Skype, publishing achievements and so on. </li><li>  task time evaluation module </li><li>  application modules - eye rest, learning foreign words, etc. </li><li>  parental control </li><li>  input volume calculation module </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Corporate Edition (Enterprise) </h4><br>  In addition to the functionality included in the personal version, the corporate version should support a number of functions that increase the efficiency of a person‚Äôs work in a company: <br><ul><li>  goal setting direct supervisor </li><li>  control of employment of an employee by work (for example, checking that an employee is not overloaded. There are recommendations not to issue tasks to an employee for more than 70% of his working time) </li><li>  integration with Outlook, Lotus Notes, JIRA, TFS, etc. </li><li>  integration with existing corporate planning and accounting systems </li><li>  base of typical tasks and their assessments </li><li>  centralized management of rule sets and exceptions </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Lite version </h4><br>  For marketing purposes, a limited version can be created, distributed for free.  This may be a personal edition with a limited lifetime, or a revision without basic extension modules and with a limit on the number of tasks, priority levels, etc.  For example, the variant with two modes of operation ConcentrateOn and Off, switchable depending on the presence of a high priority task. <br><br><h4>  The target audience </h4><br>  In terms of the distribution of paid versions of the system, you should focus on two different segments: <br><br><h5>  Individual users (Pro version) </h5><br>  Emphasis on improving personal efficiency, advertising through the breadth channels, the final consumer is the target audience of advertising, a decision maker.  Direct sales. <br><br><h5>  Corporate users (Enterprise version) </h5><br>  Emphasis on manageability, control, adequacy of restrictions, increase in overall efficiency, statistics of losses from social networks, etc.  Specialized distribution channels.  The target audience of advertising are executives, not end users.  Advertising through specialized channels, participation in thematic events, the formation of a partner network. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Obviously, the product involves the development and expansion of functionality, the development of access restriction methods, methods of planning and managing such planning, through integration with other software systems, as well as its own additional services, for example, training modules that are activated on a schedule or in the absence of current tasks. <br>  Here is an idea.  I would be very happy if such a product appeared.  I realized that on my own I would not be able to implement it, since it requires good knowledge of the network protocol, and the total amount of work is quite large.  In general, it is probably better to create it as an addition to a personal / corporate anti-virus / firewall. <br><br>  If someone is interested, I can tell the development ideas a little deeper in a personal conversation. <br>  UPD: The most important thing!  Would you buy a Pro version, with all sorts of twists, say 7-15 bucks? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162265/</a></p>
