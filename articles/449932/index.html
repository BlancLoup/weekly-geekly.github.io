Now let's move on to the most powerful of the three methods — <b>advanced</b> search. <br><br>  In this mode, you can specify criteria that cannot be specified in the other two previous modes (for example, sorting ORDER BY).  But you have to master the creation of structured queries using JIRA Query Language (JQL).

Creating JQL Queries</b> <br><br>  The simplest JQL query consists of a field followed by an operator, and then one or more valid values ​​for this field.  For example: <br><br>  <i>project = "YAT"</i> <br><br>  Such a request will help to find all the tasks of the YAT project.  The “project” field is used here, the operator is equivalent to “=” and the valid value is “YAT”. <br><br>  A more complex query might look like this: <br><br>  <i>project = "YAT" AND assignee = currentuser ()</i> <i><br></i> <br>  So we will select all the tasks of the project "YAT" assigned to the current user <br>  (that is, on you).  The request contains: the logical operator “AND”, the field “assignee” for selecting tasks for the current user, the operator equivalent to “=” and the function “currentuser ()”, which returns the name of the current user of the system. <br><br>  When creating a query in Advanced Search mode, JIRA displays a list of all possible operators for the query field. <br><br>  JIRA also shows a list of available values ​​for the " <i>AffectedVersion</i> ", " <i>FixVersion</i> ", " <i>Components</i> ", custom fields of the " <i>Version</i> " format and drop-down lists. <br><br>  When used in searching for fields in the <i>User</i> format, JIRA allows you to find the desired user by his last name. <br><br>  You can use parentheses in complex JQL queries.  For example, if you want to find all resolved tasks in the SysAdmin project, as well as all tasks (of any status, any project) currently assigned to the system administrator (admin), you can use parentheses to indicate the priority of logical operators in the query. <br><br>  <i>(project = SysAdmin AND status = resolved) OR assignee = admin</i> <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b> <br><br>  JQL has reserved characters. <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>symbol</b> </td><td>  + </td><td>  . </td><td>  , </td><td>  ; </td><td>  ? </td><td>  | </td><td>  * </td><td>  / </td><td>  % </td><td>  ^ </td><td>  $ </td><td>  # </td><td>  @ </td><td>  [ </td><td>  ] </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>  If you want to use one of them in the request, you need to: <br><ol><li>  select text that contains a special character, either with double quotes ("......"), or single characters ('......'); </li><li>  if the search text contains one of the characters listed below, then a double backslashe ("\\") is always put in front of it. <br>  + - &amp; |!  () {} [] ^ ~ *?  \: </li></ol><br>  Example: <br>  <i>summary ~ "\\ [example \\]"</i> <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b> <br>  JIRA also has reserved words. <br><br>  If one of the following words is mentioned in the search text, this text should be highlighted with either double quotes ("......") or single quotes ('......'). <br><br>  <b>List of reserved words:</b> <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>A</b> </td><td>  "Abort", "access", "add", "after", "alias", "all", "alter", "and", "any", "as", "asc", "audit", "avg " </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>B</b> </td><td>  “Before”, “begin”, “between”, “boolean”, “break”, “by”, “byte” </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>C</b> </td><td>  “Catch”, “cf”, “char”, “character”, “check”, “checkpoint”, “collate”, “collation”, “column”, “commit”, “connect”, “continue”, “count” "," Create "," current " </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>D</b> </td><td>  “Date”, “decimal”, “declare”, “decrement”, “default”, “defaults”, “define”, “delete”, “delimiter”, “desc”, “difference”, “distinct”, “divide” "," Do "," double "," drop " </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>E</b> </td><td>  “Else”, “empty”, “encoding”, “end”, “equals”, “escape”, “exclusive”, “exec”, “execute”, “exists”, “explain” </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>F</b> </td><td>  "False", "fetch", "file", "field", "first", "float", "for", "from", "function" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>H</b> </td><td>  "Having" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>I</b> </td><td>  “Identified”, “if”, “immediate”, “in”, “increment”, “index”, “initial”, “inner”, “inout”, “input”, “insert”, “int”, “integer "," Intersect "," intersection "," into "," is "," isempty "," isnull " </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>J</b> </td><td>  "Join" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>L</b> </td><td>  "Last", "left", "less", "like", "limit", "lock", "long" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>M</b> </td><td>  "Max", "min", "minus", "mode", "modify", "modulo", "more", "multiply" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>N</b> </td><td>  “Next”, “noaudit”, “not”, “notin”, “nowait”, “null”, “number” </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>O</b> </td><td>  “Object”, “of”, “on”, “option”, “or”, “order”, “outer”, “output” </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>P</b> </td><td>  "Power", "previous", "prior", "privileges", "public" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>R</b> </td><td>  “Raise”, “raw”, “remainder”, “rename”, “resource”, “return”, “returns”, “revoke”, “right”, “row”, “rowid”, “rownum”, “rows " </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>S</b> </td><td>  "Select", "session", "set", "share", "size", "sqrt", "start", "strict", "string", "subtract", "sum", "synonym" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>T</b> </td><td>  “Table”, “then”, “to”, “trans”, “transaction”, “trigger”, “true” </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>U</b> </td><td>  "Uid", "union", "unique", "update", "user" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>V</b> </td><td>  "Validate", "values", "view" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>W</b> </td><td>  "When", "whenever", "where", "while", "with" </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><br>  <b>2. Using Templates for Text Search</b> <br><br>  Special characters can be used to define text search patterns.  Consider a few examples: <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><th>  Sign </th><th>  Scope and description </th><th>  Example </th></tr><tr><td>  <b>?</b> </td><td>  "?"  used to replace a single character in a pattern. <br>  For example, the spelling of the words “text” and “test” is different. <br>  single character.  To search for both options is enough <br>  set pattern: <i>te? t</i> <br></td><td>  summary ~ "te? t" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>*</b> </td><td>  "*" is used as a replacement in a text template. <br>  zero or more characters.  For example, to select text <br>  "Windows", "Win95" or "WindowsNT" can be used <br>  pattern: <i>win *</i> <br>  To select the text "Win95" or "Windows95" <br>  You can use the template: <i>wi * 95</i> <br></td><td>  summary ~ "wi * 95" </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>~</b> </td><td>  "~" can be used to set <br>  fuzzy search patterns.  In this case, the character "~" <br>  substituted at the end of the desired word.  For example, <br>  to find a term spelling similar to "roam", <br>  use the pattern: <i>roam ~</i> <br>  As a result, the words “foam” or “roams” can be found. <br><br></td><td>  summary ~ "prox ~" </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><br>  <b>3.
