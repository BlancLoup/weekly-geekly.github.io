  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Asia's largest social network Cyworld has opened for Americans</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The most popular social network in Asia, Korean Cyworld, is entering the overseas market.  At the end of July, the public beta-testing of the <a href="http://us.cyworld.com/">American version of the</a> site officially began. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Cyworld is one of the first social networks on the Internet, which back in 1999 was opened by the South Korean company SK Communications, a division of the telecommunications giant SK Telecom.  The basis of the Cyworld service was the concept of the so-called ‚Äúmini-Hompy‚Äù - personal sections, which combined the functionality of a photo gallery, forum, guest book and personal diary.  In the American version, these sections will be called ‚Äúmini-houses‚Äù, that is, ‚Äúmini-houses‚Äù. <br><br>  An important feature of Cyworld is the three-dimensional interface of mini-rooms ( <a href="">screenshot</a> ), thereby greatly expanding the possibilities of personalization.  Each user is happy to choose furniture, wallpapers, paintings and other furnishings for their virtual home, happy to buy these products from the developer company.  The company sells such goods at <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-6104794.html">$ 300,000 per day</a> , that is, at $ 100 million per year.  The company in Korea alone employs 4,400 artists who create new content every day.  The staff of the company is very solid.  For example, about a hundred people are engaged only in monitoring user behavior.  For this purpose, large screens are designed in the Cyworld virtual world <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Seoul-Cyworld_control_room.jpg">control center</a> ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Seoul-Cyworld_control_room.jpg">photo of the control center</a> ). <br><br>  Before and after Cyworld, the concept of social networks was used by many foreign services, such as Classmates (the first social network on the Internet, appeared in 1995), Myspace, and others.  But none of them could achieve the popularity of Cyworld

      Like multiplayer online games, social networks in Korea became part of popular culture much earlier than in Western countries.  The reason for this is quite understandable.  The fact is that South Korea has long been ranked first in the world on broadband Internet.  But broadband Internet is an important condition for the popularity of Web 2.0 generation sites and, in particular, social networks.  In the five years of its existence, the Cyworld network has firmly entered the everyday life of Koreans.  According to some estimates, every third Korean (about 18 million people) has a mini-house at Cyworld, and among Internet <nobr>users</nobr> at the age of <nobr>20-29</nobr> years, this proportion exceeds 90%, and almost all of them visit the site daily.  American social networks are still very far from such popularity among the population. <br><br>  Cyworld service began regional expansion quite a while ago.  The first appeared branches of the social network in China, Japan and Taiwan.  On the <a href="http://www.cyworld.com.cn/">Chinese site, the</a> number of users has already exceeded 2 million. <br><br>  The developers have particularly high hopes for a US startup, the opening of which to the general public took place on July 27, 2006. On this day, the public beta-testing of the service started, which will not last long, only about a month.  The American site will have all the same features that made the Korean original Cyworld famous, including three-dimensional mini-rooms with the possibility of buying furnishings, as well as the ability to update the blog from a mobile phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4279/</a></p>
