  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dedicated to recruiters ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The idea to write this article gave me <a href="http://itstrategist.habrahabr.ru/blog/102894/">this topic</a> .  It started an interesting conversation on the topic of hiring IT specialists and administrators in particular.  In this topic, I will present my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to conduct an interview with a potential employee.  A lot of thinking, a lot of water, the subjectivity of the entire text, much directly contradicts the opinion of many recruiters on how to choose the right admin. <br><br>  I really hope that at least some recruiters will see this topic and draw the appropriate conclusions.  By recruiters in this topic, I mean those who work in the personnel department, and those who work in headhunter-companies, and those who are looking for a partner-replacement-replacement-assistant, already being an employee of any company.  Some parts are not intended to the latter category, but perhaps you do not be lazy and nail them on the door of the personnel department. <br><br>  The topic, in my opinion, should be considered relevant if you hire any of the following personnel: helpdesk, enikeyschik, office system administrator ( <b>not the</b> corporate guru), technical support ( <b>not the</b> blonde for the first line) to a hosting or provider, service engineer, system administrator technical support (in good companies there is such, do not be surprised), the incoming system administrator.  All of them within the framework of the article are united by one thing - their work is primarily related to the solution of problems-questions from users (why is the answer in the article).  All of them, I combine the word Admin, so as not to display a lot of characters.

      <b>The article is not about those posts where you do not need to solve the final problems of users, regardless of the name of the vacancy.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Right off the bat.</b>  <b>For job interview.</b>  Thoughts on how to create a vacancy ad and how to select a resume - below. <br><br>  At the university we are told a bunch of useful information outside of the training course.  It was there, from one excellent teacher, I became infected with one very beautiful thought.  In a working information system (the one that has already passed the implementation stage and bagopachinok) problems arise for three reasons.  The first is iron breakage.  It is logical, obviously, diagnosable, understandable.  What to take measures to protect against this everyone knows.  The second - changes in the software inf.  system, update components.  It is also clear - everything must be thoroughly tested beforehand.  And if anything happens, the problem is easier to find.  But the third reason is precisely the one according to which the number of personnel in the IT sphere has been very actively growing in recent years.  Curved hands of users.  It is precisely with this that we have to fight every day; it is precisely from this that it is worth making a start when hiring an employee.  Along the way, we will pursue the goal of finding the best possible specialist from the list of those who came for an interview and spend the minimum of time on it. <br><br>  The important point is that the interview should be conducted by a person more or less competent in these matters.  If not, find it.  Want to earn many. <br><br>  <u>Stage One</u> <br>  General issues.  No, there is no need to ask theory.  Here you need to ask exactly the questions that admins have to face most often.  The main thing is to make them right.  In fact, these questions should be the level of "advanced user" or slightly higher.  At this stage, you can easily weed out up to 80% of candidates that we do not need.  The stage can be carried out in electronic form (we take the admin!).  Make a closed questionnaire, access to which will be issued only to those who came to the interview.  Although, if there is enough time, it is better to conduct a survey yourself.  It is better that the questions are not repeated.  At least 100%. <br>  Questions should be focused on the knowledge of the materiel, but should not be purely theoretical (hello, OSI model).  Just in case, I will give examples: <br>  ‚ÄúTell me in general how DHCP works‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúTell us in general how DNS works.  What types of records do you know? ‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWhat happens from the moment the user enters the address in the browser until the moment he sees the page on the screen?‚Äù  More detail, please. " <br>  ‚ÄúWhy does mail from mail.ru go through the site, but not sent through an outlook from the same PC?  What could be the reasons? " <br>  ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between server software and serverless software?  The answer "the server software has a server" is considered poor quality " <br>  ‚ÄúHow does the SMTP protocol work?  in general terms (here you have to hear about MX) " <br>  ‚ÄúWhat is the difference between POP and IMAP?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúHow to open in 2003 office, printed in 2007 office without changing the format?‚Äù <br>  Come up with them here can be a lot.  Focus questions on self-taught, on what is not taught in universities.  At this stage, you should eliminate all those who are frankly not ready to work in IT.  Stage should be as short as possible.  5 questions per minute is usually enough. <br>  Why is this stage the first?  On the one hand, we eliminate outright unnecessary employees, saving time on trying to extract information from them about more complicated things.  On the other hand, a good candidate, we give the opportunity to feel more confident and not get lost.  Do not ask questions, ‚Äúbut in the 199th year ...‚Äù Questions should be relevant at the moment. <br><br>  <u>Stage Two</u> <br>  The test for professional suitability in the specified direction of the IT sphere.  Namely - user support or solving their problems.  If the candidate has not passed this stage - advise him to go on messing with tsiski and with high-loaded systems, where the role of users will be zero for him. <br>  You will need helpers.  Ideally, one beautiful blonde and one flashy accountant who starts to annoy if something doesn‚Äôt suit her.  It is necessary to prepare them in advance and issue instructions.  On the one hand, they should not immediately say what they have done, on the other hand, they should not torment the candidate with silence and the obstinacy of "I did nothing." <br>  The role of each of the two assistants is to distract the candidate at the time of the conversation with the other assistant.  Start the task as it would be the usual outing "into the camp of the enemy."  You got a call - you have to decide, and here the candidate is just - let you decide to try. <br>  Here you should look not so much at how the problem will be solved, but at how communication will be built.  This should not be a stress test - helpers should be intrusive, distracting, but not screaming and not swearing.  Also, the candidate should not give preference to solving the problem of the blonde and all that =) You should check how the candidate will communicate, whether he will communicate or will try to figure out what happened.  It will be itself - its value for administration is doubtful.  Of course, if you find a problem in 30 seconds, then the experiment failed.  But not a candidate, but you. <br>  Examples of problems: <br>  "Oh, and I have no sound" (headphones stuck in minijack instead of speakers that roll behind the system unit) <br>  "Oh, the laptop immediately turns off!" (Disconnected from charging, discharged) <br>  ‚ÄúAfter lunch, I can‚Äôt enter 1c (we‚Äôll assume that you‚Äôre like white people spinning on the server and launching it through rdesktop)‚Äù (too obvious, but the candidate still needs to figure out instead of what the kettle was stuck in) <br>  "Oh, the mouse does not work all day" (grabbed from the next table the one that is more beautiful) <br>  ‚ÄúOh, the mouse all day itself is twitching, and in the morning the other one didn‚Äôt work‚Äù (the second mouse was stuck in the computer, the first one was from an employee who changed them in the morning) <br><br>  Should take no more than 10 minutes.  There are only potentially suitable for this position.  If we are talking about hosting / provider support, replace the above with a phone call with approximately the same symptoms. <br><br>  <u>Stage Three</u> <br>  Find out if this candidate is necessary for us as an individual. <br>  At this stage you should know the character of a person, his interests, his hobby. <br>  First of all, you need to find out whether his ‚Äúnon-working‚Äù classes include self-development in the specialty.  Be very attentive, do not miss important information here.  For example, for hosting a host would be very useful. <br>  If a person does not develop himself by profession - after a while he may become useless.  Even guru-admins, getting stuck on one thing over time, lose their professionalism against the background of young, but developing specialists.  The inability to respond to new developments in IT, the inability to notice information about an important bug fix or a new useful technology ... You know what this leads to. <br>  Character ... you should like the person.  You work with him.  He should not hate users.  If so, then the efficiency will be lower.  If a person loves to argue - think about whether you need it.  Sometimes, very interesting decisions are born in a dispute.  But if, on average in the ward, you have a high burden on a specialist, such disputes will take precious time. <br>  It would be nice to look at the candidate‚Äôs Google reader account and his blog (if any).  Find out what he is really interested in. <br>  I repeat once again - here you must decide whether the candidate is suitable for you as a person with whom you will need to communicate fairly regularly. <br>  There are a lot more ways and criteria, of course, but this part is subjective for each individual case.  Of course, the admin should be quickly trained. <br><br>  The candidates who passed the first 3 stages are potentially suitable for us.  If their level of knowledge is insufficient, then it can be raised quickly enough.  Insufficient experience can be replaced by attentiveness to users and the ability to communicate with them.  But you need to choose someone one (or two ... but not all the same).  Such stages make it possible to sift out unnecessary candidates in descending order of the number eliminated per stage.  At the first stage, you will exclude a lot of people, at the second - less.  But if you had first held the second stage, you would not screen out as much as you could, by conducting the interview in that order. <br><br>  <u>Stage Four</u> <br>  There is no need to spare time. <br>  Tell the applicant about your usual working day, what the admin usually does per day (if you are HR - ask the former administrator to write it on a piece of paper. Do not read it yourself).  Ask if he wants to work here. <br>  Tell him about the real problems that have arisen lately, ask how he would solve them. <br>  Ask him about the software that runs in your information system, about his experience working with him.  Ask narrowly focused questions. <br>  Here you have to understand whether it will become a link in your information system or not.  That is, whether he can work directly in your company.  The most crucial stage. <br>  Ask questions about the company (if knowledge of this provides practical value in the work). <br>  It is also worth asking the fundamental theory if it is so important to you. <br><br>  <u>Stage five, final.</u> <br>  Assign candidates 2 tasks.  The first must be from the area in which he is to understand according to the results of the past.  The second must be from an area with which he has little knowledge.  To help - Google and mana. <br>  Choose the one who will cope best.  If speed is important in work, then it is the fastest. <br><br>  <b>Now about drawing up a vacancy announcement.</b>  Quite briefly. <br>  If you do not understand anything in IT - do not write this ad. <br>  Do not write a lot of scary words in the ad.  If your phrase ‚Äúknowledge of PHP, MySQL, site design‚Äù hides ‚Äúwe have a site in Jumla, we sometimes need to change the information on it‚Äù - you are shit and not a recruiter.  Fair.  Get out. <br>  Do not specify a large salary range.  If the person who came to you initially faces only 25 tr.  - and write.  Otherwise, administrators of a high level will come to you, who will almost immediately turn around and leave, twirling their fingers at the temple.  If the salary range is really large (well, it happens that support in one company is paid from 20k to 50k) - clearly indicate where it will be higher.  The contingent of those who responded to the vacancy will more accurately correspond to your requests. <br>  If you are looking for a 1c programmer and one admin in a medium-sized company, kill yourself.  No, honestly.  Well, or something like that.  And even more so for "all the same thousand dollars in Moscow" <br>  Do not write "experience of 5 years."  Experience in 5 years does not mean anything if the admin has been sitting for 5 years in a public institution and has not yet closely communicated with SATA.  It makes sense to specify 1-2 years, if you want to weed out those who do not have it at all. <br>  Do not write what is required B / O - it is not required as a candidate for admins to work as an admin well.  Coupled with ‚Äúwork experience from 5 years, age 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãyears‚Äù - only those who are looking not for work, but earnings will look at your vacancy.  And this is a big difference. <br>  Do not specify the maximum age - the human psychology is designed so that when he sees the inscription ‚Äúyou need to be 25-35 years old,‚Äù he will think that at 36 he will be fired.  And do not send you a resume. <br>  Do not specify the minimum age of 20+ years.  If you do not need students - just write.  If you need an adult - just write.  It doesn‚Äôt matter where he worked since he was 16, if he got a good work experience. <br><br>  <b>How to screen out inappropriate resumes.</b> <br>  If you do not understand anything in IT - keep your hands off.  Put a friend admin admin beer.  Let him read them. <br>  Clicking on the line in the summary that the person worked for a year in a decent position in the system integrator?  You are not a personnel officer. <br>  They refused a candidate who has a MCSA certificate, and instead of him was invited to interview someone who has several lower level certificates?  the wall is somewhere nearby. <br>  You think that the entry in the summary of the form "worked with DHCP, DNS, HTTP, FTP, hplip, AD, netware utilities, mc, total commander &lt;a bunch of different words you do not understand&gt; for the last 8 years" is more valuable than a concise "8 years of administration Windows, 5 years of using Linux on the desktop, 3 years of FreeBSD and WinServer administration experience?  Yes, you die at last. <br>  You put your resume in the trash bin, which says "year of experience with Cisco and Juniper network equipment, 2 years of experience with SOHO network equipment", and were glad that you wrote a very good and valuable boy something like "5 years of experience with network equipment companies Asus, LinkSys, d-link, huawei, ralink, intel, realtek?  Are you here?  You should be tortured on the rack or in Spanish boots. <br>  You don‚Äôt know what LPI is and ‚Äúan active developer of rsync and rsnapshot utilities‚Äù and you are happy about candidates with MS certificates, although all the servers in your company work on Linux?  I have already collected my bag and left for you. <br><br>  In general, look for those resumes in which the person does not leave in particular.  If the summary lists a huge list of software with which the candidate worked, most of which are applications for users at the Office level, then the person considers this to be their achievement. <br><br>  <b>Few personal thoughts and conclusions</b> <br>  Yes, it is personnel officers who don‚Äôt understand IT - the cornerstone of the well-being of most of us.  It is stupid managers who order on a flash what can easily be done on AJAX, avoiding incomprehensible words, deprive the well-being of many websites and companies. <br><br>  About "the reaper and the priest" - this is not as bad as it seems.  If you are hired wisely.  Combine the profession of admin and SEO-Schnick - you can.  Combining administration and design is a dubious pleasure.  The main thing is that the employer's appetites coincide with the capabilities of his corporate account. <br><br>  The fact that even good administrators from the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù do not see new trends is bad.  Very bad.  Today, much more important is the knowledge of how software works.  To ask about ISA, the OSI model (if it is really not required regularly for work), to multiply 2 numbers in the binary CC is moveton.  You will not want to work.  Fundamental knowledge of computer science with each month are becoming increasingly useless and highly specialized.  The ability of ITshnik to live skillfully in a huge stream of regularly received new information and to react to regularly changing trends in the world of software, hardware and the Community comes to the fore. <br><br>  Also important was the communication function of admins.  Successfully the admin who knows how to communicate with people.  Even compared to somewhat more experienced colleagues.  Not the admin who sets up mega-friendly services anymore, but the one who can prove their necessity and find a common language with the authorities in this regard. <br><br>  Why am I so frivolous about fundamental knowledge?  A very simple.  I have completed the 3rd year university course.  We have almost everyone in the stream - they know the theory very well.  Can tell by heart the OSI model.  They learned it.  Darted.  Do you think they can tell all this with examples in the modern world?  yes figushki.  Do you think they quickly understand the new software?  As if not so.  Do you think they understand what the user needs?  Yeah, wait.  Do you think they understand something in DNS records, registrars and hosters, nevertheless perfectly aware of the theory of DNS?  Yes of course. <br>  After a couple of years, all this flow will spill over to employers.  Hold on.  And do not make mistakes.  By this time I will have a note that I worked 2.5 years, a good job from an employer (because I like this job), 5 years of actual work experience and 11 years of intensive flooding in various forums and IRC channels on which it is possible to pick out knowledge that is much more valuable in practice than the whole theory put together.  And who do you need?  And the theory, if necessary, I will learn by heart in a couple of evenings - because I know her in general terms and regularly use her part in practice.  Oh yeah, I forgot, I also know something that is not taught in any university. <br><br>  The popularity of the profession will play a cruel joke.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it was with lawyers (and still remains). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that someone this article will make you think and reconsider your opinion. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And finally - to be a good admin, you need to want to work as an admin and be ready for all the disadvantages of this profession. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Otherwise you will fail.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285340/</a></p>
