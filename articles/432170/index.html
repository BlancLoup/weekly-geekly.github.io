The meaning of this popular wisdom is that the process of moving is fraught with stress, bustle, feelings and, of course, running around, which can also happen during a fire, and sometimes with the loss of valuable property.  Besides, when you are going in a hurry, you pack things for transportation haphazardly, then you are likely to lose something, break it, forget it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bd/37b/58d/6bd37b58dd31bf1f2207c679c24e2c6b.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine the difficulties that a hosting provider faces when it comes to transferring furniture and household goods boxes from one site to another, but servers, storage systems and other related equipment, installing it in a new place and putting it to work, yes, so that customers almost did not notice. <br><br>  "Moving" the server requires a special approach.  Servers and storage systems contain important information, the loss of which can give the customer a lot of problems and even lead to the closure of the company.  Network equipment is not furniture, its movement is complicated by sensitive electronic stuffing, so any vibrations and shaking in the process of moving should be excluded.  And any unplanned downtime can lead to financial losses for customers.

Is it possible to do this in a short time?  How to make such a move to reduce stress and loss to a minimum?  But why should servers be placed abroad at all? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Why do we need this abroad?</font> </h2><br>  Many companies today choose not only modern Russian data centers, but also the most advanced <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/320218/">foreign platforms</a> for hosting virtual servers <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/307494/">VPS / VDS</a> .  Why do they resort to the services of <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/416133/">foreign data centers</a> ?  This <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/319716/">gives a number of advantages</a> .  And Switzerland is considered to be one of the best places to host physical servers.  Today, companies are often worried about the security of hosting their IT platforms and data, and this is exactly the competence of the Swiss data center. <br><br>  They offer flexible infrastructure services that do not ‚Äútouch‚Äù with customer data: only employees of the hosting provider have access to the containment area where the equipment is located.  They take on the task of ensuring physical security, taking care of power supply, cooling, etc. <br><br>  For example, the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/320218/">data center Deltalis</a> is a bunker created in the mountain, which was once intended for the Swiss armed forces, which is now at the disposal of Deltalis customers and equipped with all the Tier IV standards.  It uses a multiparameter, modular protection system, controls entry points, access rights, has several security perimeters, records all actions of guests and staff, identifies it by the veins of the hands (this is more reliable than fingerprints), has strict ISO certified regulations, all systems are audited annually, and all employees are trained and certified. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a09/ecd/487/a09ecd4874ea1416e57e703849fa15fb.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The entrance to the former bunker is now the Deltalis data center.</font></i> <br><br>  In addition, Switzerland is a country with very strict data protection laws and regulations.  State structures do not have the right to access any information located on servers in this country until the relevant legal decision of the local authorities takes effect.  There is no procedure for government agencies to request data from data centers or providers without the knowledge of the client. <br><br>  The data center can provide access to local or international law enforcement agencies access to client servers only at the decision of the relevant authorities.  No other requests from law enforcement agencies of other countries are recognized.  Swiss data centers have no obligation to comply with the orders of any authorities, including international, with the exception of the Swiss government. <br><br>  An important advantage of Russian hosting providers providing their services on the basis of a foreign platform is the presence of a Russian-language technical support service, which foreign providers do not always offer.  In addition, Russian hosting providers are well aware of the problems and requirements of Russian customers, and this often helps to resolve issues that have arisen as soon as possible.  But back to the move. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">It's time to go</font> </h2><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/427607/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25b/916/834/25b916834a0938a2482f3c5e6a319d16.jpg"></a> <br>  <i><font color="#999999">The Interxion data center is located in Zurich, in the heart of Europe, where a favorable business environment, attractive tax regime and highly educated workforce contribute to the prosperity of financial and technological organizations in the world.</font></i> <br><br>  It is about moving to the well-known data center of the <a href="https://www.interxion.com/Locations/zurich/">Interxion</a> holding in Zurich, Switzerland.  This task arose from a Russian hosting provider, RUVDS, when the company commissioned its own pressure zone at the Interxion data center.  She has previously used the site in the aforementioned Deltalis data center in Attinghausen, Switzerland.  And now it was necessary to relocate the equipment to a new place. <br><br>  The move was required due to the reorientation of the activities of the owner of the Deltalis data center, which led to the need to use all the capacity of the data center for its own needs, in connection with which contracts with all customers were limited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/710/986/3147109861443332ae818f876124b08f.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">All of these servers needed to be transported to a new site, switching ports from one data center to another so that after turning on the power, the customers would immediately have Internet access.</font></i> <br><br>  Of course, such a move needed to be clearly planned: select a new site and provider, having studied the history of data centers and information about their reliability, consider the process of moving: how to dismantle and transport equipment, in what order to install it.  Everything should be accompanied by the transfer of IP addresses and ports to the new data center.  And of course, customers needed to be notified in advance about a break in the work of services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56c/9ea/c76/56c9eac76324962eba5d35892ee32df8.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Go!</font></i> <br><br>  The move began with the gradual shutdown of equipment at 00:00 on November 10.  All work was completed as early as 04:30 on November 10.  For 4.5 hours, RUVDS experts neatly disconnected everything, took it out of the data center - the bunker, loaded it into transport, transported it along beautiful Swiss roads, and then collected it and hooked it up in a new place. <br><br>  Fortunately, everything went twice as fast as planned and without a single failure, like a Swiss watch.  At the very beginning of its history, RUVDS already had a similar experience.  Then several servers by the project organizers within a few hours changed the old data center to their own data center in Korolev.  Everything also went smoothly.  A long-time partner of RUVDS and a reliable communications provider, RETN Gmbh, was responsible for the current move. <br><br>  While the servers were on the way, RETN redirected the traffic, set up the announcement of the subnets to the new data center, and when the servers were turned on, the clients could immediately start working fully with their VPS, and these are virtual servers of several thousand clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ed/a95/9a9/4eda959a91c5a711a79a280ef1670b2d.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">A fascinating, but short journey.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7d/dc2/bf7/b7ddc2bf740320fe5c860e4c6b8b7f74.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Empty rack.</font></i> <br><br>  During the move, the RETN provider transferred all the ports from one data center to another, so that when they turn on the power, the customers immediately have Internet access. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Destination</font> </h2><br>  Interxion is one of the leading collocation service providers in Europe.  The network of data centers of the company covers 13 cities and has 50 highly reliable sites.  Among the company's customers are the Nasdaq Exchange and many public companies.  In 2011, Interxion was listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE (INXN). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cc/046/526/8cc0465269e19848f2863c4912055534.jpg"><br><br>  The data center Interxion ZUR1 is located 10 minutes from the center of Zurich.  ZUR1 is certified according to ISO 27001 and ISO 22301 standards, has a level of reliability of 99.999%, and provides direct access to the main traffic exchange hubs in Switzerland (SwissIX) and in Europe (NL-IX). <br><br>  The ZUR1 data center is distinguished by a high degree of network connectivity and is capable of providing high speed connection with resources in 80% of Europe with a 30 ms network latency (round-trip delay). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e23/cd7/c69/e23cd7c69cfded2c505db34f7229fc7f.jpg"><br><br>  The data center is made according to the 2N redundancy standard in terms of electrical supply and N + 1 in terms of cooling and air conditioning systems.  The data center provides the required microclimate in each hermetic zone, and the levels of humidity and temperature required for the optimal functioning of the equipment are guaranteed by the SLA. <br><br>  After entering the data center on a magnetic pass, the visitor passes the verification of documents receives a magnetic card.  Then, to get into the elevator, you must use a fingerprint scanner.  Everything that happens in the data center is broadcast around the clock on the monitors of the security service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/327/f1f/b15/327f1fb1534b8bc26d5670b498b4db9b.jpg"><br><br>  For maximum protection of equipment, all server racks are placed in separate units (cages).  Each cage has an individual access system, its own video surveillance, sensors that respond to changes in volume and movement. <br>  In addition to protecting the pillars, the passage to each containment area is also equipped with a two-factor identification system, which includes verification of the magnetic pass and fingerprints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe2/b81/854/fe2b818549410fbd384f24647354cd54.jpg"><br><br>  Customer equipment is supported in climate-controlled environments, with the appropriate temperature and humidity parameters specified in the SLA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d5/3f6/3be/5d53f63bec34c4c2d1ac485ecedc4219.png"><br><br>  All Equipment has two power inputs, each of which is independently equipped with a UPS and a backup power supply from a diesel generator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26f/a75/165/26fa7516561b23d841d99c76daa397d5.jpg"><br><br>  The data center ZUR1 receives power from two independent substations of different electricity suppliers.  If the city power is lost, the UPS automatically transfers the load to the batteries.  At the same time, the automation system gives the command to start the diesel generator.  In less than a minute, the equipment goes to working capacity, after which the data center begins to be powered by a diesel generator set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acd/790/2b4/acd7902b4d729924d0b6de05ead53016.jpg"><br><br>  In accordance with the strict Swiss rules, in the data center systems of early smoke detection (Vesda) are installed. <br><br>  An early warning system of a potential fire detects the presence of smoke with a loss of visibility per meter from 0.005% to 20%.  Vesda uses active smoke detection, which consists in the continuous suction of air through a pipe system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/035/6f0/099/0356f0099239ef3e3b48d205034ede52.jpg"><br><br>  The data center in Zurich uses renewable energy and is certified as the only ‚Äúgreen‚Äù data center in Switzerland.  It uses free cooling systems and closed cold corridors.  These measures have reduced cooling costs by 30%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e5/224/ec5/1e5224ec5cc52ad3bba9ea2c6e2849cd.jpg"><br><br>  Inergen is installed in the data center for gas extinguishing.  Inergen is a non-toxic and non-flammable gas that does not harm the environment and does not damage equipment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">What is the result?</font> </h2><br>  Moving is an undesirable part of the life of the hosting provider, but with proper organization there are no problems.  Due to the need to change the data center, RUVDS found perhaps one of the most reliable sites in Europe, once again convinced of the reliability and responsibility of its partner - RETN. <br><br>  Like the old one, the new site is designed to provide clients with the services of renting virtual servers VPS / VDS.  The implementation of projects in Switzerland ensures a high level of data security - technological and legal - as well as the optimization of access speed for European customers due to its convenient geographical location.  <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub">VPS</a> services in Zurich are available from November 11, 2018 to both Russian and foreign customers of RUVDS at the same low prices.  They are focused primarily on the corporate segment: government agencies, banks, stock market players. <br><br>  Currently, the hosting provider <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub%3Fyclid%3D6892959115207776372">RUVDS</a> has its own TIER 3 data center in Korolev, Moscow region, as well as pressure zones in the data centers of Interxion (Switzerland), London Equinix LD8 (United Kingdom), and MMTS-9 (Moscow).  All containment systems meet the reliability level not lower than TIER 3, and the high speed of work and flexible tariff plans make web hosting attractive for customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6a/c45/c3a/e6ac45c3a5093cfa3edd63fee13179f6.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Huawei two-socket servers are suitable for working with Internet applications and important corporate systems, for processing and storing big data, cloud computing, and providing telecommunication services.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">They are used by hosting providers and VPS, for example, RUVDS is the official partner of Huawei.</font></i> <br><br>  After commissioning in <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/427607/">the Interxion data center of the RUVDS</a> containment zone, with the support of <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/314024/">Huawei</a> and the international provider RETN, the prices for virtual servers (VDS / VPS) RUVDS in Zurich traditionally do not differ from the prices for virtual servers in other RUVDS service centers in London and Moscow.  All RUVDS clients can choose a virtual server in the data center that best meets their goals at the same low prices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432170/</a></p>
