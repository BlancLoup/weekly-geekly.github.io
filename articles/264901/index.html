      The name Vscale is an abbreviation for vector scaling - vector scaling.  We use this term to describe the capabilities of a modern virtual infrastructure, on the basis of which you can place projects with an architecture of any complexity.  They can be scaled both vertically and horizontally.  Moreover, both types of scaling can be combined in a single project.  The metaphor of a vector representing a generalized type of scaling across the entire infrastructure is well suited to describe this practice. <br><br><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><br><br>  Among the advantages of the new service, first of all I would like to note: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Modern hardware platform.</b>  Vscale is based on a high-performance hardware platform: Intel Xeon E5v3 processors, DDR4 memory, server-class SSD drives.  Because of this, we can guarantee high speed sites and applications. </li><li>  <b>High speed deployment.</b>  The process of creating a new server due to server SSD takes from 20 to 50 seconds. </li><li>  <b>Flexible pricing policy.</b>  Hourly charges can reduce the cost of testing applications and change the tariff plan in any period of time. </li><li>  <b>Convenient control panel.</b>  Working on a new service, we sought to make its control panel as convenient and intuitive as possible. </li><li>  <b>A simple API</b> that simplifies the interaction of developers with the infrastructure. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Operating Systems </h2><br><br>  Currently the following operating systems are available for installation: <br><br><ul><li>  Ubuntu 14.04; </li><li>  Debian 8; </li><li>  CentOS 7. </li></ul><br><br>  Over time, we plan to supplement this list with other distributions and images with already installed software.  If you have any suggestions and suggestions on this subject - write, we will try to implement.  Warning questions - Windows will not. <br><br><h2>  Virtualization system </h2><br><br>  KVM is used as the virtualization system in the new service.  We chose KVM because it has the following advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Independence of resources.</b>  Each virtual server is allocated a separate area in memory and on the hard disk.  This allows you to avoid "overcell" resources (a situation where the hoster sells more resources than is actually available). </li><li>  <b>The ability to use modified kernels of operating systems.</b>  Thanks to this KVM feature, we will be able to offer users a wide range of distributions and ready-made images with pre-installed software. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Features of billing </h2><br><br>  Tariffing in Vscale is carried out on an hourly basis.  At the same time, we have fixed monthly rates. <br>  The fact is that funds are deducted from the balance every hour, but the settlement period is 672 hours (= 28 days).  After the limit is reached, the write-offs are not made until the end of the current month. <br><br>  Separately, it should be said about the cost of the last hour.  The cost of the cheapest configuration is 29 kopecks per hour, or 200 rubles per month.  If we proceed from the above figures, the hourly rate should be 200 / (24 * 28) = 0, 2976 rubles (29, 76 kopecks).  For reasons of convenience, we round off the cost per hour.  The balance to the round figure is the cost of the last hour.  If you decide to switch to a more productive configuration, the deductions from the balance will be carried out at a new rate from the moment of transition. <br>  Please note that the funds are deducted even if the server is turned off: the system resources still remain reserved for you.  To stop writing, the server will need to be removed. <br><br>  The cost of all configurations includes a limited amount of free traffic.  The traffic is calculated on the basis of actual consumption. If the monthly package is exceeded, a fee of 0.5 rubles per gigabyte is charged. <br><br><h2>  Locations </h2><br><br>  At the moment, all servers are in our data center in St. Petersburg, but in the future it will be possible to install servers in Moscow. <br>  We plan to host servers in other locations.  If you have any suggestions, write! <br><br><h2>  Network </h2><br><br>  All servers are connected to the network at a speed of 1 Gbit / s. <br>  The servers are connected to the same network as the Selectc clients.  Because of this, we can guarantee good ping and excellent network connectivity, including with Tier-1 operators. <br><br><h2>  Performance tests </h2><br><br>  Not to be unfounded, we decided to test all of our configurations: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2015/07/24/JxzizumiEccJ0eQy">512MB RAM, 1 VCPU, 20GB SSD</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2015/07/30/aScYgiUNUoEIvoop">1024MB RAM, 1 VCPU, 30GB SSD</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2015/07/30/KcvE9GhSgZS7EIuw">2048MB RAM, 2 VCPU, 40GB SSD</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2015/07/30/DuPwO2C9ncIt5T6X">4096MB RAM, 2 VCPU, 60GB SSD</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://serverbear.com/benchmark/2015/07/24/D3HKggl6qITUyEqa">8192MB RAM, 4 VCPU, 80GB SSD</a> </li></ul><br><br><h2>  How to try </h2><br><br>  After two months of beta testing, we went into commercial operation.  To try a new service, register and activate the promotional code. <br><br>  <b>SCALET200</b> <br><br>  After that, your bonus balance will be replenished by 200 rubles.  This is quite enough for a month of working with the server with the simplest configuration (1 CPU / 512 MB / 20GB core / 1TB traffic core).  You can test other configurations, but in this case there will be enough money on the bonus balance for a shorter period. <br><br><h2>  Referral program </h2><br><br>  Any Vscale user can take part in the referral program.  The basis of our program is the principle of "400 + 400".  How it works? <br>  First you create a referral link and send it to your friends and colleagues.  If one of them registers with this link, he will become your referral and receive 400 rubles for the bonus balance. <br>  And after your referral spends 400 real rubles, you will get 400 bonus rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264901/</a></p>
