      Service?  Probably comes from the English word "service". <br>  How do you mean ‚Äúservice‚Äù?  Well as: Service, Service, Service, Service. <br><br>  Trite?  Yes! <br><br>  But what is not clear is how to translate such phrases: service, services.  They are so often heard!  How? <br><br>  Especially cool sounds: services of service of service.  Just the removal of the brain through the backache. <br><br>  Go ahead? <br>  How do you like the phrase "IT service" or "IT services"?  Where did it come from?  And it came from ITIL v2, in the translation of the library of the best IT management experience, an error was made.  There the word ‚Äúservice‚Äù was translated as ‚Äúservice‚Äù.  The translation of ITIL v3 corrected this error, gave the correct translation of the word ‚Äúservice‚Äù as ‚Äúservice‚Äù, but it was too late.  The marketers picked up the error and now we have IT services around. <br><br>  These are all more or less tolerable errors with minimal damage to the country's economy. <br><br>  But the bomb that broke the brain of the total majority of IT professionals.  Just the word "service". <br>  We take a typical dialogue of two IT specialists: <br>  - what are you doing, Vasya? <br>  - about!  Petya!  I'm doing such a cool service here! <br><br>  Do you understand what I mean?  I'm not very.  It could be some kind of web service for data exchange between web applications, it could be a website or a web application, maybe it created a product.  Maybe he organized a new service in the IT department.  Yes, there may be a lot of options, because the word "service" does not exist. <br><br>  This may seem trite or ridiculous, but according to my personal observations, where this word occurs, projects begin to limp, as do the results.  This word introduces confusion in communication between people.  Pictures of the world begin to diverge, and behind them conflicts begin and results blur in a haze of cloudiness of the heads. <br><br>  There is one more problem, the most important one, most likely the problem is not only for Petya, who needs to understand what Vasya means. <br><br>  The biggest problem is that Vasya himself most likely does not understand what he is doing. <br>  This problem is very big and deep, but I will give a simple example, one of many, for understanding: <br>  1. Vasya is doing an IT service within the IT department at a certain enterprise, according to the methods of ITIL \ ITSM <br>  2. Do you think Vasya understands what a service is?  Vasya may think that he is doing the service, but in fact, he writes some kind of computer application, or maybe he sets up a program for cool, or he advises users great.  The probability of understanding Vasya of the meaning of this word tends to zero.  After all, this term in ITIL is described only partially.  Details need to search in other sources, and there is no description of the word "service".  Because there is no such word at all.  Basta. <br>  3. But if Vasya was doing an IT service, there would be a little more chance of success.  Because the term "IT service" is a little clearer.  And the definition of the word ‚ÄúService‚Äù can be found in other sources and supplement the methodological basis for building an IT department for competent methods. <br><br>  For example, ‚ÄúService‚Äù is the creation of favorable conditions for someone.  This definition is in ISO 9000. <br><br>  Based on this definition, we can significantly revise the essence of computer support services or such services as ‚Äú1C Accounting‚Äù. <br>  Where the quality parameter will not be how often the IT specialist runs around the users, but how he often rests and does not run. <br>  Because in one case, a <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25C8%25C1%25C4">BDT</a> is required, an IT hero is needed who runs and rescues poor users (IT service consumers), and with the right approach should be an IT bummer who ideally receives only one call per month inviting him to the cake .  I exaggerate for a better idea. <br><br>  In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why many IT departments never switch to ITSM rails and cannot start providing high-quality IT services.  It‚Äôs no secret that many ITSM projects fail, and IT managers conclude ‚Äúthis ITSM does not work, it‚Äôs not for the Russian soul, the mentality is not that, and so on‚Äù <br><br>  Let's communicate understandable.  In Russian.  Then we will begin to understand each other and the number of successful projects will be higher. <br><br>  On the Rights of jokes.  With some truth.  Everyone defines the truth share for himself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184758/</a></p>
