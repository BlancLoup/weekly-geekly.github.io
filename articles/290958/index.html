There is no need to talk about the fact that this topic is highly demanded: all the hunting and recruiting sites simply fill with the number of job offers for personal assistants and business assistants. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80a/f4d/137/80af4d137f6e483e8e162e91e2cac49e.jpg"><br><br>  Also, I immediately want to warn that this article has not been paid by anyone and contains only the subjective research of the author.  We‚Äôll just try to figure out which information systems or live services are capable of providing real assistance to Russian business today, and in what way it can be expressed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/f1c/883/f50f1c883ff1447d9f7693881a49accc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f43/5db/3cc/f435db3ccf3041bea7c1c95258ca3a2f.jpg"><br><br>  So, for the personal services of an assistant, even in the provinces, money is offered very considerable, which tells us about the potential demand for ready-made systems and developments in this area.  But in fact, not so much is worthy of noteworthy major systems in this review, and they are mainly related to the support of financial statements, legal advice and the transfer of documentation between partners.  Well, it would seem, and what else can you think of in support of an ordinary entrepreneur? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f38/66e/6b3/f3866e6b32b44c91a7b10bb3cb2d1119.jpg">

      But it turns out that some specialists are looking for new, more interesting services, expanding the number of opportunities and approaching the issue of business support.  And this is great: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/69c/70d/4cd69c70d76c476baff65f1643e1eb8c.jpg"><br><br>  Let's try to analyze the direction vector of the thoughts of developers of such non-trivial services; it seems to me that they should reason like this: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhat is a business in itself?</i>  <i>What hundreds of processes and tasks does it consist of, does it include magical techniques, or is it arranged only on hard work?</i>  <i>What components could it be divided into?</i>  <i>To do this, try to answer the key question: what is the 99% of the work of a businessman?</i>  <i>As you know, just good hard work is not yet a business, because the same Stakhanov was not a businessman.</i>  <i>Similarly, to provide one-time services, do hacks - this is also not a business, a hack is not enough setting for the stream, in some way the automation of a successful transaction that has benefited, the scaling of a one-time success. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Indeed, I personally came to the same conclusion that the essence of any business lies in the constant search for the best opportunities and the successful implementation of bold ideas.  This definition also includes constant attempts at optimization, one might even say ‚Äúredesign‚Äù the status quo;  attempts of such redistribution of existing resources through their own efforts, so that outsiders would be massively ready for these efforts to voluntarily give up their hard-earned money.  It is also very important not to forget that business is inseparable with risk, as it exists in an open system with not fully comprehensible opportunities. <br><br>  Perhaps, enthusiastic about the success of the <a href="http://www.getmagicnow.com/">Magic</a> service, the foremost workers in the business services sector today are ready to offer any exotic services to support the entrepreneur, even attaching a whole team of "personal consultants and assistants" who seem capable of literally anything: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ba/e46/713/0bae467138a04c97a4888becae929037.jpg"><br><br>  Indeed, a whole team of young, proactive assistants who know ready answers to all questions sounds very tempting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7a/76a/d83/a7a76ad83e6e4689a5a6afcda9c57085.jpg"><br><br>  However, I, as a pessimist with experience, immediately begins to perplex one detail: ‚Äú <i>And if a business is so successful that it could make a profit on monthly turnover of more than ten million rubles, would he need advice from yesterday‚Äôs students sitting on small salaries?</i> ‚Äù Name it excessive suspiciousness, but I consider myself entitled to ask how all these people, sitting with a cup of coffee in a cozy office, may know the subtleties and life hacking about my business more than I myself, plowing 14 hours a day without days off? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f4/4f1/780/3f44f17806d742399ed56725f7a3591c.jpg"><br><br>  But in general, I would like to note an interesting trend - today some online services are already striving to create an entire ecosystem around the support of entrepreneurs.  Need a website or promotion?  - here are the contacts of the company ‚Äúfrom our circle‚Äù.  Need a new supplier, repair service, office cleaning or wholesaler?  - here is a list of guys "from our circle."  Thus, from the usual program for filling out accounts and making payments, one can observe how the business services before our eyes gradually mutate into closed business clubs.  It can be assumed that in a few years the main thing that any young startup manager will need to do is to join one of these ‚Äúbusiness assistants‚Äù services, and then, depending on the chosen tariff, receive the phone numbers of the right people and entire teams for further full-fledged mail. promotion in all directions.  At least for beginners, such a service seems to be critically necessary, and all reports on income-expenditure, document flow and control of hired employees will recede into the background, before the end of the first calendar year. <br><br>  Perhaps this is too naive a forecast, but I see in the future the merging of accelerators, simple document management services and online services that are currently emerging with personal assistants into one set of management companies that keep thousands of large and small entrepreneurs under their wing within a single ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù.  It seems to me that this will only benefit small businesses, when instead of today's extremely aggressive environment with low chances of survival, it will be possible to get moral and economic support from ‚Äúyour clan‚Äù depending on the chosen tariff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/0c2/944/bac0c294419f429280f60a21929365d2.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the next step is the complete transfer of all business functions to artificial intelligence.  My prediction is that in just three to five years, every inhabitant of the Earth will be able to receive daily alerts about how exactly today, based on current global needs, it will be possible to most profitably and successfully invest each person‚Äôs resources: time, talent, knowledge, professional skills and available materials.  It seems to me that it is worth starting the work on such a service of the future right now.  Well, with the holiday, dear entrepreneurs! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290958/</a></p>
