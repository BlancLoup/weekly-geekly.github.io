The fact is that all the cases described earlier about 100-500 rubles, in my opinion, are not ‚Äúkidalovo" at all.  Not the scope - it's like a trifle pockets tyrit.  So, I recently got a bill for using mobile services in April.  Just in case, if suddenly the picture did not load, I dictate in words ‚Äútwo thousand four dollars and seventy two cents‚Äù.  Perhaps this is my personal record, even a wonderful Beeline international roaming nervously smokes on the sidelines. <br><br>  Dear readers of this small competition is offered - try, without going under the cut, to guess what services should have been used to make it happen.  You can even proceed to the site of the operator, to get acquainted with the tariffs. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Drumroll!  The bill was for the data.  There‚Äôs nothing to do with the content - Lost's seasons alone at the prices of the Itunes Store would be 40 pieces.  The bill was for traffic.  And the situation unfolded as follows: <br><br>  It so happened that in early April I had a 3G modem.  The seller in the store when selling the device in every possible way emphasized that it connects it to the unlimited data plan.  I know perfectly well that I consume an average of about 40 gigabytes per month, so I didn‚Äôt want any surprises and asked twice.  To which the Mexican comrade vigorously assured me that ‚ÄúUnlimited is Unlimited‚Äù, on which we parted.  The opportunity to use this connection was presented to me in a couple of weeks, when I was already in another city.  A couple of days, I have no problem shaking what I needed, since the speed of 300-400 Kb per second allowed.  And then suddenly a letter arrived that the account was suspended because the service threshold was exceeded. <br><br>  A call to the technical support service revealed the fact that my Mexican friend lied shamelessly.  Whether by inexperience or by malicious intent, one can no longer understand.  Only the tariff I had was only 5 GB per month.  I even somehow did not particularly grieve.  Until the end of the month there were 10 days left, I decided that everything would be turned on on the 1st, and 5 GB per month would be enough for me in case of any unforeseen situations. <br><br>  On the first day, I climbed into the network again, they did not let me go.  I went to look at the statistics, and saw what you saw on the previous screenshot.  Debt $ 2000 + Again dialing in technical support.  Again, new details.  It turns out they turned me off at the 5 GB level.  The procedure for stopping an account for a good account takes about 1.5-2 hours.  This time was enough for me to ‚Äúsuck in‚Äù another 2GB.  And the cost of one kilobyte in such cases is about 9 cents.  That in terms of gigabytes is approximately equal to $ 1,000 per gigabyte. <br><br>  At the same time, 5 or 6 girls on the other end of the phone insulted me assuredly that this was a normal, fair price for the Internet and there were no errors in the calculations.  They were as convincing as if they themselves paid at least every month.  I already started to believe them, since in the end I had to switch to the next boss, who agreed to correct the bill. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61468/</a></p>
