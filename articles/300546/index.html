Despite the fact that there were few changes in the staff of the largest Russian IT companies and media resources, they attracted public attention. <br><br>  Someone stubbornly denied rumors about the upcoming departure, and now left the company.  Someone left the post due to old age.  With someone they did not renew the contract.  Someone quit, but now he doesn‚Äôt know what he will do next. <br><br>  Some employers value ‚Äúemotionality‚Äù in employees and are even ready to offer for this position on the board of directors.

But Svinarenko at the post will be engaged in a clearer planning and organization of the fund‚Äôs work, Bortnik says. <br><br>  2.

The board of directors of the operator has satisfied his resignation letter.  Instead, the.

Ivan Tavrin will work on the board of directors of USM Holding, of which he is a minority shareholder. <br><br>  3. Andrei Kravchenko, head of educational projects at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.ru Group,</a> left the company.  This was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DAVoloshin/posts/1048705828524048">told by the</a> head of the Kravchenko, director of the department of research and education Mail.ru Group, Dmitry Voloshin on his page on Facebook. <br><br>  Kravchenko was responsible for educational projects for additional training of programmers at Moscow State Technical University, Moscow State University, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, worked on the Mail.Ru Group internship programs, and also held IT championships in the holding. <br><br>  Kravchenko came to MRG in 2013.

This Koemlov <a href="https://roem.ru/27-04-2016/223317/kozlov-leaves/">told</a> Roem.ru: <br><blockquote>  At Sputnik, my colleagues and I did a great job in building a grocery team that is unique within Rostelecom.  This is a very big success when a full-fledged Internet company with people who have experience in the market leaders, Yandex, Mail.Ru Group, Rambler and others, appears inside the operator. <br><br>  In the past six months, active work has been done in developing a new strategy for Sputnik.  It provides for a greater focus on services for Rostelecom and custom development based on existing technologies and products. <br><br>  The final decision on what to do next, until I have accepted it, I am considering various options, both employment and own projects. </blockquote>  The company has not yet found a replacement for Kozlov. <br><br>  5.

Another points to family circumstances.  Complaints to the effectiveness of work Burenin leadership does not. <br><br><h4>  And for dessert </h4><br>  The founder and chief editor of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post,</a> Arianna Huffington, joined <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber‚Äôs</a> board of directors to develop the company's ‚Äúemotional‚Äù side.  This was <a href="https://newsroom.uber.com/ariannahuffington/">announced by the</a> founder and head of the service Travis Kalanik. <br><br>  According to Kalanik, Uber is counting on Huffington‚Äôs help in dealing with the company's customers.  ‚ÄúHer ability to tell stories is invaluable to me, as an engineer who is used to relying on data.  As I found out, this does not always work perfectly.  Arianna's emotionality is what I would like to learn from her, ‚Äùsaid the Uber manager. <br><br>  ‚ÄúArianna embodies the type of optimistic leadership that is needed to grow Uber.  Her ability to lead was a model for me for several years and I believe that in the new position she will take Uber to a new level, ‚Äùsaid Kalanik. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300546/</a></p>
