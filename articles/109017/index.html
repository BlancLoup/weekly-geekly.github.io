  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Negative feedback - effective SEO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An interesting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall">topic was</a> raised by journalists of the NY Times.  They conducted a journalistic investigation about the online store <b>DecorMyEyes.com</b> , which sells glasses designer models, and found an incredible thing.  It turns out that the owners of this store are doing everything possible so that people leave the maximum amount of <i>negative</i> feedback about the store.  A large number of such reviews is easy to verify, simply by running a search for the name of the store in Google. <br><br>  It would seem, why the store creates itself a negative PR?  Why are they especially rude to customers and billing them with additional services, balancing on the edge of the law?  Why lie about the lack of goods and violate the delivery time?  The answer is simple.  Due to the large number of incoming links from various forums, the store's website is in the first places in the search results.  For example, at the request of [ <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3DChristian%2BAudigier%2Bglasses">Christian Audigier glasses</a> ] they are in fifth place, immediately after the official site of Christian Audigier, the famous French designer of glasses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The store owners themselves insist that such tactics bring them substantial financial benefits.  The founder and owner of this Brooklyn store, Vitaly Borker, in an interview with the NY Times, cited statistics for one day: 120 orders, a turnover of $ 20 thousand, a profit of $ 3 thousand (from which it is necessary to pay wages and pay for advertising).  On the second floor of his office there is a warehouse with returned goods from dissatisfied customers - there are about $ 500 thousand points stored there. <br><br>  However, the NY Times journalists assume that the financial success of DecorMyEyes is nothing more than a fiction.  They can only believe in the word of Vitaly Borker, although he often speaks very rudely and few of his phrases in Russian can be understood by an American journalist.  [His welcome mat is emblazoned with a Russian phrase that roughly translates to ‚Äúgo away‚Äù].

      Vitali says that when the first time he received a complaint from the consumer protection society, he sent them a photo of his middle finger.  In a similar style, he communicates with customers. <br><br>  It must be admitted that such an approach can theoretically indeed be effective.  Google‚Äôs algorithms cannot distinguish a positive review from a negative one - and simply count the number of links.  And most people do not make inquiries about the store in which they want to make a purchase.  Due to the high positions in the search every day new customers come to the site. <br><br>  Store DecorMyEyes is selling items with eBay, and search engine optimization is their trump card.  If they were selling on eBay itself, the seller‚Äôs negative rating would be immediately visible.  And when you search through Google, nothing like that is visible. <br><br>  Vitaliy Borker says that at first they hired SEO firms that published positive reviews from the company to raise the site in the search results.  But over time, he realized that negative reviews give exactly the same effect for site promotion, while getting them much easier and they do not cost a penny. <br><br>  According to Borker, a massive threat to Visa and Mastercard payments may be a real threat to his business.  If during a certain month a sufficiently large number of buyers successfully withdraw payments, then it can be excluded from payment networks.  So far this has been avoided, Borker is in control.  In case of trouble, he says that he will open an account in the name of a friend and give him 1% of the profits. <br><br>  Vitaly Borker tries to keep correspondence with dissatisfied customers, because you need to maintain a special style of communication, and spends almost all his 19-hour working day (from 10 am to 5 am).  Often you have to attend court sessions.  What to do, these are the costs of such a business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109017/</a></p>
