Every year the work on its program is becoming more and more difficult not only because of the rapid development and maturation of the JS-ecosystem, but also because of the increasing quality and quantity of applications. <br><br>  This time, the program committee had to sort out ‚âà250 applications for 30 seats.  According to the statement of some of the PC participants, if desired, it was possible to make HolyJS in 4x4 format (4 tracks for 4 days).  And in addition to reports directly about JS, we expect bold experiments. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Now all the tickets for the conference itself are already sold out, but the opportunity to join the reports is still due to the online broadcasts.  Under the cut, they first wrote about what could be seen, and at the end how to look at it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The main blocks of the program </h2><br><ul><li>  "Frameworks" - reports on the use of frameworks.  This block was always on HolyJS anyway, but before that it was smeared.  After processing reviews from HolyJS 2018 Moscow, a clear request was made for the most practically applicable reports on this or that technical solution.  Components, SSR, approaches to working with APIs, semi-mobile apps and even practical ML in the browser can be found here. </li><li>  "From the author" - reports from people who are authors of very interesting and relevant decisions.  What could be more interesting than, after the report, to ask a question to the author of your favorite decision or to ask questions (possibly tricky) to the author of a competitor? </li><li>  "Tools" - reports on tools.  Speed, productivity, quality control, DX ... For all this, feel free to go here. </li><li>  Fundamentals are truly fundamental knowledge and concepts, after which you can reconsider your views on a lot or learn something fundamental. </li><li>  ‚ÄúExperimental‚Äù - reports outside of JS.  The purpose of the conference is not only to strengthen knowledge in the main areas, but also to expand the horizons, so as an experiment we decided to make a small, but very important unit with reports not about JS.  Let's see what happens. </li><li>  Workshops.  The second complex experiment, which was very much requested on the basis of feedback.  In each of them put enormous strength and knowledge. </li></ul><br>  Of course, Node.js, a11y, OSS and much more were not ignored. <br><br>  No matter how beautiful the main themes and blocks are, the most important thing is who is behind all this.  Let's get acquainted with our speakers. <br><br><h2>  Keynouters </h2><br>  Keynouts pass outside the main tracks, are intended for the entire audience and cover the most relevant or hot topics. <br><br><h3>  Ryan dahl </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/xb/14/ixxb14l99ai4sbhe3j8il5d35sm.jpeg" align="left">  Opens the Ryan Dahl conference.  Ryan is primarily known as the author of Node.js.  He was engaged in algebraic topology, was a resident in the Google Brain program, working with TensorFlow, made Node.js, and now presents us with his new project - Deno.  From the report we learn how, why and why Deno appeared.  You can get to know Ryan better with the help of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450752/">an interview</a> that just happened. <br><br><br><hr><br><h3>  Andrey Sitnik </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0n/i7/vb/0ni7vb9ltx800cokg139wnbm1nc.jpeg" align="left">  The first day will be closed by Andrey Sitnik.  Andrei is definitely one of the most interesting and recognizable figures of the Russian-speaking part of the JS community.  He is known as the author of many great tools from PostCSS, Autoprefixer, Logux, Browserlist, and so on to Nano ID and Size Limit, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/andrey_sitnik/status/1128208594015535106">not spared</a> even on the latest Google I / O.  Andrey will tell how to deal with his projects in the world of open-source today.  An <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/444652/">interview with</a> Andrey on the eve of the conference was also published. <br><br><br><hr><br><h3>  Alex Castillo </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5j/1e/fh/5j1efhxj-d9utiht5z0oelonn54.jpeg" width="170" height="170" align="left">  Closes the Alex Castillo conference.  Alex is a co-founder of a company specializing in neurotechnologies.  He will show how using neurointerface and JS you can do something interesting and really working.  This report will show us a bit of the future. <br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Speakers </h2><br>  In addition to keyouts, the conference will include 27 reports in three streams.  I would like to tell you about everyone, but then the article will be indecently long.  Therefore, let's try to look at the program from different angles: <br><br><ul><li>  Ilya Klimov is a front-end developer at GitLab, a trainer for the Kottans.Org project, a trainer for the JavaScript.Ninja project.  More than 15 years of programming in JS in all its manifestations: from microcontrollers to cloud video rendering.  This time, Ilya will talk about the basics of CI / CD in the framework of experimental reports not only about JS.  On this subject, Ilya had great lessons on his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/javascriptninja">Patreon</a> , and the report promises to be very interesting. </li><li>  Alexey Kozyatinsky is developing tools for working with JS in Chrome DevTools and is really digging deep into the wilds of V8.  Such often used things as `console` and debugging JS in Chrome DevTools are the work of Alexey.  He has already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkBHUEFYawTk">talked</a> about some interesting cases of working with JS in Chrome on last year's HolyJS 2018 Piter.  This time, the story goes about DevTools Protocol and how you can use it to build tools for Node.js and more.  Alexey is open for communication and will be happy to answer all questions on Chrome DevTools. </li><li>  Martin Splitt - OSS advocate and developer advocate on Google for Search &amp; web ecosystem.  Martin maintains an SEO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCrzUP6MmBW4%26list%3DPLKoqnv2vTMUPOalM1zuWDP9OQl851WMM9">blog</a> for SEO for JavaScript, and our public can be familiar with the many and coolest performances at many venues in Russia.  This time, he will talk about the work of Googlebot and other modern crawlers. </li><li>  Nadiia Dmytrenko is a software engineer in the team of the UI platform in Uber, one of the authors and maintainers of the open source component library Uber <a href="https://baseweb.design/">Web</a> .  Nadiia will talk about how to make a truly scalable component library for 500+ applications on React. </li><li>  Denis Mishunov is a front-end developer at GitLab.  Denis regularly speaks at international conferences.  In addition to the deep topics, his reports are distinguished by a special presentation of the coolest illustrations, which could not be overlooked in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVGoWhHhYpQU">debugger</a> report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVGoWhHhYpQU">;</a>  with HolyJS 2016 Moscow.  This time, Denis will talk about a very valuable experience of migration on the example of different hikes in different projects. </li><li>  David Khourshid is a web developer at Microsoft, the author of the <a href="https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate">xstate</a> library and many other <a href="https://github.com/davidkpiano">interesting projects</a> .  David will tell you how to start transparently monitoring the state in your applications with remember state machines and how to simplify work with these state machines as much as possible. </li><li>  Oleg Shelayev - developer advocate for the GraalVM project at OracleLabs, organizer of VirtualJUG and GDG Tartu meetings.  In 2017, it became Java Champion.  Oleg, perhaps the first Java Champion, which will speak at HolyJS, in the framework of experimental reports he will tell about GraalVM and will show stunning and very practical cases of sharing different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãtogether. </li><li>  Vitaly Slobodin is a co-founder of the Rostov IT-community, a perfectionist, a maintener who closed PhantomJS after several years of working on it.  Vitaly on practical examples will tell how to quickly and beautifully print PDF. </li></ul><br>  The entire program of reports can be found <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/">on the website</a> . <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Workshops </h2><br>  One of the most difficult experiments of this HolyJS is <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/trainings/">training</a> .  They are free for all those who will attend the conference, there is no need to register for them separately, it is enough to come to the hall. <br><br>  We tried to find something new and something practical, let's take a closer look at them and their authors: <br><br>  <b>Remove extra code from CSS Modules runtime using webpack (Stas Kurilov)</b> <br><br>  In recent years, Stas Kurilov has been developing tools for the frontend and works at JetBrains.  Once he decided to figure out how to insert svg on all JetBrains sites and plunged into a webpack for several years.  Stas will tell and show in stages how to remove extra code from CSS Modules runtime using a webpack.  Before visiting this workshop, you should familiarize yourself with his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaiYkJOPD9v8">report</a> with HolyJS 2018 Moscow. <br><br>  <b>Svelte Cookbook.</b>  <b>SvelteJS Master Class (Pavel Malyshev)</b> <br><br>  Pavel Malyshev is an experienced fullstack developer with 10+ years of experience, as well as a project manager and entrepreneur.  It will show how to start working with one of the most notorious endangered frameworks: SvelteJS.  At this training, all fans of SvelteJS expect an interesting surprise. <br><br>  Your feedback about trainings is very important to us. <br><br><h2>  Broadcast </h2><br>  How during the conference to join the reports without appearing at the event itself?  There are two ways. <br><br>  One is a <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D453108">free broadcast</a> on May 24th.  It is open and free for everyone, and reports from the main hall will get into it (and in the intervals between them there will be interviews with speakers). <br><br>  If this is not enough and you want to get the rest of the reports, then there is a second option - a <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/buy/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D453108">paid broadcast</a> .  The difference is that it goes both days, it has the opportunity to choose from all three halls, and after the conference is over, the owners of online tickets will quickly receive videos of all reports. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453108/</a></p>
