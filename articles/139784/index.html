Now taken a new frontier, which we want to talk about.  On the unlimited warranty on equipment and other goodies, read the tackle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Equipment warranty </h4><br>  10/28/2011 we started selling a new <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/m2m/blog/136097/">device of our production</a> .  Not everything was smooth, but within 2 weeks 99% of the shortcomings were eliminated, which were not revealed at the initial stage of testing.  There were also updates ‚Äúby air‚Äù and recall and the subsequent exchange of the first part of the devices.  Today we can proudly state that the equipment is completely ‚Äútorn off‚Äù, and in confirmation of our words we (by the way, the first of Ukrainian companies) introduce a <u>LIFETIME</u> warranty on all products we produce (devices and fuel level sensors, the exception is the battery, which it requires replacement depending on the operating conditions). <br>  Until March 31, 2012, a new version of the gps tracker will be available, which will have a Glonass receiver on board, but the price of the device will <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D312">still</a> be <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D312">available</a> . <br><br><h4>  15.000 connected devices </h4><br>  By the end of February, we reached the mark of 15,000 connected third-party devices located on our servers (excluding affiliate programs and <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/m2m_profi.php">sales of server software</a> , and our devices sold by us or our representatives).  After the events that took place in September last year (the service‚Äôs inability for 2 days) the up-time is kept at 99% and then only because of the planned updates, which we, in turn, try to perform at night.  Connected clients include small private logins up to 3-5 units, and large companies with parks of 30-100-300 objects.  Just with them came the intergraters, who for one reason or another are switching to our software.

    <h4>  Your biz in 10 minutes </h4><br>  Integrators are harsh people, they all want it cheaper, but at the same time that no one knows that the software they provide is not their own.  Someone used to use the Belarusian software, someone wrote and used his own, someone ordered it on the side.  In all cases, their business was built not only on the sale of equipment, but also on the post-sale customer support, which, of course, is available for a fee.  For these customers, we offered several options for cooperation.  In <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/m2m_hosting.php">one option,</a> we give an opportunity in 10 minutes to create your personalized page with all logos and texts, which at the time of impersonal the interface and will give the integrator, with a small amount of money, the opportunity to provide services at their tariffs and, most importantly, under their trademark. <br><br><h4>  Urban transport </h4><br>  In Ukraine, the first contacting company with a real request was KP Kherson Municipal Transport Service.  After getting acquainted with our system, the management of the enterprise came to the conclusion that it makes sense to use a non-turnkey solution (and none of the proposals considered did not suit them fully), and together with us to create a passenger traffic management system based on the daily work of such a fleet.  That part of our service, which was focused on working with routes, was refined (completely rewritten) already according to the terms of reference drawn up by dispatchers, ATP management and regulatory authorities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc6/54d/c8f/bc654dc8fa0a75f7629792212ae07e72.jpg"><br>  Fully operation mechanism will be described in the following article. <br>  The solution that is currently being implemented has already shown the first results and several more cities are next in line, which have already expressed their desire to start working with us. <br>  In general - the ice is broken) <br><br>  Stay tuned! <br>  <a href="http://www.gps-tracker.com.ua/">www.gps-tracker.com.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139784/</a></p>
