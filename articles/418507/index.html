      The wireless miniature vacuum cleaner was created after the development of Black &amp; Decker‚Äôs autonomous, portable drill for the Apollo missions that took place in the period 1963-1972.  The machine used a special computer program to reduce energy consumption when extracting lunar <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD_(%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0)">cores</a> (soil samples taken out by a single column).  This program subsequently helped the company develop many battery-powered devices, this handheld vacuum cleaner is one of them. <br><br>  <b>2. Air Cushion Sneakers</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jk/o_/cu/jko_cu_9x96fwtdfvjwv7exbuhg.jpeg"></div><br><br>  In the early 1980s, a process called ‚Äúblow molding of rubber‚Äù was used in the manufacture of helmets for spacesuits.  Former NASA engineer Frank Rudy proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing this technology in the manufacture of sneakers to Nike.  He presented sneakers with hollow soles filled with cushioning material to soften the blows when running.  Rudy's idea was a network of interconnected air cells, later called Nike Air. <br><br>  <b>3. Breathing apparatus for firefighters</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/s5/oe/jcs5oe8yqvflo1v4o6ieeh9wxf8.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Until 1971, the average weight of breathing apparatus exceeded 10 kilograms.  Carrying excess weight was so exhausting that some firefighters preferred to fight fire without them.  An NASA engineer adapted the life support emergency system for spacesuits for this purpose.  After 4 years, a breathing apparatus appeared, weighing less by a third and having better visibility. <br><br>  <b>4. Blankets for marathoners</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ke/yq/u3/keyqu3i4kw6nvibibim2pwwzgsc.jpeg"></div><br><br>  In 1964, NASA developed a material capable of reflecting infrared radiation with high efficiency: it was a thin plastic layer coated with metallic reflective material of golden or silver color.  In the form of a blanket, it reflects about 80% of the body wrapped by it back.  This is used to maintain the body temperature of the runners after the finish and the victims of accidents (such blankets are used both to protect against hypothermia and in cases of fire - approx. Lane) <br><br>  <b>5. Runway safety</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/eg/zj/jpegzjthabpy1eayrrcdrxdbquc.jpeg"></div><br><br>  NASA research has shown that cutting thin strips on runways reduces the likelihood of hydroplaning the aircraft during landing: excess water flows down the grooves, thus increasing friction under wet conditions.  This experience was taken over by airports around the world. <br><br>  <b>6. Capsules with sensors</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/--/bp/ex/--bpexyxpotw0z43j6iee6vjqig.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Astronauts swallowed pills with temperature and blood pressure sensors, as well as a data transmitter to monitor their health during training.  Such tablets can be used in medicine to monitor body temperature, pressure and other vital indicators of the body. <br><br>  <b>7. Faster racing cars</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/kd/-o/gqkd-owr6xwiiurgrsillajpyr4.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Carbon fiber was invented by the Royal Aircraft Institution in Fanboro (England) in the 1960s, but received an impetus to the development of its use in spacecraft.  So carbon fiber-reinforced graphite was used in the Space Shuttle nose fairing.  This durable, lightweight and heat-resistant material later began to be used in everything from tennis rackets to Formula 1 racing cars. <br><br>  <b>8. Roof of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB_%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">‚ÄúMillennium Dome‚Äù</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ht/qk/it/htqkityyqedygcqiyyy4tm06t8k.jpeg"></div><br><br>  A flexible but durable fiberglass material with a teflon coating was developed in the 1970s for space suits.  It is now used to build many roofs around the world, including this building in London. <br><br>  <b>9. Solar panels</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/yj/vc/dmyjvc9kynskjmdbqpkw-dlrwtw.jpeg"></div><br><br>  This may seem strange, but the movement of the ‚Äúgreens‚Äù should be grateful to the rockets going into space: efficient solar panels consisting of crystalline silicon, which effectively convert light into electricity, were developed in NASA laboratories in the early 1980s.  The same technology is now used by companies producing solar panels. <br><br>  <b>10. Personal Hurricane Warning System</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/im/p8/lwimp8jbjupzr9mlmrj3paiwx4o.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Personal lightning detectors are now popular with boaters, golfers and private jets, but this was originally a by-product of the Space Shuttle program.  After directing to the cloud, the device detects lightning by analyzing subtle changes in light.  Now this invention is popular all over the world. <br><br>  <b>11. The most impressive phrase of all time.</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iw/xu/sr/iwxusrl8vwbmzs0maxdeg1rukrc.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Neil Armstrong's first step to the surface of the moon is the most important event of the 20th century.  His phrase "This is a small step for a man, but a giant leap for all of humanity" remains one of the most famous quotes ever uttered. <br><br>  <b>12. The best sunglasses</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f9/fr/pr/f9frprywog2keacd2libjlpmmua.jpeg"></div><br><br>  NASA invented a carbonate coating with a diamond-like structure to protect astronauts' helmets from scratching with micrometeorites.  This substance reduces surface friction, and therefore increases its scratch resistance: in this regard, it has been used by many manufacturers of sunglasses, including Ray-Ban, since 1988. <br><br>  <b>13.

This technology has been adapted to create faster and more powerful equipment for extracting people in car accidents.  The incisors use the same pyrotechnic devices as those used on the Space Shuttles. <br><br>  <b>16. Longer golf shots</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/iz/9u/sgiz9uliuw7fgin7g8ng6eky30q.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Wilson - one of the largest manufacturers of golf balls - has improved their quality by applying the technology of an external tank of the Shuttle in them.  The surface of the balls has a number of designed recesses, reducing their aerodynamic drag and allowing them to fly farther than regular balls. <br><br>  <b>17. The best wing tips</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1c/vc/_s/1cvc_syhdvatbcabdgvepmm6z7k.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Have you ever seen the vertical endings of the wings of airplanes and wondered what it is?  They are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingtip_device">winglets</a> and were originally developed at the Langley Research Center as part of the aerodynamics division of NASA.  Such wing tips reduce inductive resistance and allow the aircraft to save fuel.  Winglets have been used since the 1970s and are now present on all types of aircraft. <br><br>  <b>18. Sublimated food</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f8/b8/0a/f8b80aljiry7nwouootsuwwhrza.jpeg"></div><br><br>  NASA has developed a freeze-drying technology for processing food for the Apollo missions.  After this treatment, products retain 98% of their nutritional value and only 20% of the original weight.  Snacks using this technology in cooking are exported by NASA to many countries in the order of thousands of tons. <br><br>  <b>19. Baby food</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vn/s0/4y/vns04yu62qiqlrssiixv2kgbray.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Thanks to the algae studied by NASA (which were supposed to be used for oxygen production), it was found that some algae contain two essential fatty acids for the body (contained in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0-3-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">omega-3</a> - approx.
