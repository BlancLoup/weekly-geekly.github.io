  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do we know about executors of IT projects?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost all companies have ever been customers of various IT services, be it site creation, search promotion, advertising, integration of 1C type products, etc.  There are many performers and the quality of services provided is different. <br>  I would not want to raise an eternal topic about how to perform a task with minimal budgets, but I would like to add a bit of ‚Äúfun‚Äù to our blog. <br>  Our main developer La Suan Thang is able not only to design the architecture of software products, but also perfectly draws.  He depicted on paper several examples of performing tasks by different types of performers and it turned out rather ridiculous. <br><br>  So let's get started. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Private trader</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f1/7a0/231/9f17a02313181b6fb8075c1d5435ba9f.jpg" alt="programmer private owner creating b2b system"><br>  The figure shows an individual, called ‚Äúprivate trader‚Äù, which is characterized by a special tenacity, slow movement speed.  But even with these shortcomings, this category has certain features: the desire to change the occupied territory and the ability to disguise among each other of the fauna participants. <br>  Usually they clutch at each prey, as the last.  Often, private traders do not count their strength and can not fulfill their obligations on time.  Therefore, they come to the finish line with a delay.  In order to increase the likelihood of an order being completed on time, it is necessary to reduce the contents of the cart.  The victim of a private trader can only become confronted with him head-on.  Private traders are lazy and do not pay enough time to search for production.

Freelancers - a more organized type of artist.  As a rule, he uses specialized electronic spaces to lure victims (they are commonly called ‚Äúfreelance exchange‚Äù).  In these spaces, there is a certain type of hierarchy, thanks to which large prey goes to reputable individuals. <br>  Please note that in comparison with the ‚Äúprivate trader‚Äù the speed of the ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù can be controlled.  The speed can be adjusted by exposing it with a ‚Äúwhip‚Äù.  But, there is a speed limit for weak individuals.  An interesting feature in the confrontation between the ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù and the victim is the fact that the victim herself finds the ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù using signs, which are usually called ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Web Studio</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/b65/a1c/49ab65a1c298fcdd6987f21e004e88bc.png" alt="web studio creating b2b system"><br>  This type of fauna participants is more perfect than the previous two.  This is achieved by combining the above individuals into prides.  Web studio gets more chances to capture production due to the fact that the victim produced a massive psychological impact.  In the pride, the roles are distributed in a special way, which allows for more productive hunting.  The advantage of pride is that it can capture other prides.  Prides have the resources to hunt large herds.  It is characteristic that each pride has its own unique name, and this is often the primary lure for the victim. <br>  In the life of prides, rivalry is vividly expressed for the possibility of obtaining large-scale prey.  Several prides can hunt for a victim, because of this the victim is greatly affected.  As a result, the victim does not withstand the pressure and surrenders to one of the prides. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Integrator</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/982/1d7/66b/9821d766b07784da3b5168f48789434c.jpg" alt="integrator creating b2b system"><br>  This individual is a large size, which is looking for victims of its own kind.  She, like a boa constrictor, swallows prey for a long time and slowly pulls out all the nutrients from it over a long period of time.  Small members of the fauna do not worry about their safety.  Only integrators should be afraid of integrator.  The fight for the victim is a serious and long.  The integrator develops a whole strategy to capture the intended victim.  In the fight can be used several corona guns. <br><ul><li>  The first tool is psychological.  The integrator gains confidence in the victim, thereby lunting her vigilance. </li><li>  The second tool - a resource or material.  Some victims are herbivores and love to eat some green leaves.  Leaves usually grow on trees that grow in areas subject to integrators.  Therefore, they have to take the risk to get a treat. </li><li>  The third tool - power.  Large-scale seizure of densely populated areas is underway.  Before the start of such operations, the integrator conducts training.  He is stocked up with strength, resources, physical conditioning of his condition, and exploring the landscape. </li></ul><br></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143166/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143166/</a></p>
