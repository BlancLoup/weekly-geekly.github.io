  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the meantime, in the perpendicular universe, the Trade Guild strikes back</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  &lt;farce&gt; detected <br><br>  Russia's largest retailer Supermarket and numerous fmcg manufacturers, together with the popular social network <a href="http://xn--80ahcnfghmyjja.xn--p1ai/">Sredklassklass.rf</a> , announced the creation of a large it-product.  This is a service " <a href="http://xn--80ahcnfghmyjja.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Carts</a> ", based on the above-mentioned Internet resource. <br><br>  The system is an advanced Internet site for modern consumers.  Now you will receive information about the purchased product, components of its <i>open</i> price, and much more, before you release the cart in the store.  You will also receive bonuses not only for your purchases, but also for purchases of your neighbors in your home, yard or neighborhood. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "Trolleys" are synchronized with the warehouse of the store nearest to you in real time 24 hours a day.  The service allows you to make a list of upcoming purchases in two or three clicks, recalling your past preferences from your memory.  You will be informed about the absence of the desired product in the store before leaving the house, and you can leisurely pick up an analogue.

      The service provides you with complete consumption statistics for the required period of time.  The price of each position you buy is absolutely transparent and consists of several points: <ul><li>  production cost, % </li><li>  logistics,% </li><li>  federal taxes (with breakdown by values),% </li><li>  local taxes (with breakdown by values),% </li><li>  net profit of the retailer,% </li><li>  net profit of the manufacturer,% </li><li>  special loyalty program,% (if any) </li></ul>  Any of the above items of expenses you can observe in relation to a particular time period.  Seeing how much money you left at the tax money store last month will be as easy as finding out the net profit of a certain manufacturer earned on your purchases last quarter. <br><br>  Also at your disposal will be a huge base of recipes with multifunctional search and the ability to discuss with other users.  Just bring the products home, turn on the computer and see what you can cook from what you bought 15 minutes ago.  The system will also tell you the storage conditions for each product;  with proper skill, you can look into your fridge without opening its door.  In addition, the service is provided with a convenient reminder of exhaustive shelf life for certain products. <br><br>  But the most delicious is, perhaps, a multi-stage system of discounts and bonuses.  Everything is also transparent and simple.  You will receive discounts for purchases of your family, as well as for purchases of your neighbors.  Now, looking at the neighbor carrying branded packages from the ‚ÄúSupermarket‚Äù, which is opposite to your house, you will mentally thank him for additional bonus points.  And maybe send him in gratitude grandma's cake recipe.  After all, the discount on your personal card will consist of three components: <br><ul><li>  % of the amount of purchases of your family in the previous month </li><li>  % of the amount of purchases of residents of your home in the previous month </li><li>  % of the amount of purchases of residents of your area for the last quarter </li></ul>  It should be clarified that the amount of accumulated points depends on the goods in the consumer basket and is charged differentially. <br><br>  <a href="http://xn--80ahcnfghmyjja.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Trolleys</a> is an IT product created by the joint efforts of a large retail network Supermarket and numerous fmcg manufacturers, based on the most popular social network of the Russian Internet today.

Every second of them is a buyer of this well-known retail network.  In the very first month of the work of ‚ÄúTrolleys‚Äù, 15 million customers began to actively use the service.  And this figure is constantly growing ... <br><br>  Believe it or not ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81423/</a></p>
