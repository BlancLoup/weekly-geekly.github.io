  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If the grocery store seller was a freelancer, or what a service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers of Megamind!  In between my articles about creating a company, I had the idea to write a small satirical story, what would a typical freelancer look like in the place of an ordinary grocery store seller, and what conversation would take place between him and the buyer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Situation: a passerby on the street suddenly suddenly sucked in the stomach and he decided to have something to eat. <br>  The man looks around and at this moment the thought appears in his head: <br>  "So where can I eat now?"  Then in a short period of time a list of options is created: <br><br>  <b>1. I can go to friends / relatives.</b>  But now it is 2 pm and many of them are at work and they don‚Äôt care for me.  Yes, and without warning, my visit right now may confuse them.  The option is not worth it. <br>  <b>2. See what I already have / what I can do myself.</b>  There are several seeds in pockets, and at home cooking will take at least 2 hours, and you still need to get to the house.  Not an option. <br>  <b>3. Maybe buy fast food?</b>  But the last time I felt bad after him, so I do not trust them. <br>  <b>4. Grocery store.</b>  Yes!  This is what you need.  There is a seller who will tell you what is fresh and what should not be taken.  For sure.  I'll go to the store. <br><br>  After these thoughts, the <s>customer</s> visitor enters the nearest grocery store, and a dialogue with the seller begins with a <s>freelancer</s> . <br>  * Door opens.  A silent salesman is looking at the visitor in anticipation of questions. <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : I want to buy food, how much will it cost? <br>  <b>Seller</b> : I will tell you the price after you answer me questions.  What exactly do you want to buy?  How many grams?  How should it be packaged? <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : well, I do not know ... I wanted to buy food and I decided to come to you. <br>  <b>Seller</b> : So it will not work.  To write you a check, I must know exactly how many grams and exactly what you want to take.  Here, for example, my previous clients bought from me: 2 kg of bananas, 10 kg of onions, 3 liters of milk.  And also <i>(in a low voice) there</i> were even those who took 15 kg of dog food!  This is the price of such and such.  What to sell you? <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : You know, I came to you to buy food to eat, as I want to eat. <br>  <b>Seller</b> : So what did you not say before?  Well, in that case, I ask you what you usually eat in the afternoon at 14.00? <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : I usually eat a business lunch, but today my plans have changed a bit and I came to you.  Advise something! <br>  <b>Seller</b> : You know, we have no business lunches.  But there is a set of "Sushi for the house", cost so much rubles.  Will you take? <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : You misunderstood me.  I want to eat right now, and I need something ready.  And fresh.  What do you have of it? <br>  <b>Seller</b> : Of fresh we have grilled chicken.  Already ready. <br>  <b>The visitor</b> .  Here is the money, make me a grilled chicken. <br>  <b>Seller</b> : Yes, please, here is your purchase. <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : (looking in the package with chicken) But she is unrefined! <br>  <b>Seller</b> : We also have knives for sale ... Will you buy? <br>  <b>Visitor</b> : Thank you very much.  I eat at home.  Good luck. <br>  <b>Seller</b> : (to himself) Oh dear ... How many more buyers will there be who do not know what they need?

      Findings. <br><br>  What phrases and actions we see especially often when communicating with the performer? <br><br>  First, each performer is waiting for the customer, who just had an idea to buy something, has the exact parameters that he needs.  Of course, there are such clients, but there are very few of them, and it is very dangerous for a business (especially a beginner) to do its entire business process, focusing on such clients.  First of all, you need to see your customers, and know if they understand what they want to buy.  If not, then it is time to ask many clarifying questions to clarify the need.  But you object: the client will not have time for conversation.  Yes exactly.  But all clarifying questions should be asked after the first: ‚ÄúWhat is important to you?‚Äù.  At this point, the customer will say what he expects from the purchase.  And the performer will offer the option that the client will be able to use and satisfy their needs. <br><br>  Secondly, the contractor is trying to fulfill exactly the instructions given by the customer in order to say in case of problems: ‚ÄúYou yourself have chosen this‚Äù.  But a good seller should always worry about whether the purchase was useful for the customer.  Compliance with this rule is vital for start-ups, and is a prerequisite for competition.  Besides, experiencing is not worth the money. <br><br>  How was it with you?  (I am waiting for answers from both freelancers and customers) <br>  Ps story is fictional. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290398/</a></p>
