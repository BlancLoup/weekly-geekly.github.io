  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera 11 - you wanted it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/Aleksander/work/opera11release_640.png" alt="image"></div><br>  As many have already guessed, the reason for today's article was the release of the next final version of Opera browser under number 11. Almost all major innovations that distinguish this version from the previous release 10.63, were already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/opera/blog/108635/">announced earlier</a> after the beta, so I will not take away your time for their detailed analysis - for the past time, they have undergone only cosmetic changes.  However, not to mention them will not work at all, but I will do it in a slightly different context. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In all public appearances and in interviews, we constantly say that Opera browser develops to a greater extent by following user requests.  "Not a fact" - some will argue.  Yes, this is not a fact.  This is more than a fact.  So it really is.  And the example of Opera 11 is very indicative in this case.  Let's go into details.  And we will start right from the installation process. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-11-1.png" alt="image" align="right">  There is a fairly large group of users who are dissatisfied with the lack of some settings in Opera installer, as well as an equally active group of those who asked to make a portable version of the browser that you could carry with you on a flash drive and use on computers that came to hand.  Well, here's a gift for the New Year - now during installation, you can choose whether to install Opera for all computer users, just for yourself or on some mobile media. <br><br>  Another popular request that can often be found on the forums is ‚ÄúI really want the Lite version of the browser so that nothing is superfluous.‚Äù  This is a difficult question, of course.  Especially if you look at the newly installed Opera browser: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-11-3.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Theoretically, it is possible to put some of the controls on the plastic frame of the display, but whether computer manufacturers will go for it is a big question.  However, for those to whom even the existing look seems ponderous, we have provided a full-screen mode, while all the functions necessary to control the browsing of the pages are accessible using mouse gestures and keyboard controls.  Not a bad decision, by the way.  However, even though the ideal is unattainable, we are striving for it: Opera‚Äôs installation package has lost several megabytes - now Unite applications will be downloaded only when they are activated. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-11-4.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  Speaking of mouse gestures.  Admit it honestly - who sent the request to add a loop to the cursor, showing the mouse movement performed, who asked to make the description of all available gestures more visual, who did not have enough video tutorials on learning this function?  But - okay, what can we do now.  Here - get and sign.  Visually, intelligibly, creatively.  Yes, and even with artificial intelligence: perform the movement slowly - a detailed prompt appears, started to perform a little faster - only a notification about the action performed will be displayed, and if you have already reached the level of the pro - Opera will not show you anything.  But on the nerves will not act. <br><br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-11-2.png" alt="image" align="right">  Extensions.  Oh, that's a scary word.  On all holivaras, it served as a control shot in the head, was a nail in the coffin lid, a silver bullet in the heart of a vampire, and so on through the list.  Well, if extensions exist - it means someone needs it.  Now they are in Opera.  The number of them in our catalog is constantly growing, so that interested in the expansion of users will be able to pick up something for their needs.  In fact, a big plus is not even the fact that extensions in Opera have appeared, but the fact that now those who wish can not wait for the developers to implement their request for a new function ‚Äî many things can be implemented independently as an extension. <br><br>  Probably one of the most popular queries was about tab grouping.  It is therefore not surprising that we are actively engaged in this.  Of course, not everyone had time to make the release of Opera 11, but this is like a repair: it cannot be finished, you can only stop it.  However, we do not plan to stop the development of the grouping function, quite the contrary - there are plenty of plans, lots of options, it remains only to choose the most optimal one.  And indeed, the development of tab functionality is our favorite activity from the very first versions of Opera - the map below clearly shows this. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/opera-11-5.png" alt="image"></div><br>  All of the above is just the tip of the iceberg in fact.  There is also a mass of imperceptible at first glance improvements made at the request of the same restless users.  As a rule, they want to have new features yesterday and make it cooler than X ... than F ... well, in general, than others.  Take, say, mail (conveniently, by the way - anyway, no one else has a built-in client).  They asked for folders for news feeds - they did it, they wanted the opportunity to arrange elements on the mail panel on their own - added, built-in settings for popular local mail services - yes, no problem.  By the way, there are surprises.  For example, open the mail panel, open the list of received letters.  Now go to another tab with some open page and close the sidebar (F4, if someone does not know).  Now go back to the mail tab.  Well, what?  It would seem - a trifle, but very convenient.  And so we fight for every extra click. <br><br>  On this, perhaps, finish.  In the sense - this article, and not the addition of new features at the request of users.  Here the policy will remain unchanged: you say - we do.  Or do not say - and we still do.  Surprises are also sometimes needed for a change.  In addition to user requirements, there are also market requirements - and it is very difficult to negotiate a delay with them. <br><br>  Video bonus for those who read to the end: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7jC1j9Is6o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLJ1-_PBo2QtqdUT61JmnYxdpopg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/features/">A more detailed description of the functions of Opera 11</a> <br><br>  As always, you <s>can</s> download the browser from the <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">official site</a> . <br>  Remember that all our browsers are free, to install or update you do not need to send SMS, register or wait 60 seconds, looking at advertisements.
