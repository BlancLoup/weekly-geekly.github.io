  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Losing a mobile phone (how-to)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a short period of time it took me 4 phones.  All in different ways, but one thing in common is not a pity for the tube (well, almost :), but a pity for the SIM card, and all that was on the memory card.  Without thinking twice before buying a new tube, I decided to run an experiment, and how did we do in 2000 without a mobile phone?  And I did not buy it, I did it without it for one week, and then I bought it after all.  (this later happened because the boss promised to buy me a phone to your liking, and he tasted hoo, and deduct the cost from my salary) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <b>Day one or, ‚Äúdamn, here I am <s>Masha-</s> terryasha.‚Äù</b>  Discovered missing.  I called the <i>MTS</i> and asked to block the SIM card and the account details for which I had to go to the office.  He told the boss not to look for me on the phone because he sowed.  At work, they once again scolded for irresponsibility (of which everything looks like, Soviet-style hardening, the leaders explain our sins or what seems to them so :).  In the evening, upon arrival home, I changed the passwords on all the sites on which I registered (some of them were recorded in the organizer, which I don‚Äôt remember).  Password asi and all mail accounts also changed. </li><li>  <b>Day two or "happy hours do not notice."</b>  It began with a stupid late arrival at work (except for the alarm on my phone, I naturally didn‚Äôt have any).  The boss didn‚Äôt particularly swear, but blamed that I hadn‚Äôt bought the phone yesterday.  Before lunch, I missed two meetings with contractors and customers.  Got a scolding from the chef.  During lunch, I ran for the alarm clock (I bought a Japanese desktop <i>Rhythm</i> ).  Throughout the day, involuntarily clutching at the belt in the hope of looking at the time or calling.  In the evening I began to think about how to quit this bad job. </li><li>  <b>Day three or "happiness ended and an alarm clock appeared."</b>  The first morning question from the chef, ‚ÄúI bought a phone?!?!?‚Äù When I entered my room I looked around and was surprised - wow, I have a business telephone number.  The joy passed very quickly from the memory of the fact that part of the numbers resignedly ingrained in some bin with the SIM card, and the rest in the phone‚Äôs memory in the pocket of some huckster.  With a screech and squeals I begged part of the necessary numbers from the chief.  I made a couple of calls from the city (as hell, it's still inconvenient).  At lunch I ran to the stationery for the diary.  I continue to actively grab the belt.  In the evening, an unpleasant surprise in the form of a fury was waiting for the house, loudly shouting something about what a bastard I am, and why I don‚Äôt answer calls and messages. </li><li>  <b>Day four or "and that, like nothing terrible, I can after all when I want."</b>  The chef doesn't talk to me.  All orders get through colleagues.  Right in the morning begins to tear the city.  For one and a half hours I can‚Äôt leave him (even because of need :).  The time is just barely approaching dinner, and I am already exhausted to the point of impossibility.  Begin to think about the meaning of the anecdote about the elusive Joe.  Positive shift - hands to the belt do not stretch.  After lunch, I took up the delights of all phone numbers and transfer them to the diary.  In the evening, on the way home, one thought turns in my head - tomorrow is <b>Friday</b> . </li><li>  <b>Day five or "well, finally this crazy week is over."</b>  A serious conversation with the boss who recommended me to buy any mobile phone and restore the previous number of the SIM card, otherwise he will do it for me, and he will buy one that will be embarrassing for me in a decent society, or I will pay for 2 months.  Before dinner, without straining in the process of work, he flipped through the phone prices and read the characteristics of the handsets.  Restored the SIM card.  Dine went to town.  For two years - probably the first dinner during which nobody bothered me.  Yes, it was definitely worth it!  In the evening, on the way home, I thought with great satisfaction that, if desired, you can still stop those horse races, which we call life. </li><li>  <b>Day six or "well, everything is enough."</b>  Saturday.  I woke up late.  Slowly I went to <i>Euroset</i> , then to <i>Svyaznoy</i> and settled on <i>Eldorado</i> .  Bought a phone.  He came home and, without opening the box, put the phone on the farthest shelf, for it‚Äôs not figs that we can handle the weekend. </li><li>  <b>The seventh day or "reading heaps of late messages."</b>  Slowly drove all the recorded numbers from the diary into the phone's memory.  Installed Asya, gmail and Google Maps. </li></ul><br>  From all this I learned a lesson, which, in principle, is not difficult to reach. <br><br><ol><li>  Do not record passwords in the phone's memory, although it is very convenient.  Passwords must be remembered (it is difficult, if there are more than 3-5 of them, and even 8-15 digits). </li><li>  You need to have a backup copy of the phone book or in the old-fashioned diary (not forgetting timely synchronization and updating). </li><li>  Have at home any chronometer, except for the phone and PC. </li><li>  To sometimes feel like a person, you just have to turn off your mobile phone sometimes. </li></ol><br>  <b>PS</b> It‚Äôs still difficult without technology in our time and it‚Äôs not quite clear how we used to do without them, but for all that we don‚Äôt have to forget that these are just things and tools, and certainly don‚Äôt become attached to them anymore than they are worth it. </div>
