The fact is that for many objects in the Kuiper belt, the actual orbit differs from the calculated one.  Some such objects have a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">perihelion argument</a> that is almost zero.  Modeling shows that such a deviation can be caused by the presence of a large planet with an unusual orbit, which has a significant impact on the movement and position of many objects in the solar system.

      Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, who discovered a strange behavior of objects in the Kuiper belt, called the mysterious planet "Planet 9".  According to experts, the mass of this object reaches 10 Earth masses.  This planet makes one revolution around the Sun for 20,000 years.  A team of scientists believes that this object has an elongated orbit, and the planet on one side comes closer to the Sun than on the other. <br><br>  As mentioned above, direct evidence of the existence of this planet yet.  But there are more and more indirect ones.  Another indirect proof of the existence of Planet 9 is the angle of inclination of the axis of rotation of the Sun to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">the ecliptic plane</a> . <br><br>  Our star and the planets of the solar system were formed in a single process.  According to the generally accepted theory, the initial gas-dust cloud began to rotate, which led to the compaction of the cloud in the center, where the Sun was formed.  Planets formed from the remaining material.  In theory, a rotating gas-dust disk was supposed to promote the rotation of the sun, and all the planets should be formed in one plane of the disk.  As a result, the axis of rotation of the Sun would have to be perpendicular to the plane of the orbits of the planets. <br><br>  But actually it is not.  The axis of rotation of the Sun is not perpendicular to the plane of the orbits of the planets, a deviation of six degrees is observed.  Scientists are trying to find the answer to the question - why is it so the past 50 years.  There were many explanations, but none of them reveal all the features of the behavior of objects in the solar system.  Among other hypotheses is the asymmetry of the gas-dust disk from which the Solar System was formed, the magnetic interaction of the Sun and the disk, the passage of another star near the Solar System. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f22/e98/34a/f22e9834a0eb414794b07f2328d4ef75.png"><br><br>  Astronomers have already realized that the situation observed in our system is not at all unique.  Thanks to the observation of exoplanets, it was found out that the situation in the solar system is not unique.  Rather, it is quite common. <br><br>  But what is the reason?  According to the authors of the new work, it is possible to explain the discrepancies between the theoretical and actual orbits of the Sun and other objects of the Solar System by the influence of the ninth planet, and possibly other planets, if there are any.  The elongated orbit of Planet 9, as it were, swings the entire system.  The model with the inclusion of this planet, built by scientists, shows the observed inclination of the Sun's axis of rotation in reality. <br><br>  The calculations carried out by specialists show the possible existence of two orbital planes for Planet 9. The first possible plane is moderately inclined to the ecliptic plane, passing near the mid-plane of four Kuiper belt objects that behave differently than they should in the absence of third-party factors.  The second possible plane is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of 48 degrees. <br><br>  However, the behavior of some objects in the Kuiper belt is still different from the calculated one in this case, so the model is not ideal.  Its authors believe that the ninth planet may be the main, but not the only factor that affects the inclination of the axis of rotation of the Sun and other objects of the Solar System.  Unfortunately, this hypothesis does not help astronomers understand where to look for the ninth planet. <br><br>  It may well be that Planet 9 has already been fixed on images of some telescopes, and these photos are available for study.  But due to dimness and slow movement, this planet was not noticed by scientists, and it only remains to be discovered.  Earlier, physicists Christophe Mordasini and his graduate student Esther Linder from the University of Bern in Switzerland tried to suggest what Planet 9 might look like. They made a rough estimate of the radius, temperature and brightness of this object.  Scientists believe that Planet 9 was formed within the framework of the solar system itself.  According to the authors of the work, this planet is a somewhat reduced copy of Uranus and Neptune, and its atmosphere consists of hydrogen and helium.  The temperature of the planet is -226 degrees Celsius. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ad/a9a/8fa/0ada9a8fa12233d34ec5f1141c1b0f1e.jpg"><br>  <em><font color="gray">The figure shows the location of the external objects of the solar system known to science (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_(minor_planet)">Wikipedia</a> )</font></em> <br><br>  In 2014, Spanish astronomers from the University of Madrid suggested that there could be two large planets outside of the orbit of Pluto.
