The functionality of a wallet with a talking title <b>Moneto</b> standard: payment for purchases, transfer of funds, checking account balance, etc. <br>  At the moment, <b>iCaisse</b> , an iPhone case with an integrated NFC chip, is required for making payments, but it‚Äôs clear that Moneto targets the iPhone 5S.  By the way, the developers promise to launch a service in Europe in the future and add support for the Android platform.

By this time, it is planned to significantly expand the number of supported issuing banks and trade and service enterprises. <br>  The payment system <b>Isis Mobile Wallet</b> , in the opinion of the three operators, is already ready to be introduced all over the world, however, so far it is planned to launch only in the US.  Perhaps this is the right decision - initially to debug the system in the home market, where Isis provided all the necessary support from the project participants. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faf/9ed/fef/faf9edfef6e932cd520ffe5545e279de.png"><h4>  Google Wallet for Gmail starts an advanced implementation of payment services </h4><br>  <b>Google</b> in May 2013 introduced the function of sending and receiving mobile payments through Gmail mailboxes.  Now the function is available for a much larger number of users, they have already received corresponding invitations to their mailboxes. <br>  The Google Wallet for Gmail extension allowed, like regular files, to attach money to an email.  For example, you can pay for the services of a freelancer in this way, and he will receive money at the same time with a positive assessment of his work. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c8/48e/33e/3c848e33e1b76cd8e935990d6e2afc2f.png"><h4>  In the Home button on the next iPhone will be a fingerprint scanner </h4><br>  In the last digest, we told that the iPhone 5S will receive an NFC chip and a fingerprint scanner.  And now, in the iOS 7 Beta 3 update, the interface of the biometric scanner was discovered, which, apparently, will be built into the Home button.  In this case, it will be possible to control not only making payments, as previously assumed, but access to the device as a whole.  <b>Apple</b> fans will appreciate this opportunity - many of them use an additional pin-code lock to protect personal photos and important information. <br>  It is not yet clear whether it is possible to add several fingerprints to the system (in case the smartphone has to be taken with another, unusual hand or for the implementation of the parental control function when the child is allowed to access the device), but new iPhones can provide a qualitatively new level of protection mobile payments. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55a/0d3/f51/55a0d3f510eb407c911ad3078838af79.png"><h4>  High-tech shopping with Yahoo! </h4><br>  Recently, the company <b>Yahoo!</b>  acquired a startup <b>Lexity</b> , founded in 2009 and has already attracted $ 5.7 million in investments.  Lexity develops Internet business applications aimed at increasing sales, from advertising to customer support. <br>  Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, as well as no information about the changes that affect Lexity.  The startup team continues its work and is awaiting rebranding in the coming months.  Perhaps then it will be clear why Yahoo!  turned its attention to the field of e-commerce. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b96/b43/012/b96b43012bcc9b72826a5462bb245f71.png"><h4>  Apple certified mPOS terminals PAX Technology </h4><br>  <b>Apple</b> issued the MFi certificate to the Chinese manufacturer <b>PAX Technology</b> , according to which the models of the D200 and D210 terminals manufactured by PAX can work with any Apple technology that supports payment applications.  For a Chinese company, this is a huge step forward - now certified products of the company will have the inscription ‚ÄúMade for Apple‚Äù and be used throughout the world. <br>  Small businesses also have interesting opportunities.  Now there is no need to enter into an agreement with banks and install POS terminals, it is enough to have an iPad and an mPOS terminal from PAX Technology to accept payments to your e-wallets. <br><br>  What is interesting, in your opinion, has happened in the world that you should pay attention to? <br>  Join the discussion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189392/</a></p>
