  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The consequences of a ban or again blackjack and hookers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The story is about what the closure of the working Internet from ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù sites and the deprivation of intelligent people of their small joys can lead to. <br>  And also about the fact that designers and designers are idlers, not isolated from the ground, who can only put a stick in the wheel (as many coders really believe) - but still important people :) <br><br>  Who is lazy to read - just a link to the <a href="http://useq.org.ru/">next bashorga clone</a> .  And who is interested to know how he appeared and "fuck, finally?" ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started quite banal - the chef suddenly decided to close access to entertainment sites for employees.  Well, we reacted to this with understanding - bukh, that impression, in general, moved from ‚Äúodinees: accounting‚Äù to some kind of ‚Äúone-class: accounting‚Äù: ‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù simply did not leave the screens of their computers.  But the fact that the bashorg (ru) falls into the list of "forbidden" sites - we did not expect such a trick.  In our department it was a long tradition - to look through the bashorg at lunchtime, to share the pearl found out loud, to drop something ourselves, and so on. And although everyone agreed that the tower was not a cake for a long time, the tradition held.  And so - please. <br>  No, it did not become a problem for us.  At first.  We are not boos.  Four experienced programmers didn‚Äôt accept this pathetic attempt to deprive them of their daily bash ‚Äî even for an insult.  We were above it.  Five minutes later, we quietly read quotes. <br>  So two or three days passed, then the chief (no crime - at lunch!) Found us doing this, and in an ultimatum form demanded to use the working Internet only for business purposes.  ‚ÄúOk‚Äù - we shrugged, taking modems from our pockets.  The chef puffed and became bloody for a couple of minutes, then a huge scandal broke out (to think it over, he used to seem like an adequate person to us).  The result of the scandal was the appearance of a surveillance camera on the wall of our office and the threat to immediately dismiss anyone who was seen watching the "forbidden" sites. <br>  Then I began to look for a new job. <br>  But the good work is not in one day, but something had to be done with the camera on the wall.  It was an overt challenge that we could not ignore.  After a week of hard work, our response was ready. <br>  We set ourselves the following task: regain the opportunity to read bash indiscriminately.  We worked in two directions - intercepting video from the camera and camouflaging the contents of the screen.  The first direction "did not go", but the second one worked.  Yuz, my colleague, picked up a small project on his home server, periodically drawing down quotes from the bash and putting them into his base.  The users who came to the server were given a document consisting of two frames - in a large (almost all window) frame some profile site was loaded, and a narrow (40px) left frame contained a column of points.  When you hover the mouse over the next point, a <abbr title="overlib js-library by Erik Bosrup http://www.bosrup.com/web/overlib/"><u>pop-up window appeared</u></abbr> , containing the next quote from the bashorg.  The low-key and low-contrast colors of the window did not give any chance to an outside observer to read its contents - even taking into account the quite good characteristics of the camera spying on us. <br>  That's how it looked <br><img src="http://useq.org.ru/pix/screen1.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  On the screen <img src="http://useq.org.ru/pix/screen2.jpg" alt="image">  On camera <br>  We enjoyed success for a couple of weeks, gradually expanding the functionality of our camouflaging proxy.  Now all the pages of the bash were available;  quotations, absolutely not palyas, it was possible not only to read, but also to ply, minus, and even <abbr title="But what about recaptcha? - you ask. And it must be entered. But you know that Google does not give a picture of its recaptcha if the request comes from a referrer different from the one registered for this recaptcha? We did not know. I had to drag down the image from the recaptcha, slipping the correct referrer, save it to disk, and then output it to the user. And bash does not add quotes more often than once every 5 minutes. And since all the additions came from one ip, Yuz's home server, they had to pick up an anonymous proxy service there."><u>add!</u></abbr>  Even when the chef was standing right behind him - true-true - this was a special thrill.  Oh, sweet moment of celebration!  Intoxicating taste of victory!  The chief obviously sensed something unkind and looked at us suspiciously, but could not find the reason. <br>  We, having a little fun, went further.  Comments appeared in ‚Äúour‚Äù bashorge (which, of course, were also recruited completely unnoticed by an outsider).  But there were few of us, and quickly got tired of commenting on quotes ... the idea was hovering in the air and, I don‚Äôt remember, who suggested once: <br>  - And let's make your bashorg!  There is only nothing left ... <br>  - With blackjack and whores? <br>  - Well, of course! <br>  - With comments! <br>  - With a profile and taking into account posting quotes! <br>  - With olbanian interface language! <br>  - Go to the stump!  Yes, even then I will not go on it! <br>  - Then with the ability to connect a custom language.  And the interface itself, at the same time. <br>  - And we will leave the ‚Äúanti-boss‚Äù mode ... as moderators, shall we? <br>  - Why do we need moderators?  Let people vote for quotes themselves.  And moderators - nafig.  We leave only the ‚Äúbest of the abyss,‚Äù especially since all quotes from the main one always get the best first.  Long live democracy!  Anyway - enough to whine that the bash is no longer a cake.  Let's make a cake!  Well, what does bash have to do with bash today?  In a sense - to bourne shell?  Yes, there is only the original logo and remained.  So let's face it: bash - long time bash.  What is now in the network is already some kind of anti-bash. <br>  So there were thoughts about the domain name (we used to enter by ip before).  But antibash turned out to be busy. (Not really, we didn‚Äôt know. And about ibash, qbash, and darkness-bang bash clones, imagine, too. After learning, they were discouraged and were about to give up at first. But then they decided to do it. Only , of course.) <br>  The first logotype was: <br><img src="http://useq.org.ru/pix/logo0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, we are all programmers, not designers.  Funny to say, but we were proud of him.  He seemed to us stern, classic and stylish.  And with deep meaning - useq - it's an inverted bash! <br>  Fortunately, the screenshot of the first version of the site has not been preserved - even we ourselves didn‚Äôt like its design, which already says a lot. <br>  Since each of us defended precisely the set of functions proposed by him, which should first be introduced to the bash, we decided that everyone would implement the proposed function himself.  The brainchild was chimerical, but (to everyone's surprise) it worked.  We were so inspired that we decided to show it to the world.  Have shown friends from other departments.  The result was a stream of criticism and a bunch of glitches.  Our enthusiasm fell to zero and the project almost died out again.  But the selfless Hughes once collected his strength and rewrote half of the code, so that he (although it looked cadaveric), but did not fall apart when the user rejected "one step to the side."  In addition, a blessing in disguise, a designer appeared in our team - Serega Burnakov, pouring over our mud on our wonderful design, drew his own, for which he was thankful (although he claims that he did not draw the design, but only removed the one that was And now the site simply does not have a design. Seryoga promises us one day to reveal a true miracle, and probably it will happen sometime :)) It was he who painted the current logo.  Now the site had a half dozen regular visitors and even had some interest in chatting on the forum and exchanging comments.  And the enthusiasm for further development - we made (on the same mechanism) a picture-quote pad and video quote pad - each user can add his own picture or video there and vote for those added by other users.  So the site has evolved to its current form and clearly outgrew its micro-audience.  The result of which was this post.

      It's funny, but none of us can explain why he is investing his strength in this project.  It is clear to everyone that there is nothing new in it, that it is all secondary, that it does not have commercial prospects and prerequisites for general fame.  The randomness of its design is visible to the naked eye - it looks like a house 50 times rebuilt and completed by various builders, moreover, without the participation of architects and designers.  But to abandon him is for the time being out of the question.  On the contrary, there are plenty of plans: <ul><li>  Creating pictures with captions, (demotivators, motivators, comic books, etc.) online and adding them to the site are all on the same principle of quotation. </li><li>  Adding anecdotes on the principle of quotation. </li><li>  Adding stories (text with the ability to insert pictures and videos) on the principle of quotation. </li><li>  News taking into account already read by cookie. </li><li>  Grouping of quotes, pictures and clips in the best for the past months and years </li><li>  Analysis of text quotes and distribution of tags on the results of the analysis. </li><li>  Community  Section meta links to other useq elements, grouped by community preferences. </li></ul>  And, surprisingly, they are even slowly being implemented. <br><br>  So for what purpose was this post written? <ul><li>  Get feedback.  Criticism, ideas for improvement (well, a little praise does not hurt :).  The current audience (judging by the attenuation of activity on the forum) interest to give feedback is almost at zero. </li><li>  Maybe get someone else in the team.  This, of course, is very unlikely - given the complete lack of any funding (and, alas, commercial prospects) - but what if? </li><li>  Well, just wondering - whether the site will survive, getting out of his sandbox in a big scary world.  :) </li><li>  And yet - we all no longer work there.  And I very much hope that this post will reach the chief - (hello, Vasily Andreevich) and he will understand that infringement of the ghostly freedoms of programmers can be very sideways - you know, no savings in working time did not happen here :) </li></ul><br>  With thanks to those who read this post to the end, once again <a href="http://useq.org.ru/">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146290/</a></p>
