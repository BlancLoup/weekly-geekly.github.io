In addition to including the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/wiki/Catch-all">catch-all</a> function, which sends all incoming mail of non-existing mailboxes of my domain to my main mailbox, I had to reserve all the ‚Äústandard‚Äù mailbox names so that there were no misunderstandings when an outsider had already scored some name, and all the "service" mail does not go to you.  In PDD  You can, of course, at any time, expropriate any mailbox of the domain under control, but after all, the sediment remains.  I was puzzled: <b>what are the names of mailboxes are standard and system?</b>  Yandex technical support responded that they reserve only the name postmaster @ for each domain in order to track complaints and problems with the mail, and that at the moment the question about the set of reserved names they have left open.  Further, the search result on the Internet was a bit predictable. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <sup>(in the picture: the famous black mailbox, a place of pilgrimage for amateur ufologists)</sup> <br><br><h4>  RFC </h4><br>  First and foremost, what I wanted to find was the RFC, which turned out to be <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt">RFC 2142, MAILBOX NAMES FOR COMMON SERVICES, ROLES AND FUNCTIONS</a> ( <i>mailbox names for common services, roles and functions</i> ), in the last 1997 edition.  I will cite only the information that interests us.  Based on the document, the following mailboxes must exist and have the following purpose: <br><br><h6>  Business mailboxes: </h6><br>  info @ - Marketing department, here you can find brief information about the organization, products, services. <br>  marketing @ - Department of marketing and sales interaction. <br>  sales @ - Sales, product ordering and ordering information <br>  support @ Customer support, problems with the product or services. <br>  abuse @ - Customer relationship, the box should always be working and valid, customer complaints are sent here, including messages about <i>‚ÄúInappropriate public public behavior‚Äù</i> .

Which is de jure based on the RFC and other documents for each individual service. <br>  The mailbox assignment paradigm for people in * nix sounds like this: each user receives a mailbox on a workstation with the same name as his login.  After creating a username in the system, you can already send and receive mail to your account.  <i>(there will be its ‚Äúbut‚Äù: if it permits root and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258C_MX">MX</a> is correctly <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258C_MX">spelled out</a> ).</i>  If you want to get a trendy alias - contact your administrator, he will register it in <i>/ etc / aliases</i> or else where in the mail system. <br>  The same goes for system services.  There are a lot of backup names like <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nobody/" class="user_link">nobody</a> , clamav @, www-data @, which correspond to the system accounts of services, are not used by anyone in real life, except for these corresponding services and are mail aliases of the system root user, so we will not take them into account, because we already learned all the meaningful names of the network service boxes from the previous paragraph.  Add only <br>  root @ <br><br><h4>  Modern Internet and other unofficial naming conventions for mailboxes. </h4><br>  Let's try with you to find the most frequent names that domain owners reserve for themselves and use as administrative, business and personal contacts. <br>  admin @ <br>  administrator @ (people who know a lot can add localized admin names in Windows, like <i>administrador, administrateur</i> ) <br>  user @ <br>  mail @ <br>  blog @ <br>  office @ <br>  job @ (and sometimes resume @ and hr @) - for sending and receiving applications for work and resumes. <br>  spam @ - sometimes it is set as an alias to abuse @ or postmaster @, for spam complaints, obviously. <br>  billing @ - for billing.  <i>K.O.</i> <br>  account @ - for accounting and account support. <br>  domain@domain.tld - the box name repeats the domain, obviously, for aesthetics. <br>  alex @, boss @ - feel free to score your first and last names and nicknames to eliminate the social engineering factor when, for example, your name is Alexey, and your wife, knowing perfectly well that you bought yourdomain.com, gets it from the box alex @ yourdomain .ru letter of dubious content - an hour will not believe an attacker. <br>  <i>You can add something to this sheet.</i> <br><br>  Besides this, I know almost nothing about mail name conventions on Windows systems, do they really exist? <br><br>  Thus, having reserved all these names as aliases for your main mailbox on the domain, you will protect yourself, including the number from mailbox squatting and malicious use of mailboxes with ‚Äúsystem‚Äù names.  Also, all the "official" correspondence on your domain, which can come to the system names will not be ignored.  If you are organizing mail for the office, then such agreements can also be useful to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126822/</a></p>
