Some are happy every day that you can sit in front of the TV with a beer in the evening and watch football.  Others - constantly suffer from the production mess, dirt and lies of human relationships and are forced to develop corn formations on the head, hands and behind to reduce the threshold of sensitivity. <br><br>  Are rare, smart, adequate managers who must suffer so and lie back before they reach retirement from a stroke caused by turbulent feelings in their youth or bite themselves for something that may never lead their dream company for reasons beyond their control? <br><br>  Is there really only a dirty fight with trolls, morons, brainworms, and an increase in rectal corns is the goal of our life?

      Of course not :-).  I'll tell you how to choose an effective strategy that preserves professional motivation and pumps us well. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I divide the companies in which we work, according to internal processes, into two large parts.  But first we classify employees in these companies. <br><br>  <b>People in companies</b> <br><br>  <i>Sheeps</i> <br><br>  Many need to be forced to work with a stick.  Coming to work, a person in the morning ... relaxes, hangs out, showing with all his appearance that he is a victim, that without a dose of stars, his work week will not bring anything of value to the company‚Äôs money box.  But if you push it - we get a good result.  And so every week. <br><br>  <i>Drovers</i> <br><br>  Often there are lovers drive sheep, and by the end of the day quietly slaughtered and fry one laggard.  And they are so motivated by this (I‚Äôm sure they feel a kind of psychological orgasm with this) that they can not increase their salaries for years, and people will be happy - life is good. <br><br>  Drivers are often stupid and straightforward.  But this is their feature, not a disadvantage. <br><br>  <i>Smart and ... good for now</i> <br><br>  Colleagues with the spinal cord feel the balance of efficiency, understand how to solve problems faster and easier, and to whom it is better to entrust them.  Yes, this is a talent from nature.  While colleagues are ‚Äúgood‚Äù - they can bring enormous benefits to the company. <br><br>  <i>Clever and ... already evil</i> <br><br>  Again, these are extremely adequate, smart, employees, but already acting in their vested interests - to popiarity at the expense of the company, to pump their own skills, to acquire useful connections. <br><br>  <i>Beaten by a stool in childhood</i> <br><br>  I did not want to write about this category :-), but because of their danger to the company, I‚Äôll tell you a little.  These employees are deeply hurt by life.  Victims of fate.  And they will, for their own pumping and increase internal confidence, to finish off the weak, while receiving great pleasure, and hate and envy the strong.  They can work for weeks and suddenly ... turn off from the process for half a year due to depression.  In general, bright, interesting nature :-) <br><br>  <b>Company type "Bipol adequacy"</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.segodnya.ua/img/forall/a/120595/73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In companies of this type there is a constant process of moving employees to the most appropriate levels, at which they give the company maximum - with money, knowledge, energy. <br><br>  The system constantly strives for balance, operates in maximum efficiency mode.  Each employee feels demanded, permanently pumped. <br><br>  It is important that sensing the meaning and the overall strategy, there are amazing constructive relationships between employees that can last a lifetime. <br><br>  In these companies, the leaders, taking care of the overall efficiency, coaching the development of subordinates, and developed, overcoming the feeling of envy and jealousy - they bless to move upward or upward-to-side. <br><br>  The main boss works on a par with everyone.  He is often ‚Äúsmart and evil‚Äù (the good one will not last long :-)) monitors the health of the system, cutting off the emerging trolling branches with shears and ensures that the employee is at that level of the bipole of adequacy where he shines most brightly as a professional and As a person. <br><br>  At the base of the staff pyramid, as a rule, are ‚Äúsheep‚Äù under the ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù, ‚Äúsmart good‚Äù direct the departments, and ‚Äúsmart evil‚Äù either tops or politely shoot back.  "Stomach-beaten in childhood" actively move between levels, mainly playing the role of porridge, which improves digestion. <br><br>  The company is presented as a triangle with constantly glowing personalities.  Everything is shining as a rule, when the recoil energy decreases, the asterisk moves with the management or the boss and starts to burn again. <br><br>  They plow everything, by the sweat of their brow. <br><br>  Conflicts, if there are, they are creative and without death :-) Dangerous conflicts between smart employees are carefully monitored by the boss and cut down by extinguishing excess energy in constructive and necessary directions. <br><br>  In this model, as a rule, talented and intelligent managers are very good.  Above and on the side - smart, effective colleagues, I want to go forward.  It is important that when you feel a breakdown, the system itself will help you to rise and light up again.  Moreover, the boss will feel and call personally. <br><br>  Your official letters will be necessarily read to the end, including tops, and sensibly commented. <br><br>  Meetings are encouraged to express their own opinions, initiative is welcomed, there is a feeling that the time you spend benefits the company and in the depths of your soul feels familiarizing with the beautiful. <br><br>  Flexible methodologies get accustomed here well.  If you are entrusted with such a company to secure effective communications with simple business processes - I recommend paying attention to simple Agile-tools like <a href="http://www.trackstudio.ru/">TrackStudio</a> , <a href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a> , <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/products/intranet/">Corporate portal 1C-Bitrix</a> . <br><br>  I will give advice.  Work in the ‚Äúadequacy bipole‚Äù as long as possible.  Get laid out to the fullest - you will be noticed and made sure that you constantly occupy a bright useful place in the pyramid.  If, damn, there will be an overwhelming desire to score a job, stop pushing the cart and control it - leave, let others work properly :-) <br><br>  <b>A company like "The lair of sadism"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c78/2dc/6f6/c782dc6f677ce4ea1fa0047d83674bd3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A wonderful training ground for researching the depths of the shifted human psyche :-) <br><br>  A model arises as a rule when, due to the seizure of power by a ‚Äúdriver‚Äù or ‚Äústolen stool in childhood‚Äù, ‚Äúsmart and good for now‚Äù leave the company for a short time and remain: <br><br>  - Sheeps <br>  - Drivers <br>  - Clever and already evil <br><br>  And everything is ruled by a boss who seizes power, who either is a ‚Äúdrover‚Äù or just not this one, but he saw it - ‚Äúbeaten with a stool in childhood‚Äù. <br><br>  Thanks to a catastrophic brain drain, IQ may be a unit per department, if not lower. <br><br>  At the pyramid levels of staff in this case, closer to the boss will fight to the death of "smart and evil" and "drovers".  Tops will be virtual, transmitting orders from top to bottom and to the question: "Are you a fool?" Answer: "Always a fool, Your Highness." <br><br>  It's funny, if anyone knows, be at meetings in such a company.  You barely restrain yourself from laughter and tears, when one is more stupid than the other about the solution of the problem, but even more terrible - when adult uncles and aunts make a clever expression on the face and give a condone. <br><br>  Stockholm syndrome is a common disease among colleagues.  I have even seen colleagues who are really starting to cry with emotion on the topic of how well they congratulated a thread on the top of their birthday.  Nightmare. <br><br>  Your servants are read only if they contain 2-3 sentences, since  the rest of the text in the buffer frontal head head does not fit.  We have to explain complex concepts on the fingers and toes to meetings, and by the way, you yourself start to grow stupid and repeat - it takes at least six months or a year :-) <br><br>  The situation is very similar to the kingdom of "Alice in Wonderland" - every day they are looking for the guilty, the main boss shouts "A head from the shoulders!".  :-) <br><br>  If you get into such a company, you should know that you will be used as cannon fodder and your intellect will remove the parts of the brain that were knocked out with a ‚Äústool as a child‚Äù higher up the career ladder. <br><br>  Lay out here is useless and even dangerous.  If, and most likely it will be, you will start working more and more efficiently 80% of the surrounding employees - they will certainly substitute you, still - you actually force them to keep up, and in this realm of politics work for the good of the company is not the place. <br><br>  Everyone tries to climb on the head of another - the unfortunate, who were at the bottom, are forced to push the cart forward.  The rest - tusyat. <br><br>  The higher, the more lies, folly and flattery.  Personnel decisions are paradoxical and comic. <br><br>  If you get the courage to go to the first person and report on total idiocy - do not be surprised to hear something like: "If something does not suit you, you can be free." <br><br>  But it is not all that bad.  You can put a series of interesting experiments.  For example: <br>  - initiate a project <br>  - gather a project team of representatives of the "elite" <br>  - work flawlessly yourself and crush your head with a couple of three structural divisions <br>  - make ineffective members of the project a fool in front of the leadership <br><br>  If you are lucky and succeed, enjoy the fountain of colleagues leaving in parts, heart-rending screams in the corridors and fascinating debriefing meetings where people will trample into the ground and they smile insanely in response :-) <br><br>  In general, if this is your company, the first thing I recommend to do is to find a secluded ‚Äúbipole of adequacy‚Äù in it and from there set up experiments, and when you get tired of it, go to a dream company.  Don't linger long in the ‚Äúden‚Äù - you will undermine your health. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Do not lose hope and look for your own ‚Äúbipole of adequacy‚Äù - a dream company.  If you find one, hold on to it with all your might.  But if you are a thrill-seeker with a strong psyche and a desire to make a joke, then companies of the ‚Äúsadism den‚Äù class should surely be in your portfolio. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122686/</a></p>
