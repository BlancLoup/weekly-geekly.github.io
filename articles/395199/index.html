  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook will delete your photos if you don't download the Moments app.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Facebook continues to divide its application into parts.  First, Messenger ‚Äúbroke away‚Äù from him, which is notable for its intrusiveness, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277136/">vulnerabilities</a> and eats the battery with appetite, and now Moments.  If you have set up automatic synchronization of photos from your smartphone to Facebook, then until July 7, 2016, the social network will delete these images - to prevent this, you need to download a new application. <br><br>  The aggressive policy caused a stir in Google Play and iTunes - but users began to download the application, including just to leave a negative review. <br><br>  Some people keep thousands of photos in a closed album, and they don‚Äôt even know about them: <br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="740728442254135296"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><a name="habracut"></a>  In early 2016, some users of Android-smartphones found that removing the Facebook application could <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270344/">increase the time spent</a> on a single charge by 20%.  My experience confirmed this - I began to charge the smartphone much less often, although the Facebook application was not used so actively - it worked mainly in the background.  The company clearly knows about the problem, as the vice president of products, Chris Cox, in 2015 <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/facebook-workers-ditch-iphones-in-push-for-world-conquest/">forced</a> employees to throw iPhones and use Android until they figure it out.

      The <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274302/">Messenger</a> mobile application company released in 2011.  In some countries, it competes with ordinary messengers, as it allows you to communicate without registering with the social network itself, using the name and phone number.  Users could write messages in the main Facebook application, but in April the company announced that this feature was disabled in the application, and later <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276850/">in the mobile version of the</a> site.  So she <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/9/5598440/facebook-will-turn-off-messaging-in-its-mobile-app-forcing-you-to-download-messenger">forced</a> users to download Facebook Messenger and caused a lot of negativity.  But the app is a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/261956/">bit ahead of YouTube</a> . <br><br>  Facebook again decided to use a similar aggressive policy with respect to new applications.  Now we are talking about Facebook Moments, a service for storing and sharing photos.  In the main Facebook application there is a function of auto-synchronization of photos with a social network: they are saved in a closed album.  Some people in this album may have <a href="https://twitter.com/aurevoiralexis/status/740728442254135296%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">thousands of photos</a> .  The company made a newsletter in which it warned that ‚Äúif you want to save yours (number of photos), download Moments and log in to it until July 7th‚Äù.  If you do not want to use the application, then you can download these photos from your Facebook page.  Otherwise, the photo will be deleted. <br><br>  If you have already received such a letter in Russian - please leave the full text in the comments or write to me in a personal message. <br><br>  Again, the threat of Facebook had an effect on users, and they began to download an application for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.facebook.moments">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moments-get-photos-you-didnt/id991346515%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> .  And again - negative from users: ‚ÄúMy feedback on the messenger turned out to be prophetic, when I sarcastically said‚Äú make another application for a photo, ‚Äùand now I‚Äôm waiting for my interest, I was ahead of you with this idea for half a year.‚Äù  Another user writes ‚ÄúSo why do I need a Facebook on which they are forced to download their new items, otherwise we‚Äôll delete the photo !?‚Äù <br><br>  It is important to note: we are talking only about closed albums with auto-synchronization.  Manual albums, as well as photos and videos uploaded to the page, Facebook will not delete.  Not now, anyway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/7bb/950/30a7bb950a4c0efeab87d3ddee762529.png" width="600" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395199/</a></p>
