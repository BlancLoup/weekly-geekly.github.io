  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find a job to the sysadmin. Or ‚Äúwhy don't they call me for an interview?‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I promised in my last note, I will try to briefly tell you what criteria a 9/10 sysadmin resume went into the basket. <br><br>  For starters, put yourself in the shoes of people (people) who need a worker.  Moscow's IT market is quite overheated due to dumping emigrants from Ukraine and Russian regions.  As a result - a huge shaft of reviews and it is physically impossible to read them all.  Each employer comes up with their own filters in order to find the one and only.  I will say right away that I am not HR and never was (crossed) because HR people have 1-2 employee search templates and none of them are applicable to IT specialists.  For this, I had my own filters, let's say, of the second level.  But the first level of the HR-biorobot also needs to be passed somehow.  In order to pass both levels of the initial dropout, you just need to issue a summary of the rules.  A trifle, but for an IT person, especially a sysadmin, paperwork is a knife in the heart, and many are addicted to it. <br><br>  So, simple rules, or which summaries will definitely not pass the ‚Äúreading‚Äù stage of a heap of reviews: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Do resume a vacancy </h4><br>  If a person writes that his desired position of ‚ÄúDirector of IT‚Äù with a salary of stopitsot millions, then maybe you do not need to respond to the vacancy of a ‚Äúsystem administrator‚Äù with a much lower than indicated income?  I can still understand when boys of 24 years write about their gigantic experience of a merchandiser in a large trading network, but if on the contrary, the resume immediately goes to the ‚ÄúReject‚Äù folder with the ‚ÄúLazy‚Äù resolution.  After all, what does it cost to correct the text for a vacancy or even easier to do two resumes at once?  Nothing.  So - lazy.

    <h4>  2. Hide your dark past </h4><br>  I will reveal a little secret: usually the first and the last place of work are read, the rest of them run over their eyes.  If you started your career as a security guard at the Sucking Paw dog shelter, then maybe you shouldn't mention this in the ‚Äúsystem administrator‚Äù vacancy response? <br><br>  But it is also not worth it.  All your words are pretty easy to check. <br><br><h4>  3. Write in detail </h4><br>  Such summaries were sent to the cart immediately: <br><br>  <i>place of work: Hook and Hryuk LLC (meat-packing plant)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>position: system administrator</i> <i><br></i>  <i>duties: was engaged in system administration</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Do not be lazy to indicate specific responsibilities and specific achievements.  It does not hurt and will allow you to evaluate your ability to talk beautifully about boring admin days. <br><br><h4>  4. Specify middle name </h4><br>  Of course, this is trivial and niggling, but if you were given not only a name at birth (an artist previously known as Zverev), but also a patronymic was assigned, then show respect to your ancestors - indicate it.  This only shows the accuracy of the person, but it can play a key role, ceteris paribus. <br><br><h4>  5. Write a phone number where you can be contacted. </h4><br>  I emphasize, not email or Skype, but a telephone.  The initial contact is always ‚Äúby ear‚Äù and, if the phone is unavailable within an hour or does not respond, then you will most likely not be called back.  Believe me, there are usually enough candidates not to dwell on a particular person. <br><br><h4>  6. Avoid non-formals. </h4><br>  Various emoticons, slang words and other informal methods of communication.  Not that they go badly into minus, but they are alarming.  For example, often the presence of a smiley in a resume is a reason for an HR worker to reject a candidate.  Do not take risks, it is not worth it. <br><br><h4>  7. Attach a photo </h4><br>  From personal experience, resumes with a photo are much more likely to succeed than without.  If there is no photo, then there is no need to post pictures, sketches or screenshots (there were some particularly clever admins who instead of photos put pictures on it). <br><br>  In short, that's all.  I will tell you about how to behave during the interview next time.  All the sun and smiles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233939/</a></p>
