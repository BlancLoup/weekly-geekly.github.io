I will say right away, I will personally describe my experience, you do everything at your own peril and risk.  If something does not work out, I am not guilty.  So, let's begin: <br><ol><li>  You need to issue an international payment card.  In my case, the Internet card VISA International, issued in Privatbank through the Privat24 system. </li><li>  You need to register with the Google Checkout payment system and authorize your card there.  In my case, they asked me to confirm my billing address.  To do this, I sent a copy of my National Passport with a residence permit, a copy of my foreign passport and a copy of utility bills using a single payroll. </li><li>  The fact is that at the moment, officially, this phone can only be bought by residents of the United States, Great Britain, Hong Kong and Singapore.  If you simply go to the store site <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">www.google.com/phone</a> then the phone order button will be inactive.  But there is an easy way out of this situation.  Again, I tell you how I did. Perhaps some other method will work for you.  Go to the <a href="http://www.plati.ru/">site</a> and buy a list of available proxy servers there.  I bought 50 pieces for as much as 50 cents through the WebMoney system (I think it makes no sense to talk in detail about this system).  I can only say that it is convenient to replenish your wallet on the <a href="http://www.webmoney.com.ua/">site</a> again through the Privat24 system.  Check this list for availability <a href="http://www.checker.freeproxy.ru/checker/">here and</a> then check to which country the remaining ones <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/iplocation/">are</a> and look for the abbreviation USA / UK / HK / SGP.  You drive a suitable proxy server into your browser properties and go back to <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">www.google.com/phone</a> .  And voila phone order button is active. </li><li>  We return to the fact that the phone can only be delivered to one of the above countries, so in order to be delivered to Ukraine, we need an intermediary who can send it to us.  The best and proven service is <a href="http://www.shipito.com/">www.shipito.com</a> .  I did not check it myself, but judging by the reviews, everything should be fine.  In my case, the phone was delivered to a friend in LA who brought it to me in Donetsk.  When you register, you will be charged $ 8.5 in advance, do not worry, they will immediately be written off when you make your package.  After registration, you will be given your personal number, which you will specify in the delivery address when placing the order on Google.  Congratulations, you now have a personal address in the USA. </li><li>  Go back to the site, order your phone, in the delivery address indicate your name, 2972 ‚Äã‚ÄãColumbia St.  # (the number that you received when registering a Shipito account), Torrance, CA 90503. Instructions on how to specify the delivery address on the Shipito website, if something is unclear.  When placing an order, you can engrave on the back of your phone.  It costs nothing, but it will delay the delivery time of the phone for 3 days. </li><li>  .  After your phone arrives at the Shipito service warehouse, you can arrange the delivery of your phone to Ukraine.  To do this, you will need to fill out a declaration (the instruction is again on the website) and arrange the parcel.  I recommend to specify in the declaration merchandise, but not gift and delivery to choose USPS Priority Mail¬Æ Int'l.  Of course, you can choose another method, for example FedEx, but it significantly increases the cost of the final price of the phone and not the fact that you will not be charged a fee.  In the description of the goods, simply indicate ‚ÄúMobile phone‚Äù without a model name  And now the most important thing is to not get to the customs duty, specify the declared value in the range of $ 250 (200 euros).  You can also get insurance for $ 5.  But keep in mind that in which case you will be able to recover only the declared value.  Otherwise, you can specify the full cost, but then you will get 40 percent of the cost on taxes.  Therefore, there is a small risk.  But, again, judging by the reviews of those who ordered under this scheme, everything should be fine. </li><li>  Now somewhere in 15-25 days, you will receive a notice that your new Nexus One is waiting at the post office in your hometown. </li><li>  Total: the delivery time from Google to Shipito is 2-3 days, plus 1-2 days for making the package plus 15-25 days for the delivery of the package, only 3-4 weeks.  The price of $ 530 is the cost of the phone, $ 50 is customs tax, delivery in the USA is free of charge, $ 8.5 is Shipito services, $ 31 is the cost of delivery to Ukraine, only $ 620. </li><li>  In principle, by this method you can now purchase almost any product that is delivered to the United States.  Ebay, Amazon and others will no longer be an obstacle for you. </li><li>  If you have any questions, <a href="http://shophelp.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D947">there</a> is a very good FAQ on Shipito, and <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D151319">here</a> and <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/">here,</a> like-minded people from Russia are discussing the purchase of the Nexus One. </li></ol><br>  It seems to be all.  If you have questions, write @ukr_android <br>  PS <a href="http://www.androids.com.ua/reviews/kak-ya-stal-obladatelem-google-nexus-one/">Here is</a> an article about why I decided to buy a Nexus One. <br>  PPS is already from me ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/myshyak/" class="user_link">myshyak</a> - when using such a scheme, no one will give you a guarantee that your phone will not cause suspicion at customs. If this happens, be prepared to pay from 20 to 40% of the duty. Although literally half a year ago, HTC Magic received according to a similar scheme, and everything went well, bypassing customs ... <br><br> <code><a href="http://twitter.com/ukr_android"></a> Disclaimer:    @ukr_android     .          ;-)</code> </div>
