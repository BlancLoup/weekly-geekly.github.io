  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I studied at the "Internship School"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today is a bit unusual topic for me, but I decided to write about my studies, because it took away a significant portion of my time and gave a lot of useful knowledge and skills.  Perhaps someone will be inspired and also go through school. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c71/3a9/19d/c713a919db49489ca09f017b246b5329.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that I asked <a href="http://rusak.me/blog/">Anton Sergeevich Rusak</a> , a designer with whom I had been working for a long time, about what to read on the subject of design.  He advised me to read the site of Artyom Gorbunov.  I obeyed: it turned out to be quite a decent section ‚ÄúTips‚Äù to which I specifically stuck.  He took the time to read two or three tips from there every day. <br><br>  I saw that they were enrolling students in the " <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/school/31aug2015/">intern school</a> " and really wanted to go.  Agreed with Anton Sergeyevich that we will go to study together.  So they decided: they sent tests and began to read literature.  Fortunately, the recommended reading of the literature turned out to be quite a lot.  Among other things, I would like to separately mention the ‚ÄúFind an Idea‚Äù by Heinrich Altshuller and ‚ÄúDo it tomorrow‚Äù by Mark Forster.  About them I will try to write a couple of separate articles.  Now I‚Äôll just say that they really change the mind and approach to business. <br><br>  As a test, it was necessary to develop the design and concept of a payment service.  This product should allow you to easily transfer money to a friend in a neighboring town, a relative kept abroad by a relative, to the village of a grandmother.  I got a simple design service " <a href="http://33kita.ru/portfolio/day-deneg">Give</a> me the <a href="http://33kita.ru/portfolio/day-deneg">money</a> ." <br>  Our test tasks were checked and at the competition 1.4 people we entered.  I ended up on the 33rd place in the overall standings, which is pretty good if you consider that I‚Äôm not a designer at all, but just know how to cut and paste pictures in Photoshop.

    <h2>  Learning structure </h2><br>  Schooling is divided into three stages.  At the first 100 students study.  Of these, the top 30 fall into the second.  On the third pass only 10. I will tell about the first step, because I deliberately did not go to the second and I do not know what is happening there. <br><br>  The learning process is divided into weekly blocks.  Every week text and video materials are laid out on a special school resource.  Students study them and pass automated tests by 23:59 Fridays.  If a student does not pass tests on time, there is practically no chance of getting to the second level. <br><br><h3>  First week </h3><br>  The first week of training for me coincided with a <a href="http://navff.ru/%3Fp%3D427">trip to Sadhu Sang</a> .  The materials seemed to me quite simple, until I began to take tests.  In simple, seemingly tests, I could not score more than half of the possible points.  The tests on the layout and the negotiations seemed to me particularly difficult: there are a lot of subjective answers.  Those.  you need to understand how the author of the test thinks in order to pass it successfully.  According to the results of the first week, I went down in the ranking somewhere by 10 positions. <br><br><h3>  Second week </h3><br>  The trip to the south continued and training, too.  In the second week, intensive training continued, the materials were piled up and superimposed on each other.  I liked one of the teachers, <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/belyaev/">Vladimir Belyaev</a> .  He has a tricky, exquisite facial expression and it seems that this is exactly what a lawyer should be.  The test results were again disappointing: by the beginning of the third week I dropped to 51 seats. <br><br><h3>  Third and subsequent weeks </h3><br>  When I arrived in Cherepovets, Anton Sergeevich shared with me an excellent technique.  You can print tests and think with paper in hand.  It turned out to be very effective: it is possible to express some thoughts on the fields, to postpone a decision, without haste to turn to primary sources.  In short, all the benefits of paper media.  So over the next couple of weeks the situation in the rating has stabilized and even began to rise slightly. <br><br><h2>  Benefit </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/147/4f5/d211474f59fe4384a7330de3cfafbb48.png" align="right"><br>  I will reveal here a little bit of what has greatly helped and continues to help. <br><ul><li>  <b>Proximity theory.</b>  It is well disclosed <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/sections/136/">in Lebedev</a> and even more fully revealed in the school of Gorbunov.  This is about the fact that the closer objects are visually, the greater is the connection between them.  From proximity theory follows a number of special cases and rules that are useful to apply in projects. </li><li>  <b>Basic elements of layout.</b>  This is about how to make strong layouts from titles, texts, illustrations, signatures, hyperlinks and controls. </li><li>  <b>Layout pages.</b>  This topic is devoted to several weeks.  From simple text pages to complex pages with many different elements.  The section is well studied with Harrover's pre-read book. </li><li>  <b>Build interfaces.</b>  This is a whole section that leads <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/">Ilya Birman</a> .  Here I will note the methods of working with layers, the syntax of interface elements and navigation.  We use these techniques every day and thank you for this Ilya. </li><li>  <b>Conversation.</b>  The whole discipline is based on the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/30963608/%3Fpartner%3Dnavff">methodology of Jim Kemp</a> and, in fact, the negotiating course is chewing this book with actual examples from the lives of designers and programmers.  The course turned out to be very practical advice, for example, if according to your feelings, you are late for a meeting by 5 minutes - call and say that you are late by 10. You will arrive early and the person will be pleased that you arrived earlier.  Often people do the opposite: they downplay the delay time, which is just annoying. </li><li>  <b>Design and right</b> led sly Vladimir Belyaev.  He told what plagiarism is, licenses, 16+, how to save on the conclusion of contracts, how to register a company and what to do if it is time to go to court. </li><li>  <b>Text and editing</b> turned out to be the most difficult discipline for me.  I got the worst grades on her.  However, there are also many useful things there, for example, how to write a good promotional page.  The Gorbunov bureau has its own invention: the information style.  This is the style of writing simple and hedgehog texts.  One of the characteristic techniques of the info-style is the <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/20141214/">removal of stop words</a> . </li><li>  <b>Management and results.</b>  For me, the most interesting, relevant and simple section.  I found for myself in it very important things.  The principle of " <a href="http://ksoftware.livejournal.com/202173.html">do ‚â† do</a> ", <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bureau/fff/">FFF</a> and " <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/20130909/">not butt</a> " </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Kursovik </h2><br>  At the end of the first stage you need to do a runaway.  The task is to draw a website for a company engaged in windows, doors, shutters and gates.  I made a block layout, and I had to attract a designer for the drawing of the layout.  With photoshop and indizayn I have bad and what a good designer does in 2 minutes, I do in an hour.  So it turned out to be easier to delegate than to do it yourself. <br>  Kursovik helped keep the position in the first thirty and I was invited to the second step.  Anton Sergeevich also passed with excellent results. <br><br><h2>  Second stage </h2><br>  After reading a little about the second stage, I decided that I would not continue to study this year.  Very large study load, but I need to run projects and build a house.  It is good that you can continue learning with any of the future kits. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> The trainee school takes designers, editors and managers to the next professional level.  I try to apply most of the principles given by the school, although it does not always work.  The most difficult thing is to switch to FFF with customers and employees.  But I hope that this will happen soon. <br>  I wish you happiness =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298282/</a></p>
