Despite the fact that they were not the first to interview this guy and not the last, Chris was extremely friendly, polite and easy to talk to ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Interview</b> <br>  IncGamers: Well, Chris, how did you spend your weekend? <br>  Chris Saigati (laughs): Not bad.  We finally announced the existence of Starcraft II.  As if the stone fell from the soul, by golly.  A long period of conspiracy, work on the "secret project" is in the past.  Very happy about it.  There was even a joke in our team - we approach each other and report: ‚ÄúI heard, and we are working on Starcraft II‚Äù! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/10a/bb7/a3f/10abb7a3fc792eda73a5d503a5dbd707.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Chris Saigati" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      IncGamers: Can you now say under what name Starcraft II passed during the conspiracy? <br>  Chris Saigati: Of course.  We called it "Medusa" ("Medusa"). <br><br>  IncGamers: Medusa ... does it mean something? <br>  Chris Saigati (laughs): Basically, no.  So, there is some connection with Karigan (Karigan), but ... <br>  IncGamers: Real-time strategy has made Blizzard the industry's top echelon.  However, the last game in this genre was released in 2003 (original Warcraft III).  Why did Blizzard reject strategies for so long? <br>  Chris Saigati (embarrassed): Well, such a long pause is associated with one small project.  You probably know him - this is World of Warcraft.  In general, the decision to make Starcraft II was made immediately after the sale of Frozen Throne.  However, to start earlier, again, we did not allow World of Warcraft.  It turned out to be a truly gigantic, incomprehensible project.  It is incomprehensible in the sense that we are much more accustomed to creating strategies and role-playing arcades (Diablo). <br>  After the decision to create StarCraft II was made, there were always a few people in the studio who were closely involved in this project.  But to deliver a decisive blow, to work all together (especially for a long time we could not connect artists) prevented ... yes, yes - World of Warcraft. <br><br>  IncGamers: As you know, for a long time there was a website on the Internet, which categorically stated that Blizzard is working on a multiplayer game in the Starcraft universe. <br>  Chris Saigati (laughs a lot): Yes, I read this ... <br><br>  IncGamers: Don't say that.  Chris, answer honestly: why did you abandon work on a multiplayer game in the Starcraft universe and switch to Starcraft II? <br>  Chris Saigati (laughs): Okay, I'll reveal all the cards to you.  A week before our talk today, we suddenly realized that we didn‚Äôt want to make a multiplayer Starcraft, sent it to all four sides and sat down to make Starcraft II. <br><br>  IncGamers: In the entire history of Blizzard, we did not observe a single precedent of chasing scandalous fame among studio developers.  And this is despite the fact that millions of eyes are always riveted on Blizzard, and thousands of journalists keep writing about your games.  How is it going? <br>  Chris Saigati: The main thing that we always do when dealing with the press - we carefully weigh every word.  Your right to write anything: that the next project will be a multiplayer Starcraft, that it will be a game in a completely new genre, something else ... We can't get through this.  There will be no leaks.  People who work at Blizzard always think what to say and when.  They do not need Ponte, they have enough of a sense of self-worth, which gives a job in Blizzard. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUXoekeDIW8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4ZasYL8qfLbkaoP1MITI3kYR2RA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  IncGamers: It is very interesting that such a corporate spirit lives in you and that you are so persistently moving away from protruding individuals.  Even now, when Blizzard is one of the most influential gaming studios, you guys are simple and affordable. <br>  Chris Saigati: I am glad that you perceive us like that.  I do not like all these stamps ‚Äúour heroes‚Äù or ‚Äúthe whole world knows them‚Äù ... <br><br>  IncGamers: How many Blizzard developers came to Seoul?  In my opinion, quite a lot ... <br>  Chris Saigati: Actually, the fact that they decided to send so many DEVELOPERS to Seoul seems to me remarkable. <br><br>  IncGamers: When we arrived in South Korea, what is happening here with multiplayer games just blew our brains out.  This is prohibitive.  And what are you going to do with Starcraft II to meet the expectations of fans of online games? <br>  Chris Saigati: We usually have no difficulty incorporating a multiplayer mode into our games.  Let's be honest - we can do it very well.  Warcraft III and Starcraft are among the best games for online contests between gamers.  In general, eSports is very close to us.  We in Blizzard have formed communities of gamers in Europe, Korea, Asia and the USA, we support them as soon as possible, we support competitions within these communities. <br><br>  IncGamers: Will there be a Starcraft II version for Macintosh? <br>  Chris Saigati: Sure.  Right now we are working on it.  We have always supported this platform and will continue to do so. <br><br>  IncGamers: Thank you, Chris, for an interesting conversation. <br>  Chris Saigati: You're welcome ... <br><br>  - The translation is not literal, please do not judge strictly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31087/</a></p>
