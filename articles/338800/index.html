  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SAP is looking for future specialists to work with data science and machine learning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This fall, SAP is launching a new young talent support program - the SAP Young Professionals Program.  During the year, 20 novice specialists (students or graduates who have recently graduated from higher educational institutions) will be trained with the support of SAP experts and representatives of partners.  And then they will become part of the project teams on the most promising areas in the IT market: development, data science and machine learning.  Selection to the program starts in several leading Russian universities, the main stages will be held in Moscow and Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  In this post, we will explain in more detail why SAP is seeking to find new talents for the most promising professions in the IT market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cb/4e/59cb4ea8581a2180515541.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why SAP decided to start training Data Science and Machine Learning</b>

      In early 2017, the company introduced SAP Leonardo, a portfolio of solutions for using new technologies in business.  It includes services for working with the Internet of things, machine learning, blockchain, predictive analytics, Big Data and many other services. <br><br>  After the SAP Leonardo announcement, we received a lot of questions from Russian customers and partners about the functionality of the system and how to apply innovations in production, industry, retail and other industries.  We faced not only the interest in new technologies, but also the lack of specialists who know how to work, for example, with big data or machine learning.  That is why we are starting the SAP Young Professionals Program, whose participants will be able to gain rare practical experience in popular professions over the course of a year. <br><br>  <b>Big Data Specialist - The Most Demanded Profession of the 21st Century</b> <br><br>  One of the most painful questions for our customers is what to do with the huge accumulated volumes of big data and how to turn Big Data into Smart Data (‚Äúsmart data‚Äù) in order to gain value.  Many companies have long used in the work connected devices, machines, sensors.  But at the same time for the majority still remains a mystery - how to make the data work? <br><br>  Data Scientists is one of the most popular media professions today.  Harvard Business Review calls it the ‚Äúsexiest profession of the 21st century‚Äù, McKinsey predicts demand for 140-190 thousand big data specialists in the USA alone in 2018. <br>  In SAP, the direction of big data is developing widely for several reasons.  First, key business processes - sales, purchases, logistics, finance, manufacturing - are already going through SAP systems.  Clients trust our expertise in working with big data. <br>  Secondly, SAP has its own powerful solutions for working with big data - in particular, SAP Predictive Analytics.  We also use well-known algorithms for working with Big Data (for example, logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest) on SAP HANA. <br>  We should also highlight the use of neural networks.  At the beginning of the year, SAP and Google agreed on a strategic partnership, part of which was the use of the open source library TensorFlow on SAP technologies. <br><br>  When working with big data, we solve a wide range of tasks.  Here are just a few examples: <br><br>  - prediction of repairs and quality of products manufactured at production <br>  - forecasting sales and payment behavior of customers, as well as methods of customer retention <br>  - Forecasting HR functions: employee outflow, employee retention methods, employee life expectancy forecast <br><br>  <b>How will the recruitment and training program SAP Young Professionals Program</b> <br><br>  To participate in the program for the 2017/18 year, we invite students of 4 courses or older, graduate students or young professionals who graduated from university 1-2 years ago.  Program participants will be distributed in two directions, for each there are specific requirements: <br><br>  - For developers: knowledge of integration subsystem components, knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand tools for web development (JavaScript, SAP UI5, SAP Fiori), experience in working with databases (HANA, SQL) <br>  - For specialists in Data Science and Machine Learning: knowledge of discrete mathematics, statistics and statistical analysis, understanding of the basic algorithms of machine learning, skills in working with databases and SQL, knowledge of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Python, Hadoop, R). <br><br>  Training will be held in full-time (at SAP offices in Moscow and Yekaterinburg) and online formats.  Offline lectures to SAP YPP participants will be delivered by specialists from various SAP departments (consultants, presales, etc.).  Classes will be devoted to the structure of the company and its portfolio, features of ERP-systems, the development of soft-skills (presentations, work in a project team, etc.), design thinking (design thinking session).  In addition to face-to-face format, students will also participate in online classes and, most importantly, get free access to SAP Learning Hub ‚Äî a huge cloud-based ‚Äúrepository‚Äù of SAP knowledge with many electronic manuals and interactive courses on various IT topics, as well as the ability to communicate with by experts. <br><br>  An important part of learning is practice.  Beginning data scientists will work with real, already processed client data to understand the principles of Data Science. <br><br>  After three months of training, students are waited for exams, according to which they will be distributed to various departments of SAP and our partners, where they will start working as part of project teams on existing client projects under the guidance of senior colleagues.  At the end of the program, participants who have shown themselves at their best will receive a job offer on the SAP team or one of the partners. <br><br>  If you want to ask a question about the program or send your application for participation - <a href="">write us about it</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338800/</a></p>
