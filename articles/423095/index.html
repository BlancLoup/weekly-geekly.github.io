At the Steve Jobs Theater gathered journalists and technicians, thirsting for new information from the largest company on the planet and the first American trillionaire. </p><br><p>  Part of the data on new devices Apple itself today accidentally browsed on its website.  During its update <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849898/apple-confirms-iphone-xs-iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-names">,</a> references to the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xr <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849898/apple-confirms-iphone-xs-iphone-xs-max-iphone-xr-names">appeared</a> in the code.  In addition to the names "leaked" and some of the characteristics of new devices: screen size, memory size and body color.  But the most interesting Tim Cook and his comrades still told directly at the event.  In short, in three words: more expensive, more, more powerful. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h2>  Apple Watch </h2><br><p>  Began with the new Apple Watch 4. Cook believes that Apple's smart watches have come a long way to become the number one watch in the world in sales.  And now the company is entering a new level.  As expected, now smart watches will take care of our health with you.  They will detect if the user's heart beats irregularly, and send him a message about it.  Now, Apple Watch also knows how to make an ECG graph - you no longer need to consult a doctor for this. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/iq/xw/uaiqxwmnpwrplleapfpdl15kiya.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The processor is twice as fast as the previous one;  it is dual core 64 bit.  The display has become a third more than in the previous generation.  "Desktop" hours completely changed.  Now you can bring to it, for example, your favorite photos.  The dial can also be animated.  The clock has improved the speaker and microphone, updated the cellular signal transmission system, added the function of the radio.  Motion and orientation sensors began to work 8 times faster ... The watch became waterproof, and their battery should last 18 hours. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/yg/ra/qbygrat58ocrro-rw9yqrgb3b5m.jpeg">

    <p>  The coolest thing is that Apple Watch was taught to understand if a person fell, stumbled or slipped (they say, to find patterns, you had to sweat very seriously).  If a person has fallen, a big red button will appear on the clock, by pressing which you can quickly call for help.  Moreover, the watch can even call it independently if the user does not move within a minute after the fall. </p><br><p>  Apple Watch Series 4 prices: </p><br><ul><li>  Series 4 with GPS - $ 399; </li><li>  Series 4 with LTE - $ 499. </li></ul><br><p>  Start of sales - September 14.  Shipments to the United States start on September 21. </p><br><h2>  iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max </h2><br><p>  Two new Apple smartphones, differing in display diagonal.  It will be 5.8 inches for iPhone Xs, 6.5 inches for iPhone Xs Max.  Display - OLED, resolution - 2436 x 1125 pixels.  Both smartphones have become dvuhsimochnye.  Both have two cameras with 12 megapixels.  One - with a wide-angle lens and f / 1.8, the second - with a telephoto lens, double optical zoom and f / 2.4.  The camcorder can record video in 4K and sound in good stereo thanks to four built-in microphones. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/i6/9y/wei69ygfj2yre2dbfwvkndoxnog.jpeg"><br><br><p>  In front of iPhones - "the most durable glass in the world."  They are waterproofed to IP68.  Improved HDR-shots and 3D Touch, accelerated algorithms Face ID to determine the owner of the face.  Apple continues to insist that it is the most reliable smartphone locking system in the world. </p><br><p>  Inside both models - the most powerful A12 Bionic processor at 7 nm with 4 GPU cores and 6 CPU cores.  Smartphones work 30% faster than previous models.  The internal storage has also expanded: a model with 512 GB will be available. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/35/4_/6m/354_6m3zwax7ff6uc0zm-uhqqxi.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Apple continues to put pressure on augmented reality.  To make her smartphones even better work with AR, the Core ML camera engine on the A12 will now work 9 times faster and 10 times more energy efficient than before.  They showed how you can make a virtual ‚Äúaquarium‚Äù from your kitchen, in which 200 species of fish and sea creatures swim.  One of the applications helps to play basketball better by analyzing your throws in detail (though it would be if the ball accidentally touches the iPhone while it is shooting your game?).  They showed the graphics in The Elder Scrolls: Blades from Bethesda and the new Galaga AR toy for the destruction of space aliens who seized your room, which several people played on the table on the stage. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/9t/xr/md9txrrpl0dgec-zgjchj7ipi9q.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Smartphones will work for an hour and a half longer than their "daddy," last year's iPhone X. </p><br><p>  Case color options are gold, silver and gray. </p><br><p>  There will be 64 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB versions. </p><br><p>  Prices start at $ 999 (from Xs Max - from $ 1099). </p><br><p>  Pre-orders in the United States start from September 15, sending - from September 21 (in Russia - from September 28). </p><br><h2>  iPhone Xr </h2><br><p>  Another smartphone, the main feature of which is the presence of an LCD display.  Its diagonal will be 6.1 inches - something in between the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max.  The display goes from edge to edge for the first time; it is the most advanced LCD screen in the world of smartphones.  Apple called it Liquid Retina.  The resolution is 1792828 (326 PPI).  The screen is larger than the iPhone 8 Plus (it was 5.5 inches), but in a much smaller package. </p><br><p>  The smartphone is protected from dust and water according to the IP67 standard.  It works with Face ID, A12 chip and all other iPhone Xs / iPhone Xs Max technologies. </p><br><p>  The battery, according to Apple, is one and a half hours longer than the iPhone 8 Plus (before this, the iPhone 8 Plus was the leader among Apple smartphones, from 11-12 hours of active work without recharging). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/rh/cu/xkrhcus58f_3syex5whmbi6cjhm.jpeg"><br>  <i>New price tags</i> <br><br><p>  The iPhone Xr will have 64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB options. </p><br><p>  Prices - from $ 749. </p><br><p>  Pre-order starts from October 19, sending - from October 26. </p><br><p>  In general, they expected more.  Even the update line of the iPad this time did not work.  The whole presentation took more than an hour from strength.  On the other hand, Apple last showed the new size of the iPhone in 2014, with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.  And the A12 Bionic chip, as the company says, will definitely be the most powerful smartphone in the world. </p><br><p>  We remind you that all Apple equipment can be taken 20-30% cheaper directly in America (just compare Apple.com and Apple.ru prices).  Savings on each purchase of iPhone is more than 10 thousand rubles.  And you can deliver all this to Russia with <a href="http://bit.ly/PochtoyHABR">Pochtoy.com</a> - in the shortest possible time and at the best price (from $ 8.99 per pound).
