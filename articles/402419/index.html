  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We disassemble new Nintendo Switch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Start selling new consoles <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/">Nintendo Switch</a> has been very successful.  In the first week, the company managed to sell more than 1.5 million consoles.  By the end of March, the manufacturer plans to overcome the 2 million bar.  With the Nintendo Switch, gaming reality takes to the streets: the console can transform and transform the game - from home TV to the console screen.  The prefix, with which you can continue the game anywhere, has every chance to become your constant companion.  <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">The parcel</a> offers to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/287026/">get to know her better</a> ‚ûú <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/962/a38/039962a38adf4d16aab5817f7b687e60.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In recent years, the legendary <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/">Nintendo has</a> been in a zone of turbulence.  From historical successes to crushing defeats, the company was only a few years apart.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">The Nintendo Wii</a> sold over 100 million copies and was recognized as the most successful console of the company.  The next product - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> - was able to take a huge market share from its main competitor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-PlayStation-Vita-WiFi/dp/B00PV515DU/ref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fs%3Dvideogames%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1489717643%26sr%3D1-3%26keywords%3DPlayStation%2BVita">PlayStation Vita</a> , but six months after the start of sales, it began to rapidly lose popularity due to the lack of games and fell in price. <br><br>  The gamers didn‚Äôt accept the updated version of the basic console ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Wii-U-Consoles-Hardware/b/ref%3Dsn_gfs_co_WiiUVisNav_3075116011_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3075116011%26pf_rd_p%3D8d62828b-982f-4b50-9848-1a7d591115a1%26pf_rd_r%3DWKB7307W6C5GWFY24JTQ%26pf_rd_s%3Dvideogames-subnav-flyout-content-3%26pf_rd_t%3DSubnavFlyout">Wii U</a> ) either: sales fluctuated around 14 million consoles, and fans accused Nintendo of losing their brand and low level of fantasy.  The company tried to take into account the opinion of customers and for 5 years went into the development of a new console, which was supposed to return the glory of Nintendo.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fd/696/49f/4fd69649fe29444cbd30b374acd14fb3.jpg"><br><br>  In October last year, the long-awaited information about the Nintendo Switch appeared, and already in March anyone can buy it ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dsr_nr_n_1%3Ffst%3Dp90x%253A1%252Cas%253Aoff%26rh%3Dn%253A172282%252Cn%253A16227130011%252Ck%253Anintendo%2Bswitch%26keywords%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1489719051%26rnid%3D493964">‚Äústanding in line‚Äù to save money</a> ).  Should I call this product a legend or just a modern console, it is too early to decide, but now we can talk about its innovation.  The console turned out to offer new possibilities for interaction between players and tie the game not to a specific place (sofa and TV), but to the player himself.  For this you can love her for sure. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Hybrid</font> </h3><br>  Nintendo Switch is trying to erase the boundaries between home and portable consoles: now you can play not only at home in front of the TV.  The game can continue anywhere: on a walk in the park or in a stuffy Moscow traffic jam.  The process of the game can not be stopped, at any place you have at hand a set-top box that offers excellent image quality, a good screen with clear lines and bright colors. <br><br>  For a comfortable game away from home TV, there is an LCD touchscreen display, which resembles a conventional 6.2-inch tablet.  The screen resolution is 1280x720, 237 ppi (pixels per inch).  The display has a good color and excellent resolution for its diagonal, it is equipped with a light sensor that can be turned off to adjust the brightness.  When the console is connected to the TV, it is possible to increase the image quality up to 1080p. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/e1a/c33/b41e1ac33341435fb5b63abd7ab5ae77.jpg"><br><br>  The company's pride is the most capacious battery in the history of Nintendo consoles - 4310 mAh.  In portable mode, it lasts for 4-5 hours.  And if the battery is pride, then the new generation of feedback controllers called HD Rumble is a delight in engineering.  To understand what it is about, just take the controller in hand. <br><br>  The heart of the Nintendo Switch is a modified Tegra X1 64-bit SoC processor with four ARM Cortex A57 cores.  The processor is served by an active cooling system, two megabytes of L2 cache and operates at a frequency of 1020 MHz.  The amount of RAM - 4 GB type LPDDR4.  In a portable format, it operates at a frequency of 1331.2 MHz, and in a stationary, it develops up to 1600 MHz.  The graphics embedded in the SoC is based on the second-generation Maxwell architecture and contains 256 CUDA graphics cores.  The maximum frequency of the GPU (307.2 MHz, 384 MHz and 768 MHz) is achieved exclusively while the console is operating in stationary mode, when installed in a docking station.  The amount of internal memory format eMMC NAND is 32 GB, 6 GB immediately takes the operating system, and there are only 26 GB, which, again, is sparse.  Saves the situation the ability to connect microSD memory cards up to 2 TB!  To understand the space occupied, you can take as an example the digital version of the game Dragon Quest Heroes, which will take as many as 32 GB in the console!  In other words, buying a console, do not forget to grab an additional memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/20c/dcc/13920cdcc0cb4e3baf21d463842504ff.jpg"><br><br>  The Verge rated the console at 7.5 points out of 10. The publication noted the reliability of the hardware of the new Nintendo Switch, a simple switch from the home version to the portable, experts liked one of the best in the history of starting games - Zelda.  In the US, one of the versions of the console is sold complete with this game (and with Just Dance 2017) and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/nintendo-switch-systems/ci/34599/N/3569470714">costs only $ 420</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Joy con</font> </h3><br>  Mandatory component of the Nintendo Switch - Joycons (Joy-Con) - two wireless controllers with a standard set of buttons and a joystick (before all the consoles came bundled with one controller, and the second was purchased separately).  At first glance, everything is as usual.  But it is worth studying them more closely, and it will become clear that the engineers from Nintendo have tried their best.  Right Joy-Con thanks to NFC and an infrared sensor can measure the distance to nearby objects and detect movement.  You can play ‚Äústone, scissors, paper‚Äù - the console digitizes the figure you are showing.  Such a set of technologies makes it possible to play with the help of physical figures of heroes as we used to play as toy soldiers, only now in virtual reality. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gUEhQ65FOJ8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Joykon abilities are not limited to this.  The Nintendo Switch has the ability to transform: the controllers can be easily separated from the console and used one by one with approximately the same functionality, one of the joycons can be given to a friend and chopped into a game with him for a couple.  On the inside there are light indicators that indicate the sequence number of the controller, which helps not to get confused when playing together.  In the mobile mode, the controllers can work up to 20 hours (inside there is a 525 mAh battery). <br><br>  Both controllers have a gyroscope and an accelerometer - mechanisms that allow you to record the movement of devices in space, especially useful for motion games.  It is pleasant to interact with the Joycons during the game - they add realism to it, perfectly conveying sensations through vibration.  For Switch, there is even a game in which you need to guess the number of ‚Äúballs‚Äù inside the controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11b/2c2/d86/11b2c2d86764459ca5811f8b47c7ace6.jpg">  <i>Due to their compact size, the Joycons have been criticized by the holders of the thumbs.</i>  <i>For some reason, the Japanese did not take into account that not everyone in the world is as miniature as they are :)</i> <br><br>  In Nintendo, they did not forget to take care of the convenience of gamers and added special removable panels with straps to the console kit, which allow you to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa very small controller and protect it from slipping out of hand (when you chop with friends in a motion game). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/976/67f/3cc/97667f3cc5f942b5b75e425d58da8271.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The cost of a pair of Joy-Con in the US is <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1311614-REG/nintendo_hacajaaaa_joy_con_l_r_gray.html">$ 80</a> , in Russia - 5,490 rubles ($ 95).</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Included with the Nintendo Switch is a holder that allows you to insert two jojcons into it and get a full-fledged controller for the game when connected to a TV or tablet.  The accessory is available in two versions - with and without a charger (as standard). <br><br>  One of the most desirable additions for advanced players is the Wireless Switch Pro.  The controller comes with a USB Type-C cable for recharging and is ideal for many hours of play.  In Switch Pro, all the technologies that are in the joysticks are repeated, and you will be pleased with the subtle detail - a small inscription on the right joystick - THX2ALLGAMEFANS (‚ÄúThanks to all the fans of the games!‚Äù).  The cost of Switch Pro in Russia is 4490 rubles ($ 78), in the USA - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/ref%3Dlp_16227128011_1_6%3Fs%3Dvideogames%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1489733278%26sr%3D1-6">$ 70</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Dock station</font> </h3><br>  A universal device for charging, fixing the tablet and connecting to a TV.  When you open the back cover, we see several ports: HDMI for connection to a TV or projector, USB 3.0 and a power connector.  At the bottom is the modern USB Type-C, which manufacturers of Chinese smartphones have so fond of, and Apple has left only one USB Type-C port in the new MacBooks, abandoning both its own Thunderbolt ports and other universal formats.  The process of connecting the console to the docking station is quite simple - the display is simply inserted into the docking station via USB Type-C. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Nintendo Switch Game Modes</font> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zw47_q9wbBE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can play on the Nintendo Switch in three modes.  Connect the console to the TV and get the full format of the home console.  Take the controller Joy-Con (the second you can hand to a friend), set the display on the steps, and get some kind of a hybrid tablet and console.  And if you need to go somewhere, you can simply take the Switch with you and continue the game as if nothing had happened.  Can you imagine such variations with other consoles? <br><br>  The manufacturer did not include games in the standard set, they need to be bought separately.  Not the most popular move, probably due to the desire to minimize the cost of the console.  Why not: often the games in the starter set are not at all what you usually play.  But for sure you will play in The Legend of Zelda, so you should buy it bundled with the device: in the American BHPhotovideo.com you can save a lot on this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/f80/95f/9a5f8095f1d8495fb3ab221556f12c82.png">  <i>Game cartridges resemble an SD card</i> <br><br>  At the presentation of the console, a funny story happened when one of the journalists for some reason licked the cartridge and was shocked how bitter it was.  The company explained that the cartridges were soaked in a special solution so that small children did not want to swallow them and poison themselves.  A good move and care for children! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7p47TOmicQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  At the time of the console release, only 12 games were presented: <br><br><ol><li>  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </li><li>  1-2 Switch </li><li>  Just Dance 2017 </li><li>  Snipperclips - Cut it out, together! </li><li>  Super Bomberman R </li><li>  Fast rmx </li><li>  I am setsuna </li><li>  Shovel Knight (along with two DLC packs) </li><li>  Skylanders imaginators </li><li>  World of goo </li><li>  Little inferno </li><li>  Human resource machine </li></ol><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">What is the result</font> </h3><br>  At the exit, we get a truly unique hybrid console, in which mobility organically exists with the game on the big screen, with universal and functional controllers, with a good screen.  Nintendo Switch removes unnecessary restrictions and offers us a new level of mobile gaming. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12d/7ca/6ad/12d7ca6adcae48c687126c4ef3da92c5.jpg"><br>  The console is sold in two color variations - gray and red-blue, and from the whole set only the joycons differ in color.  The cost of the console in Russia is 22,490 rubles ($ 390), <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/">in the USA - $ 299</a> .  True, now Nintendo Switch is in short supply and appears in American stores in small batches.
