  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Goals, objectives and principles of automation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working in a company that deals with system integration, I had to read and supplement documents such as TKP, TK according to GOST, Acceptance Plans, etc. many times.  Projects on enterprise automation pursued similar goals and had approximately the same format.  The same phrases were repeated from document to document. <br><br>  I decided to collect the most common phrases that fall into the "goals and objectives" section.  And add principles that should be followed when making decisions. <br><br>  The list is not universal.  I would be glad if it helps someone when writing documents.

      On the other hand, some of the principles put together in this list are my understanding of what both large corporations and individual product development teams should strive for.  Steps on the way to the informatization of society. <br><br>  I urge you to adhere to many of these principles in your work in order to keep to a certain bar, below which it is simply no longer modern to be. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Creating a single information space for the interaction of information exchange participants. </h1><br><br>  Under this arch, you can put everything - and B2B, B2C;  CRM, ERP systems.  As well as document collaboration systems, such as Office 365, Google Docs and others.  If you think about postal services and instant messengers (Hangouts, Skype, Telegram, Slack ...) <br><br><h1>  Centralization of management. </h1><br><br>  From systems of monitoring the status of servers for the enterprise to the Smart Home control panel for personal needs. <br><br><h1>  Providing a holistic picture of the state of information objects to facilitate operational management decisions. </h1><br><br>  Analytics, statistics, reports.  Everything that allows data to collect, process and display in a convenient form. <br><br><h1>  Acceleration of information flows. </h1><br><br>  It can be achieved as an increase in productivity due to an increase in resources, due to changes in architectural and technical solutions, and by reducing the number of logical links in the data transfer chain (automatic processing instead of manual at some stage, for example). <br><br><h1>  Rapid receipt of relevant information. </h1><br><br>  Push / e-mail / sms notifications, auto-update web pages, subscribe to events and more. <br><br>  When working together with documents or adding to the knowledge base of the development / implementation / maintenance team, it is worth refusing to correspond with the request to drop the latest version, link to the article, or unsubscribe when something is added.  Set watch, subscribe, etc.  and read the mail.  Do not take time colleagues. <br><br><h1>  Compliance with current legislation. </h1><br><br>  The most acute question in a timely society ... But 15 years ago, only measures aimed at obtaining licenses from the FSB approached this point 15 years ago.  Now ... I will not even list. <br><br><h1>  Data protection from unauthorized access, loss and damage. </h1><br><br>  Simple and clear - IB. <br><br><h1>  Control access to information on the role model. </h1><br><br>  IB. <br><br><h1>  Optimize data storage to eliminate redundancy. </h1><br><br>  Adjusted for cases where redundancy improves search performance. <br><br><h1>  Accounting and synchronization of document versions to improve collaboration. </h1><br><br>  How often do you send documents that do not have the final state by e-mail?  Think about it.  Perhaps your corporate infrastructure already has a solution that allows you to store documents edited by several people in one place.  Even an individual has a wide (and free) ability to work with files.  Try to use them all the time, and forget about letters with attachments like "TK on ProductName.version31.docx". <br><br><h1>  Eliminate duplication of data entry to speed up processes and prevent contradictions / distortions. </h1><br><br>  It is not a shame to admit, but many companies still ask their clients and applicants to fill out questionnaires, which are sent by mail.  At least a third of the fields of such questionnaires could be filled automatically. <br><br><h1>  Reducing the influence of the human factor on the functioning of information systems. </h1><br><br>  Protection from the fool, from Krivoruchek and from a beloved - automator. <br><br><h1>  Reduction of unproductive expenditure of staff time. </h1><br><br>  Virtually all of the above can ultimately save a person from the routine. <br><br><h1>  Changing the corporate culture of the organization. </h1><br><br>  A change occurs when a system of personnel training and assessment is being implemented, as well as when internal floodlists, bulletin boards, and the like come across. <br><br>  Are there more beautiful frazochki?  Write in the comments that I missed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257161/</a></p>
