  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 and other numbers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I, like you, know that James Gosling - a great man, a giant, just like Kernighan, Richie and Stroustrup - began developing a new language Oak 24 years ago.  I, just like you, know that the active life of a new language began 19 years ago, when its first official version from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.html">Sun Microsystems</a> appeared on the Internet, and all world-wide software developers began to acquire licenses for Java 1.0.  But I am celebrating exactly the 20th anniversary of Java.  Perhaps I am sentimental, but for me Java is Java and not some oak.  And for me it is important that the Java language got its real name exactly 20 years ago.  In honor of this one cup of coffee: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95f/415/8ac/95f4158ac50f443b88796c6ff123b22a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And I - like you, I hope - like the legend that it's not even about coffee, but about the coffee maker.  Coffee maker is itself a cult object.  Being a programming language for coffee machines ‚Äî as well as TVs, cars, telephones, self-checkout counters, and even credit cards ‚Äî is very honorable.  Twenty years ago, they talked differently, but now everyone understands that without Java, there will be neither Big Data, nor the Internet of things, nor telemedicine, and nothing at all - for the new world, the world of the future. <br><br>  I‚Äôll throw a few numbers at you now, and you can decide for yourself whether this is important or not.

      ‚Ä¢ 10 billion is the number of smart cards based on the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/embedded/javacard/overview/index.html">Java Card</a> .  Try to do without Java now. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 7 billion - so many devices today run on Java.  10 years ago it was three times less, but today, if only smart machines inhabited the Earth, they would have one common language - literally. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 125 million - the number of multimedia devices running on Java.  Imagine that Russia is inhabited by multimedia devices. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 9 million - so many developers write in Java.  18 years ago there were 400 thousand, and today - 9 million. Imagine that all of Moscow is inhabited by Java programmers.  Submitted? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 630 - so many people are included in the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK Community</a> today.  When you read their list, in the eyes dazzled by the names of Russian developers. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 30 is the number of implementations of the corporate versions of <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/javaee6technologies-1955512.html">Java EE 6</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html">Java EE 7</a> .  Compatible implementations. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 20 - well, of course, so many years have turned Java, we have already figured out.  And this is a 20% discount on all <a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage%3Fpage_id%3D39">Oracle Certification</a> exams until the end of the year - of course, in honor of the 20th anniversary of Java. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 12 is the number of enterprise Java EE vendors.  It does not take your breath away that you can choose the version of the language that you like, from the supplier that you like, and create a byte code that is guaranteed to work equally on any web sites?  On different devices?  In the operating environments your users prefer? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 9 is the next version of Java.  This is the same version in which modularity will be provided ( <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/">Project Jigsaw</a> , do not worry - this is not scary, but very important for scalability, building libraries and large applications), Java Shell will appear (an interactive tool for evaluating code fragments), a new API for HTTP clients (with support for HTTP / 2 and WebSockets), the ability to port to ARM AArch64 for Linux, etc. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 8 is the current Java version.  This is the version that is now used to ensure the safety of land and air transport, to collect information on the state of the oceans, to monitor and record cereals in programs to help starving people, to simulate the functions of the brain and the human musculoskeletal system, and of course, for entertainment .  This is the version that was created by one-third by engineers from the Oracle Development Center in St. Petersburg.  Russian developers were responsible for Java ME (completely) and Java SE (AWT, SWING, J2D, JavaFX graphics libraries), as well as for the performance and quality of Java 8 as a whole. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 5 is the number of Java principles.  Without these principles, there would be no Java: <br><br>  1. Simple, object-oriented, familiar language (like C and C ++). <br>  2. Reliable and secure (simple memory management; security is built into the language and into the runtime). <br>  3. Neutral to architecture and portable. <br>  4. High-performance (the interpreter does not need to check the execution environment, because the automatic "garbage collector" is engaged in the release of memory). <br>  5. Interpreted, multi-threaded (Thread class), dynamic (at the layout stage). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 5 again - so many years ago, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/sun/index.html">Sun Microsystems</a> acquired Oracle.  Together with Sun, the company bought Java itself - and thus assumed all responsibility for Java.  Anyone who says that Oracle has not justified the trust, let them throw a stone at me first.  Because <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 - so many releases of the Java platform - namely, Java 7 and Java 8 - released by Oracle. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 is you.  Another person to whom Java benefits.  Or maybe another Java programmer.  The choice is yours. <br><br>  And if you're not really a Java programmer, but are going to take exams for certificates in Java this year, then Oracle Certification gives you the 20% discount on all exams in honor of the 20th anniversary of Java - until December 31, 2015 .  To get a discount, go to <a href="http://pearsonvue.com/oracle">pearsonvue.com/oracle</a> and register with the promo code "Java20".  You will not regret! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258989/</a></p>
