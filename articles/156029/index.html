As of 2010, there were about 192 million domain names on the Internet, and their growth was about 3.7 million per month.  Among such a huge number of ordinary, and sometimes very banal names, there are domains that can cause a healthy laugh well, or at least a surprised smile.  Dear ladies and gentlemen, I present to your attention a selection of some of the most extraordinary domain names. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This list is headed by the domain of Google, or rather <b>gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogleogle.com</b> .  Now at the entrance to the site you will find a huge number of such icons here: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/574/5e3/97c/5745e397c64aad35a6067d5d68d7556c.png"><br><br>  However, earlier this site was in many ways similar to its progenitor.  It had such familiar to us (well, almost) buttons "Goooooooooooooooooooo ... ... gle.com Search" and "I'm Feee ‚Ç¨ √´√´√´√´eeeling Luuuu√º√ºucky".  Funny what to say. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f14/86c/7c0/f1486c7c0d1a6cfb528b8ff0d850ed25.png"><br><br>  For most network users, it will not shock the domain of, say, 60 characters.  However, among these lanky domain names come across very original.  These include the site <b>thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com</b> , which contains various interesting facts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2bc/975/277/2bc975277e8d47fe57fc60b1d3e5cd3b.png"><br><br>  <b>Thelongestdomainnameintheworldandthensomeandthensomemoreandmore.com</b> , the creators of which considered their domain the longest in the world and even submitted an application to the Guinness World Records, can be attributed to the same heap.  However, unfortunately, and perhaps fortunately, their application was rejected.  The argument was quite simple - there is no point in this, for the record can be broken by adding only one letter to the domain name. <br><br>  Even more sad fate in the domain <b>3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592.com</b> , which now does not work at all.  For those who have not noticed, the domain does not consist of a simple selection of numbers, but is a decimal display of the number Pi, at least up to 63 digits after the point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a64/071/e99/a64071e99c7db2f8480e3b2c30604fb0.jpg"><br><br>  Another domain - <b>dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com</b> - contains a question that translates as ‚ÄúDo websites need to look the same in all browsers?‚Äù.  Not the longest domain and far from the most original, but go through it and you will receive a very comprehensive answer to the question posed in the domain.  Brevity is the sister of talent, perhaps ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1c/2b1/a9b/d1c2b1a9bd1981a9d6aafe0c5e1cda77.png"><br><br>  With what, and in short, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantantiliiliogogogochka, the founders of the town in Wales, were not exactly gifted, which in Welsh means ‚ÄúSt.  The site is named after this town ( <b>llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.co.uk</b> ), the creators of which also feel free to call the ego the site with the longest domain name.  Interestingly, someone told them that size is not the main thing? .. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e5/dd9/426/3e5dd94268de918dd2ba59fe37f4086f.jpg"><br><br>  Do hosters also have a sense of humor.  The guys from Network Solutions so accurately own them, no wonder they assigned the <b>dotcom.com</b> domain to their website.  Here is such a pun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/163/f04/6da/163f046dacd905fbd93308e09457a658.jpg"><br><br>  Here we are with you slowly and got to the most unusual domains. <br><br>  The highly respected Royal Ornithological Association of Britain (The Royal Tit-Watching (Ornithological) Society Of Britain) once used a very non-scientific domain - <b>Nice-Tits.org</b> .  Apparently ornithologists are also able to appreciate the feminine beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eda/bb5/8f9/edabb58f9a411552b84df793266702c9.jpg"><br><br>  Dickson doesn‚Äôt do anything bad, just manufactures instruments for controlling temperature, humidity and pressure, but their domain is difficult to attribute to such innocent activities of <b>DicksOnWeb.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/838/288/b3a/838288b3a88863b9fedd6f1fedec9377.jpg"><br><br>  But the company Choose Spain, engaged in organizing a weekend in Spain, judging by the domain <b>ChoosesPain.com</b> is ready to include in the package of the tour the most unusual wishes of tourists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/972/d74/9b9/972d749b99a60c72e0930780bf4d0a66.jpg"><br><br>  Website manufacturer software <b>ViagraFix.com</b> ( <b>ViaGrafix</b> company) quietly existed without any shame until the very moment when the famous tablets appeared.  The company now calls itself Learn2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bba/8a5/999/bba8a5999487efd20a34eec283c7d4d7.jpg"><br><br>  The community of teachers and students <b>TeacherStalk.com</b> , apparently wants to teach how to sneak up to the teacher.  So, just in case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/824/f21/df2/824f21df2246d6ec4e77e039c70ffac4.jpg"><br><br>  The small quiet town of Winters publishes its own newspaper Winters Express, the domain of the site of which is more suitable for the site for adults - <b>WinterSexPress.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78e/cec/739/78ecec739d54af604154400100e9539b.png"><br><br>  Auctions Hit is one of many eBay options.  That's just not clear what the domain <b>AuctionShit.com</b> hints <b>at</b> ?  On the quality of lots? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dce/3df/37f/dce3df37fb48d49c8e62e3bf2a65abe1.png"><br><br>  The company engaged in the construction of scaffold (scaffold erection) and dismantling works chose the mammoth as its symbol, which very ambiguously affected the domain <b>MammothErection.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca6/8ed/4f1/ca68ed4f1db24a6a9f7c6c63fddff1a9.jpg"><br><br>  The domain site of the corporation, which monitors the status of channels in the state of New York (New York State's Canals), <b>NYCAnal.com</b> was eventually changed to canals.ny.gov because you know what the reasons are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/904/0d3/591/9040d35912989d2db9d54955eb9ba7ba.jpg"><br><br>  In New Zealand, there is also a ‚Äústore on the couch‚Äù called ‚ÄúBut That's Not All‚Äù.  Site - <b>ButtHatsNotAll.co.nz</b> .  Do they have in the sale of hats for the fifth point? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ca/c4f/fbf/7cac4ffbf66666e1464d6b86e25ea873.jpg"><br><br>  The Childrens Wear Company apparently believes that without their products, cute kids will start to curse, which is hinted at by the domain of their site - <b>ChildrenSwear.co.uk</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/311/8ca/c8f/3118cac8f2ab55d384648c3f74e0cbf4.png"><br><br>  Website IHA Vegas - <b>IHaveGas.com</b> .  No comments. <br><br>  The site <b>BiGalsOnline.com</b> , judging by the domain, offers toli products for pets, toli communication with girls of a particular orientation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13d/8f7/31a/13d8f731a01f78b00d7abd9275f943b5.png"><br><br>  SCA Tissue offers sanitary and hygienic products, but what are they made of, not from poor sea creatures?  The domain name is <b>ScatIssue.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45f/0c1/7ec/45f0c17ec8fb963cdb74bde1731587e2.jpg"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt even want to think about what prompted Cumbria Storage Systems to name its site <b>CumStore.co.uk</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4b/f28/d2f/c4bf28d2fc38c9857c12321a182c7e9b.jpg"><br><br>  Alter‚Äôs waste management division is very well known as <b>AltersCrap.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/853/521/684/853521684628040daeb380a31810820a.jpg"><br><br>  On the Cook Islands, you can start your business, but note that in the end your site will look something like <b>domain.Co.ck</b> . <br><br>  Employees of the Australian company WebOne, apparently, very bony.  They stated it in the domain - <b>WeBone.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f9/3b0/ea5/4f93b0ea5ea8605022c9c98377262385.jpg"><br><br>  The website Who Represents is an information base about agents of various pop stars and cinema.  The domain of their site demonstrates the attitude of some people to show business - <b>whorepresents.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9e/fc6/0db/c9efc60dbb77fcaad809d2e2f3a83b1b.jpg"><br><br>  The Pen Island site, offering pens and other stationery, has acquired a very funny domain <b>penisland.net</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bb/8f0/101/4bb8f0101a63500d375b088df95ef938.jpg"><br><br>  Italian Generator Company - <b>powergenitalia.com</b> .  Oh, those Italians.  At the moment the domain no longer belongs to this company. <br><br>  The site domain of the Methodist Church of the First Coming <b>cummingfirst.com</b> hints at something completely unrelated to the church.  The domain is no longer the property of the above church. <br><br>  Art people love to stand out from the crowd, but this is somehow too much - <b>speedofart.com</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ef/118/1c1/6ef1181c1a0d3c6dda3a915e51807e9f.jpg"><br><br>  Odds Extractor - service for farmers.  Domain - <b>OddSexTractor.com</b> , well, farmers are people too. <br><br>  Can Apple's Mac make a guy more brave?  Creators of the site <b>MachoMe.com</b> <br>  think yes! <br><br>  The Experts Exchange project is designed for programmers who want to share experiences, but <b>expertsexchange.com</b> seems to offer a completely different type of exchange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71d/77b/b9c/71d77bb9cf64bd10d78648e4ed10f26e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> Most of these domains have changed owners for a long time (and therefore the theme of the site), or simply ceased to exist, which is a pity.  After all, they gave a reason to laugh once again, and laughter, as they say, prolongs life.  Live long and do not forget to laugh more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156029/</a></p>
