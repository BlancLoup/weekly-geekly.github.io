It is about him, as well as our modest participation, that we are going to tell during this short trip . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d66/feb/cc7/d66febcc7eb63fae8a07a600321e104b.jpg">

      We are the <b>Result</b> , or abbreviated <b>"RZLTT"</b> . <br>  Full cycle interactive marketing agency. <br>  We help ambitious businesses to quickly launch new services in the form of startups in the Russian and global markets.  It is probably useless to write more words about our main activity - you will want it, you will find it yourself. <br><br>  Also, it hardly makes sense for you to talk about TechCrunch - you know everything and so.  And remember that his first Russian version happened in 2010, when it became clear that our level is also a level, and in general it is not worse than over the hill. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Plus, an event with TechCrunch sauce allows this very sauce to be smeared on itself, and then to argue its own ‚Äúglobality‚Äù.  Trifle, but nice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6b/324/49f/e6b32449f1c3a69c8ee4b01e953c4502.jpg"><br><br>  Anyway, we monitored each event separately, and coming to the third TechCrunch, it became obvious that the composition of the party had not changed and its core remained static for three years now.  On the one hand, this is good, the leaders remain leaders, on the other hand, I would like to see new, interesting faces.  They, of course, tried to put on public display, but, apparently, the person of Arkady Volozh is so huge and comprehensive that it is he who has been central to the event for more than a year, and other speakers and interesting visitors are lost in his shadow. <br><br>  Another statement follows, adding to the hypothesis that the Russian IT crowd needs to be diluted with new faces, ideas, and projects ‚Äî most of the projects shown at the event already exist for some time or another. <br><br>  There are enough examples of this, but perhaps the strongest fact is the victory of Excursiopedia - a resource with already more than three years of history, and according to our subjective feelings, even five years.  But these are all the little things that have little relevance to the project with which we came to the event - <b>PromiseUP</b> . <br><br>  <i>Project without a project</i> <br><br>  Perhaps the most curious in the whole history of PromiseUP's participation in Moscow TechCrunch was that, in fact, we were almost the only ones who came without, in fact, a product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/198/912/337/1989123373bbf0ed7b5ee59c37122b6e.jpg"><br><br>  By the time we showed ourselves on the Startup Alley, we had a website, a corporate identity that had been formed (it turned out that designers now call their own design that way - we were surprised too), a presentation and stickers.  We prayed to the spirit of Steve, wrote complaint letters to Apple and, in general, shamans as they could, but the miracle did not happen - the application was not posted in the AppStore for the event. <br><br>  Having decided that such a trifle wouldn't stop us anyway, we armed ourselves with our own closed beta (in the test environment) on the connected devices, and it was she who was shown to all those interested in our project.  We were particularly pleased with the fact that no one expressed a curse on this fact, but on the contrary, he tried his best to help with advice or recommendation that would help us at the time of release. <br>  In other words, people reacted very positively to the idea itself and its visual design, which was very important for us, since we do not provide any unique service or technology, but a unique idea, philosophy and psychology, if you like. <br><br>  Hence the conclusion: a very positive audience comes to TechCrunch, ready to communicate on any topic with anyone who is interesting enough to start a dialogue.  In our experience, we say that far from always and far from everywhere, unknown teams meet that way, I'm sorry, startupers. <br><br>  But, probably, the absence of a clear product that can be touched became the main obstacle to our entry into the list of semi-finalists of the Startup Alley.  Still, whatever one may say, the level of projects, like the general level of the event, is very high.  And if you look at the most interesting ideas and their implementation presented at the conference, it becomes clear that PromiseUP did not reach the best in terms of the level of implementation, or complexity of the service, its reasonableness and, probably, the visual part.  Of course, this can only scare the coward, so we decided to put the bricks aside and try our strength as we can. <br><br>  On December 9th, on the first day of the event, it became clear that all our fears were, if not groundless, then unequivocally exaggerated. <br><br>  We managed to come up with several entertainment elements that were able to interest most of the visitors.  Partly because many were afraid to appeal to people with non-standard proposals and ideas, we immediately understood that this is the only thing that can catch a sophisticated person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/906/811/d1c/906811d1c6baa8e30f5bde816eeea49d.jpg"><br><br>  Hence the advice to all people and teams participating in events of any level: do not be afraid to talk to people, ask questions, collect opinions, pull people, climb into the camera in front of their faces, pick up snacks from plates and so on.  It has not hurt anyone yet - we checked and made sure. <br><br>  Perhaps the main tool for attracting attention to ourselves was our investment agreement, which we offered to enter into each.  Its essence is simple: any person could become a ‚ÄúPromiseUP investor‚Äù by investing any amount, even ten rubles, even a million, into our project and putting his signature next to ours, on paper, which we allowed to take home.  The logic is simple: we ensured that if PromiseUP is selected for the semi-finals, we will refund 200% of the investment amount, and if we win, then 300% of the initial investment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/482/d12/007/482d12007fc488721e3fba17d6656861.jpg"><br><br>  If we talk about the specific results of this action: we have concluded about 50 such contracts, for a wide variety of amounts, from 100 rubles (minimum) to 3,000 rubles (maximum).  We were even a little worried - what if people take it seriously?  But nothing happened (partly because we did not get through to the semifinals and honestly answered on the second day that we were ready to drink each ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù for a drink).  Almost every person reacted positively to words, like: "At the moment when half the world will use it, and Ivan Kochetov will be giving an interview to Bill Geist at the next AllThingsD in New York, you will not have such a chance." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/305/21e/9b3/30521e9b38f26466a64fb50a16af01de.jpg"><br><br>  Before the speech of the company's founder, Ivan Kochetov, on the TechCrunch stage, people were not very happy.  After it, we became the point of issuing gauze bandages during the plague ‚Äî there was a traffic jam around our table, through which the hands of those who wanted to put their signature next to ours on agreement reached. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fh-KUECmAaY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhj5LUg8qoKXhmLxIHiT1nzRYc9tmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Well, what do you say? <br><br>  We believe that the audience award, if it were, definitely would have been given to us.  Why?  Firstly, it can be seen from the reaction of the listeners.  Secondly, we decided not to go in a completely standard way, and instead of details, on which 99% of the founders of startups concentrate, speak words and phrases that everyone can understand. <br><br>  Actually, we reaped the fruits of our own work for two full days: we shook hands, washed our hands, shook again, discussed some points in the mechanics of the application, listened to ideas and asked clarifying questions.  Since we started to brag, we should add that we were one of the few who were honored by Mike ‚ÄúButcher‚Äù Butcher himself.  We appreciated it, Mikey! <br><br>  At the end of the first day, when the semi-finalists were announced and we did not hear our name, it was decided to concentrate fully on the constructive, providing an opportunity to entertain those who needed it (we mean those who passed the selection, of course). <br><br>  As a result, we received a noticeable amount of interesting ideas on what could be added to PromiseUP, which markets are potentially interesting for us, and so on.  We were very pleased that people quickly became imbued with a social model of responsibility for these promises and spun it in ways that sometimes we did not even succeed during the assaults. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a9/1e1/34e/7a91e134e99a53ea86f3c7a8942c96fe.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, we were rooting for friends and acquaintances.  Especially for the guys from OhMyStats! Who went through to the semifinals and, in our opinion, were (and still are) completely worthy of the title of finalist. <br><br>  In the end, as a rule, it is customary to rant about cons, comments, shortcomings and so on.  We are not satisfied with this rule, so we want to leave a positive review, in fact, regarding everything. <br><br>  The organization of the event was top notch.  We never wanted to eat or drink, we were never forsaken by Digital October employees (hello, Masha!), Tried to help us with everything, answered any, even the most stupid of our questions, which were many.  Thank you for your support and patience, for help on the site, for not giving us anything. <br><br>  If we talk about the actual results of our participation in the event, expressed in something tangible, then, ultimately - we are very lucky.  The fact is that the release of PromiseUP in the Apple AppStore happened the next day after the end of TechCrunch Moscow, and considering that the majority of discussions on the Internet began just then - we received a noticeable portion of downloads and reviews.  Including from those with whom we communicated at the event.  The journalists, of course, also provided all possible assistance: The Elephant, who included us in the top 10 start-ups of TC Moscow;  The rain that showed us already twice on the air, Russia Beyond The Headlines, who invited us to tell about the application on the pages of The New York Times and many others.  Thank you, journalists and bloggers, we love you! <br><br>  PS At some point, we were able to talk with a person from AOL, who was also one of the organizers of the event on the side of TechCrunch, on the topic of PromiseUP participation in the American Disrupt this year.  It turned out that this is quite realistic, and for this it is not necessary to get a million from Pavel Durov, you just need to have a visa and be able to swim across or fly over the Atlantic.  Take note of yourself!  Well, we will wave the handle from the stage TechCrunch Disrupt New-York 2013. We will show them how to keep promises in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171041/</a></p>
