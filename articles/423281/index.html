  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feedback in the team, 360 and February 14</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all know that timely feedback is important.  There are many articles, videos, books and courses on this topic.  But not everyone has the habit of giving timely feedback to their employees, colleagues, and loved ones.  Plus, the feedback should be correct.  Often, we don‚Äôt need to be asked if we need someone to warm up and we forget to give positive feedback, considering that everything seems to be clear like that. <br><br>  Ask any couple with experience and they will say that, of course, it is important to make romantic evenings and give flowers to each other, but not everyone does it regularly and in a timely manner (let's be frank).  And only on February 14, everyone remembers about this and willfully, candles do not light and get vases.  So with feedback, as long as there is no culture to give it regularly and on time, we need special days of the week, places where people can give each other this very feedback. <br><br>  This is the event we and the team held. <a name="habracut"></a>

      This note should help find answers to such questions: <br><br><ol><li>  How to organize a feedback event for your team? </li><li>  How to organize a feedback event for a large team? </li><li>  What stages can such an event consist of? </li><li>  What exercises and techniques can still be used? </li><li>  What are the pitfalls in preparing a large team event? </li></ol><br><h2>  Start </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1f/ec/ky/1feckysfhymzcjvqdiqsvgyoojs.png"><br>  <i>Something like this was a request from my team on one of the retrospectives</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe method of‚Äú 360 degrees ‚Äùis a method of current assessment of personnel, which is to identify the degree of compliance of an employee with the position held by interviewing the employee‚Äôs business environment.‚Äù (Wikipedia) <br><br>  Ok, request accepted.  And for a start it was necessary to determine the goal.  What is this 360 for? What for?  To put a tick somewhere, to really identify the degree of compliance of an employee, to complain about colleagues?  Deciding on this is extremely important!  It may happen that you do not need any 360, and you have a completely different problem. <br><br>  We spent a lot of time with the team to find the reason why we need 360 and what we will do with the results. <br><br>  As a result, the goal was designated as follows: improving the working atmosphere and communication in the team.  To achieve this goal can be if: <br><br><ul><li>  give each other feedback </li><li>  learn to give open and correct feedback </li><li>  learn to accept feedback </li><li>  help to become better, more efficient, more successful for each team member </li></ul><br>  Well, if by SMART, then the goal is this: to improve the atmosphere and communication in the team within 6 months from the date of the event. <br><br>  Metrics: growth of indicators (trust, mutual aid, number of team players, transparency, utility, pleasantness).  Any growth will fit me! <br><br><h2>  Behind the scenes </h2><br>  It was decided that there will be a survey and there will be an event where we can discuss the results with the team. <br><br>  An important condition was that the survey will be open.  That is, the addressee will see both the answers and the authors of these answers.  The team (well, the majority) expressed the wish that this time the feedback was open, which is good!  Prior to this, 360 in the team was held anonymously. <br><br>  I compiled a questionnaire and agreed its format with the team.  I tried to simplify the questionnaire as much as possible so that the respondent could simply select the answer and not write from scratch, for example, when the answer must be provided in a free form. <br><br>  The questions in the questionnaire were as follows: <br><br><ol><li>  I know what you did in the last few sprints and understand what value you have brought for the team and product. </li><li>  I believe that you are helping the team achieve the goals of the sprints </li><li>  I can rely on you as a member of the team (I trust you) </li><li>  You are a team player </li><li>  I am pleased to work with you </li><li>  I know that if I turn to you for help, you will help me. </li><li>  I want you to stop ... </li><li>  I want you to start ... </li><li>  I want you to continue ... </li></ol><br>  The first six questions were offered answers. <br><br><ul><li>  not </li><li>  probably not </li><li>  I do not know </li><li>  rather yes </li><li>  Yes </li></ul><br>  The questions were not mandatory, so they could be skipped. <br><br>  The total number of questionnaires was equal to the number of team members, in my case 32. <br>  In each question, the metric was ‚Äúsewn up‚Äù, the dynamics on which I will keep track of. <br><br><ol><li>  Transparency.  Colleagues, know what you are doing. </li><li>  Utility.  Colleagues, believe that what you are doing is beneficial and helps to achieve goals! </li><li>  The trust.  Colleagues can rely on you. </li><li>  Teamwork.  Colleagues consider you a team player, the goals of the team are your priority. </li><li>  Nice.  Colleagues like working with you. </li><li>  Mutual aid  Colleagues know that you can help. </li></ol><br>  The questionnaire I used <a href="https://oprosso.ru/">oprosso.ru</a> , I liked the design and set of tools.  This is how the profile looked like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/dz/nj/d3dznjwiwz2utczibsgdbuvrw5a.png"><br><br>  Among the shortcomings of this questionnaire - in the process of passing the survey, it is impossible to save and close it in order to return later.  Also, if you‚Äôve returned a few pages back, the answers are erased and you have to fill it all over again.  I am still searching for a convenient and free service-questionnaire (I don‚Äôt have to offer monkey and google forms). <br><br>  After the guys passed the survey, I processed and digitized the results.  To each ‚Äúyes‚Äù I assigned 4 points, to each ‚Äúmore likely yes‚Äù - 3, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù - 2, ‚Äúrather no‚Äù - 1, ‚Äúno‚Äù - 0. In the end, for all participants and for 6 questions I got my own sort pivot table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/dt/z6/lrdtz6h0evtc9psgnwnhc538aei.png"><br><br>  I highlighted with green those and those questions, who and where points had more than 100, yellow from 70 to 100, and red less than 70. <br><br>  Also, I calculated for each addressee the number of respondents in absolute terms and the share. <br>  I planned to present these general results at the event itself to the children. <br><br>  A week before the event, every day I published a meme in which I talked about feedback, how to give it, about its purpose, etc.  Decided instead of a long instruction or training to do so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7t/zl/6m/7tzl6mtlo4xypbhgwfa0k1xjz4e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/no/mv/oonomv2bk4slvnbtdu0v4kami-w.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  "Christmas Eve" </h2><br>  In the evening, on the eve of the event, I sent the results of the survey individually to everyone.  It is important - not all answers for all team members, but only the results of the answers for this person, for example, Ivanov, I sent the results of the answers only for him, for Ivanov, and for Sidorov only for him, for Sidorov. <br><br>  I was worried that if I sent them out earlier, uncontrolled feedback would begin, and I wanted this process to be in a safe environment and in the most correct form possible. <br><br><h2>  Friday 11:30 </h2><br>  The first few minutes were devoted to the objectives of the event, the plan, the rules, I also drew a couple of flipcharts to help give feedback, there were sample sentences and various reminders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/o-/b8/sto-b8vlwe_fnhjge742oarhvcy.png"><br><br>  We started with a rather long delay and I had a great temptation to quickly go over to the feedback itself and skip the exercise for the mood to work.  But I gathered all the will into a fist and did it. <br><blockquote>  CONCLUSION: Do not belittle the value of the exercises. <br></blockquote>  It helped not only to set up a group, but also to encourage it.  The original version of the exercise rules is here <a href="http://www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing/">www.funretrospectives.com/collaborative-face-drawing</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to conduct the exercise Joint licensing</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Licensing is a fun interactive event that helps to remember names (and not only!). <br><br>  It is conducted as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  each participant is given a sheet of A4 paper and a pen / pencil / marker </li><li>  each member signs their own piece of paper </li><li>  then the participants randomly move around the room (better with energetic music) and stop at a stop command </li><li>  each participant must find a mate, for example, with the one who is the closest </li><li>  Members of the couple change their pieces of paper </li></ul><br>  And on command they begin to draw some part of the face (for example, nose and mouth). <br><br>  At the command, the participants of the pair change sheets of paper again, as a result, the participants should have a sheet with their name. <br><br>  Repeat steps 1-7 and draw the remaining parts of the face. <br></div></div><br>  Some photos from this exercise: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/ox/xf/gloxxfmykxy-tjdz4lwbgydpc9o.png"><br><br>  After everything was activated, I distributed the general results, told about the counting algorithm, gave 5 minutes to get acquainted with them, asking clarifying questions. <br><br>  Since there was no projector in the place where we held the event, I printed out to everyone the general results. <br><br>  The next step was the immediate process of giving feedback.  I chose the speed dating format.  It was planned that 15 people will sit, and the remaining 15 will move clockwise.  Then I planned to plant those 15 who moved in a circle, and those that sat should move.  Thus, according to my calculations and prototypes (!), I should have turned out that each participant received feedback from all team members.  But everything collapsed when mathematicians came running in and said that nothing would work out for me.  True, we never managed to find a way to mix people up in such a way so that everyone would eventually communicate with everyone.  Surely he is! <br><blockquote>  CONCLUSION: always have a plan B. And maybe even V. </blockquote>  We acted in the style of agile.  They left everything at the mercy of self-organization, it always works wonders.  Seated the guys in pairs in a staggered manner, so that they do not interfere with each other and say, by the bell call, move clockwise so that each time there is a new pair.  Everything.  Each pair had 3 minutes for feedback, 1.5 minutes for each.  The bell rang 2 times, 1 time - it is necessary to change the role - if you spoke, now you listen, and 2 times - that time has passed and you need to change the pair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/uq/m-/gguqm-_tpsi_sw0fjb-wljy2b6k.png"><br><br>  Somewhere in a couple of hours they managed to give feedback to half.  We took a break and continued.  After another couple of hours finished. <br><br>  The next stage was a general circle, where each participant in turn had to answer 3 questions: <br><br><ol><li>  what did I hear today? </li><li>  How do I feel about this? </li><li>  What will I do with it? </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iw/3s/jo/iw3sjorti4red_lqpx9qzuawlca.png"><br><br>  Answers to question 3 were recorded by the participants themselves on a piece of paper and pasted on the wall by me.  This was a wall of promises. <br><br>  Each participant had 3 minutes, but it is clear that someone fit in them, and some did not.  It also took 2 hours. <br><blockquote>  CONCLUSION: Do not believe if team members tell you, they say, let's hold a retrospective in nature, then to fry kebabs, then we will first work hard, and then we will work on kebabs.  Not!  At some point, it will surely begin - oh, one should marinate a skewer, one should chop onions, one will leave first, then the other.  It seems that this should be treated normally and be ready to go to the meeting, but do not allow everyone to disperse! </blockquote>  As a result, we had feedback in writing, verbally from each participant, conclusions and promises. <br><br>  The final exercise was wool team building.  This turned out to be a very important exercise, because after almost 5 hours of hard work, everyone was tired and exhausted and there was a need to emotionally switch and warm up. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Wool team building is done like this.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Each participant is given a ball of wool, such as acrylic - it is inexpensive and bright.  Then the participants stand in a circle, take the tip of the woolen thread and wind it around the wrist a little.  Well, at the command of throwing someone) when flew a new tangle, again you need to wrap a little around your wrist and throw.  The main thing is to keep the circle, keep the web stretched and do it quickly and fun! <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt endow this sacred sense with some sort of sacred meaning; rather, it was symbolic (‚Äúwe are one team, in one network, all of us are connected by the threads of communications‚Äù ... with a furious spirit). <br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nj/2h/-p/nj2h-p3hrixkxtjs3a18ff3jlgc.png"><br><br>  In general, it was a bright and fun ending not an easy day.  After that, all happy and contented went to cook kebabs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423281/</a></p>
