Why is this happening?  Yes, because a series of letters have more advantages for both the company and their customers. <br><br><h3>  The benefits and advantages of a series of letters: </h3><br><ul><li>  Round-the-clock work - a person can contact you at any time, a letter will be sent to him immediately. </li><li>  Improving the quality of service. </li><li>  The most useful information - you convey to the subscriber detailed information about your services. </li><li>  Increase response - you regularly remind about yourself and expand the audience, which is useful for your service. </li><li>  Increased engagement - you convey interesting information, often enter into dialogue with the reader, he feels confidence in you and is waiting for new letters. </li><li>  Increase sales - with each letter, your client is one step closer to the purchase. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A series of letters are ideal for e-commerce, webinars, online trainings.

    <h1>  What is it to write about? </h1><br>  Each letter should be interesting, it is unprofitable for us to lose the reader somewhere in the middle.  Content ideas - a huge amount.  Here it is important to understand - your content should fall into the information need of the client audience. <br>  Let's give an example.  The client is interested to buy a semi-trailer, so your mailing list should answer all questions concerning his purchase: <br><ul><li>  What to look for when choosing? </li><li>  Types of semi-trailers for a different type of business. </li><li>  How to make a new semi-trailer? </li><li>  Service Details </li></ul><br>  Already there are 4 topics that can be put in the basis of your series of letters. <br>  The simplest content idea is a guide or a selection of tips that answer a customer‚Äôs question. <br>  But if there are no more ideas, do not be sad.  We have prepared 9 more content ideas for a series of letters: <br>  <b>Guide "As ______?"</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c23/579/10c/c2357910cfc14121a834212a878b0e97.png"><br><br>  <b>Collections (tips, letters, tricks, etc.)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/605/f16/e4d605f1670543e2a8955da517c8f971.png"><br><br>  <b>Answers on questions.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f17/3a9/bf1/f173a9bf13f943c482c85551bc8635cf.png"><br><br>  <b>Lifehacks</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10c/1f6/9e0/10c1f69e0bc44271ad21df8b1e922866.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Useful checklists</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/14f/cea/aa714fceafd64e1583a0aa1ddeda1e9b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Success stories</b> <br><br>  <b>Comparison texts (for example, similar products; the task is to help choose)</b> <br><br>  <b>History tour</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebc/123/ee1/ebc123ee19d6472d89af1b4b407e1794.png"><br><br>  <b>Themed jokes and jokes</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa6/d3a/dae/fa6d3adaee284a9093efb0920c445366.png"><br><br><h1>  How often do I need to send letters from the series? </h1><br><br>  Email distribution allows you to customize the distribution of your messages as you like.  All you need to do is specify the number of days between sending the current letter and the last one.  Try sending letters every day for the first few days, then make a longer period between letters - after, say, the first week.  Why do you need it?  Because immediately after you subscribe to an email newsletter, you are interesting to people, and this is a great chance to sell them something. <br>  Too frequent emails can cause unsubscribe from mailing.  To avoid this, consider two key points: <br><ul><li>  If your newsletter coincides with the birthday of the client and sending a letter about an abandoned basket, choose one thing. </li><li>  If you are doing a newsletter from a travel company and at the same time know that your client has gone on vacation for a month - do not burden him with unnecessary letters, but let him rest easy. </li></ul><br>  The break between the series of letters you set yourself depending on the subject of distribution.  If these are training lessons, then after passing through one series, after a few days, you can start another one. <br>  <b>Under what conditions can you customize the sending of the next letter from the series:</b> <br><ul><li>  immediately after entering into the address book; </li><li>  subject to the opening of the previous letter; </li><li>  subject to a click on the link in the previous letter; </li><li>  to a specific date (event, holiday); </li><li>  when adding products to favorites; </li><li>  after placing the order; </li><li>  pending purchase; </li><li>  after making a purchase (for example, tell about all the possibilities of using the product). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What to do if the subscriber does not open the letter or does not follow the links?</b> <br><br>  When compiling a newsletter, you need to think over a series of reactivation letters for ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù subscribers.  Tips for composing such letters: <br><ul><li>  Think about the result you want from reactivation, and tie each step to it. </li><li>  Check the logic - is the letter correct, have you built the base of ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù correctly and is it worth it to invent something creative or is it better to simply ask why subscribers do not read the letters? </li><li>  Write down the steps in the calendar and put reminders, then you will not forget to "wake up" the subscribers. </li></ul><br>  And finally, you do not need to poison the readers with the same few years.  Update and develop your chain of letters.  Analyze each letter and work on improving performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/7b6/80b/2f67b680b6bf4a6c846de807bf079f79.jpg">  Irina <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">Chugay, SendPulse</a> mailing list <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">marketing</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295794/</a></p>
