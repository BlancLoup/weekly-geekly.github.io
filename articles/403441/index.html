A group of researchers from Case Western Reserve University developed the first implantable system for recording activity and muscle stimulation of the brain, which restores the movement of arms and hands in patients with paralysis. <br><br>  The system includes a neuro-computer interface with recording electrodes embedded in the skull and functional electrical stimulation ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_electrical_stimulation">FES</a> ).  The first person to experience the technology was the 56-year-old Cleveland resident Bill Kochevar, who was paralyzed below the shoulders as a result of an accident.  With it, he restored the movement of arms and hands. <a name="habracut"></a>

Now this technology allows the paralyzed person to reach the object and take it, that is, it can eat and drink.  With further development, technology can give more precise control by expanding the possible range of actions, ‚Äùsaid study lead author Bolu Ajiboye. <br><br>  Experiment with Nomad is part of the BrainGate clinical trial program conducted by a consortium of academic and medical institutions that evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the neuro-computer interface system in people with paralysis.  Other BrainGate research has shown that people can <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286234/">control the cursor on a computer screen</a> or a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/250902/">robotic hand</a> . <br><br>  Jonathan Miller, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, led a team of surgeons who implanted two 96-channel arrays of electrodes onto the surface of the brain.  They then implanted 36 electrodes of the FES systems, which revitalize the muscles in the upper and lower arm. <br><br>  Arrays record brain signals when Nomad represents the movement of his wrist or the hand as a whole.  The neurocomputer interface decodes the recorded information from the brain signals about the movements it intends to make, and then it is converted by the FES into electrical impulse patterns to control the electrical stimulation system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/959/fbd/eee/959fbdeee6d08992ef8cfef835cb20fb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Pulses sent through the FES electrodes activate the muscles that control the shoulders, elbows, and wrists.  To overcome gravity, which otherwise would not allow to raise and stretch a hand, Nomad uses mobile support hands, which is also under the control of his brain. <br><br>  Before implantation, Nomad first learned to use his brain signals to move his hands in virtual reality on a computer screen.  As Kochevar‚Äôs ability to move a virtual hand improved over the next four months of training, the researchers suggested that he would be able to control his arm and hand. <br><br>  Eight years of muscle atrophy required rehabilitation.  Researchers conducted cyclical procedures for electrical stimulation of Nomad‚Äôs hand and hand.  In 45 weeks, his strength, range of motion, and endurance improved significantly.  When he tried to move his hand, scientists set up stimulation patterns to develop his motor abilities. <br><br>  Now the patient can force each joint of the right hand to move individually.  Or, just thinking about eating or drinking, he leads the muscles into a consistent movement.  When he was asked to describe how he commanded the movement of his hands, Nomad replied: ‚ÄúI make her move without any special effort.  I just think about it, and it works. ‚Äù <br><br>  The researchers note that the achievement required for technology to be used outside the laboratory is not too far from reality.  Work is underway to create wireless implants for the brain, and researchers are also improving the decoding and stimulation schemes needed to more accurately define movements.  FES fully implantable systems have already been developed and are being tested in separate clinical trials. <br><br>  BrainGate research technology was originally developed at Brown University in the laboratory of John Donohue, now the founder of the Wyss Center for Bio- and Neuro-Engineering in Geneva.  Implantable recording electrodes, known as Utah arrays, were originally designed by Richard Norman, Professor Emeritus of Bioengineering at the University of Utah. <br><br>  doi: <a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30601-3/abstract">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30601-3</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403441/</a></p>
