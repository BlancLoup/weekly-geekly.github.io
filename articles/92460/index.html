      Business in this niche (with a smart approach and good organization of the business) is win-win.  Therefore, there are quite a few taxi companies.  But his successful organization requires a lot of time, effort, money, good software, smart employees and a clear strategy for action. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not difficult to list more successful taxi services in your city, because they are widely known and used by most of the inhabitants of your city.  What distinguishes them from less successful services? <br><br>  Many factors play a role here - from the ‚Äúbeautifulness‚Äù of the number to the technological effectiveness of the company's software.  It also plays the role of the approach to the business, namely the drivers and the rules of their work and, of course, the rules and level of work of dispatchers. <br><br>  However, the current trend in the development of the taxi service market is gaining users with new features.  The more a taxi service can give, the more professional he will do it - the more clients and their sympathies he will receive. <br><br>  In this review, we would like to tell you about how to use our technologies to organize the most modern, stylish and technologically advanced taxi service, creating for itself a profitable and interesting business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It will be about the so-called dealer program.  If you are familiar with our previous reviews, then you have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow our taxi model works - what are the pros and cons, and what unique opportunities it provides. <br><br>  Now imagine that you have the opportunity to open exactly the same taxi with all these features, but only under your own brand.  This is our Dealer program. <br><br>  Our dealer immediately receives a ready-made business on a turnkey basis (it <i>sounds simple, but we worked on creating this opportunity for a long time</i> ), namely, our own taxi connected to a common base.  The common base is the unification in one system of all partners, dealers and agents of the Taxolet taxi. <br><br><h4>  <b>What do we proudly give to the dealer?</b> </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  An application for drivers with which they will accept and execute applications. <br></td><td>  Application for customers, from which they can call a taxi without the dispatcher. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://taxolet.ru/img/instruction/driver_step3.png" alt="image"><br></td><td><img src="http://taxolet.ru/img/instruction/client_step6.png" alt="image"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Dispatcher program, with which you can send applications to the drivers application manually. <br></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6de/b6e/d2f/6deb6ed2f7fea4347ec806ad57552301.jpg"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Personal Cabinet dealer, with which you can manage your taxi and monitor the statistics of work. </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b0/555/5fe/8b05555fee6c1c9bd9dff37f13b2f908.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>  <b>What is the result of the work?</b> </h4><br>  All the dealer needs is to spread information about his taxi, attracting customers and drivers, as well as abide by the rules of the company and monitor the quality of the drivers.  The company takes all the technical and organizational aspects. <br><br>  <i>Thanks to the dispatching program, you can create an additional influx of applications into the system from the outside.</i> <i><br></i> <ol><li>  Taking applications by phone. </li><li>  Taking applications by SMS. </li><li>  With ICQ. </li><li>  Using the site or various online resources. </li></ol><br><h4>  <b>What makes our scheme different from the traditional business in a taxi?</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  The dealer gets into the hands of the most sophisticated and technological taxi service. </li><li>  The dealer can earn not only on their own, but also on other people's applications. </li><li>  It is not necessary to rent a room to organize a business </li><li>  It is not necessary to hire dispatchers and other workers. </li><li>  No need for expensive equipment. </li><li>  You do not need to be an expert in any modern technologies and study any special courses or complex computer programs. </li><li>  You do not need to purchase additional expensive licensed software. </li></ul><br>  <b>Our company assumes the following duties:</b> <br><ul><li>  Providing software and various web services. </li><li>  Development of new platforms and their introduction into the work of a taxi service. </li><li>  Maintain the security and integrity of all data. </li><li>  Financial accounting and timely payment of earnings. </li><li>  Development of additional services and services. </li><li>  Ensuring the smooth operation of all services and services. </li><li>  Full technical support and advice. </li><li>  Accounting, analysis and implementation of various requests, ideas and suggestions of the dealer. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>What is the profit?</b> </h4><br>  The essence of the dealer's earnings is very simple.  Becoming a dealer, you, as in the traditional taxi, earn on the cost of completed applications.  Each dealer determines the cost of the application in his taxi.  Our service only removes the commission for their services. <br><br>  In addition, you can <a href="http://taxolet.ru/partner.php%3Fdealer">order a free test drive of the Dealer Program</a> on our website.  We will be happy to help goal-oriented people to organize their own taxi and by all means help with its development. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05b/536/c51/05b536c51275837c9ea626badcbeb227.png" alt="image"></td><td>  More complete information can be <a href="">obtained from the dealer manual</a> . </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92460/</a></p>
