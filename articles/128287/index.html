Samsung Netbook Review 305U1A-A03</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The Samsung NC10 with Wimax, which served me faithfully for two years, has already begun to get its braking effect.  My patience is exhausted, and I began to look for a more productive alternative. <br><br>  Main requirements: small size (frequent business trips and, therefore, netbook form factor), acceptable netbook performance, low price (NC10 took for 12500 p.). <br><br>  It was decided to abandon Wimax: the experience of using Yota, the size of the coverage and the quality of communication, along with the new YoT tariffs, showed that Wimax, by and large, is useless pampering for me.

      I began to look closely at what is now on the market, and in the end, my choice fell on the Samsung 305U1A-A03. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9c0ed1e/61a28081/5a02a7c6/996c7a9d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, first of all, netbooks on the Atom platform in conjunction with Ion2 came to mind.  But then I found out about the AMD Fusion family with an integrated Ati Radeon 6310 GPU. I will not say what is better and more productive.  Just for myself, I realized that I want to take a netbook on this platform. <br><br>  The choice is not yet special: ASUS 1215B, which has the largest screen among "classmates" (a full half an inch more), but inborn generic problems (for example, glitches with a touchpad).  This is solved by self-sizing using electrical tape, or sending immediately after the purchase straight to the service center. <br><br>  I will not list the remaining alternatives (there are <a href="">not so many of them</a> ), I‚Äôll just say that, apparently, the best option on this platform is <a href="">HP PAVILION dm1-3201er</a> : it has a lot of attractive (4 gigabytes of RAM, hard for 500 gigs, and working not at the usual laptop speed of 5400 rev / s, but at the usual ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù 7200 rev / s, Windows 7 Home Premium), but the only thing that bothered and stopped is the average price for Yandex at 17635 rubles . <br><br>  And recently, an offer from Samsung codenamed 305U1A-A03 and priced at less than 15 thousand rubles appeared on the market.  I decided to remain loyal to the brand, although I choose, as a rule, in terms of functionality / price / quality, and not on the basis of commitment to a particular brand.  But here it was just the case when the attractive price coincided with the requirements and wishes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/25dbbf89/52b7692b/efd4d6de/768a5361.jpg"><br><br>  So, the main characteristics: <br><br>  <b>Processor</b> : E-350 1600 MHz <br>  Processor Code: E-350 <br>  The number of processor cores: 2 <br>  L2 cache size: 1 MB <br><br>  <b>Memory</b> : 4096 MB DDR3 1333 MHz <br><br>  <b>Display</b> : 11.6 inches, 1366x768, widescreen <br>  Screen type: <b>matte</b> (indisputable plus in our time!) <br>  Screen backlight: LED <br>  Graphics chipset: ATI Radeon HD 6310M <br><br>  <b>Hard Drive</b> : 320 GB Serial ATA <br>  Hard disk rotation speed: 5400 rpm <br><br>  And: <br>  Gigabit LAN, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11n, USB 2.0x3, VGA (D-Sub), HDMI, microphone input, audio / headphone output, SD card reader, 1.3M webcam. <br><br>  Installed OS: Windows 7 Home Basic 64-bit (I am glad that it is not Starter). <br><br>  Here are the results of evaluating the performance index in Windows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ea6382c2/dd962b68/ee22c23f/71bbc38f.jpg"><br><br>  Battery capacity: 8850 mAh (on many sites for some reason they write 4000 - they copy it, it seems, from the old review, where, apparently, they looked at some kind of pre-sale sample). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6d9a3488/6c247adb/a417f9b2/1e0fafb8.jpg"><br><br>  I will note the peculiarity of the network connector: it partially folds up (I don‚Äôt know how practical it is, it‚Äôs a concern that it may break off in time). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/834e31eb/c9615e5a/d4c5e329/c0b6d465.jpg"><br><br>  Netbook looks businesslike strictly, has a solid appearance.  The surface is either semi-gloss, or semi-glossy (compared to the NC10, the glossy doesn‚Äôt turn its tongue to name).  However, the fingerprints are quite noticeable, although it does not bother me at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2141bb77/e307260d/473fa969/9770ad4d.jpg"><br><br>  The netbook has a wide touchpad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/56a91072/a1fd61bc/6e1165e9/74dad5f8.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung remained true to itself and retained the possibility of easy access to RAM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0a1f9a0c/472ae348/01ee032d/ae856095.jpg"><br><br>  However, as I understood from the reviews, there is only one memory slot.  The maximum that can be done is to replace the 4-gig bar with the 8-gig bar.  Although they say that there is not a lot of RAM (and I agree with it), but in this case such an operation loses its meaning (costs will exceed the effect achieved, if there will be any). <br><br>  Keyboard island type, large, convenient to type, I liked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/560cc3f6/3e217dcd/ede0ed22/4dc26532.jpg"><br><br>  The only thing when I put Punto Switcher, I found that the Pause / Break key is missing.  While I am at a loss and I think, on what combination of keys to hang the switching of the text typed in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù layout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e1967d1c/5907ba7b/81ec688d/f323b159.jpg"><br><br>  Compared with a 10-inch netbook, the object of review is not much different in size: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/565e58e1/97d9aa9d/47a8bfcb/3797d163.jpg"><br><br>  And now a fly in the ointment: during acceptance, when I began to insert the battery, I discovered this unpleasant thing under the battery compartment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dffd5051/e8483f63/f8c342f0/25495c72.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like this is soldered from the back of the motherboard.  She is shyly covered with a film that is poorly adhered and bubbles on the ledges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c9a5e4f1/53fb30de/a7cafb2a/c9b24d99.jpg"><br><br>  It remains to guess what it is: a feature, or a marriage.  I hope, representatives of Samsung who read Habr, will help me in a solution.  In the store, where he took, they could not give a clear answer in the complaint department.  I understand that ‚Äúit does not affect the speed,‚Äù but I am afraid that over time it will only get worse, the film under the battery will become flaky even more from the temperature.  In general, the positive impression of the purchase was very blurred. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br><br>  Netbook has a nice, strict (business) appearance.  As stated by the manufacturer, the body is made of aluminum.  It was built on a fairly productive platform, you can view HD content, many even <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D17:43673">manage to play</a> quite demanding games.  However, when I started watching videos on youtube in full HD, I could not achieve hardware decoding, the video slowed down.  So, I still have to delve into the settings. <br><br>  Unfortunately, to decide whether I am satisfied with the purchase, until I can (time will tell).  All because of the above problem with the battery compartment.  In general, although the netbook seems to be assembled quite soundly, I still found a slight backlash of the top cover in the closed state, and the solution with the Ethernet connector, I repeat, raises questions about its durability. <br><br>  However, if you think about the price, characteristics and appearance (as well as, for example, the presence of a 100% marriage at ASUS 1215B) give the right to call the Samsung 305U1A-A03 the best choice among competitors. <br><br>  PS Interesting links: <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D17:44302">Samsung 305U1A-A03: almost perfect netbook with a matte screen on AMD Brazos platform</a> , <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D17:42046">netbooks on AMD 2011 mobile platform - Brazos (Fusion)</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128287/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128287/</a></p>
