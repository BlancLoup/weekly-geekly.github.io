      The main idea that Hastvit tried to convey was that crowdfunding is not begging: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt ask for money, you invite people to become part of your project.‚Äù  Crowdfunding is co-creation, and the main task of the authors is to involve the target audience in order for the campaign to become entertaining for both parties: it would be interesting for shareholders to follow the project‚Äôs dynamics and feel part of it, and creators are interested in communicating with the audience and getting priceless from it feedback  For example, for its ‚ÄúOlympic City‚Äù photo project, Hastvit and a partner announced a vote on the topic: ‚ÄúWhich city that hosted the Olympics should be included in your photo project?‚Äù.  The first place, oddly enough, was taken by Moscow with a large margin, the second - Berlin and the third - Tokyo.  And this is one of the reasons for Hastvit‚Äôs visit to Moscow. <br>  The second topical thesis: ‚Äúcrowdfunding is not magic!‚Äù, As many think ... This is not a magical act and not a generator of easy money, you need to work hard, proving the uniqueness, consistency and necessity of your idea, project.  Goals must be modest. <br><br>  Hastvit also noted an important component of the crowdfunding system - the credibility of the authors of the projects.  ‚ÄúPerhaps this is what the Russian lacks?‚Äù  There should be established, recognized artists, artists who would use crowdfunding to implement their projects, then things will go in Russia.  We need to create a critical mass of interest so that people see the projects that have taken place. ‚Äù <br><br>  On Skype, Charles Adler spoke about the trends in the world of crowdfunding, and how the nature of projects has changed over the past three years.  Adler noted that ‚Äúproject authors do not always understand what cultural mechanisms are involved in crowdfunding,‚Äù and that ‚Äúnow project authors are increasingly analyzing their risks on Kickstarter rather than looking for like-minded people,‚Äù as was originally intended.  And as it seemed to us, this is not particularly pleasing to him, since all the co-founders of Kickstarter are creative people and are engaged in various types of art. <br><br>  At the end of the lecture, Gary answered questions from the audience.  We learned that Gary is a big fan of David Lynch, that he does not watch television and does not understand why he is needed at all, and why he needs a distribution system, if he has Internet access and can build relationships directly.  And also that ‚Äúgood graphic design is my weakness, the project immediately looks more real!‚Äù.  Speaking about the future of crowdfunding, Hastvit stressed that he can solve many problems, including social ones.  It is good that more and more platforms for public funding appear in the world, as people have the opportunity to promote projects in their own country: ‚ÄúI wish you success.  The main thing is not to give up! ‚Äù <br><br>  The display of Hastvit‚Äôs films ‚ÄúObjectified‚Äù and ‚ÄúUrbanized‚Äù will take place on November 21 at 19.00 and 21.00 in the Polytechnic Museum‚Äôs lecture hall. </hh></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159541/</a></p>
