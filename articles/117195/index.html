Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been changes that began to appear even before the crisis. <br>  What are these trends?  But: <br>  - since 2007, more and more investors began to demand that startups have a service station in a team and in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equity</a> , <br>  - since 2007, funds began to neglect small transactions, the average investment of the early stages increased from $ 800-900k to $ 1.3m, and then even higher, <br>  - the cost of software development began to fall due to the availability of ready-made libraries and a large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open source</a> solutions, <br>  - a media ecosystem has been formed in the industry, which allows you to get customers without resorting to large infusions in advertising, but simply by finding an interesting problem, <br>  - with the development of social networks, it became possible to attract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_marketing">traffic from social networks</a> , with a successful start of the project, it turns out to be very cheap, <br>  - the solvency of the Internet population has grown and a large number of tools have appeared that allow you to collect money from customers, <br>  - the presence of various advertising tools (from contextual advertising to traditional banner networks and affiliate programs) makes it easy to convert traffic into money.  Entire industries appeared in the States in which ‚Äútraffic = money‚Äù works, <br>  - the trend of creating credit card funded startups is developing more and more. <br><br>  What we have on the investor side of the field? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Investors, realizing that the value of capital for most startups in the early stages is very conditional (see above), began to go into the later rounds of investment, not associated with development, but with access to the market or increased sales.  In this field, the number of startups that went through the early stages and showed the market demand for the product is traditionally an order of magnitude smaller.  There was competition from capital, which explains the transcendental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-money_valuation">pre-money valuations</a> for <a href="http://dennydov.blogspot.com/2011/03/blog-post_6937.html">successful startups</a> . <br>  On the other hand, the cost of developing and launching products fell, and entrepreneurs began to realize that sharing part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)">equity</a> for money, when you can invest your little money, and the rest is not logical to close the founders' working time.  Thus, the requirements for the angels sharply increased.  Not so much, and not only money, began to be demanded from the angel, but something more - what we call advicing, coaching, mentoring.  Something that can not be bought for money, but that can help a startup.  The category of such angels is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_angel">superangles</a> .  They put down their philosophy, which can be described as ‚Äúthe investor is not able to evaluate the project - only the market can do it.  Any project that meets the basic requirements is worth getting a small investment to try to enter the market. ‚Äù  Such investors make many small investments in companies that are selected.  One of them is <a href="http://dennydov.blogspot.com/2010/08/dave-mcclure.html">Dave McClure</a> , who has made his foundation of <a href="http://500startups.com/">500 startups with a</a> size of only $ 30 million, which implies a small investment.  The fund exists in the form of an incubator, with which 120 (!!!) mentors cooperate - the best entrepreneurs, experts and investors in the industry. <br>  Most of these superangel are registered in the <a href="http://angel.co/">Algel List</a> , through which they receive most of the projects. <br>  According to this model, in one way or another, several structures operate on the market.  In America, this is <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">YCombinator</a> , which began to lose its appeal in the face of competition with <a href="http://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/">PlugAndPlay</a> , Ron Conway and <a href="http://www.svangel.com/">SV Angels are</a> working according to this scheme.  There are such structures in New York.  An incubator that degenerated into <a href="http://www.founderinstitute.com/">The Founders Institute's</a> training program, which went franchising around the world.  In Europe, it is the famous <a href="http://seedcamp.com/">SeedCamp</a> .  In Russia, this is <a href="http://glavstart.ru/">Glavstart</a> , which is trying to use the YCombinator model.  In Ukraine, we launched <a href="http://www.growthup.com/">GrowthUP</a> , which does not make investments, but free of charge (we exist at the expense of investors) provides access to a training program and mentors (we have a large number of start-ups from Russia and Belarus).  Here is an <a href="http://blog.shedd.us/321987608/">almost complete list of</a> such programs around the world. <br><br>  What conclusions can an entrepreneur draw from all that is written above? <br>  1.

Build a team that can make and run a prototype, and get the first users to attract investments. <br>  3. Communicate with investors at the earliest stages, but not to get money, but to get feedback - most of them easily share their thoughts and experiences.

Try to use the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/116963/">Customer Development</a> methodology, which proved to be one of the best for building a successful startup. <br>  5.
