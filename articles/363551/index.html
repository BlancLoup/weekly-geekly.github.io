      Fortunately or not, the minds of the guests were confused by today's news <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242062/">about Kinopoisk, which is starting to show movies online</a> .  Asya Melkumova, a spokesman for Yandex, said that it was most likely a leak from one of the partner online cinemas.  The official announcement of the movie on "Kinopoisk" will take place later. <br><br>  At 20:06 Roman <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kukutz/" class="user_link">kukutz</a> Ivanov, head of the Yandex Browser, went up to the stage. <br><br>  The events unfolded quickly: in 10 minutes three people took turns on the stage.  A few common words, and, finally, the chief designer of the new ‚ÄúYandex browser‚Äù began to talk about how they represent the browser of the future. <br><br>  The general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new approach: the user doesn‚Äôt need to see the structure of the web, know the inside of sites, remember urls and feel how data packets run through networks.  Immediately he needs the result.  This idea is not so new: from the very first version of its browser, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù has already started hiding URLs (I'm not used to this, by the way).  But perhaps this is the case when an idea, implemented in part, does not work at all.  And now Yandex has resolutely advanced further. <br><br>  So: the new Yandex browser is even smaller than the browser interface, more than the web itself.  Minus the top panel - 20% more Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd5/7ee/411/bd57ee411fe54a4c9b5d759d21f0caa4.JPG"><br>  <i>New and old interface</i> <br><br>  Tabs have moved down - closer to the taskbar;  tabs from one site are grouped together. <br><br>  The browser start page went the way of Bing: Yandex made a lot of beautiful pictures (or, more precisely, gifs, because they are animated) throughout Russia, which can be used as a background.  Or put your option. <br><br>  A smart search string loads information as you type a query: facts from Wikipedia, location on a Yandex map, answers to questions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/481/313/b00481313bd6498da7e666d321446053.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d79/ee0/7bb/d79ee07bbfb3440f8a8c8da3357baa22.png"><br><br>  A gift for business: Yandex-search groups information about a company in the form of a company card based on popular requests: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e08/d95/950/e08d95950959402ab35a88225185c2ff.png"><br><br>  Knocking the pathos of the moment, the designer of the new browser entertains the audience with a buggy presentation.  It turns out that at the moment when they showed how scary urla looks in the modern web, the music from ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù was supposed to sound.  So he said after the slide ended. <br><br>  Showed a new browser logo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/048/122/86b/04812286b086466181581a89dc8cd9ea.png"><br><br>  If only they had come up with a new logo with it.  To write constantly ‚ÄúYandex-browser‚Äù is tiring, but simply ‚Äúbrowser‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù for obvious reasons will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/176/505/2ab/1765052abfeb4815bcb949ce0bffc388.png"><br><br>  The alpha version of the Yandex Yandex Browser has already been used in Yandex for several months.  Now <a href="https://browser.yandex.ru/future/">everyone</a> can download <a href="https://browser.yandex.ru/future/">it</a> . <br><br>  This is the main part of the presentation is over.  Only half an hour - very humane. <br><br><h5>  First impressions </h5><br>  In the presentation demo zone in the browser, a couple of tabs with Habr√© are already carefully opened: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/f8b/b7d/7b9f8bb7d81141fd8cd9681bb28df254.JPG"><br><br>  Browser start page is animated.  It makes no sense to describe, it is necessary to see for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/a96/8c4/bbca968c4a4c4995b8350022e5db43d7.png"><br><br>  Not ‚Äúwithout an interface‚Äù, as you can see, did not do: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/8f7/748/e9b8f7748e3a4f7e9653cd460cf462c7.png"><br><br>  - at the top of the line with the title, by clicking with which you can go to the start page with a smart search field, at the bottom - translucent, but still as a separate field - the tab bar is located.  According to Konstantin Gorsky, art director of the Yandex Browser, this is a forced solution: if the tabs were on their own, then this could be confused with the interfaces of some sites where they can close controls. <br><br>  However, this is fixable: the browser API allows webmasters to disable this panel for their sites.  You can already see the tabs on top of the content without unnecessary givers using the example of ‚ÄúYandex cards‚Äù opened in the new browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/e1c/b44/ab2e1cb44c3944dbab9caa9b2a9bac28.png"><br><br>  The settings page has been redesigned, but the good old structure of Chromium is still recognized: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/599/531/0b4/5995310b42ed49efb46a106d0238d1be.png"><br><br>  During the presentation, I noticed that all the screenshots on the screen are in the Mac interface, and as an example of the site, the main page of the apple.com was first shown.  Designers of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù explain this by the fact that they themselves use ‚ÄúPoppies‚Äù.  But that's not the point, but the fact that the Yandex browser mac really looks and works more elegantly.  For example, in OS X in full screen mode, the browser is stretched along with controls, while in the Windows version it stretches the page content, hiding browser controls - this is the standard logic of operating systems, but as a result, in Windows, full-screen mode is less convenient to use.  However, this is still only an alpha version, so that changes for the better are still possible. <br><br><h4>  Yandex and anonymity </h4><br>  Already after the main program, I spoke briefly with <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kukutz/" class="user_link">kukutz</a> about another topic that did not sound at the presentation, but relevant in connection with the topic of Internet surfing in principle: the attitude of Yandex to anonymity and various technologies of anonymizing the surfing of users in the network.  As Roman said, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù constantly thinks about this subject, weighing the pros and cons.  So far, the arguments "against": the lack of mass demand for such a service and the quite obvious policy of the state to control the activities of users on the Internet outweigh the arguments "for": protection against unscrupulous activity of providers (such as selling information about the behavior of users of advertising networks), protection against hacker attacks in open networks, etc.  There is also the problem of trust: Roman noticed that even the most secure service raises questions for the one who provides it.  In general, as <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kukutz/" class="user_link">kukutz</a> said: "We do not have a concrete solution and answer with which we could enter the market." <br><br>  That's all.  Farewell view of the already empty hall from the point of view of the presenter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/000/cb4/a61/000cb4a614c94338aec6f9e7cead50e7.png"><br><br>  Thanks for reading. <br><br>  PS "Yandex" laid out his presentation in the form of a post on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/244343/">habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/244343</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363551/</a></p>
