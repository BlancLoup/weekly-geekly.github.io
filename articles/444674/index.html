In 2019, the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus models with concise names, new screen formats and improved performance became the logical continuation of the Xperia XA series.  Also as the flagship, these models were presented in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress exhibition, and most importantly, recently went on sale in the Russian market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe use Sony‚Äôs mid-range innovations to make new technologies as accessible as possible,‚Äù said Mitsuya Kishida, president of Sony Mobile Communications.  ‚ÄúSmartphones with a new widescreen display of 21: 9 with an elegant and sophisticated design are great in the hand and just made for entertainment.‚Äù </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/ig/yk/reigyknljcaolnf-zbgulanxpaa.jpeg"><br><br>  Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus smartphones have received new widescreen displays with an aspect ratio of 21: 9 for efficient work with several applications at the same time, displaying more content, shooting video with cinematic proportions and watching movies without black bars.  The quality of the screen at altitude.  Smartphones use IPS matrices with maximum viewing angles, accurate color reproduction and high contrast, as well as a large margin of brightness for readability of content outdoors on a sunny day.  The display resolution is Full HD +, with 6 and 6.5 inch diagonals, you get sufficient pixel density for any tasks, be it games, watching movies and TV shows, editing photos or editing video.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/g5/bz/ctg5bzl-as5dicc10mv7ovfspme.jpeg"><br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting the support of multi-screen split-screen mode, which has gained convenient access through the company's side menu Side Sense.  Due to the proportions of the 21: 9 screen, divided in equal shares of the application on the screen are better displayed and contain more content than if the division occurs into squares or rectangles with landscape orientation, as when using displays 18: 9 and 16: 9.  In addition, on the Xperia 10 or Xperia 10 Plus display, you can split the screen so that one application is displayed in the classic 16: 9 format (for example, it can be a music video) and there is still room for the second application (say, in the messenger). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/ch/uj/rxchujwvyra4n-8z3tuwp4ega9o.jpeg"><br><br>  The new dual camera in the Sony Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus supports the concept of the screen and offers video shooting in 4K resolution and with an aspect ratio of 21: 9.  Ideal for those who dream of camera work, but so far ready only for experiments in mobile format.  In Xperia 10, 13 megapixel and 5 megapixel modules are used, and in Xperia 10 Plus, a bundle of 12 megapixel and 8 megapixel matrices are used.  The quality of shooting and the functionality of the software fully meet the expectations of users.  Photos and videos are obtained with rich colors, excellent contrast and detail.  In the younger model, the second camera provides portrait mode operation and serves for a spectacular background blur, while in the older one it allows you to take portraits and shoot with a double optical zoom.  A separate plus for recording high-quality video is the SteadyShot electronic stabilization system, which helps reduce camera shaking when shooting in motion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2x/oj/9w/2xoj9woy7ewpob7u2ke9jndfiyc.jpeg"><br><br>  In terms of design, new smartphones have received ergonomic metal cases, and the front has reliable protection with Corning Gorilla Glass 5.  Of interesting also worth noting the return of the scanner prints on the side of the smartphone.  True, now it is made a separate block (and not built into the power button) and adds a zest to its glossy finish when looking at the smartphone from the side.  This layout does not degrade the user experience.  Sony Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus users do not have to press the power button first, and then the scanner, because touching the sensor automatically activates the screen and unlocks the smartphone after recognition of the fingerprint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ov/x8/zd/ovx8zdq2uzdakdavg5bwizahfiu.jpeg"><br><br>  All other Xperia smartphone chips are also in place.  For example, there is support for Sony High-Resolution Audio and the LDAC codec, with which you can listen to music in its original sound, even through wireless headphones.  It also uses the Sony Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE HX) technology, which automatically improves compressed audio files to almost the quality of high resolution, restoring the subtleties of the original recordings and simulating live sound.  Smart Stamina's algorithms provide a long time without recharging, and battery life is increased through the use of Battery Care technology and Qnovo adaptive charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/_d/8t/po_d8trpcagolow-bqdaym6yejc.jpeg"><br><br>  As for performance, the Xperia 10 runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 mobile platform with 3 GB of RAM, 64 GB storage and support for memory cards.  The battery capacity is 2870 mAh.  Xperia 10 Plus uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 platform, 4 GB of operational and 64 GB of constantly party with expansion microSD cards.  The battery has a capacity of 3000 mAh.  Both models are running the operating system Android 9.0 Pie.  Buyers can choose the colors of the case that best suit their style; this year Sony designers are offering dark blue, black, silver and gold.  The cost of the Sony Xperia 10 is 24,990 rubles, and the Xperia 10 Plus can be bought for 29,990 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444674/</a></p>
