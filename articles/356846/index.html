  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The camera operator is not a male profession. Women in the frame too distract</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In many cities of the world, authorities install a large number of outdoor security cameras and road cameras.  The police are pleased: street crime is decreasing, detection is increasing, and the traffic cameras also automatically bring millions of dollars to the city budget in the form of fines.  In some cities, they specifically create ‚Äúspeed traps‚Äù and put video-recording cameras there to catch transit drivers unfamiliar with the local specifics of speed limits in certain areas.  For example, in the small town of Woodworth (Louisiana), such high-speed traps bring <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/08/10/the-woman-who-spent-six-years-fighting-a-traffic-stop">61% of the city budget</a> .  On the city <a href="http://townofwoodworth.com/">website, the</a> button for paying fines is central.  In other cities of Louisiana road video cameras bring <a href="https://app.lla.state.la.us/PublicReports.nsf/3F1E2F36EA7402D2862572F300630CC1/%2524FILE/00001155.pdf">up to 87% of the city budget</a> . <br><br>  Fines for drivers are good, but you still need to keep track of pedestrians. <br><br>  The urban community of Lo Barnechea in the Chilean city of Santiago is not far behind the world trend.  The mayor of the municipality Felipe Guevara (Felipe Guevara) decided that the city necessarily needs a system of mass video surveillance from balloons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://derechosdigitales.tumblr.com/post/126920749611/alcalde-de-lo-barnechea-admite-que-el-sistema-de">An article</a> in the local press does not provide a clear understanding of why the video surveillance system was deployed precisely on aerostats.  Perhaps this is due to the mountainous nature of the terrain, so that ground cameras cannot cover a large area.  Sky cameras can track individuals from a distance of more than a kilometer.

      Whatever the reason, Felipe Guevara clearly realized that mass observation of the population has several advantages, but recognized a serious drawback.  ‚ÄúThe mayor explained that in surveillance systems in Argentina, camera operators use cameras to monitor women in the streets,‚Äù writes La Segunda newspaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a01/2dd/043/a012dd04370bb8b5ecd52868195dcfc8.png"><br><br>  However, such a trifle does not prevent the implementation of a population observation system from balloons.  The mayor did not even think of accepting this fact as evidence that video surveillance systems will always be used inappropriately for illegal surveillance of people.  But even Edward Snowden <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230339/">told</a> how, when monitoring Internet traffic, young NSA employees share with each other photos of pretty naked girls from webcams. <br><br>  The NSA then conducted an internal audit, which revealed cases of abuse of working position.  Several NSA employees admitted that they were monitoring their ex-girls for their personal interests. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYoung guys of 18-22 years old work in the ranks,‚Äù Snowden explained.  ‚ÄúSuddenly, they are sent to a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they have access to your private records.‚Äù  During the working day they encounter something completely unrelated to their work in any sense.  For example, intimate photos of a girl in a sexy pose.  But the photos are extremely attractive.  So what should they do?  They turn around in a chair and show a colleague.  He says: ‚ÄúWow, that's cool.  Send Bill a look. ‚Äù  And then Bill sends to George, and George sends to Tom.  And sooner or later, all these people met the girl‚Äôs secrets.  This is never reported in reports.  No one even knows about this, because the audit of those systems is very bad.  The fact is that your private photos, private videos, intimate moments recordings are pulled out of the communication flow and transferred to the government without any special authorization and without special need, in violation of your rights.  Why is it in the state database? ‚Äù <br><br>  Snowden confirmed that he had seen this many times.  Different employees encounter this more often, less often, depending on the task being performed.  ‚ÄúThis is considered an added benefit of working in the tracking department,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Chilean Mayor Felipe Guevara proposed another solution to the problem: <b>to hire only women</b> because they are ‚Äúless inclined to voyeurism and more restrained than men‚Äù. <br><br>  Well, this is an interesting offer. <br><br>  Let's not question the thesis that women love to spy on others.  But having such an opportunity, the representatives of the weaker sex will still be difficult to resist the temptation.  For example, find out what the husband is doing now.  And you will not envy those husbands whose wives got a job working as camera operators on aerostats. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356846/</a></p>
