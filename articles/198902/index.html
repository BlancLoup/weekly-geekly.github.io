The beginnings were enthusiastic, without funding. <br><br><h5>  Cool startups </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fe/283/bb9/2fe283bb93179ca0bcbff7ecb883b817.jpg">

      The product is not important, it is important that he is now a cool startup.  You are there, they say, do and work, and I flaunt it.  He goes to parties, writes articles in his blog, makes videos about startups.  How to be a cool startup?  How to choose a company name?  Ask him!  After a couple of months, disappointment comes: he seems to be a cool start-up, but the matter is not moving.  But nothing.  He will find acquaintances in the crowd who also do not move and calm down. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Experienced </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/b8d/cfb/8c0b8dcfb823bfbb3e6b62f0e724e1a8.jpg"><br>  There are many projects behind him in the role of a performer, but in (his) team he does nothing - he wants to command and observe how others work.  He does not always come to the meetings, he believes that he no longer needs to work - his experience should fit in as a contribution to the work.  In a couple of months, disappointment is coming, they say, it‚Äôs worth it or it‚Äôs still not working!  Or begins the denial of ideas, I told you - it will not work. <br><br><h5>  I want everything, but there is no time </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71e/f14/fb5/71ef14fb5c785cb332d0e85157c76520.jpg"><br>  Ready for hours to discuss the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to do and how to promote.  Takes the job, but in the end a lot of result does not work.  No time, after all, and other projects scored.  Yes, and school, work, family waiting.  There is no disappointment, because the person hopes to still have time for everything in the future and, as a last resort, to finish it alone. <br><br><h5>  Teach me </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f4/3dc/617/5f43dc61770ccb1c631e95fafdaa4a12.jpg"><br>  Soul team and tester in combination.  Ready to test, chat and learn, but not independently, with a mentor.  Not with that experienced one, but who will explain everything with examples and show where to read what.  The project is interesting, but there is no initiative, I want to learn, but not independently.  But the problem is that there‚Äôs really no time to teach him, in the end, disappointment is coming, they say, don‚Äôt learn! <br><br><h5>  Avid techie </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/320/4bb/26a/3204bb26a81f3c276e6ec7d1099fcfb9.jpg"><br>  Begins to thoroughly learn the basics of the basics.  The study lasts a very long time, stackoverflow is filled with questions to which no one knows the answer, followed by deliberation and preparation.  Give him enough time - it will be a walking encyclopedia and an intelligent member of the team (unless of course you quickly change technology).  Good for long projects.  Since the technology itself is interesting, and not so much a startup as such, frustrations occur in the selected technologies.  It is better to prerecipitate everything in Java, but then, someday.  First learn ... <br><br><h5>  Creator </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/9a7/2cd/ed39a72cd6a8626025fb5ad057a3c559.jpg"><br>  He does everything diligently, especially under inspiration, he can move mountains, and quickly.  He appreciates his work, because he creates masterpieces from scratch.  Dislikes all there economists, marketers and other non-creators.  Dislikes if someone touched his code.  Frustrated if you have to change something or redo it in the prototype.  Like, it was necessary to immediately think everything and do it once. <br><br><h5>  Procrastinator </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/9f0/a12/7fe9f0a12fcfd03de58463054bf75b3a.jpg"><br>  It also turns mountains at the beginning, just like the creator.  But at some point a fracture occurs, he gets bored and he doesn‚Äôt seem to leave, but does nothing.  The reasons for inaction are easily invented.  Especially if the task is important and all remind him of it, procrastination progresses especially rapidly.  During such periods, he actively hides, does not come to meetings.  He becomes frustrated and offended when a task is taken from him.  Tomorrow he would finish it. <br><br><h5>  Hard worker </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db8/df7/e48/db8df7e489f0bdb805afb82835a21b0b.jpg"><br>  He constantly thinks about the product, licks the details and chases after everyone.  Himself clutches at everything.  Motor teams.  Why nobody works?  Disappointed in the team, supposedly not everyone is as sick with the project as he is.  Then offended at all for a long time and finds out the reasons for the failure. <br><br>  Of course, a person may have several of these qualities at once. <br><br>  And what types of characters did you meet in your beginnings? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198902/</a></p>
