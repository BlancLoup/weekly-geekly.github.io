Immediately, you will notice that the ETERNUS storage system family today has the following groups: <br><br>  DX - disk arrays <br>  JX - just JBOD (disk shelf) <br>  LT - tape libraries <br>  CS - Virtual Tape Libraries and Disk Libraries <a name="habracut"></a>

      In the group ETERNUS DX there are arrays of primary, secondary and senior level.  The number of digits in the model also indicates the ‚Äúslope‚Äù of the array.  DX60 / 80/90 Arrays - Entry Level Arrays <br>  DX410 / 440 - mid level <br>  The DX8700 is a high-end enterprise level array. <br><br>  In addition, you can often see, for example, the name ETERNUS DX440 S2.  Here S2 is the number of the array generation.  This is the second most recent generation of ETERNUS disk arrays from the list of those released onto the European market.  Just until 2009, ETERNUS arrays were not in principle supplied to the European / American markets, while being the technological leader in the market of Japan and a number of Asian countries, where the only competitor who could argue with Fujitsu was and is Hitachi.  Actually, it is these two vendors that together account for more than 50% of the total SKD market in the region.  So, in the spring of 2009, the Fujitsu management made a strategic decision to bring their own disk systems to the European markets, which were called ETERNUS DX S1.  Prior to this, about 20 years, the FUJITSU skid was called ETERNUS, but had a different model numbering. <br><br>  In fact, in Russia / CIS / Europe, the introduction of a completely new brand in the market was launched.  And this is despite the fact that at this point Fujitsu had more than 40 years of history in developing and manufacturing its own disk storage systems.  In Fujitsu laboratories, more than 1,000 engineers have been developing their own disk systems.  Actually, this largely explains the fact that a rather large market share was occupied in Europe for 3 years.  ETERNUS is not a startup that appeared ‚Äúout of nothing‚Äù as the fruit of the friendly work of several like-minded friends, but the result of many years of work by a huge group of developers in a high-tech company. <br><br>  Historically, in the 1960s, FUJITSU actively began to produce and offer its own mainframes to the market, and then disk storage systems were needed.  The corporation created a department that develops its own disk systems, and the result of the work of this department was the first FUJITSU disk systems, released over 40 years ago.  The figure shows the general history of own ETERNUS disk systems over the past decades. <br><br>  Beginning in the late 1990s, along with storage for connecting only to mainframes, interfaces for connecting to open systems began to appear.  First of all, at that time, of course, to UNIX-systems.  What immediately catches the eye when looking at the drawing: the main difference from the huge number of today's producers is the lack of acquisitions and ‚Äúoccasional purchases‚Äù, which we have often seen on the market in the last decade. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c62/fe2/dec/c62fe2decb124b497da8249a1363cfc8.png"><br><br>  In today's product line, of course, several disk arrays, only the flagship is drawn in the figure.  But at the same time, all of today's product line is the result of many years of work by a single group of developers, and not the fruit of spontaneous purchases on the market, with the goal of including hiding current losses ‚Äúto correct financial statements‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161145/</a></p>
