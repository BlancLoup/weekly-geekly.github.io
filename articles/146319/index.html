  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does Google search change</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rinat Safin, Head of the Moscow Search Quality Team <br><br>  The world around us is constantly changing.  The amount of information available to humanity is growing, and users every day expect more from computers.  While working on Google search, we try so that they can find everything that they didn‚Äôt even think of looking yesterday. <br><br>  In order to improve the quality of the search, we annually conduct more than 50 thousand experiments and run more than 500 changes in search algorithms.  Some of them are changes in the interface that can be easily noticed.  And many simply influence the order of the results so that the link to the page that contains the information you need is first and you find what you need as quickly as possible.  We have a whole team of search quality.  Each change is thoroughly tested and discussed.  If you want, you can even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJtRJXnXgE-A">take a look at how such discussions take place</a> .

      For the first 120 days of 2012, we made more than 150 additions to our search algorithms!  I will talk about some of them, which, in my opinion, are the most important for the Russian-language search. <br><br>  In February of this year, we made our search <a href="http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/2012/05/blog-post.html">more local</a> .  Now, for example, residents of Kazan will receive more information from their city in search results when they are looking for an institution located nearby.  If we are talking about ordering a taxi, then it will be a taxi in Kazan. <br><br>  Much attention is paid to the fight against <a href="http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/2011/02/google_10.html">search spam</a> .  Over the past year, several algorithms (such as <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2011/08/high-quality-sites-algorithm-launched.html">Panda</a> and <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/another-step-to-reward-high-quality.html">Penguin</a> ) have been launched and improved to combat low-quality sites in search results.  We also noticed that users are very annoyed when they cannot find information on the page due to the abundance of advertising, which sometimes just overflows the site.  Pages on which the user sees only advertising on the first screen and does not see useful content, the <a href="http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/2012/01/page-layout-algorithm-improvement.html">new algorithm</a> removes from the top positions in the search results. <br><br>  It is no secret that some websites borrow material from others.  We have launched a number of changes that give preference in the search results to those sites on which original materials are posted. <br><br>  Many users need to learn something and get quick access to information while on the road or at a meeting.  For smartphones and tablets, which are increasingly used in such cases, we have special applications that make mobile search much more convenient.  You can, for example, just say your query instead of typing it.  For iOS, there is the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-mobile-app/id284815942%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1">Google Search App</a> , and for Android, <a href="http://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.googlequicksearchbox">Google Search</a> .  We are constantly improving them and releasing new versions. <br><br>  It is important for us that users are confident in the integrity of information about their search queries.  Recently, for those who have logged into their account, Google Search works via <a href="http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/2012/03/blog-post.html">SSL</a> and fully encrypts the data transmitted between the user's computer and Google servers. <br><br>  And these are just a few of the changes that have recently occurred with our search.  In our work, we try to take into account the opinions and feedback of users.  If you have suggestions and suggestions on how to improve our search, write to us about it <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/108954345031389568444/108954345031389568444/posts">on our page on Google+</a> .  We will definitely figure out how to make it easier for you to use our products. <br><br>  Every week we launch new search improvements.  We will continue to talk about interesting changes in our blog.
