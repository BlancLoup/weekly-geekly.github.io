And here the proverb admins are relevant are divided into two types, the first type is those who have not yet done Backup and the second type are those who already do.  Almost immediately, the virus was picked up, which spoiled all the jpeg files on the computer, just writing some garbage in them, thank God there was a time for another analog photo and they could just be scanned again.  But even then, the thought of always having a copy grew stronger in my brain. <br><br>  At first, she was lying on a nearby computer in the computer science office.  Then there was a miracle writing cdrom with a speed of 1-2x for the record, I began to buy blanks then they cost 50 rubles in my opinion and eventually fell in price to 5 rubles for the non-boxed options.  Since that time, I have two large boxes with recorded discs.  Time went blank discs, and suddenly my good friend spent some crazy money bought a writing dvdrom with a 2-4x recording speed, dvd discs cost more than 100 rubles and it was very expensive for a poor student to buy them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It should probably be noted separately that it was the time of expensive Internet, when you had to save every movie and mp3, the content grew very quickly and you had to store it somewhere and backup it.  Over time, the price of DVD discs fell to 50 rubles, and I began to actively write on them all. <br><br>  Even later, the price dropped to 11 rubles when buying a tube for 100 discs.  From now on, I probably have more than 1000 disks left with all kinds of content: films, studies, music, software and much more.

      The first outlet for online backup was mail, it could send small files to itself and have access to them from any place where there is Internet access.  The second place where you could conveniently store files is a small ftp of 50 megabytes, which providers gave to their users. <br><br>  The world moved on, I had my own computer and I started to buy screws, at first there were 5 of 320GB of them, a part of everything I backed up on the screws themselves with a simple copy, some of which were still written on dvd.  And also I started working and I had working servers and a lot of unused space.  Part of the file moved there. <br><br>  As time went on, the drives had grown to 750GB each and the turning point of the emergence of unlimited Internet and developed local content sites arrived, I had to think about the storage of movies and TV shows, and they occupied the main place.  Somewhere around this time I threw out most of my sit and dvd, and also sold almost all of my hard drives. <br><br>  It took only your documents, photos, software and some other trifles to backup.  The order of the place for backup fell hundreds of times.  Oddly enough, the mail still played an important role in the backup of small files. <br><br>  Finally, there appeared not expensive, large and fairly fast flash drives, my first flash drive was 4 gigabytes at once and it contained almost everything I needed to backup except pictures and music.  I found on her even a description of <a href="http://gadgets.softpedia.com/gadgetsImage/The-A-Data-Nobility-Series-PD7-200x--Turbo-Speed--USB-Flash-Drive-1-12366.html">gadgets.softpedia.com/gadgetsImage/The-A-Data-Nobility-Series-PD7-200x--Turbo-Speed--USB-Flash-Drive-1-12366.html</a> <br><br>  Time passed, the main backup was a flash drive and a remote server at work.  Archive photos passed for 100 gigs and every year grew more intense.  And then suddenly the era of clouds began, where a backup company thinks the service that provides you.  The first thing I migrated to the cloud were office documents in google docs.  Damn convenient and accessible from anywhere where there is internet.  All my work is connected with the Internet and if it is not already there, then my documents are not really necessary for me.  The next step was the migration of charts, diagrams, and others to gliffy.com from visio.  Both online services are not perfect, but they gave me enough functionality and I was very pleased with both of them. <br><br>  At this time, I removed the flash drives, I just stopped using them, I poured documents and other files into google docs, there is no need to carry photos and music with me.  The backup of its files always lay in encrypted form on the working server + there was an offline hard disk with a full copy of the disk from the computer. <br><br>  The ssd era has come.  After the very first ssd test for the system disk, I realized that happiness was near.  These feelings were similar to those when I changed the eight megabyte vidyuhi for the second gifors with 32 megabytes, when I upgraded from 512 megabytes of RAM to 2 gigs and from 2 gigs to 8 gigs.  The response improved to madness, which made work and life at the computer much more pleasant.  But there was also a danger, the first sdsd died very quickly, and probably at that moment I lost, you can tell some of the data that just did not have time to get into backup and stayed on the dead disk. <br><br>  That's when I started thinking about continuous backup to the Internet.  At the same time, I stumbled upon the company backblaze.com and began to make my file storage for 90 terabytes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/119367/">habrahabr.ru/post/119367</a> <br><br>  Backblaze is still in my opinion the cheapest way to backup large amounts of information from windows or mac.  Now I have three computers backed up with a total backup of about 2 terabytes and I pay $ 5 a month for each computer. <br>  Also in the backblaze versioning appeared, and even if I deleted or changed the file recently, I can return it from backup. <br><br>  Well, the first rule of the admin before, to change something, make backup.  For servers I use bacula, backup ninja and self-written scripts with saving files in amazon s3 and on other servers. <br><br>  The main thesis of this note: people make backups, no matter where and how, with pens or automatically. <br><br>  All successful backup. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158907/</a></p>
