(view of the flash developer)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>From the translator: Jez Warden has many years of experience with Flash / Flex.</i>  <i>He is also a Flex Consultant with HBO and Flash &amp; Flex Architect in Roundarch.</i> <br><br>  I attended a conference from Microsoft MIX 2010, which was held in Las Vegas a week after 360Flex.  I was already on MIX in 2007 and 2008.  I recorded a lot of videos and then successfully fucked everything up.  Those conferences were really weird.  They were held at the Venetian Hotel, the same hotel as at the Adobe MAX conference.  So I had the opportunity to personally see the differences between the two communities, and they are still the ones ... <br><br>  Adobe has more girls, more parties.  In conversations, it turned out that many on MIX were in some form involved in the Microsoft technology stack, whereas in Adobe, you did not know who was doing what.  Yes, there were templates, but design, back-end, Flash, Flex, Python ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the 2000s, when they presented the world with new features in Silverlight 3, I ooh @ l.  People were really excited about the new features, and this is despite the fact that Flash has been around for 5 years, as it is.  The people swallowed everything they threw, they could not wait to run and code, code, code.  After thinking about this topic a bit later, I realized that Microsoft developers are using Microsoft technology.  They do not separate them, as they do in Adobe.  That is why you can rarely see a .NET developer who uses Flash / Flex for the front-end part.  Most of them use AJAX, generated by Microsoft tools.

      But this year was different.  I realized that Silverlight is not just a competitor of Flash / Flex / AIR in video, and this is the missing part of the puzzle in .NET, something that was missing before.  The functionality added from versions 1 to 4 of Silverlight is what we, the Flash / Flex developers, already had in service.  They also made corrections of our work.  All this in order to develop on the Microsoft platform.  You need a web runtime + super browser + device to work.  Apple has it all, Google has it all ... Adobe?  Khem, no device, no browser, but yes Flash Player taxis, and? <br><br>  In general, it doesn‚Äôt matter how to get these capabilities, or who outdone anyone, Microsoft‚Äôs community lacks a design tool to allow designers to work with .NET developers.  Yes, there are several tools, but this is like heaven and earth compared to Flex / Flash.  I once spoke with a store manager on .NET who hired a Flash designer to help design their Silverlight / WPF efforts. <br><br>  Everything that foreshadowed for so long happened - Microsoft is fighting with Adobe in the field of design and he succeeds in this, he occupies a niche.  It really scares, but nevertheless - cool.  I did not use their tools for production, so the paragraph seems suspicious.  But damn, they already support PSD (Photoshop) and AI (Illustrator) for importing, just like FXG.  Well your mother.  I already blew out the 2nd cup of coffee and started the 3rd when the voice of <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a> sounded - "And now we import a pair of FXG ...".  Say it again!  Where is Design!? <br><blockquote>  Designers do not use Expression Design, they use Photoshop and Illustrator. </blockquote>  said mike downey when i argued with him.  Confidence could be heard in his voice, he seemed to confirm "Yes, it is really so."  What does it mean?  This means that they are on the right track.  It's cool that we can use the tools that we constantly use.  It also lowers the level of entry barriers for working with design agencies with Microsoft stores, as with partners.  Cool. <br><br>  And once again, it was very nice to see SketchFlow in action.  Rapid design is a tremendous help for sales managers, and even now the .NET world can do this using the right tools, that's it. <br><br>  The main topic of the conference is ‚Äúmobile, mobile, mobile‚Äù.  They push their Windows Mobile 7 hard, or whatever they call it.  I personally checked the work with three buttons, it feels obvious convenience.  Everyone carried the ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button to the iPhone application, why not delete this step and make it native to the phone.  And also make the search the first and most important.  I can not argue with this decision. <br><br>  These were the most memorable keynote'y that I have ever seen.  Microsoft clearly conveyed its vision to the audience and inspired her to act.  Almost.  Despite the fact that the history of the developer was picturesque with all the tools that work with the devices &amp; the market, ready for your arrival, the phone still does not exist.  And the iPhone is already there.  But when he appears, it will be something.  I believe that Adobe can create its own success story ... but on MIX keynote there was some kind of professionalism, confidence in all this.  Perhaps the whole thing is in the level of experience of the speakers, and maybe the whole thing is in rehearsals, and maybe in high-quality material.  Each speaker was undoubtedly positive and did not pretend that "this is better than it looks or you think," as it was before. <br><br>  But, as I said, this audience was completely different from the Adobe public.  There should have been more noise, shouts, speaker interruptions.  .NET devs need more Redbull, that's what I can say.  Maybe that's why all the Flex / Flash were there, um. <br><br>  Having come to this conference, I wanted to see what people are working ‚Äúthere‚Äù.  And they do the same things that we do.  CMS systems that have a rich appearance for management, work with media, video players, development for mobile platforms, which do not exist.  Build extensible client applications using modules.  They are the same as we do similar work.  Sadly, the specifics of Silverlight are still very close to Microsoft, the client has to hire someone, a firm, a company.  The technology itself is ready, but the market is not. <br><br>  And this leads me to the following conclusions.  They got 60%, we have problems.  Not a big problem, but we are starting to lose work.  In light of this fact, you have two choices.  Take Cynergy‚Äôs path, as she did several years ago and work on the principle ‚ÄúWe work with both technologies, they are both cool!‚Äù, Or enjoy the reduction in the amount of work.  I do not know how this will affect the world of Flash / Flex, but most of my clients have ceased to exist for 2 years for me, until I start coding in Silverlight.  I, like others, get a lot of work, so it does not mean that I will become unemployed.  Just a job like the Major League Basketball or the Olympic Games will flow smoothly into the Microsoft kingdom, not Flash.  And not because Flash has more platforms for installation, it doesn't matter.  I can not compete, not paying attention to the fact that we have 99% they have 60%.  After all, Java / Python / Ruby, etc.  still exist in large numbers.  They focus on specific markets.  Many areas in which Flash &amp; Flex will be in demand for a very long time.  Not everyone on the planet uses Microsoft technology. <br><br>  ESPECIALLY in the field of consumers. <br><br>  What is particularly interesting is the way in which Microsoft makes sense of its phone for consumers.  They hired the right people who say the right things, integrate the right tools.  I am sure that manufacturers will incline devices not to be cynical to operators.  I think if Apple did it easily, then what is it worth doing to Microsoft? <br><br>  Microsoft finally hired the right people.  They put key persons in certain parts of the company, tidy up the old guard, who did not understand either the web or young consumers. <br><br>  Will I do something new after MIX?  Not.  I will continue to communicate with my new Microsoft friends, but until Silverlight works for me, instead of forcing me to form a partnership / consulting relationship with Microsoft, nothing will change until then.  All the salt in the money.  If people pay me, I will do it.  Microsoft is paying now.  I don‚Äôt mind working as a partner for Microsoft, but now the world knows me as a Flas / Flex developer who likes to show off her mother with a Flash Player, and not Silverlight. <br><br>  It can only change the flow of banknotes.  It can dry up very quickly, but the Microsoft market is huge enough that, having gone deep, I will find clients without problems, even if I am not the first after the start of the race. <br><br>  Oh, and finally, all the ‚Äúfree‚Äù software from Microsoft in order to kick you in the direction.  Visual Studio looks awesome, and so does C #.  Maybe I will study Unity this week, I will do everything to avoid working with Objective C. <br><br>  No matter how much there was, many thanks to Microsoft for the invitation, I appreciated it, the whole movement was hilarious and I like to meet new people.  It was the best MIX, I learned a lot and probably will perform on the following. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87999/</a></p>
