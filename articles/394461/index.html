  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smoking causes grievous bodily harm: the explosion of an electronic cigarette can deprive a person of eyes, teeth or legs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The 63-year-old family therapist Joseph Kavins from California, on the evening of April 15, decided to take a rest after smoking one of his electronic cigarettes while playing Solitaire.  At 22:30, the man heard a loud bang and felt as if he had been struck with a stick in the face.  He saw a lot of blood around - but only with his right eye.  The left eye could not be saved, the doctors had to remove it. <br><br>  And this is not an isolated case.  Let's see how safe smoking is with these devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4da/749/22a/4da74922a6796a510745fa73418918e0.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the photo - Marcus Fortsani.</i>  <i>This is not a leg on the left leg, but a charred skin.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A patent for an electronic cigarette was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/251742/">obtained</a> in 1963 by American Herbert A. Gilbert.  The purpose of the inventor was a safe and harmless way of smoking, for which he replaced the standard burning of tobacco and paper with warmed, moist and fragrant air.  Before and after Gilbert, there were other inventors of such devices, and the Chinese pharmacist Hon Lika is traditionally called the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of smoking electronic cigarettes.

      Electronic cigarettes - vaporizers are essentially inhalers.  Therefore, someone thinks that they are safer than regular cigarettes or that they will help to quit smoking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a4/921/d53/8a4921d533ea482fb4f9eb708b94f1e7.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  A few years ago, electronic cigarettes in Russia were rare.  In 2008, this topic was raised on Habr√© - in the post <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/23446/">‚Äú</a> Do we switch <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/23446/">to electronic cigarettes?‚Äù, It was</a> told about the presentation of the first smokeless e-cigarette Gamucci, which produced steam instead of smoke.  The producers of this cigarette wanted to make money on the anti-tobacco laws of Europe and the USA, talking about the minimum occurrence of lung cancer and harm to health in general, about the absence of environmental damage.  By the way, researchers from the private university of John Hopkins <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245462/">have revealed the</a> harmful effects of a pair of electronic cigarettes on the lungs of mice, so it is impossible to speak of complete safety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/94a/fb4/e15/94afb4e15b027650a8da38fbfd553b35.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Later, the anti-smoking campaign began in Russia.  Lawmakers banned smoking in cafes and restaurants, in other public places, which caused a rapid growth in the vaporizer market.  First, electronic cigarettes appeared in large numbers at the cash desks in the stores, and now almost in any Moscow shopping center there is at least one point of sale for more complex gadgets - such that you can <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274324/">port a game like Flappy Bird</a> .  But with great opportunities comes a big responsibility, and now manufacturers need to think more about security. <br><br>  In the USA, the market of electronic cigarettes has grown from zero <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2016/05/05/can-e-cigarettes-survive-the-war-against-vaping/">to 3.7 billion dollars</a> in ten years.  13% of Americans have tried this device at least once, and 9 million "hover" on an ongoing basis. <br><br>  Of course, the market for conventional cigarettes in the amount of 92 billion dollars in the US vaporizers lose. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvQ6K8ariWs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGerWJOT0OpuGQAq1mfHewncgumA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The e-cigarette came into vogue thanks to anti-tobacco laws to help smokers do what they love in any places - on board airplanes, in theaters, and so on.  But the authorities of different countries still paid attention to this question, and in the United States, for example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272072/">banned smoking electronic cigarettes</a> on commercial flights.  This was done to ‚Äúprotect air passengers from the unwanted effects of aerosol vapors that are released when using an electronic cigarette. <br><br>  Against this background, in 2015 even presented a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265438/">smartphone that can be smoked</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14a/f77/76c/14af7776c91666ae85e70548780e2000.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Batteries have become more powerful, and explosions from them are now able to cause significant harm to health.  In some cases, users who use low-quality devices are to blame for this. <br><br>  In the case of the 63-year-old family therapist Joseph Kevins, it is doubtful that he himself changed the battery, or that he bought a cheap Chinese fake, although I don‚Äôt presume to say that this is not the case.  Cases like this were in the United States, and according to the FDA, cigarettes heated, burned and exploded 66 times in 2015 and January 2016.  These are only known cases, and, apparently, only with the most disastrous consequences. <br><br>  In Thomas Boe, a cigarette exploded in his mouth while he was driving a car, and two teeth were stuck in the palate.  Kenneth Barbero vaporizer with an explosion <a href="http://vape.net/man-badly-injured-another-vaporizer-explodes/">burned his tongue</a> .  Due to the explosion of a vaporizer in his pocket, Marcus Fortsani‚Äôs leg was <a href="http://www.westword.com/news/vape-pen-explosion-gives-marcus-forzani-third-degree-burns-7653238">charred from calf to hip</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b9/df5/3fe/1b9df53fec68e9fa9138d8895c1af960.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Joseph kevins</i> <br><br>  24-year-old Briton Kirby Shin is also unlucky; she needs plastic surgery to make the effects of <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/23/woman-could-be-scarred-for-life-after-an-e-cigarette-exploded-in-her-face-5640164/">a cigarette explosion</a> less noticeable in her face.  She smoked at home when there were two children next to her - fortunately, only she suffered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/799/01f/5a6/79901f5a6d124318dec6a528f8ee03b6.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  People more often pay attention to the fact that when smoking an electronic cigarette, steam gets into the lungs, and not smoke, that there are no burning products of paper.  But do not think about the security of the devices themselves. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBatteries explode due to poor production at dirty, unsanitary facilities in China.‚Äù  This is the fault of the people who are trying to bring their products to the market as quickly as possible, ‚Äùsays Gregory Bentley, a lawyer from California, who represents the interests of 62 people affected by electronic cigarettes in court.  It‚Äôs impossible to sue Chinese manufacturers, so Bentley and other lawyers focused on the distributors and sellers of these gadgets.  Bentley Law Office was the first to win a case against an electronic cigarette seller in October 2015. <br><br>  But why should we be afraid of batteries, if many of us have a phone in our pocket, a laptop in our bag, a smart watch on our hand?  The first reason why a lithium-ion cigarette battery is more dangerous than a smartphone battery is its shape.  According to a 2014 US Fire Department <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/electronic_cigarettes.pdf">study</a> , because of the cylindrical shape, a cigarette is overheated, and as a result, the battery or case may turn into a bullet that will fly around the room - as was the case with Kevins and Boe. <br><br>  The statistics below show when the batteries exploded most often.  It leads the Fire Administration.  Unfortunately, statistics is the result of a study of only 25 cases, that is, 80% of fires are only 20 burnt electronic cigarettes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a6/328/606/4a63286063cb4999aacd6c2d55f7b277.png" width="600"><br><br>  It remains to find out why these batteries are burning and exploding.  Professor Carnegie Mellon University Venkat Viswanathan, who studies lithium-ion batteries, is sure that it will be difficult to determine the cause.  What we have: 9 million "soaring" people in the US and 66 battery explosions.  That is 0.000074 cases per person, too small to compile statistics.  To try to find a problem, you need to test a million batteries, and the only way to do this is to give a million devices into the hands of buyers.  That is what is happening now. <br><br>  In 2014, 466 e-cigarette brands were sold in the United States.  Every month about ten more appear on the market.  If large manufacturers can buy high-quality batteries at a low price, then a small company has to save.  They buy cheap batteries, which at best do not last long, and at worst - can lead to consequences that are easy to <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dvaporizer%2Bexplosions%26espv%3D2%26biw%3D941%26bih%3D772%26source%3Dlnms%26tbm%3Disch%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjlqqug__rMAhWlB5oKHfxXDgkQ_AUIBigB">find on the network</a> .  Below in the photo - one of the least scary examples. <br><br>  Visvanathan said that now they make cars with batteries of 8000 cells - and they are safe, while electronic cigarettes usually have only one cell.  Here the professor is cunning: Tesla Model S this year in Norway has already <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/268742/">burned to charge</a> , and this was the fourth such case with this electric car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac5/6a4/20e/ac56a420ef621ce57ba55b3bdcef8f2e.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Smartphones also <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos/show/vid/573982/">explode</a> , and ordinary cigarettes in the event of careless use lead to fire.  Electronic cigarettes exploded 66 times in 9 million users - that is, this is an extremely rare event.  But in the event of an explosion, the tiny battery of a vaporizer is capable of crippling, because people keep a cigarette in their faces, fragments in an explosion get into their eyes, and therefore the consequences can be worse than when a smartphone explodes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394461/</a></p>
