  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Advertising wants to be useful</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Any business, whether it is the sale of pencils or the production of sophisticated construction equipment, requires advertising, in particular advertising on the Internet.  Unlike radio and outdoor advertising, the Internet has a number of serious advantages, the main of which is a complete understanding of the cost of attracting one client.  Entrepreneurs know this and are willing to spend big money on promoting their services online.  That is why at the moment the Internet is the second marketing channel after television advertising in terms of investment.  However, few people know that the cost of advertising on the Internet can be reduced by targeting advertising to the target audience (CA). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d66/a73/1af/d66a731afcff48cefa0f52b9ea468ed1.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The essence of targeting is that, based on data about Internet users, you only advertise your products or services to people who are interested in them.  In this case, the data can be very different: gender, age, income, marital status, place of residence, car availability.  What information to use depends on the products and the target audience you offer them.

      The audience with which targeted advertising works can be divided into two categories: new users and those who have already visited your site, but for some reason have not made a purchase. <br><br>  To increase the number of new visitors, you should use the technology RTB (Real Time Bidding) - an auction model for the purchase of display advertising on various sites combined into a common network.  Simply put, at RTB auction real-time ads are sold on those resources that are visited by the target audience.  At the same time, each individual impression is evaluated, the probability of a click on a banner and a subsequent purchase is calculated. <br><br>  The first RTB exchanges appeared in the USA in 2008.  Previously, online advertising was sold only in bulk (hundreds of thousands of impressions), and the real-time auction gave the opportunity to buy or sell advertising of a smaller volume.  Russian specialists began using RTB technology in 2011.  By the end of 2013, the volume of the auction advertising market in our country reached $ 35.8 million, and around the world - $ 4.5 billion. <br><br>  The mechanism of RTB is built on the interaction of advertising sites, they are represented on the stock exchange by SSP (Suply Side Platform), and by advertisers, their name is DSP (Demand Side Platform).  SSP informs the advertiser that it is possible to buy impressions on a resource whose users fall into its target audience.  DSP, evaluating the site, offers a favorable price, that is, it makes its bid.  In the auction, the maximum bid wins, and the winner places his advertisement on the resource.  At the same time, the advertiser shows ads only in Central Asia, and users see advertising messages that may be useful to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/6fc/06b/27f6fc06baa746db963c4009deb31da3.jpg"><br><br>  Consider the use of targeted advertising on the example of the manufacturer of plastic windows.  The main consumer of this type of product is women, who most often make decisions when choosing interior items.  Age category: 24 - 50 years. <br><br>  At the auction of the RTB exchange, banner advertising was purchased at several sites, which visitors are from the target audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e8/af8/ca6/6e8af8ca6d1a441481e56ab869a9f737.jpg"><br><br>  Targeted advertising campaign was launched on April 30, and in a week almost 1% of users who saw banners clicked on them.  In this case, the advertiser paid only for the transition of the interested user to the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fd/8e4/3d4/0fd8e43d48664f2dbc17734171ae6839.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, over the week, site traffic increased by 30% compared with the number of visitors before the launch of a targeted advertising campaign. <br><br>  <b>an old friend is better than two new ones</b> <br><br>  Consider the second option, when it is necessary to return users who have already been on the site, but left without making a purchase.  For example, a successful young man was thinking about buying a luxury car.  During business hours, I went to the website for the sale of cars, looked at several models and ran away to the meeting.  Now your task is to remind yourself.  This can be done using the retargeting tool, showing our hero the advertisement of your car dealership on other resources connected to the RTB system, while offering a discount or a special promotion.  However, it should be remembered that a young person could have been a girl in the place of a young person, which means that the target audience is divided into male and female, and the motivating advertising should be divided by gender. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64b/d34/614/64bd34614b79477e83f8834eef52bb7e.jpg"><br><br>  The retargeting tool differs from targeting in that you do not buy information about the necessary users on other resources, but create the data segment of the target audience yourself.  A person has already come to your site, which means that he is interested in products and he is your potential consumer.  Thus, when using retargeting, the advertising campaign is based on the data of users already loyal to you. <br><br>  There are two ways of retargeting: simple and advanced.  Simple is used when working with all users who have left the site.  The bottom line is that the advertisement of the resource continues to haunt visitors at other sites that are connected to the RTB system.  This can be banners or contextual ads, while they are not personalized and simply remind the user about the brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c6/b27/e6d/7c6b27e6dd92414bba248d0f5e8c9038.jpg"><br><br>  The effectiveness of simple retargeting can be traced to the example of an auto dealer advertisement that we know.  For three weeks of impressions, the conversion amounted to about five hundred targeted actions on the client‚Äôs website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/e65/f97/b01e65f979ab48ef9b6cfc5fcb878f2a.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's talk about advanced retargeting, which works harder, but gives more results.  A potential buyer is shown not just advertising banners indicating the store, but, for example, a product that he had previously viewed on the site.  In addition to the reminder, advertising can offer the client a discount for a limited time.  Thus, you motivate a client to return to the site and buy a product. <br><br>  The content of such banners is compiled using complex algorithms based on statistics on user behavior on the site (patterns).  For example, site statistics show that 85% of users who have watched the four models of the most expensive TVs end up buying the fifth, most advanced model.  So, for visitors who have left the site after watching those four TVs, it is better to show the fifth model in motivational advertising.  Thus, the statistics system predicts user behavior and calculates its next step. <br><br>  Statistics are collected constantly in the background.  The longer the algorithm runs, the more accurate the forecast. <br><br>  <b>Do not believe - check</b> <br><br>  You can find out that the retargeting tool works, and you haven't spent your money for nothing, from the RTB report.  As already shown in Figures 3 and 6, data on the number of clicks on banners and conversions after a click are daily reflected in the report.  They are displayed both in the form of a graph and in the form of a table, which also shows the cost of one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/979/1ef/836/9791ef836a5b4572825f07e6b343f8ec.jpg"><br><br>  If there is any doubt that using retargeting you can attract visitors to your website, still check how this mechanism works: put the product in the cart at any major online store and close it.  Soon the store will remind you of yourself. <br><br>  If there is no doubt, then the question arises, how to connect RTB?  How to do this depends on what you need: buy advertising or sell shows.  In the first case, you need to find a DSP operator who will represent your interests on the exchange.  At the moment, one of the largest Russian players in this segment of advertising is the company Intency.  If you want to sell banner places on your website, you need to contact the representative of the sites on the RTB - SSP exchange, among which Between digital takes the leading place.  Both companies use their own technology and give maximum results with minimal financial investments. <br><br>  All ingenious is simple <br><br>  As you already understood, targeting helps to correctly correct the advertising campaign and show it to the desired target audience.  At the same time, the results are clearly visible from the report of the RTB exchange: how many visitors came from which site, how many of them made a purchase or a call.  You will only have to observe how the conversion of the site increases and calculate the profit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292416/</a></p>
