    <h4>  Eat filed or go to eat already, tear off your ass from the screen </h4><br>  Do I need to explain that while eating the next portion of dumplings / pizza / salad / pasta (underline), many of us are staring at ZomboYaschik or Pisyuka Window.  Do not.  Cover / mute / Turn off and quietly eat concoction. <br>  <b>What for?</b>  When we eat and watch something, we eat much more, and with food we get the information we get and the worst thing is without any processing.  Anyone who does not understand will each time become more fat and tired.  And non-British scientists have found that if distracted while eating - a grub flies past the center of pleasure, well, you fly past the pleasure as "plywood over Paris."  If you do not think that you need to enjoy the food, go and dig yourself into the ground, because you are all food! <br><br><h4>  Send to Hell (or Basket) a good part of your music.  collections </h4><br>  Meditate on the content of the songs you listen to.  If you understand not only Russian, but also Albanian to the heap, think about the songs in this language.  You will notice in the song a negative or sadness and a difficult fate - her, not hesitating.  This does not apply to music without words, as well as most Soviet and Russian songs until 1980. <br>  <b>And why is that?</b>  Everything that we listen to quite often (the most favorite tracks) influences us with the help of the non-magical effect of repetition, on which all modern advertising is based.  In other words - it is a gradual programming on certain feelings, thoughts and actions.  Sometimes you listen to Yuri Loza and swim away on a raft to a depresnyak.  In general, we love to suffer and regret ourselves.  And our favorite songs as a rule reflect our most unsuccessful concepts in life (like, ‚ÄúI loved him ... and he left ...‚Äù).  But on the fact that to deal with all this once and for all, and to think that you are listening - not all have enough brains. <br><br><h4>  Forget ZomboYaschik </h4><br>  No comments. <br><br><h4>  Watch movies more carefully </h4><br>  No, you shouldn‚Äôt look out for blunders, rather follow the plot - look for the discrepancy between the nasty actions of the characters and further positive events, it usually doesn‚Äôt happen in life, but you hang plenty of noodles on your ears to think that way. <br>  <b>Well, here's another!</b>  <b>I watch movies for fun, not for thought.</b>  And the subconscious mind records everything, especially the reinforcement of bad actions with a good end.  Thus, we have stereotypes unrelated to reality that destroy our whole life (for example, ‚ÄúI did it with complete confidence, but it turned out not what I expected ...‚Äù).  In general, if you like fooling your brain - keep up the good work. <br><br><h4>  Remember: you live in the best country! </h4><br>  I will not write about it better, more criticism will rise.  I did not write this. <br><br><h4>  Headline </h4><br>  Is it not so?  Who else do we need to strive to cope with, if not with us?  I still do not get as good as I would like.  And you have? <br><br>  <b>If you have already done something from this list</b> , then it is worth continuing - write in the comments - I will put a plus sign :) <br><br>  PS: I stumbled upon an <s>interesting</s> intriguing cartoon on the website <a href="http://mr-freeman.ru/">mr-freeman.ru</a> , which had already been written on Habr√© at least twice, but I would like to pay attention and ask to see all the parts, starting from the end.  I would also like to hear your opinion about this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85643/</a></p>
