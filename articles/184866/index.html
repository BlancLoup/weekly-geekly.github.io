    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Story </h5><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúevaluating‚Äù the building was born in 2GIS for a long time.  Later, the idea began to walk in different departments, in every possible way to transform and grow into details, but it never came to realization in the framework of the 2GIS directory.  Therefore, it was decided to submit the project to Hakaton. <br><br><h5>  Hackathon </h5><br>  So far this is an internal <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Hackathon</a> 2GIS, on which projects, processes and hypotheses are run-in, which are difficult to integrate into current business tasks, but I really want to implement it.  It takes three days: from Friday to Sunday.  The company provides infrastructure, food and everything necessary.  Employees at this time, of course, are turned off from work processes.  There is a special thank you to Vitaly Kulpin. <br><br>  Eight people, an uncut idea, fan atmosphere and three days to make a project. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Team pro and manager</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://twitter.com/24ds">Evgeniy Chertenkov</a> - design <br>  <a href="http://ikrivchun.moikrug.ru/">Igor Krivchun</a> - backend <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/semenov">Vlad Semenov</a> - backend <br>  <a href="http://dmitrienkop.moikrug.ru/">Peter Dmitrienko</a> - frontend <br>  <a href="http://okatev.ru/">Evgeny Okatiev</a> - frontend magic <br>  <a href="http://pinrate.ru/">Dmitry Kuznetsov</a> - frontend <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sereje4kin">Sergey Kolomenkin</a> - manager <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dkondrateva">Dina Berezina</a> - Analyst <br><br>  The idea is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kibik/">Anton Spiridonov</a> . <br></div></div><br>  In fairness, I must say that most of the design and layout were already ready, so the main forces were thrown to <i>fix the bugs and fix them</i> . <br><br><h5>  Project </h5><br>  Of course, here you can start talking pathetically that Pinrate is a miracle service, thanks to which you can now: <br><ul><li>  find the "right" place to live </li><li>  understand whether to change the apartment </li><li>  try someone who has more. </li></ul><br><br>  But, as already mentioned, it is not.  The project is made in the atmosphere of fun and just for fun.  Of course, there were also internal tasks, but they didn‚Äôt put much pressure. <br><br><h5>  Filling </h5><br>  All data arrives from <a href="http://api.2gis.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpinrate">the 2GIS</a> Reference <a href="http://api.2gis.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpinrate">API</a> .  Maps work on the Open Source <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library and our tiles.  Most recently released beta API cards 2GIS 2.0, by the way, works the same way - data 2GIS with Leaflet'om under the hood. <br><br><h5>  How to count </h5><br>  The site says it is magic.  In fact, it is not, and the formula is.  We take into account the distance to various infrastructure facilities of the city and their impact on the standard of living. <br><br>  Of course, we do not take into account the parameters of the car: neither the remoteness from the center of the city, nor the condition of the house, and certainly we do not know about the "cheerful" neighbors.  We simply assumed that the better the infrastructure is developed, the more likely it is that all this is indirectly at a normal level. <br><br>  At the same time, we are well aware that this is ‚Äúa bit‚Äù wrong and we recognize that today the rating cannot be considered expert. <br><br><h5>  How to run </h5><br>  The project is a one-time project - we are ready to bet that if you already visited Pinrate, you did it once.  Played and forgotten.  This scenario, we assumed.  Therefore, for more coverage, they decided to go through the social network, or rather the carpet bombing by sharing.  For each evaluation interval came up with several options for status.  From ‚ÄúHole.  Not black  Just a hole ‚Äùto‚Äú The King of the World, well ‚Äù(there, of course, there are more successful ones, but it's better to see them yourself). <br><br>  In addition, we switched to the dark side - after a few minutes of being on the site pops up pop-up, in which we ask to share the link. <br><br>  Separately, I want to say how we worked with bloggers.  More precisely, not only bloggers, but everyone who wanted to please the project (well, get them sharing).  For buildings, which, as we expected, will be checked by ‚Äúpersons‚Äù, the statuses from the ‚Äúwho knows, he will understand‚Äù series have been invented.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/780/22b/b6278022bcdcc853284a8cb60f1d0290.png"><br><br>  And it worked. <br><br><h5>  Effect </h5><br>  To be honest, we ourselves are a little bit fucked by the effect. <br><br>  We were shown <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/625297">on TV</a> . <br>  <a href="http://news.ngs.ru/more/1227588/">Information</a> , <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/127855-pinrate">entertainment</a> and <a href="http://primamedia.ru/news/hitech/25.06.2013/284824/vladivostoktsi-mogut-uznat-naskolko-horosh-ih-dom-krasauchik-q.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.mr7.ru/articles/86103/">sites were</a> written about us. <br>  Over <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime%3Fq%3Dpinrate%26src%3Dtypd">7,000</a> Twitter feeds. <br>  Public on Vkontakte: <a href="http://vk.com/gazetabc%3Fw%3Dwall-27730461_2385">one</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/kirov%3Fw%3Dwall-45706908_2841">two</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/mynsk%3Fw%3Dwall-22925627_33998">three</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/search%3Fc%255Bq%255D%3Dpinrate%26c%255Bsection%255D%3Dauto">others</a> . <br>  We were approached by several journalists.  Those who were not familiar with 2GIS, first of all asked: ‚Äúwhere did you get all the data from?‚Äù.  I had to talk about 2GIS itself, and about the API, and even about <a href="http://flamp.ru/">Flamp</a> . <br><br><h5>  Future </h5><br>  We are preparing for <s>an IPO</s> that in a couple of days the project will play out and we will return to ordinary life again.  Some technical points will be used in future products. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  There must be some inspiring phrase, but we decided that it would be more honest to say: take <a href="http://api.2gis.ru/">API 2GIS</a> and do as we do, do better than us (sorry) :) <br><br>  Many thanks to all who supported and helped. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184866/</a></p>
