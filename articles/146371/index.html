  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Larry Page Health Causes Investor Concerns</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The meeting of shareholders of Google held yesterday by a majority of votes decided to hold a split of the company's shares - it was decided to increase the number of outstanding shares at the expense of proportional splitting of each initial one.  As a result, in the fall of this year, if Google settles problems with a number of independent shareholders who refused to submit their papers for the split session and wanted to sue the council, the situation would be that 75% would be in the hands of Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt voting shares, which leaves almost no tools for influencing the company's policy to minority shareholders. <br><br>  However, shareholders and investors of the company were worried about another circumstance - Larry Page was absent at the shareholders' meeting due to the fact that he lost his voice (physically) and therefore his participation in the event did not make sense.  When it became known that Page also missed one of the most important events for the search giant - Google I / O, which will take place next week, as well as a conference call to announce the company's financial results for the second quarter of this year, the health of one of the founders caused regular questions <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google‚Äôs press service did not clarify the specific nature of the problems with Paige‚Äôs voice, citing respect for the CEO‚Äôs private life, but said that while the problems occur, the communication will take place via e-mail and other written communications.  At the same time, someone later noted that Page had not written a single message on his <a href="https://plus.google.com/106189723444098348646/posts">page</a> on Google+ since May 25. <br><br>  Thus, the publication Business Insider was able to draw sad parallels between the case with the head of Google and Steve Jobs's disease, which also was removed from the management of the company due to illness.  It is also worth recalling that the mother of Sergey Brin (co-founder of Google), Eugene, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.  In this regard, in 2008, Brin decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland, where his mother is being observed and treated.  It was found that Parkinson's disease is not hereditary: he and his mother have a mutation of the gene LRRK2 (G2019S), which gives the likelihood of developing the disease in later years.
