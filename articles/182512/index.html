  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ekovozhdeniye with the new Cellocator IQ 50 terminal: a practical overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that the possibility of analyzing the behavior of the driver behind the wheel and his driving style is by far the most urgent issue.  Eco-driving allows you to reduce fuel consumption by about 16%, reduce the amount of harmful emissions into the atmosphere, and also significantly improve safety on the roads.  With proper driving, the total trip time is reduced, the average speed increases, and the time spent on stopping and starting off when driving in traffic is significantly reduced by braking in advance before approaching the red traffic light and hitting the ‚Äúgreen wave‚Äù.  Thus, eco-friendly drivers save more and arrive at their destination earlier. <br><br>  In the spring of this year, the company <a href="http://www.cellocator.ru/">Pointer Telocation</a> - a well-known manufacturer of satellite monitoring equipment from Israel, released a new <b>terminal IQ 50</b> , which, among other advantages, provides an opportunity to analyze the driving style of the driver, and the processing of the initial data can occur in the device itself, and ready reports are transmitted to receiving server. <br>  This feature is particularly relevant for rental and rental cars, for carriers and courier services.  After all, it is no secret that the damage that passenger cars rent or lease get is often the result of irresponsible driving style, leading to significant costs for the repair and maintenance of vehicles, as well as fuel costs. <br><br>  Now everything is in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

This solution allows you to duplicate the operation of an external antenna if it is damaged, for example, when the driver intervenes. <br><br>  The SIM-card holder is <b>Amfenol SimLock</b> , time <b>-tested</b> , the voltage regulator is implemented on the <b>3-amp LM22670</b> , the GSM antenna is embedded, it is soldered on the end of the printed circuit board.  The modem used by GPRS is a <b>four-band Telit GE864-QUAD Automotive V2</b> , which has a low profile, an extended temperature range, increased protection from electromagnetic radiation, and also meets all automotive M2M market standards.  As a backup battery uses high-quality LiPol battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh.  The central processor is <b>STMicroelectronics STM32F103, ARMCortex-M3.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e89/3d6/f7a/e893d6f7a0d0165c54f5fb8063ddfdbb.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0c/5ac/ce0/b0c5acce04446f3b6ac15c08316b1aef.jpg"><br><br>  Complete with the device itself is also supplied everything necessary <b>for mounting the device on a vehicle</b> .  For programming, adjusting and testing equipment, Pointer has created a set of software tools with which even beginner integrators will be able to fine-tune the equipment for specific tasks.  The program interface is convenient and intuitive, the tooltips when you hover the pointer on a parameter make it easy to understand the programming of a function or parameter of the device.  A distinctive feature of the device is also the quantity and quality of available optional accessories and sensors.  Special accessories, such as a <b>protective silicone case</b> , are also created for the IQ 50 terminal, and now integrators will not have to select protective equipment from external influences. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff0/e06/f83/ff0e06f83551f26fd96231e68c1dca18.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, as I mentioned above, the IQ 50 terminal provides the <b>ability to analyze the driving style of the driver</b> , and the processing of the initial data can occur in the device itself, and the finished reports are transmitted to the receiving server.  Thus, the Cello IQ device registers and transmits reports on the condition of the vehicle (engine status, idle time and time in motion);  driver's behavior - in the form of a pre-set set of events and primary data of dangerous driving (‚Äúsafety‚Äù function), emergency events and primary data on emergency situations (‚Äúevent recorder‚Äù function) for subsequent event reconstruction, as well as data on uneconomical driving with terms of fuel consumption and accelerated wear of vehicle subsystems (eco-driving) and other information.  All the above reports have been successfully implemented in <a href="http://gurtam.com/ru/gps_tracking/wialon_hosting.html">the Wialon Hosting satellite monitoring system</a> , so there is no need to use additional software for processing data from IQ 50. <br><br>  Summing up, it can be said that the IQ 50 is a high-quality instrument with wide functionality that ensures stable and trouble-free operation even in difficult working conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182512/</a></p>
