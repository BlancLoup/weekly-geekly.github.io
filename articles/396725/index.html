  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I picked up my files from OneDrive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In recent months, many OneDrive users have received a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274737/">letter of happiness</a> that their free 15 GB will soon "turn into a pumpkin", which will now be three times smaller than the one before. <br>  Users are encouraged to fight the excess pumpkins themselves and while they are busy with this, their OneDrive goes into readonly mode.  If this struggle drags on for a long time, then in about six months the corporation will start helping people. </p><br><p>  Some time ago I used Windows Phone and I had about 2500 photos of a little more than 8 GB in size, and I had to pick them up. <br>  But it was not there. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd3/02b/7e7/cd302b7e769a4d048e9239cc0e58caa7.png" width="80%"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  After spending several hours trying to retrieve <em>my</em> data from the OneDrive, I realized that I was not alone, and wrote this text. </p><br><p>  Immediately write a solution that worked.  To pick up files, read in a row. <br>  In the end - intuitive ways that do not work.  Lovers of detectives can start <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396725/">from there</a> , and then go to the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396725/">riddle</a> :) </p><br><h3><a name="ok"></a>  How to download a large folder from OneDrive via the web </h3><br><p>  The solution is to split one large directory into several small ones, which can already be downloaded separately by zip-files (one large one ‚Äî not, see <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396725/">below</a> ). <br>  The algorithm is as follows: </p><br><ol><li>  Create the desired number of directories next to a large folder. <br>  Their number is selected based on the fact that: <br><ul><li>  the size of one pack of files did not exceed 4 Gb (and preferably less than 2) </li><li>  the number of files there was less than 1000. <br></li></ul></li><li><p>  We go to a large folder (I have pictures there), we switch to the list view there, otherwise after a while the page just hangs due to the number of pictures. </p><br></li><li><p>  Using shift, select a certain number of pictures and move ("move") them to one of the previously prepared directories.  My size of one pack was from 500 to 1000 photos. <br>  <strong>Important</strong> : it is necessary to select it through shift, and not Ctrl-A.  And note that you do not see all the files in this directory! <br>  Unfortunately, when you select files, you do not see the total size, only their number. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f6/ce5/e02/9f6ce5e025ea4cc6b937f33a0d5c8872.png" width="80%"><br></li><li><p>  To see more files, you need to go upstairs and re-enter the directory;) (well, as always) </p><br></li><li><p>  Repeat until the directory size is less than 4 GB. </p><br></li><li><p>  Download each daddy separately. <br>  The previous selection is removed by a cross.  Watch out for two directories! </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f3/4d5/8f8/9f34d58f8c644f48bb6df8c3f9dc6721.png" width="80%"><br></li><li>  After all the zip files have been downloaded, you need to check that all the archives are open and all the files are in place, just by number. <br>  If a zip does not open, it can mean one of two things: <br><ul><li>  zip size &lt;4 GB: connection was interrupted and zip did not download, then you need to download this directory again </li><li>  size zip&gt; = 4 GB: too many files were selected, this directory must be split into two again and downloaded separately. </li></ul></li></ol><br><h3><a name="notok"></a>  What <em>does not</em> work </h3><br><p>  "Each task has a simple, intuitive, <em>wrong</em> solution," this is about OneDrive. </p><br><p>  So, </p><br><ul><li><p>  Just select the daddy and download it. <br>  In this case, the Microsoft server is issued a zip-file with a size of 9 GB, but in the old format, which does not support an archive size of more than 4 GB.  Simply put, this is a broken file that does not open. </p><br></li><li><p>  Go to the directory and download files in batches of 500-1000 pieces. <br>  I was shown only the first 1000 files, the others see no possibility at all. </p><br></li><li>  Through "select all", all 2500 files are selected (9 GB), but you can remove the selection of individual files only via ctrl + click on each file.  It's a pity.  I thought I would download the first thousand first, and then the remaining 2500-1000.  But it would not help me anyway.  there is more than 8 GB. </li></ul><br><p>  I‚Äôll mention separately why the OneDrive client didn‚Äôt even try: first, it‚Äôs stupid to install a program from which I take all my data and I‚Äôm not going to use it;  Secondly, before that I had cases when ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWNWEQVuTEo0">something went wrong</a> ‚Äù in the synchronization of OneDrive and instead of the files appearing, they disappeared. </p><br><p>  Also synchronization, of course ... when empty equals empty, everything is synchronous.  But not what I need now. </p><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><ol><li><p>  The idea "this is a big corporation, nothing will happen with its service" does not work. </p><br></li><li><p>  It is necessary to store eggs in different baskets.  Full copies of them. </p><br></li><li>  Pick up your files from OneDrive without a client - you can. </li></ol><br><p>  It is noteworthy that Microsoft, in its apologizing letter, offers only two actions to choose from: buy more space or delete files. </p><br><p>  It seems no one thought that before they leave, people will want to take theirs. <br>  If the directory size was less than 4 GB, there would be no problems. </p><br><p>  But I have to evacuate the data due to the fact that the size exceeds 5 GB! </p></div>
