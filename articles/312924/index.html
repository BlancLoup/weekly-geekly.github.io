  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the specifics of the renewal of domain names in international zones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a not very pleasant situation with the Reg.Ru domain registrar, negotiations on which were stalled. <br><br>  On October 2, 2015, the domain was registered in the .ST zone, it was not extended to Expiration Date (October 2, 2016) and removed from the domain control panel of the registrar.  Not just received the status of a domain with overdue payment, but generally disappeared from your personal account.  When contacting the support service, it turned out the following: the domains of this zone can be extended after removal from delegation, but for 20,000 rubles, which is almost 10 times the cost of a regular extension. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a justification for such pricing, the registrar refers to its agreements with the main registrar of the EPAG Domainservices GmbH zone - <a href="https://www.epag.de/">www.epag.de</a> and at the same time did not provide any legally relevant information about how their internal agreements with third parties relate to me, as a Reg customer. .Ru. <br><br>  <strong>Important:</strong> on the Reg.Ru website, there is completely no information on the features of domain renewal upon Expiration Date, there are no warnings about deleting the domain from the control panel, and even less about the increase in the cost of renewal by an order of magnitude.

      If you ask for information on the site owner of the .ST domain zone, it turns out: <br><br>  1. Here - <a href="http://kb.registry.st/domains/domain-life-cycle/">http://kb.registry.st/domains/domain-life-cycle/</a> <br><br><blockquote>  It is not a matter of course for the registrant. </blockquote><br>  On Expiration Date, the ‚ÄúRenew grace period‚Äù begins, which lasts 40 days.  At the same time, the cost of the extension does not change, which is directly stated. <br><br>  2. When contacting the support service of the owner of the .ST domain zone, an answer was received: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear domain registrant, <br>  Reg.RU is a registrars network.  EPAG is direct accredited ST Registrar. <br>  We will contact today EPAG to resolve this issue. <br><br>  This is a period of 40 days. </blockquote><br>  Thus, there is confirmation that the owner of the zone of additional payment really does not require. <br><br>  3. Clause 1.19 of the offer accepted by the client when registering a domain in the .ST zone on the Reg.Ru website contains the following provision: <br><br><blockquote>  1.19.  Registration of second-level domain names in international zones is carried out in accordance with the established Rules on the registration of domain names, approved by the Registrar of domain names in the domain chosen for registration in the international zone.  For the registration of domain names in international zones, the Contractor independently chooses a Registrar from among those with which the Contractor has agreements. </blockquote><br>  Those.  Reg.Ru chooses the counterpart through which the registration will take place, with the client: <br><br>  a) does not know in advance who will be such a counterparty (in this case, it turned out to be EPAG); <br>  b) does not have any contractual relationship with this third party; <br>  c) is not informed about the conditions affecting the management of the domain, including the order of procedures and fees. <br><br>  Proceeding from all this, it turns out that for the present being the owner of a domain name in accordance with the rules of the owner of the .ST domain zone, I do not have the opportunity to renew the domain myself and do not see it in my account.  Renewal is possible only through the support service at repeatedly overestimated cost, which was not mentioned anywhere on the registrar's website either at the time of domain registration or at the time of the renewal attempt. <br><br>  I will be grateful to the Habr community for any help in assessing the legality of such behavior of the Reg.Ru. registrar.  At least from the point of view of good faith. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 1:</b> <br><br>  Received the final answer from Reg.Ru regarding the extension and transfer of the domain to another registrar.  As it turns out, there is no technical possibility, but it exists, only for other money: <br><br><blockquote>  We have negotiated with a higher organization, according to their agreement with the registry for domains .st, there is no grace period or recovery period, so neither we nor our partner have the technical ability to extend the domain for you at normal cost. <br>  Answering your question about warnings from our side, we note that based on the terms of the contract with the registry, we sent you notifications to the contact email of the domain that the domain and all services on it will be deleted six times, starting from 09.08.2016. <br>  The domain in this state is not available for transfer, so we are not able to provide you with the EPP key for its transfer. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>UPDATE 2:</b> <br><br>  The domain zone support service resolved the issue with EPAG, which extended the domain before any information from Reg.Ru.  A day later, a notice came from Reg.Ru that the cost of renewal is equal to the normal cost and after payment the domain appeared in your personal account.  Most likely this decision was made only for this particular case.  A little later the domain will be transferred to nic.st. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312924/</a></p>
