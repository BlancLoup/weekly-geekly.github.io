The implemented system is capable of using Kinect and the OpenCV library to recognize certain objects, faces and obstacles in the three-dimensional scene, and to describe the scene to its owner using voice messages. </li><li>  <b>MSU</b> and <b>MIPT,</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Monitor</b> project <b>.</b>  The project proposes to automatically monitor the mood of the child using the Kinect sensor and superimpose a map of his moods on the calendar.  In this way, parents will be able to trace how various actions affect the mood of their child in order to appropriately change their behavior and the set of proposed activities.  It is assumed that the system will be useful for early diagnosis and prevention of serious diseases, such as autism. </li><li>  <b>Irkutsk State University, the</b> project Kiwi.  The application for WindowsPhone, analyzes the psychological state of people based on entertainment resources: aphorisms, interesting facts and psychological tests.  It proposes to get rid of large-scale problems by solving them even at the source - at the level of each individual.  A comprehensive application ‚Äí a database is constantly updated, bilateral interaction with social networks takes place, recommendations are issued.  All this makes the application interesting for the modern user. </li><li>  <b>MIEM-HSE</b> and <b>MAI,</b> <b>LaserCraft</b> project.  The project has created hardware and software for conducting dynamic outdoor games - a special gun and a wearable suit with a microcontroller.  Each player is supplied with a Windows Phone 7 phone, which allows you to organize collective dynamic games with social behavior that can be tied to useful activities such as garbage collection.  The project will allow the child to be torn away from computer games and captivate with street entertainment at the intersection of reality and virtuality. </li><li>  <b>Saratov State Technical University, the</b> project <b>"System of mobile robot robots."</b>  Students drew attention to an important, but not very noticeable at first glance, problem - the neutralization of minefields left over from the time of hostilities.  To do this, they propose to use a system of mobile robots that are capable of collective behavior.  They demonstrate the model of collective behavior of robots in the form of a program on XNA, as well as a ready prototype of a sapper robot </li><li>  <b>TUSUR</b> (Tomsk), MDVoice project.  The project proposes a method for early diagnosis of laryngeal diseases (such as laryngeal cancer) based on voice analysis.  The current prototype is implemented on a PC and allows you to recognize voice changes, it is assumed the implementation of the system on Windows Phone 7. </li><li>  <b>SUSU</b> (Chelyabinsk), <b>Mother</b> <b>Health</b> project.  According to the UN, one of the important problems of our time is the problem of motherhood, which is also associated with the problem of reducing the birth rate in our country.  Students proposed to solve this problem with the help of a support system for women during pregnancy and the first years of raising a child.  The intelligent content filtering system carefully selects articles that correspond to the current period in a woman‚Äôs life, providing information and moral support.  It is also assumed that additional features and tools will be available in the application. </li><li>  <b>SUSU</b> (Chelyabinsk), project <b>Smart</b> <b>Pipes</b> .  The system allows you to save water consumption by reducing leakage.  It is known that leaks are guilty of a significant percentage of water consumption during its transportation, and the flow rate directly depends on the pressure in the pipes.  The implemented prototype of the system allows to flexibly control the pressure in the water supply system, ensuring the minimum allowable pressure depending on the current water consumption by the consumer. </li><li>  <b>TPU</b> and <b>TSU</b> (Tomsk), the project SuperTomsk.  The project is focused on improving the literacy level of children based on Kinect.  The main task is to create an exciting game that will involve children in the process of learning letters, adding them into syllables and words.  The current version of the game allows you to learn how to spell letters of the alphabet by repeating the outline of letters in the air. </li><li>  <b>Nizhny Novgorod State University, the</b> project <b>Pandam</b> <b>.</b>  The parental control system of the new generation allows you to track the child‚Äôs posture while working at the computer using the Kinect sensor, as well as blocking the computer at certain intervals and requiring you to perform certain physical exercises controlled by the Kinect sensor. </li></ul><br><br>  Enjoy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142073/</a></p>
