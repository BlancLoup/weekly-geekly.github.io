  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Please send spam! Lots of spam!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To combat spam, Microsoft offered to introduce ‚Äúelectronic stamps‚Äù that you need to buy from your mail provider to send an e-mail.  Of course, such an approach would drastically reduce the flow of spam, but there were no fraers willing to switch to fully paid mail, when there are thousands of free ways to send e-mail, and there will not be any in the foreseeable future.  In addition, the approach proposed by the company did not guarantee that those who switched to the proposed mail system would be protected from spam, it only guaranteed, like a regular mail system, that spammers would pay their provider (mail) for the letters sent out, but Who will continue to receive spam, albeit in smaller quantities? <br>  I propose not to fight spam, but to legalize it, but so that all parties benefit from it: advertisers, mail providers and, most importantly, the final recipient.  How to do it?  Pretty simple. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Spam is an advertising medium.  Spam bought by advertisers.  Advertisers need our attention;  fact - <strong>they are willing to pay for it</strong> (and even risk their reputation).  Only here, instead of paying us with you, for our attention and time with you, they pay to spammers, who undertake to do this dirty, ungrateful and illegal work for them.  It is necessary to make so that the money invested by the advertiser in advertising would come directly to consumers of advertising.  In other words, the consumer of advertising should receive, and the advertiser, accordingly, pay some small amount for each letter opened by the recipient with advertising.  This is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe proposed system. <br><br>  <strong>How can all this be organized?</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Opening an account in the proposed mail system, each user who wants to be able to send letters will have to deposit a small amount in the form of a deposit, for example, $ 5.  And let the security price of one letter being sent be, for example, 5 cents.  When sending a letter, 5 cents are withdrawn from the user's account, which the mail provider collects as a guarantee that this letter is not advertising.  Who will decide whether a letter is adware or not?  Recipient.  If the recipient decides that the received and opened letter is an advertising letter and presses the corresponding button, 5 cents, withdrawn from the sender‚Äôs account as a deposit, will be divided between the provider and the recipient.  For example, the provider will receive 1 cent, and the recipient will be credited 4 cents to his account.  If the sender is in the recipient‚Äôs address book, or if the recipient decides that the letter received from the stranger has no advertising character and presses the corresponding button, the deposit of 5 cents will be fully returned to the sender, and the letter will remain free in that case for all parties. <br><br>  <strong>From the introduction of such a system will benefit all but spammers.</strong>  Advertisers will not need to use the services of spammers: millions of people themselves will add their addresses to special databases wishing to receive advertising, indicating which kind of advertising they prefer.  In addition, advertisers will be confident that their letters are at least opened, whereas today, thanks to spam filters, hardly one of the hundred letters they send out opens.  Mail providers will be able to earn (what they have been dreaming about for so long, but they don‚Äôt know how) on a huge advertising flow.  But most of all we will win with you, since either we will completely get rid of spam, or we will turn it into a source, albeit not large, but income.  And you will not need to constantly hide, mask or periodically change your email. <br><br>  It will be possible to make it so that the size of the required deposit for incoming mail, in a certain, reasonable range, is set by the user himself - as the price of his attention and time.  Advertisers will think twice whether to send a sales letter to someone who set the price of their attention at $ 5 per letter.  On the other hand, the user can specify the advertising of what and in which price range he prefers to receive, and then the advertiser's target audience will be much better quality than today's newsletter ‚Äúto everyone who has not hidden‚Äù.  Moreover, the advertiser, through the intermediary of the provider, can set a bonus paid to the recipient in addition to the security price of the letter, if the recipient answers some simple questions on the subject of the letter in order to verify that the advertisement has been learned. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know whether such a postal system will be created or not, but I‚Äôm sure of one thing: you have to pay for advertising, and not to pay anyone, but to the one to whom it is intended, as Alvin Toffler predicted long ago in his ‚ÄúFuturoshock‚Äù ".  In this world, there is a price to everything, including our attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10818/</a></p>
