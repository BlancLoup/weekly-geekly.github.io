Disassemble a pack of letters, instruct another employee, issue a dozen more contracts ... Even if it is very easy to do physically, the very idea that you have to do this for a long time can cause convulsions.  I don't even want to start! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Therefore, you postpone the execution of the case for 5 minutes ... Then another 10 minutes ... Then you decide to drink tea ... And now the working day comes to an end, and you have not done almost any useful business, having spent all the time reading news on the Internet!  And things are accumulating and accumulating ... Once you get into this dead-end state, you can be in it for a long time.  At the same time, you can feel even more tired and wrapped up than on days of really active and hard work.  Many probably noticed that during such periods it often pulls to go for a walk in the fresh air, chat with someone ‚Äúabout anything‚Äù or even help in carrying weights.  In general - to do at least something more actively than is required from you at the moment.  What are we tired of if we don‚Äôt do any hard and difficult physical work?  Ask any boss or secretary what is most unpleasant about paperwork with contracts and reports.  This is boredom!

      An interesting feature of our psyche is that it regularly requires new experiences and emotions for normal work.  No wonder few people take vacation at sea for four weeks.  Even a very comfortable rest can get bored if it is monotonous.  With this, by the way, housewives often come across.  It is especially strange and sad to observe this if a woman has no material problems.  But, as stated in the series - "The rich also cry."  From the fact that there is comfort in life, and there is no interest and enthusiasm.  Help out in this case, one or more hobbies that add variety to life.  What makes us look for this variety?  The need for play and entertainment!  Unfortunately, many parents from childhood inspired us with the idea that there are moments in life that you just need to take for granted.  That routine work just needs to be done, even if it is unpleasant, and we cannot avoid it.  I listened to such reasoning.  Fortunately, this is a big mistake.  You can not only make entertainment work, but also make any work entertainment! <br><br>  Let's try to figure out when people get tired of a game.  About two years I was deeply interested in the development of casual games, talked a lot with their developers and even participated in the release of a couple of small game projects.  Therefore, I can tell you exactly which of the parameters most strongly influence the interest in the game.  First is the level of difficulty.  The game should not be too easy or too difficult for the player.  That is why most computer games offer a choice of several levels of difficulty.  This is done so that players with different characters and level of training are equally interested in playing.  Secondly, the level of difficulty must grow as the player learns to play and his skill grows.  If the difficulty level is suitable for the player, then he usually ends the game after the final victory, or when he becomes ‚Äúeverything is clear‚Äù.  To keep the player interested, the game must be somewhat unpredictable.  A simple example is the tic-tac-toe game.  Remember how you played it as a child, and when and why you are tired of this game. <br><br>  So how can we turn any ordinary business into entertainment?  The easiest way is to change the difficulty level.  If a lesson is too difficult - break it down into simpler tasks and deal with them separately.  If the occupation is too simple and therefore boring, increase the difficulty!  This may sound like a paradox, but it works! <br><br>  The movement helps a lot of people.  Many office workers will definitely benefit from moving more during the day.  Walk around the office, do a little physical workout.  It happens that even such trifles as tapping with a foot to the rhythm of music or any other movements help.  Charge your body with movement!  Is it boring to sort out and fill in forms?  Try doing this with your other hand.  Is the caller talking very slowly?  Do not focus all your attention on this.  Draw at this time on paper or write down the case for the near future.  Or maybe you sing something "about yourself"?  In general, do some more simple activities in parallel and feel how everything becomes a bit more complicated and much more exciting at the same time. <br><br>  Another household example is background music, under which it is often very pleasant to work.  Music not only creates a pleasant emotional background, but also entertains our brain.  On the one hand, we kind of spend some of our ‚Äúcomputational resources‚Äù and attention on music perception, but on the other hand it becomes interesting.  The body enters a state of flow.  When I ponder some serious question, I usually put on slow and "clumsy" music.  If I‚Äôm busy with some kind of routine work, I usually give a jaunty power-speed metal hit for 200 per minute.  While the body ‚Äúon the machine‚Äù does the work, the mind is amused by the perception of music.  Or, at this moment, I think about something completely outside.  And if you also think about the pleasant things, it turns out well.  The work is in full swing, the mood is good, and my acquaintances are then surprised how I manage to do so many different things :) What do you want! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64545/</a></p>
