      Kaspersky Lab at Positive Hack Days traditionally pays attention to highlighting the most topical issues that are becoming more and more sophisticated every year.  This year our experts will cover topics such as: <br><br>  <b>Alexander Gostev: Mystery Duqu</b> <br>  The report is dedicated to Duqu, a complex Trojan program that seems to have been written by the creators of the notorious Stuxnet worm.  Its main goal is to act as a backdoor in the system, simplifying the theft of private information.  This is its main difference from Stuxnet, the main purpose of which was sabotage at industrial facilities. <br><br>  An analysis of the activities of the victim organizations and the nature of the information that interested Duqu authors leads to the conclusion that the attackers' main goal was any information about industrial production management systems in various industries, as well as about trade relations of a number of Iranian organizations. <br><br>  A number of signs indicate that the Duqu Trojan virus could exist as early as 2007-2008 in the form of earlier versions, as well as the fact that the Stuxnet worm was created on the basis of a certain platform that was used to create Duqu.  Moreover, the development of Duqu and Stuxnet could be conducted in parallel, at the same time. <br><br>  <b>Vitaliy Kamlyuk: Three recent stories about malware attacks on DBO systems</b> <br><br>  This report presents an analysis of three malicious programs that are the most active and high-tech at the moment.  The malicious program Lurk is one of the most active and hidden when attacking Russian banks.  The SpyEye malware distinguished itself this month by updating the module to monitor user actions via a webcam.  Cridex, seen in several large mass mailings, is the latest major competitor for Zeus and SpyEye to attack international banks and RBS systems. <br><br>  <b>Andrey Duhvalov: Protection of industrial information systems is a factor of human survival</b> <br><br>  Modern civilization unconditionally depends on information systems.  Particularly high degree of dependence in the industry.  Nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, oil and gas pipelines, national electricity distribution networks, national and world-class transportation systems are facilities controlled by information systems.  The protection of automated control systems for facilities that can affect the stability of countries, peoples and continents is a super challenge for IT security specialists. <br><br>  Now Kaspersky Lab is developing a security system for industrial information systems. <br><br>  <b>Maria Garnayeva: Methods of inserting sticks in the wheels of the botmasters: the Kelihos botnet</b> <br><br>  Kheli Tech and Microsoft, codenamed Operation b79, led to the interception (sinkholing) of the first Kelihos botnet.  In March 2012, Kaspersky Lab and the company CrowdStrike disabled the second botnet Kelihos, which its creators began to form immediately after losing the first one.  At the heart of both botnets lay the P2P architecture, which previously was theoretically considered invulnerable to Sinkholing. <br><br>  The presentation will examine the technical features of the sinkholing method with a description of the Kelihos communication protocol, changes in new botnet versions, and explain why sinkholing is a useful action from the speaker‚Äôs point of view, but only a temporary solution to neutralize botnets. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Nevstruev: Practical aspects of mobile security</b> <br><br>  How real are mobile threats?  Kaspersky Lab experts will show that infection is possible when using completely innocent things, such as Google search or playing Angry Birds.  We will also clearly consider the effective technologies for protecting mobile devices. <br>  It is noteworthy that most of the threats to mobile platforms come from Russia. <br><br>  <i>If you have any leading questions that you would like to ask at the event, you can ask them in the comments so that we can prepare well.</i>  <i>:) And if you can‚Äôt come, then also ask for topics that interest you - we will try to compensate a little for your absence.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143896/</a></p>
