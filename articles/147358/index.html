We have long been going to make a post about what products the company ASUS receive awards at various exhibitions.  But I didn‚Äôt want to do another post about laptops, netbooks, tablets or even motherboards.  And then there is the erroneous impression that the Taiwanese manufacturer doesn‚Äôt have anything interesting. <br><br>  In today's post we will try to get away from the format of a laptop announcement / laptop review, because ASUS has something else to see ( <i>and mention a little about the awards</i> ).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>ASUS EA-N66 Dual Band Wireless Ethernet Adapter</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/983/db9/92b/983db992b6c520ed5b5f9b90fbbd3c77.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The award in the category "Communications" at Computex 2012.</i> <br><br>  The adapter can operate in both Wi-Fi frequency bands and provide data rates of up to 450 Mbps in each of them.  It also has a convenient interface and can be used in three modes: Ethernet adapter, repeater or access point.  Repeater mode is used to enhance the wireless signal and increase the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãa Wi-Fi network.  If it is necessary to turn a wired router into a wireless one, it is enough to connect the EA-N66 to it and switch to the access point mode. <br><br>  The adapter allows you to use two frequency bands Wi-Fi - a fast range of 5 GHz and a slow range of 2.4 GHz (reserved for downloading files and surfing the web). <br><br>  And a little more about networking technologies.  At the Computex 2012 exhibition, ASUS introduced the <b>ASUS RT-AC66U wireless router.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39b/68b/211/39b68b211fd89934c3566da2df514c8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUS RT-AC66U is not just a wireless router operating in two frequency bands (2.4 and 5 GHz), but also an access center for a variety of cloud services.  For example, the ASUS Cloud Disk service provides remote access to content that resides on a disk device connected to the USB port of the router. <br><br>  RT-AC66U can be used as a multifunction device with 3G, FTP, DLNA or print server capabilities. <br><br>  Data rates in the 5 GHz band can reach 1.3 Gbps.  Considering that in the 2.4 GHz band the maximum data transfer rate is 450 Mbps, the total speed of this router is 1.75 Gbps. <br><br>  The RT-AC66U offers features that are already familiar to users of other ASUS high-speed routers.  These include the ability to quickly configure using the ASUS WRT control panel, the QoS Internet channel bandwidth allocation system, the Download Master download feature and many others.  RT-AC66U supports up to eight SSID identifiers, allowing you to create multiple wireless networks with different access rights at the same time, and is also fully compatible with the IPv6 protocol. <br><br>  The ASUS Smart Access service allows you to connect to your personal ‚Äúcloud‚Äù to share files between any compatible devices running Windows, Mac and Linux.  Moreover, such a device can even be removed remotely from sleep mode. <br><br>  ASUS Smart Sync makes it easy to sync data between local drives and ASUS WebStorage cloud storage.  Synchronization is performed automatically in the background. <br><br>  To implement access to the "cloud" file storage with modern security features and high speed data exchange, use the AiCloud application, available for free from the Play Store for Android devices and the App Store for iOS devices. <br><br>  <b>ASUS EB1033 Nettop</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbb/4ef/f77/bbb4eff77d88cc18f323d8bbef9bc61e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nettop interesting thin body, the volume of which is only one liter.  The discrete video card GeForce 610M (512 MB) is installed.  The nettop works on Intel Atom processors (Atom D2550 at 1.86 GHz or Atom D2700 with 2.13 GHz).  In the presence of 2 GB (with an expansion of up to 4 GB) of DDR3 RAM and HDD with a capacity of 320 GB.  On the case of 6 USB ports, headphone and microphone inputs, HDMI and VGA outputs. <br><br>  Detailed specifications you can study on the <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/EeeBox_PC/EeeBox_PC_EB1033/">site</a> , but not because of them nettop got into the review.  The device received an award in the Computex 2012 category of ‚ÄúEco-Friendly Technologies‚Äù. Using approximately 4% of the materials from which a regular desktop computer is made, the EB1033 boasts a high degree of processability - at least 90%.  Its annual energy consumption is 68.5% lower than that required by the Energy Star 5.2 standard, which makes it one of the most environmentally friendly and energy efficient computers at the moment. <br><br>  <b>ASUS P1 Portable LED Projector</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94d/1da/1d1/94d1da1d144af58c11e010cbb30b6e15.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The LED projector received an award in the Display and Digital Entertainment category of Computex 2012, and was unexpectedly awarded awards at several design competitions.</i> <br><br>  ASUS P1 is capable of projecting an image with a brightness of 200 lumens and a resolution of 1280x800 pixels.  It weighs only 415 g, and its dimensions are close to a regular CD case (126x34x130 mm).  The service life of the LED lamp is up to 30 thousand hours (4 hours a day will last for 20 years).  ASUS P1 is ready to work in 5 seconds after it is turned on, and its shutdown is instantaneous, without a long cooling period.  P1 is compatible with most ASUS laptop power supplies. <br><br>  Thanks to the small projection ratio (1.16: 1), you can get a projection sized to the screen of a 40-inch monitor by placing P1 one meter from the image.  The keystone correction function implemented in P1 automatically changes the image parameters in order to achieve perfect quality when projected at an angle. <br><br>  <b>ASUS O! Play TV Pro multimedia player with TV tuner:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45b/8e6/b4d/45b8e6b4df6cb66c8f64ef54126d17b0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The player received an award in the ‚ÄúDisplays and Digital Entertainment‚Äù category at Computex 2012.</i> <br><br>  ASUS O! Play TV Pro is a modern multimedia player with a built-in TV tuner for watching digital TV.  The preinstalled O! Easy software makes it easy to control the playback of multimedia files (more than 50 popular formats are supported) and to use many entertainment and informational online services. <br><br>  Thanks to the built-in digital TV tuner, O! Play TV Pro allows you to watch digital TV broadcasts in DVB-T format.  A convenient feature is the electronic program guide, with which you can program the TV tuner for the week ahead.  With an internal hard drive, the O! Play TV Pro can be used as a VCR to record TV shows.  Also supported is the ‚Äútime shift‚Äù feature, which provides the ability to pause the TV show to watch it later. <br><br>  And through the firmware ASUS O! Easy you can do the following: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ publish media files on Facebook; <br>  ‚Ä¢ repeat the last 7 seconds of the show; <br>  ‚Ä¢ broadcast files from computer to TV; <br>  ‚Ä¢ transfer multimedia files wirelessly from mobile devices to TV; <br>  ‚Ä¢ quickly play video files from USB disks or memory cards. <br><br>  <i>That's all for now.</i>  <i>If you like something, be sure to share your impressions, and we will tell you more about "atypical" products.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147358/</a></p>
