I climbed on Habrahabr to read reviews about this service, and ... I did not find anything (although judging by the references on the Internet, it seems to be there <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/4sync">for a long time already</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a7/183/32d/2a718332d764bf136978cbdb44288731.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Actually, then let's see what he is </h4><br>  The service is the brainchild of the <a href="http://www.4shared.com/">www.4shared.com</a> file-sharing service, with all the consequences - the lifting of restrictions of 200 megabytes per file, and it seems like cancellation / fewer restrictions on download / upload speed, in any case, the client was <nobr>15-24</nobr> in the testing process <nobr>megabit / sec,</nobr> when loading several full iso-images with ubuntu found on the computer. <br><br>  Getting to the site of the service, we see a brief description of the service, telling us about the opportunity to get free 15 gigabytes of cloud space and an offer to download the program. <br>  You can register for the service through the site by entering an email address and the desired password, then enter your name and but until you confirm your address you cannot use the service. <br>  Also through the program, the story with the activation is the same. 
      <br>

      The program can login using your existing <i>4shared</i> account. <br>  By the way, confirmation came to rambler-mail about an hour later, after the request, maybe I just had no luck.  The notification mail came to google mail immediately. <br><br><h4>  What do we have got an account? </h4><br>  15 gigabytes of disk space, a fairly convenient web interface, familiar to many standard Explorer-integrated interface for working with the cloud on a computer.  (True, for some reason I have a check mark on the completion of the download to the service, I put it right away, although the file is still being downloaded). <br>  Clients for Windows, Linux, Mac beta, as well as mobile clients: Android, Blackberry, iPhone, Symbian. <br><br>  By the way, the site interface is somewhat similar to the dropbox, but inside - the web interface is completely different, more like an evernote web interface. <br><br>  To get a link to a file, just select it in the web interface or right-click in the explorer and select the corresponding item in me - this is all standard.  I did not find the opportunity to get a direct link to the file, so using the service as a small picture-hosting will not work. <br><br><h4>  Torrent downloads </h4><br>  But on the other hand, there is an opportunity to get a link to the whole <a href="http://www.4sync.com/folder/Hpo55xQ4/Habr.html">folder</a> , leave comments to the files, and also for premium users, download the contents of the folders using torrent networks or as a zip archive. <br><br>  By the way for a <a href="http://www.4sync.com/file/gS8g21te/ubuntu-1204-desktop-i386__1_.html">single file</a> torrent link you can get a non-premium, and even simply unregistered users. <br><br>  A premium user can be anyone who wants <a href="http://www.4sync.com/payment.jsp">more disk space</a> , naturally for money. <br>  Although in the account settings you can see such a <a href="">label</a> , it seems to me that this information is taken from the main service <i>4shared.com</i> , because I didn‚Äôt see any restrictions on speed, and also seemed to have ads (apart from McAfee which they distribute, including with the installer) . <br>  Although it may in the future with increasing popularity it will, and downloading automatically will be the very direct links.  On the other hand, during the existence of the service, this inaccuracy would have already been fixed, if it were so? <br><br>  If someone can confirm or deny this fact - I will be glad to add a post. <br><br>  I was pleasantly surprised to find this service.  In particular, I was attracted by the opportunity to give a link to a folder with all the features of the service, and downloading a file using torrent networks.  After all, in the case of downloading a somehow common file - the same image or distribution kit, or a movie - other content carriers will be picked up for distribution. <br><br>  There is one caveat when creating public folders - you should pay attention to it, otherwise you can lose the files put in the specified folder, or you don‚Äôt want to get something, including virus.  Copying the public link to the folder - it automatically becomes publicly available.  Fully public.  You can rename it, you can create many other folders in it - you can load anything into it, and if you guess with the name of the neighboring shared folders, you can change them (the folders that exist there by default). <br>  In order to cut such a raspberry, you need to right-click on the folder in the web interface to change its properties.  There everything is extremely simple, you can give rights only to read, add, change, etc. <br>  But the opportunity to give someone (who you really want, for example, a password) the ability to download to you directly to your computer, as long as you do not have the file you need - the opportunity is still convenient.  The main thing is to use the provided mechanism. <br><br>  Who has also tried out and wants to share his impressions - welcome to the discussion. <br><br>  UPD: Yes, when you receive a link to a file through a web interface, there is a link ‚Äúdirect link‚Äù, when you click on which you are offered to purchase a premium account: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/517/625/ef9/517625ef92e828bc8814f5c6087a30d4.png"><br><br>  UPD2: Links removed from the post.  Opening a shared access to a folder allows you to change the contents in it at your discretion even to unregistered users. <br>  Keep this in mind when publishing links to folders on shared resources. <br><br>  UPD3: Added details about changing the rights to public folders. <br><br>  UPD4: Free account is deleted when inactive for 180 days.  Therefore, at least once in half a year, you need to go to the site, or run the program.
