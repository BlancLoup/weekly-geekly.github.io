  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fashion for group suicide came to Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few years ago, fashion group suicides appeared in Japan and became a real nightmare for the local police.  Every month in the newspapers appear regular notes about new deaths.  To go out of their lives together or three of them has already become commonplace - this does not even happen to the press.  Another thing, together with five or six. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The record case of group suicide happened three years ago in the suburbs of Tokyo, when the police immediately found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/international/asia/13japan.html">nine corpses</a> .  Six teenagers and a woman were found in a minibus outside the city - they were poisoned by carbon monoxide after taking sleeping pills.  That same evening, two more girls were found near them, who died in the same way. <br><br>  The police reported that nine suicides, apparently, had agreed to meet through one of the websites.  A typical case in Japan, where with the help of the Internet more than a hundred people kill themselves a year.  In the Japanese Internet, special suicide sites have been operating for a long time.  People discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.  You can also buy special medicines and kits for painless care of life.  The most important thing is that there you can always find a partner and like-minded person with whom it will be easier to take the last step. <br><br>  No need to think that group suicides are exclusively Japanese fashion.  The same begins in Russia.  It would be strange to assume otherwise, because Russia ranks second in the world in the number of suicides per capita.  Here is the <a href="http://soldatjain.livejournal.com/9275.html">message</a> ( <a href="http://yandex-top-ru.livejournal.com/673811.html">copy</a> ) under the heading "I am looking for" appeared yesterday in the <a href="http://soldatjain.livejournal.com/">soldatjain</a> LJ-diary:

    <blockquote>  <i>looking for a second (3-4 ..) for suicide Moscow</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I will not answer here only in 233-784-498!</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><br>  The following is a quote from <a href="http://www.lib.ru/EKZUPERY/citadel.txt">Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's Citadel</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  <i>There is no need for the suffering, those who rest in the bosom of the Lord and who are in mourning for them.</i>  <i>The departed, who is remembered, is more alive and mightier living.</i>  <i>I see the confusion of the living and pity them.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I want to heal them from melancholy and hopelessness.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I am compassionate to the one who opened his eyes in the forefathering darkness and believed that God's stars were his home and suddenly realized that he was on the way.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I forbid questioning him, for I know: there is no answer that would deplete curiosity.</i>  <i>The questioner opens the abyss.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The depths of the heart are known to me, and I know: having saved the thief from poverty, I will not spare him from the desire to steal, and condemn the anxiety that drives the thief to a crime.</i>  <i>He is mistaken in thinking that he is bothering someone else's gold.</i>  <i>Gold glows like a star.</i>  <i>Love, even if it does not know that it is love, needs only light, but not the power of men to appropriate light to itself.</i>  <i>The flicker fascinates the thief, and he steals for theft, like a madman, that bucket after bucket scoops out the black water of the spring to grab the moon.</i>  <i>A thief steals and, in a fleeting flame, the orgies hurl the dust of a pilfer.</i>  <i>And again he stands in the dark around the corner, pale, as if before a date, motionless for fear of scaring away, hoping that it is here that he will find once that he quenches his thirst.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you brought me a treasure, let it be so fragile that take away</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I can have it a faint breeze of wind.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How dear to me are young faces, defenseless before old age.</i>  <i>How sweet a smile, defenseless in front of me and ready to be replaced by tears.</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><br>  Apparently, this is the first case of a public search for a partner in suicide in RuNet.  We still do not have specialized sites where these people could calmly, apart from the rest of the public, discuss their problems.  Therefore, the process began in the largest community of Runet - on the site Livejournal.  Naturally, this blog post has already been completed with dozens of silly comments, got into the Top 30 of the most popular Livejournal entries, after which it was closed from prying eyes. <br><br>  <i>Related Links:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://mydeathspace.com/deaths.aspx">Dead Bloggers Memorial</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/suicide_ru/">Suicide community</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate">The number of suicides per capita in different countries</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5038/</a></p>
