  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What mobile devices do public transport passengers prefer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a7/a9e/d37/9a7a9ed376f34c5eac0265db90b96df5.png"><br><br>  Every weekday, a huge number of people living in the Moscow region, but working in Moscow, spend a lot of time trying to get to the office first and then return home.  You yourself can be one of the regular users of public transport.  Yota together with TelecomDaily found out from which devices, what content and under what conditions (including from the cellular operator) the residents of the Moscow region consume, getting from the region to work in the capital - and we are ready to share with you the results of this study. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The study involved two thousand residents of the Moscow region, who come daily by train to the capital.  In particular, polls were conducted at the Timiryazevskaya stations (residents of Lobnya and Dmitrov, as well as nearby villages), Kolomenskoye (Domodedovo, Kashira, Stupino), Petrovsko-Razumovskaya (Zelenograd, Klin) and at the Yaroslavsky station (Mytishchi, Fryazino, Sergiev Posad, Pushkino). <br><br>  We were interested in traffic sources, how much people are willing to spend per month on paid content, which social networks prefer, the services of which operators they use, etc.  We paid attention to the mobile device model of users, and also tried to establish whether there is a connection between the format of using the device and the model itself.  In addition, we wanted to know if customers notice changes in their gadget format (they began to spend more / less, more / less often go beyond the limit), what are the main tasks for the device (local video / streaming, social networks, music, mail, surfing, games online / offline and what type of content (paid / free) consumed by users.

      We divided the users' mobile devices into three classes: smartphones (screen sizes up to 5.5 inches), phablets (5.5-7 inches) and tablets (from 7 inches).  Nearly a third of respondents had neither a smartphone nor a tablet - and in the further survey they did not participate. <br><br>  Then we figured out the level of popularity of mobile OS: as expected, the majority (72%) use Android devices, 23% on iOS, 4% on WindowsPhone and 1% totally typed Symbian, Blackberry, WindowsMobile and tablets on Windows. <br><br>  How many tablet owners are among users?  It turns out, only 8%.  But on the tablets most often (in 92% of cases) they watch the video - the highest penetration rate with an average value of 55%. <br><br>  Among the owners of phablets (11%), the video is watched by only 68%, on smartphones this figure is even less - 49%. <br>  What else, besides video, are mobile devices used on the way?  87% spend time on social networks, 82% read mail, 71% surf the web.  Mobile games occupy the attention of 32% of users, and music fans complete the list - 31% of them. <br><br><h3>  Content: sources and types of traffic </h3><br>  The most popular social networks are in the following order: VKontakte (66%), Odnoklassniki (23%), Instagram (18%), Facebook (13%), Twitter (5%) and 2% accumulated in total ‚ÄúMy World‚Äù and Google+. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/bc2/65d/7aabc265dd01494aa0d78bbc15cf5074.png"><br><br>  The overwhelming majority (91%) prefer local games.  Only 15% choose online games, but among them there is a large proportion of those who also play offline games. <br><br>  As for the video, only 10% download content in advance, while 93% prefer to immediately watch videos on YouTube, on social networks, via instant messengers, etc. <br><br>  Buy content, only 6% of respondents.  Basically, these are players and owners of expensive smartphones, in particular, music buyers are noticed in iTunes.  All others do not download paid applications and do not buy multimedia content.  Among the reasons for such an uneven distribution, customers in particular cited the fact that information should be free. <br><br>  54% of respondents admitted that it is important for them to predict communication costs.  We can not but recall that Yota offers users to control costs in a mobile application, even when abroad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/468/61b/f44/46861bf44e4e4db7802a18b8872a1479.png"><br><br>  We note another interesting point: in the course of the study, we were able to identify patterns of dependence of the traffic structure and the devices used on the age of the respondents.  People from 40 years of age generally consume more voice traffic than young people (16-25 years old) and middle-aged people (25-40 years old).  At the same time, a group of 40 years old uses the least Internet traffic.  Leading the consumption of traffic middle-aged people. <br><br>  Among the middle age group, the maximum penetration of flagships (iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S, etc.): it accounts for 72% of all devices in this category, while young people and the older generation have mostly budget smartphones and models of the average price category.  The budget devices are more in the older generation, and among the youth, the devices of the middle price category dominate, and the flagships of 2-4 years old are also prevalent. <br><br>  Travel time is an opportunity to use the mobile Internet, entertaining yourself or gaining additional knowledge.  As we found out in the course of the study, many people use this and need unlimited internet, good coverage and affordable connection.  A significant part of Yota users are residents of Moscow and the Moscow region, where we use more than 23 thousand base stations, working on the Scartel and MegaFon powerful network.  All our clients have access to high quality of communication and real unlimited internet in 2G / 3G / 4G networks. <br><br>  Now tell you - what content do you most often consume from your phone / tablet?  Maybe you, too, happened to take part in this study?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278007/</a></p>
