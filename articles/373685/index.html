There are no questions for network equipment, which cannot be said about power supplies that often fail.  In most cases, repair of these switching power supplies (UPS), private repair organizations are not taken due to the lack of repair schemes and high density of placement of radio components.  In addition, the cost of one power supply from official representatives exceeds 50 thousand rubles per unit (53 tr. Aug. 2016). <br><br>  The gap in the absence of a repair scheme was solved by reverse engineering, a ‚Äúdonor‚Äù power supply unit, a soldering iron and a flashlight.  Who is interested in the scheme of this power supply and its description, please: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One unit was unsoldered so that it was possible to examine all the tracks of the circuit board and get to the hidden radio elements.  The printed circuit board, as it turned out, is remarkably translucent with an ordinary lantern.  Thus, the scheme, gradually, was copied on paper, and then in Visio.  The scheme has the character of repair and does not claim to be the factory assembly scheme, because the values ‚Äã‚Äãof all elements (especially SMD capacitors) could not be considered.  But, if the face values ‚Äã‚Äãare very necessary, they can be ‚Äúpulled out‚Äù of the official datasheet to the main components of the scheme.  For example, the scheme of the KKM power supply unit scarves almost completely corresponds to the description of its UC3854N controller.

By the way, Scribd strongly ‚Äúcut‚Äù the graphic information in the document, so if you just need to look through it, you can see it in the web, if you need to work with the document, better download it.  The repair experience of this block is about 1.5 years.  I think more than 20 of these power supplies passed through my hands.  All characteristic failures, successful / unsuccessful repair experience recorded in this file. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/355502810/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25A1%25D1%2585%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B-%25D0%2598%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BF-Prn150m-6">Description of the operation of the UPS circuit PRN150M-6.doc (Scribd.com)</a> <br><br>  There is a basic electrical diagram in the document, but sometimes you need to have it more credible, sometimes you need to fix it, print it out on a large format, mark something, so I also post the * .vsd (Visio) file with the electrical schema on Google.docs separately. <br><br>  Electrical Diagram in Visio: <br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8u3xrasJmxkcVFjeEdWZjJmTms/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">BPU PRN150M-6.vsd scheme (Google.docs 1.2Mb).</a> <br><br><hr><br>  Backup references in case the previous 2 "broke": <br>  GoogleDrive link to archive with backup source files (diagram and block description): <br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8u3xrasJmxkM1Z2dXRHTWh5OEk/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">Backup GoogleDrive documents</a> <br>  Microsoft OneDrive link to archive with backup source files (diagram and block description): <br>  <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhbMSgb07DCYgWEcQYnTNyjVcHxS">Microsoft OneDrive backup copy</a> <br><hr><br></div></div><br>  For the "mass" repair of this power supply, I recommend to make a kind of "stand" for fixing the printed circuit board, so that it is safer and you can reach all the radio elements.  What is a ‚Äústand‚Äù of: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9e4/33a/13b/9e433a13bb534474b16bd82340f932c8.jpg"><br>  <em>Stand of check and repair of the power supply unit PRN150M-6 (EM9005 PS / AC)</em> <br><br>  Two hard plates capable of removing heat.  Plates of the same size, but with different placement of holes for fasteners for cooling radioelements.  I found some kind of sandwich panels for wall decoration.  Aluminum panels with a layer of an insulator, thickness, millimeters 5. In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmounting of the printed circuit board, the plate should be insulated.  I just scraped one layer of aluminum from a sandwich: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ac/397/703/5ac397703c2a434d9a59d867fbfdb8f8.jpg"><br>  <em>Stand check and repair power supply.</em>  <em>The board is isolated from the ‚Äústand‚Äù plates.</em> <br><br>  In the right places on the plates are fixed small corners for attaching the printed circuit board to the "stand".  After assembling and screwing all the radio elements, the stand behaves tough, removes heat well, makes it possible to "poke" in the entire "stuffing" of the power supply.  There is another option to make a stand for checking these blocks.  Take one "donor".  The case is cut with an engraving machine, or rather, cut the bottom, leaving all the fasteners in the right places.  But - sorry.  On the other hand, if you have 30 pieces of these blocks, and besides you no one can repair them - flag in hand - safely cut one case.  For, as in any repair, there comes at least one non-repairable power supply unit, in which the transformer has burned down and, frankly speaking, is too lazy to mess around with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f21/99f/165/f2199f1650084224acc8df4b4b8cad75.jpg"><br>  <em>Stand check and repair power supply.</em>  <em>All electrical circuits are available.</em> <br><br>  Even for the test, you will need a power cord with an E27 watt incandescent lamp at 95 at the break (the worst option), or a 220/220 V isolation transformer, also with a restrictive safety lamp in the secondary winding (the best option, especially if you have RCD machines).  This is all described in the * .doc file.  All this is necessary for your own safety, and you don‚Äôt burn radio elements in case of ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù repair. <br><br>  Special thanks to the guys from the cxem.net forum for their help in explaining the principles of operation of the CMC.  <a href="http://forum.cxem.net/index.php%3F/topic/105305-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BC-pfc/%26page%3D40">Here is the discussion of the failure of the CMC in this power supply</a> . <br><br>  Thanks for attention!
