Want to create your own story?  Fire in the data center, cyber attack, and need to be saved?  Or maybe your office was attacked by green men?  Or do you not believe in aliens?  You can create your own history and save humanity yourself, with your own hands! <br><br>  We offer you to plunge into this world full of surprises.  You will have to fight, and not only intellectually.  Our top speakers can help you in this endeavor. <br>  No boring tasks!  Break the brain, take a break from coding, talk to the speakers!  Come off in full and complete the quest! <br><br>  You can participate either alone or with a team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/ql/0j/jmql0jwgx6ggysz2zw1_cjjjrnw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Tote on the best speaker </h3><br>  After a certain time after the conference, the organizers of DotNext publish a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/436292/">report</a> "Top 10 best reports."  Seats are completely dependent on the voting participants of the conference.  We suggest you play a tote on the position of this rating.  Let's identify among us experts who most accurately predict the results.  The essence of the game is simple - each participant receives 1000 points, which he can distribute in the form of bets.  You can make bets on a certain place in the ranking from 1 to 10, and to hit the top 3, top 5 and top 10.  After the results are published, the winners for each group of bets are put down, and for triggered bets the amount of points awarded is doubled. <br><br>  Bids will be accepted until the end of May: <br><br><ul><li>  right at the conference through activists at the community stand; </li><li>  via telegram chat: <a href="https://t.me/dotnext_rates%3B">t.me/dotnext_rates;</a> </li><li>  via e-mail: <a href="">oms@dotnet.ru</a> . </li></ul><br>  The prize for the winner by the number of points scored will be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pro-NET-Benchmarking-Performance-Measurement/dp/1484249402">book by</a> Andrey Akinshin ‚ÄúPro .NET Benchmarking‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dv/jg/oc/dvjgocs1y5ai3wdx8ifjzzuawag.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Know our </h3><br>  If you have not yet decided what to go for DotNext, you should know: both days we will be handing out compulsory gifts to all participants in T-shirts (as well as sweatshirts, panama, socks, aprons, etc.) with a global logo or from any local community! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/mj/a3/wdmja3-f2c7nb6rrrhpnevua6a0.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Meeting program </h2><br>  <b>May 15.</b>  <b>Day 1</b> <br><br>  12:00 - 13:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Elizaveta Golenok, Dmitry Nesteruk, Nikita Tsukanov ‚ÄúRound table: New technologies to be‚Äù</a> <br><br>  14:00 - 15:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Anatoly Kulakov, Alexey Merson, Maxim Arshinov, Vagif Abilov, Konstantin Gustov ‚ÄúRound table: Domain Driven Design: the beginning‚Äù</a> <br><br>  16:00 - 17:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Yulia Tsisyk ‚ÄúHow our communities work‚Äù</a> <br><br>  17:30 - 18:30 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Yuri Kerbitskov ‚Äú.NET Core Application Domains‚Äù</a> <br><br>  19:00 - 20:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Yana Golubeva, Yury Orlov "Quiz"</a> <br><br>  <b>16th of May.</b>  <b>Day 2</b> <br><br>  12:00 - 13:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Yuri Kerbitskov "Efficiency of the programmer"</a> <br><br>  14:00 - 15:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Roman Nevolin, Vagif Abilov ‚ÄúRound table: Functional paradigms‚Äù</a> <br><br>  16:00 - 17:00 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Nikita Tsukanov "Exhibition of Achievements of the National Avalon Building"</a> <br><br>  17:30 - 18:30 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">Elizaveta Golenok "dotQUEST: Results"</a> <br><br><a name="section1512"></a><h3>  Elizaveta Golenok, Dmitry Nesteruk, Nikita Tsukanov ‚ÄúRound table: New technologies to be‚Äù </h3><br>  Have you worked in the same company for many years?  Or did you come to work in a large company with a lot of legacy?  Do you want to write on .NET Core, use deconstructors, named tuples and immediately after the release of C # 8.0 implement nullable features and async streams?  Is it worth doing?  Why not all companies are ready to adhere to current trends?  Or maybe it's just worth talking to someone from the management, and it turns out that not everything is so scary?  We will raise these and other questions regarding new technologies at our round table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/uf/ti/obuftirn-lnxzk_yht7hngwq43y.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/p2/dz/o4p2dzbdetqnfc9prhid1fsqouo.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/b9/yq/b6b9yqdu3rzpfn7fsjkvt0uuwls.jpeg"><br><br><a name="section1514"></a><h3>  Anatoly Kulakov, Alexey Merson, Vagif Abilov, Konstantin Gustov, Maxim Arshinov ‚ÄúRound table: Domain Driven Design: the beginning‚Äù </h3><br>  It seems to many that Domain Driven Design is a silver bullet, and the main thing for using it is to master some technical patterns.  But, before you write at least a line of code, you need to do a lot of other work: build work with the customer, isolate the bounded context, etc.  What and how to do at this stage will be discussed at our round table.

Meanwhile, with the advent of .NET Core, the concept of assembly isolation, loading / unloading and security aspects has changed, and now we have to use new techniques. <br><br>  As part of the report, let's recall what application domains are, how things are going with them in .NET Core, and talk about how to use the AssemblyLoadContext class, which represents the new paradigm of load contexts. <br><br>  In the report: <br><br><ul><li>  We will tell you how to work with dynamically loadable assemblies from .NET Core; </li><li>  We learn that there are no more application domains as such in .NET Core; </li><li>  We will get acquainted with new techniques for isolating assemblies, loading / unloading and safety aspects. </li></ul><br>  After listening to the report, we will better understand how the .NET Core and .NET Framework work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/dg/ll/lydgllottpck8dsge-xosbmrcpq.jpeg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  He started his way as a programmer as a Delphi developer, but then fell in love with the .NET platform and C # in particular.

Let's recall the individual reports that were presented there, as well as some historical facts about DotNext.

You may have already heard about "ten-time" programmers.  These are programmers who are 10 times more productive than ordinary programmers.  How do they do it?  We will try to approach the answer to this question within the framework of the report.  We'll talk about Hard Skills and Soft Skills.  Consider what the Eisenhower matrix, the tomato method, and other efficiency enhancement techniques are.  And also we will listen to what experienced developers advise, what approaches their thoughts converge on and how an ordinary tea can make you a much more productive and efficient developer.  After the report, you should have no doubt that each of you can become a ‚Äútenfold‚Äù programmer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/dg/ll/lydgllottpck8dsge-xosbmrcpq.jpeg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  He started his way as a programmer as a Delphi developer, but then fell in love with the .NET platform and C # in particular.
