  <section class="page js-page"><h1>linkCharge.Offline: method of payment for products and services for offline buyers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Online payment processing Paysto does not stop improving its services.  In particular, <a href="http://paysto.ru/ru/products/linkCharge">Paysto</a> ‚Äôs linkCharge billing and receiving service has expanded its functionality, and now it works not only on the Internet, but also in an offline environment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The reason for this decision turned out to be obvious and simple: some Web users are not yet ready to sell the fee via the Internet, and still prefer to pay for the purchased goods and services in the usual, more traditional way, via bank transfers, and also when the recipient needs a set of documents, for example, to justify a payment in the bank.  It was to them that the Paysto developers went, providing the option of the linkCharge.Offline service. <br><br>  The meaning of his work and the fundamental difference from the online version of linkCharge is that the customer realizes the payment offline, using the usual form of payment on the receipt or payment order at the bank, and can also receive, if necessary, the originals of all the documentation related to the order, with stamps and signatures of the performer.

      In addition, the customer does not need to fill out any online forms in the Paysto system (as is the case with the online linkCharge service).  Before you create an invoice for your client, the contractor in your Personal Cabinet creates a new buyer, indicating in the appropriate form the necessary information about him, as well as his postal address, to which the original documents will be sent, if necessary later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/081/6f4/ee6/0816f4ee69ec088b1d8033900a840009.jpg"><br>  When the buyer is created, you can invoice him, which will be provided to the customer for payment.  The invoice contains information about the work performed: its type and characteristics, cost, and the total amount to be paid.  It also marks the deadline for the execution of the order for which the contractor is responsible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f0/681/a6c/4f0681a6c3c8892c7a3bcf34c1d73cf7.jpg"><br>  Paysto system generates a set of documents that must be provided to the customer in confirmation of the work being done.  This is the actual invoice for payment, the contract with the customer and its annex, as well as the act of accepting the work performed.  These documents can be downloaded from the system to the computer in different formats - html, .doc, .xls and PDF.  An invoice necessary for legal entities is also formed in the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a04/4d1/917/a044d1917f834b15bdbc70576fefc873.jpg"><br>  Further, the documents must be handed over to the customer - either electronically by e-mail, or printed out and sent by regular mail or handed in person.  Upon receipt of copies of documents, the customer can pay the invoice.  It is important that in this case, when using the linkCharge.Offline service, the customer can pay only with a bank transfer of an individual in any bank of Russia or a payment order from the settlement account of a legal entity in a servicing bank, all other payment methods, such payments through terminals, bank cards and electronic money, which work in the online version of linkCharge, are not yet available to him. <br><br>  When the account is paid and the funds are credited to the Paysto bank account, the following happens.  After 14 days they will be automatically credited to the account of the contractor.  If the contractor submits to the Paysto the original acceptance certificate signed by the customer, the funds will be credited immediately.  All information about the transaction, of course, is displayed in the Executive Personal Account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ef/fee/ec6/0effeeec631377ed6294ac541243db8a.jpg"><br>  Finally, some customers may require the provision of originals of all documents on the transaction.  This service is also provided in linkCharge.Offline, and you can order originals for the desired project in the ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù section of the Personal Cabinet.  To do this, check all the documents whose originals are required.  Employees of Paysto will send by regular mail the signed and sealed original documents to the customer‚Äôs address specified by the Contractor in the Personal Account when creating the buyer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/030/7ba/39d/0307ba39d9d0c33e2c6f7df5c54ccd13.jpg"></div><br>  As already mentioned, after 14 days or after the submission of a certificate of completion from the customer, the funds are credited to the contractor‚Äôs account with Paysto.  In the future, he can dispose of them at his own discretion - withdraw them to his bank account, VISA / MasterCard card or to WebMoney wallet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142478/</a></p>
