Oddly enough, the mail really delivers, and does it well.  For a few thousand shoals shoals just a few.  Of course, this applies to regular mail, not EMS.  The latter (though also part of the mail) for some reason differ in a much higher percentage of broken boxes.  Maybe unloaded in a hurry.

      In about 2010, special double or triple boxes were needed to be sent by mail - this made the order more expensive, but more or less ensured that the games would reach without depressed corners.  The complexity of our deliveries, unlike, for example, from books, is that if you put a cast iron pipe on top of a book, the book will endure.  And the game will sell.  As practice showed, the Post of the Russian Federation then, it seems, drove a lot of heavy and rough. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : See <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/304090/">who</a> came in the post.  You can tell him about your particular case. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2012, the situation began to change, and in 2014, it was precisely corrected to the level that we are just giving away in ordinary branded mail boxes.  True, stuffed with something for lack of backlash inside.  From the moment when orders began to reach steadily, we began to work not directly (previously in the office and then a special person was in charge of the packaging and delivery to the department), but through the counterparty.  We give to the service on the same principle as the courier, they pack up there themselves, consolidate and send themselves.  It seems that they worked through the department where Ozon is still hosted, so specifically at the point of departure there are no delays or problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/900/152/07e/90015207efdb421e89ed47b35d8bffe7.jpeg"><br>  <sup>This is what a regular courier did on the car, not the mail.</sup> <br><br>  The problems are the following: firstly, sometimes instead of air delivery, the mail silently sends ground.  This most often ends tragically for the recipient, but in the reports the post insists that it sent the air (or acknowledges and recounts, but the problem of waiting is still there).  There were five such problems, probably for a couple of years.  In this case, the cost differs by 3 times, and the period - by 3-4 times. <br><br>  In May of this year, EMS showed unexpected intelligence and, seeing the recipient's address in London, Canada (this is at the specified index), for some reason decided that London is from the capital of Great Britain.  In response to a request, they first said that the redirect could not be released anymore, a very complicated international incident.  We, of course, immediately sent a second parcel.  At that moment, when she crossed the border of the Russian Federation, the first track suddenly transformed.  Rate it (need to read upwards): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a93/e70/50c/a93e7050c5ec4cb991d9bb6fc4467711.png"><br><br>  In general, they are cool guys in the country, but as soon as it comes to the border, questions begin.  For example, we made a shipment with a delivery cost of about 4 thousand rubles.  It reached the customs, not passed, returned.  We paid for the re-shipment, and it passed normally. <br><br>  <b>In Russia, they very often lose notifications</b> ; this is literally a typical situation.  Therefore, we do not believe them, and we send every parcel with tracking.  As soon as it becomes possible to see the adventures of the package via the link, this link is immediately sent to the client.  Sometimes we know the estimated time of arrival in the settlement and, at the end of the plug, if the event ‚Äúorder received‚Äù or ‚Äúorder canceled‚Äù did not come, we send another letter.  With useful tips, they say, it's time to call the post office, ask, should already be there. <br><br>  All orders we send for full prepayment, cash on delivery is not working.  At the same time, if we deliver a marriage, we bear the responsibility ourselves - we immediately send the goods, and then we deal ourselves one-on-one with the mail.  Over the past year there was one obvious joint - the buyer complained about the long delivery to the Far East.  They really violated their own norms.  As a result, we immediately compensated the cost of delivery to the buyer, and the post office compensated the cost to us.  But for consideration of the claim they take up to 8 months, which is far from operational. <br><br>  In regular mail, it also happens that the buyer did not have time to pick up the order from the office (even taking into account a long time, the ‚ÄúI was on a business trip‚Äù combo, the ‚Äúlost notification‚Äù and the ‚Äútracking tupil‚Äù syncope still work fine).  After the call in the middle of the term still happens.  In such an outcome, when receiving information that the order travels back to us, we once again clarify the relevance of the order, if necessary - we send it again, but the client pays for the second time. <br><br>  <b>Very often with this delivery by mail is not the fastest and cheapest</b> .  We have garters with couriers almost everywhere in the central part of the Russian Federation, and they know how to deliver through special hubs much faster and more precisely, right to the door.  You can save 200 rubles per order, but it will be twice as fast, with a predictable time limit, and with responsibility for delays.  In addition, the courier is usually far more precisely responsible for our marriage, which dramatically increases their responsibility.  Because of this, we have a special process where the operator recounts the delivery in various ways and offers alternatives, if any.  Here, for example, a review from Market, illustrating the situation: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúI live in Kazan myself, but I delivered it to Vladimir, I made an order and chose the delivery method by mail to Russia.</i>  <i>After I paid for the order, the operator called me and offered to deliver my order by courier, as it turned out this method was cheaper than mail delivery to the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>In the end, I canceled the order, the money on the card came back very quickly and I made the order again.</i>  <i>Everything went very clean and smooth. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>hexew</i> </blockquote><br>  Now we are holding the money from the card and doing a partial debauchery so that these dances with a tambourine about the cancellations of the order are not there.  The hold is turned into actual charge at the moment when the order is sent to the buyer. <br><br>  With these couriers, by the way, we‚Äôve just gotten into trouble.  I have already told how some services decided to save on the outsourcing of couriers in Irkutsk, and as a result, brave guys, it seems, specially ottormazhival orders.  They simply did not call the client and waited until he himself turned back, and they read a few rubles for additional storage.  We definitely refused to work with four large partners with good logistics networks because of the quality of the couriers.  Because we don't need such a picture at all: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Advantages: Quick, clear search on the site, quick response to the order, call back in 15-20 minutes, everything is notified by mail, the operator speaks affably, the next day delivery, a convenient delivery time is offered, excellent mailings are funny, funny, interesting!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Disadvantages: Rude, rude talking courier, delivery should be before 15.00, it was promised that the courier would call, but the courier did not call, had to call herself!</i>  <i>When I called the courier, he rudely said, ‚ÄúThere are many of you here,‚Äù ‚Äúyou are my last on the list,‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what they told you at the company, I‚Äôll deliver it when I can.‚Äù</i>  <i>This VERY spoils the impression of all the work of the company.</i>  <i>Even under the condition that everything else was fine, but the delivery in vrok is half the total impression.</i>  <i>And, if this condition is not met, and even the courier is rude behaves, it crosses out everything else. "</i> <i><br></i>  <i>borisova-boss</i> </blockquote><br>  We solved this problem with a slightly more expensive delivery (about 40 rubles), but the problems stopped.  Plus, buyers had a notification scheme - first by mail, and then, on the day of delivery, an SMS about ‚Äúcourier left Vasily, number such and such‚Äù, before ‚ÄúYou will have the courier in an hour‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, if you have a store, try to order with delivery to yourself.  So you learn a lot of new and interesting, especially about the fact that the absence of a call an hour before delivery is very inconvenient. <br><br>  Something like that.  Well, I remind you, there are more various jambs with analyzes in this <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/225605/">post in</a> 2014. <br><br>  There, a representative of the Post of the Russian Federation appeared in the comments below.  You can carry him specific cases.  Hold on, Dmitry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304090/</a></p>
