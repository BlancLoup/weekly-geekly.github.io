  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the new Aftershokz Sportz Titanium: another bone conduction headset that can be tied into a knot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Aftershokz has replaced the Sportz Titanium wired version of its Sportz headphones and headsets, dramatically improving sound transmission quality, sound absorption performance and body refinement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d3/146/2e4/7d31462e4ebe418c90bc82feade6c321.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Headphones with bone conduction sound should not be confused (and compared) with headphones that <i>use</i> bone transfer technology.  In the latter, sound emitters are built into the ear cushions, and most of the energy is not transmitted through the air, which prevents bass from damaging the eardrum.  Such headphones, as a rule, belong to the type of overhead and cover the ears of the listener. <br><br>  Aftershokz headsets use <b>only</b> bone conduction, and this means that they do not cover their ears at all.  There are currently three main headsets in the line: Bluez 2s, the flagship is Trekz Titanium and the new Sportz models.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/409/cde/47d/409cde47db0d4fd89a0c9e26e782f28c.JPG"><br><br>  Titanium, or as they say ‚ÄúTaytenium‚Äù, is primarily distinguished by a flexible and durable headband that holds the shape perfectly, does not break. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ed/134/db3/6ed134db384e4a7b982b57664e871076.JPG"><br><br>  And also it is very light - the latest model, which will be discussed: the approximate weight of the headband is 20 grams, the weight together with the wire is 44 grams. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  The sound has always been controversial and partly the ‚Äúweak‚Äù side of bone-conduction headsets, because they were inevitably compared with the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù ones.  Nevertheless, even when Trekz was edited by Verge in its usual manner, nothing was found except the usual ‚Äúweak bass‚Äù. <br><br>  Indeed, piezo emitters transmit low frequencies worse, which is why bone conduction of sound has gotten better in such industries as medicine, military science, scuba diving, and some others.  However, Verge recognizes that in the category of headphones based on this technology, Aftershokz is still the best. <br><br>  The company itself emphasizes that it did not create headsets for music lovers.  The main target audience - athletes (running and cycling), which such headband design allows you to feel more secure, respond to the sounds of the world around you, as well as answer calls. <br><br>  Also, models are in demand as headsets for motorists, for those who listen to audio lessons or books, where sound quality is not of primary importance, or as an office headset. <br><br>  But - bass, it must be admitted, still not the strongest place.  To get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow unusual everything is, you can use common <a href="http://misterfog.ru/check-yourself/">tests from the network</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/189/67d/c03/18967dc03e014d4fb1e004ba5d496ece.png"><br><br>  I quote literally.  On checking the bass compared to regular headphones (there were <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/croise-r-pbh-200.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_campaign%3Dcroise%26utm_medium%3Dsportz">Croise</a> gags at hand): <br><br><ul><li>  Aftershokz - the sound with open ears was heard at 80, the sound with ears plugged at 60 </li><li>  Croise - the sound is heard, as expected, on 20 </li></ul><br>  In the second case, with high frequencies: <br><br><ul><li>  Aftershokz - sound on 18 </li><li>  Croise - sound on 16 </li></ul><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br>  By and large constructively, such headphones could be anything, since, depending on the quality of the dynamics, bone conduction will work from the forehead, and - as is possible with Aftershokz - from the elbow. <br><br>  Nevertheless, historically, headphones are mounted on the head, and Aftershokz Sportz Titanium follows tradition.  The only difference is that the speakers ‚Äúthrow in‚Äù through the ears, like the arms of glasses, and are located in the temple area, without overlapping the auricles. <br><br>  The wired model came out unusually light.  Partly due to the fact that the battery, which is "sewn" in the case of Bluetooth-models, put to the wire.  On the same block is a button on the headset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/909/29d/d6a/90929dd6a883497c8f3ce72227d0a0e8.JPG"><br><br>  Here is the connector for charging the gadget!  Since the sound vibrations pass through a much more ‚Äúdense material‚Äù - the bones of the skull - they need more energy, and even wired headphones with bone conduction sound need to be charged. <br><br>  The remaining control buttons are in a separate element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/9e9/3cd/4789e93cdb5d492283c39b94f7bda615.JPG"><br><br>  Speakers Sportz Titanium Round. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b6/331/c0a/3b6331c0a6dc41648545930a561d3f22.JPG"><br><br>  <b>In sports</b> <br><br>  For the most part, behind the headphones with bone conduction technology, the image of the ‚Äúsports‚Äù stuck because of the fact that they do not cover the ears.  However, since the first consumer patent of Hugo Gernsback, which <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer%3Furl%3Dpatentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US1521287.pdf">proposed the</a> Osophon audio device in 1924, there are much more usage scenarios. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7e/42e/53c/e7e42e53cb9c4b15935f78ce543fa7a3.png"><br><br>  If you take only the sports and entertainment sector, then Aftershokz can be offered in tourism, and as headphones for gamers, and, as already mentioned, for educational purposes, etc. <br><br>  Wired headphones for sports are now selected, of course, less.  However, the possible discomfort from the wire with the battery is compensated by the ease of the headband itself, as well as a small clothespin, with which you can fix the Sportz on clothes (wire length is 130 cm). <br><br>  However, this does not mean that wired headphones have suddenly ceased to be used by athletes.  Very much: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe7/be1/958/fe7be1958c494ad4bf3b3ba7981ab231.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo: daddydidyouwin / theswagmama / runmomdiary (Instagram)</i> <br><br>  Makes the Sportz attractive and price: wired headphones cost twice as much - three times cheaper than wireless ones. <br><br><ul><li>  For example, a model <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-sportz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_campaign%3Dmic%26utm_medium%3Dsportz">with a microphone costs 4,290 rubles.</a> </li><li>  Version <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-sportz-titanium-bez-mikrofona.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_campaign%3Dnomic%26utm_medium%3Dsportz">without microphone - 3 490 rubles</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Sound absorption and vibration</b> <br><br>  The main claim to the early models was that they strongly ‚Äúdistribute‚Äù the sound to the outside, and it turns out that the process of listening or talking on the phone has ceased to be intimate. <br><br>  It's one thing when you ride a bike on the highway, and the likelihood that someone will overhear you is minimal.  Another thing - unsportsmanlike situation, for example, in the same office.  Beginning with Bluez 2S, Aftershokz models have significantly ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù in this direction and now at a comfortable volume for the listener (on the smartphone, about half), the outward sounds are almost indistinguishable and barely audible. <br><br>  The sound "up to the stop" on such headsets also generates vibration.  These vibrations do not feel disgusting, and at medium loudness they are hardly perceptible!  At the same time, manifesting themselves at the maximum, they do not distort the sound, do not add any rattling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43f/76d/755/43f76d755d3a43738724154a2580801d.JPG"><br><br>  They are sold in the original box, inside which is also a case and microUSB. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373237/</a></p>
