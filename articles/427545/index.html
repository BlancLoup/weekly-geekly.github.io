      According to the Ministry of Transport, Operators and airlines will be obliged to bring their activities in compliance with the requirements of Russian legislation, which will protect the rights of passengers and the safety of their personal data.  In addition, it will be possible to carry out domestic flights in any foreign policy conditions.  <b><u>Requirements are supposed to be introduced in stages</u> , while the mandatory condition is the placement of servers in the territory of the Russian Federation and the corresponding registration of enterprises in the territory of the Russian Federation.</b> <br><br>  However, the opinions of airlines sound more skeptical. <br><br>  Thus, in the opinion of the Director General of Siberia Airlines, Vladimir Obedkov, the application of this document in practice can lead to a complete stop of the activities of Russian airlines and / or a long (2‚Äì4 years) and costly migration to other reservation systems. <br><br>  The fact is that the three largest Russian airlines have foreign providers: the American Saber from Aeroflot, the Swiss SITA from S7, the Spanish Amadeus from Ural Airlines.  The fourth player is Utair and almost all the other Russian airlines operate from the Russian Sirena Travel.  Exceptions: Victory low-cost airline - with American Navitair, Azimut airline - with the National Reservation System (NSB) developed by Rostec together with Vnukovo Airport. <br><br>  On October 22, 2018 the press center of the Ministry of Transport published an appeal in which it says: <br><blockquote>  The requirements provide for the deployment in the territory of the Russian Federation of servers and databases of operators (providers) booking and selling domestic flights, as well as registering passengers for a flight (they are currently located in the United States and other countries), which corresponds to the practice in other areas of the economy, such as banking sphere. <br><br>  Regarding financial costs, we consider it necessary to inform that providers of automated information systems for air transportation design receive a fee from the airline for each ticket sold and should provide for the relevant costs of meeting the requirements of Russian legislation to continue working in the domestic market of the Russian Federation.  <b>The costs of transferring a part of the equipment to the territory of the Russian Federation will not be excessive for them and are absolutely feasible.</b> <br><br>  In this regard, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation recommends that Russian airlines and foreign operators calmly prepare for the entry into force of these requirements. <br></blockquote><br>  Let's look at the consequences of this project, who will be right, time will tell. <br><br>  Is it possible to "land" the plane?  The video below shows extreme attempts and landings with strong side winds.  Imagine what the passengers are experiencing at these moments. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P9OAng32F0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Whether you saw the analogy or not, but it seems that in order to host servers in Russia, you need to have sufficient motivation.  Success in this matter will depend on the readiness of the ‚Äúairfields‚Äù and on the climate that will be created in the IT market. <br><br>  <b>More to explore the possibilities and threats of transferring computing power to Russia will help our two studies:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/about/news/white-paper-zakon-o-personalnyh-dannyh/">White Paper on the Federal Law number 152.</a>  <a href="https://www.cloud4y.ru/about/news/white-paper-zakon-o-personalnyh-dannyh/">4500 book downloads.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/cloud4y/blog/425003/">White Paper: Calculation of TCO "Cloud vs Purchase of Servers"</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427545/</a></p>
