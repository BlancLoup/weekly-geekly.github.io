He took the initiative to have so many working days in a year, and everything else - paid vacation, but for some reason the authorities were against it. <br>  I had to go through the first two days after the holidays, scoop up the accumulated and slowly get back into the work process. <br><br>  It was then that I was visited by the <b>idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow you can increase your vacation without hitting the management‚Äôs wallet</b> .  Surely this idea has already been visited by someone else, for sure it has already been described somewhere, for sure it has even been used somewhere, but I haven‚Äôt seen its implementation in nature, so I share it with everyone.  Maybe someone will come in handy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Description </h4><br>  A vacation with the preservation of a working mood is not exactly a vacation.  This is the <i><b>ability to move to the remote for a certain period</b></i> . <br>  There are many reasons for this: starting from repairing the road, because of which you have to get to work twice as long, ending with a sudden free-ride ticket to Egypt in a situation where the annual vacation has already been used up. <br>  Due to the conditions that have arisen, the worker works for a week from home / from the hotel / from the hospital where he mows down from the army / from elsewhere. <br><br><h4>  Pharmacological properties </h4><br>  Considering that vacation is first of all the need to change the situation, even leaving for a week to work from home can have a very positive effect on the employee‚Äôs results.  Yes, there are situations when it is preferable that everyone is in the field.  However, the IT industry is charming because with proper organization of the process it is not always necessary. <br>  We agree that the employee on such leave during working hours remains within reach and is available via Skype or at least the telephone.

    <h4>  Indications for use </h4><br>  As an experiment, it is possible to offer the possibility of leaving for one week twice a year.  At the same time, it is impossible to take this week right after the usual vacation, but it is possible before it (this is a deep idea, you need to think about it). <br><br>  Applicable, in my opinion, to most of the IT-evil.  We will assume that I am now talking about programmers in general, because the motivation of, for example, system administrators is not my profile.  In this case, nothing prevents you from correcting this method for your situation. <br><br>  Further restrictions or assumptions are based only on your personal preferences, experience and features of your team: you can increase this time, you can reduce it, you can give it in larger portions.  You can take two weeks a year for the norm, and everything that is above, make an additional bonus, which is issued for certain achievements.  You can select the second week, if the first week brought unsatisfactory results. <br><br>  Option 2 * 7 calendar days seems to me enough to understand how it works in your company.  Depending on this, it will become clear whether to move in this direction or better to abandon this practice. <br><br>  A separate question here can get up "and I can work today from home, I broke to go?".  In my opinion, it is better to exclude such situations in advance: there is a practice of taking a week at a remote location, there are no other options, it is useless to depict a nurse.  Approved maximum a day before the holidays.  All conditions must be thought out in advance and discussed immediately when announcing the introduction of the practice. <br><br><h4>  Contraindications </h4><br>  It's simple.  It is impossible if: <br><ul><li>  The security policy of the company for various reasons does not imply work outside the enterprise. </li><li>  You do not trust your subordinates and believe that they will be tinkering at this time. </li><li>  You tried this method and stopped trusting your subordinates (see previous paragraph). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I have a phrase capable of killing any dissertation defense: ‚ÄúThere is no experience of introduction yet.‚Äù <br>  However, it seems to me that a change in the situation of a tired employee is able to bring good dividends to the company, and the employee himself will be happy.  Why he will become a better attitude to the company, which can again bring dividends to it. <br><br>  Technical capabilities allow us to experiment, so do not hesitate to try something new - perhaps it will be your killer features to retain employees or become a common practice that will make the world a little better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184464/</a></p>
