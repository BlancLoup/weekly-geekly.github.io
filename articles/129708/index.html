All of them were looking for, in fact, one thing - the perfect combination and application of existing capabilities, developments and skills.  In attempts to imagine what this world could be and build it, many people have spent more than one year, not one million. <br><br>  This process, let's call it, the optimization of reality, can not be imagined without one more, parallel - mental.  People think constantly, therefore, for any company that is trying to achieve success, it is very important to understand what employees and customers think, how they think and, most importantly, what conclusions they draw from their own reasoning.

      When we talk about any organization headed by a person, we understand that his thoughts and actions are of fundamental importance at all levels of government.  Good managers, charismatic and responsible, we used to call "leaders" - these are people who lead, more precisely, their thoughts, followers.  Brilliant leaders are called ‚Äúvisionaries‚Äù, because such people can not only find like-minded people, but also explain to them the meaning of the movement. <br><br>  Thomas Watson, one of the founders of the National Cash Register Company, who <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/124135/">later joined</a> the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation (CTR), which became IBM, once said that: ‚ÄúThought has been the father of every action since the beginning of time.  "I did not think" costs the world millions of dollars. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What you think is also worth talking about.  Not only to convey your own thoughts to others, but also to hear the opinions of other people, which may affect your model of world perception.  It is for this reason that IBM holds meetings of various representatives of business, science, and government organizations in order to discuss problems and issues related to leadership.  After all, the person who stands at the head must not only effectively cope with current processes, but also look to the future himself in order not to remain in the past. <br><br>  In fact, it is possible to summarize the main questions that ask people who are responsible: How will a product or company behave tomorrow in a changed world?  What will be our success and how to adequately measure it?  What contribution do we make to the whole society?  If the first question and the second question are part of business planning, then not every person can immediately answer the third one.  But he can tell others. <br><br>  However, enough already prefaces.  It's time to show who discussed what at the recently completed Think forum held in New York.  I would like, first of all, to mention the audience gathered in New York: these are not only IBM representatives themselves, but also other very interesting personalities: Sir Howard Stinger, President of Sony Corporation, Joshua Cooper Rameau (Kissinger Associates), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Harvard Business School professor), King Abdullah II of Jordan, Jamie Dimon (CEO JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co), Jim McNearney (CEO Boeing), Farid Zacharia (sensational CNN flight commentator, moderator Think), Mexico President Felipe Calderon, Pascal Lamy (head of the WTO), Peter Voser (CEO of Royal Dutch Shell) and Thomas Friedman (count  NYT smart and author of the book "Flat World" - not to be confused with a series of books Pratchett). <br><br>  It seems to me that such a heterogeneous audience does not gather in one place or at one event.  However, all these people came to the IBM Leadership Forum to talk about their vision and hear the opinions of other panelists. <br><br>  It is worth starting with our compatriot - Igor Aramzyan, general director of RVK, who spoke about his understanding of leadership as a phenomenon: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1RB0qq-uaXY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhilB8bAVIugjx1t5UB5lig0ChwlJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Sasha Johnson, one of the directors of the VTB joint fund - DFJ, answered the question of what her vision of leadership in the future will be - how the idea worthy of embodiment will look like: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-uHyqgsJFM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjK5EzZkF-01sJ0O8HIfjPUPd5Ncg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  King Abdullah of Jordan said that now "people want freedom and opportunity," and the leaders of the region realize the need for reform.  Separately, the king agreed on the importance of information technology for the development of his country: about 1% of the population is involved in the technology sector, while the industry has reached a turnover of $ 2.2 billion and is 14% of this small state's GDP. <br><br>  Another head of state, namely Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, interrupted the official and protocol message with a greeting to the IBM team, saying that his sister works for this company. <br><br>  But one of the most provocative speeches, as many expected, belongs to Farid Zakaria.  His entire lecture was devoted to problems of different levels - from private to corporate.  The University of Minnesota did research and came to the conclusion (they were voiced by Mr. Zakaria) that people cope with short-term problems much more efficiently - therefore, a person needs to act quickly and carefully in any situation, preventing spreading of activity for a long time, because case, there is a huge number of unnecessary solutions, so-called  organizational perturbations.  This is the longest video in the review: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/izGpSxoww3k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiiGlalZxvllmozti5z2ReDMRu9Ww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But Joshua Cooper Rameau, author of the book The Age of the Unthinkable about the latest global recession, noted that humanity is constantly trying to oppose outdated ideas to innovations that have long been doomed to failure: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0B1P4-t6qQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhglGPC-90-stXjJdray7-Nwqdow_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Summarizing: a huge number of people expressed their thoughts about leadership at the conference.  These are people whose areas of activity may not even intersect, and this is what makes the diversity of opinions so interesting.  Today, everyone has the opportunity to find out what the king thinks about the role of information technologies (especially against the background of revolutions in the east) in society and how leadership is perceived in the largest companies in the world. <br><br>  If you are interested in this video, you can view all the presentations and discussions on the IBM website on the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm100/us/en/forum/">Think forum</a> . <br><br>  Finally, I would like to say the following: ‚Äúthinking‚Äù is not only creating something new from emptiness, even if it is in your own mind.  To think, to analyze and generalize it, to structure it.  ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù is a modern way of existence of every rational individual on planet Earth. <br><br>  From September 23 to October 23, the Think Exhibit exhibition will be held in the Lincoln Center, located in New York - this is the first of its kind museum organized from large information screens on which human history will be shown to visitors by visualization, This is not processed for the general public.  All panels are sensitive to touch, allow you to switch and change the contents, learning how humanity and modern technology make the world a better place.  If one of you is in the right place - come in, admission is free. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVrXAsYd1Wk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjI14a0HE0UjQrFnhKoOvHgQCwbvQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129708/</a></p>
