  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The revolution in the field of chargers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Russian scientists have developed an unparalleled in the world charger for mobile phones and laptops.</i> <br><br>  The power supply unit of a mobile phone or laptop is either disposable batteries or batteries that need to be charged periodically.  The world is flooded with hundreds of millions of such devices, and no one has ever thought of changing something here.  Therefore, the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRussian scientists so struck many well-worn specialists.  The Russians suggested using hydrogen in the charger! <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read more <br>  It is called the fuel of the XXI century, and dozens of electric vehicles running on this fuel are already running in different countries.  But how to make him give a current in a small device?  This was made possible by nanomaterials created by the Aspect Association, and it was possible to create a charger that provides 30 hours of continuous telephone conversation.  For comparison - the best foreign batteries are designed for only three hours.  The device on hydrogen is safe for the environment and human health, and weighs only 180 grams.  A standard charger of the same weight can give only 1.5 full cycles of battery charging, and a new device - 5. In 10-20 minutes, a fully depleted phone is again ready for use. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe‚Äú heart ‚Äùof the device is a nanoporous membrane with a catalyst,‚Äù explains Doctor of Technical Sciences Lev Trusov.  - It resembles a cake "Napoleon" of a dozen layers from nanometer to hundreds of nanometers thick (1 nanometer - 10-9 meters).  Each square centimeter of the membrane contains up to 100 billion pores, each of which is several nanometers in size.  Their creation is our know-how.  Such a multi-layered structure allows to take off large energy from a small volume.  As a result, a long service life and low weight of the device.  For example, for a laptop, it will pull only 100-150 grams.

      Actually, an electric current is produced on the membrane due to the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen known from the school textbook.  Moreover, hydrogen itself on the same membrane is extracted from a special compound that is in the device, and oxygen is taken directly from the air.  Practically you carry a power outlet in your pocket.  Such a charger is indispensable for long flights, while traveling, in the country, in any places where there is no electricity. <br><br>  Soon, the Tenzor plant in Dubna will begin mass production of such devices, taking the path of a public-private partnership.  Signed a cooperation agreement with the American company Medis Technology.  According to Lev Trusov, this innovative development was carried out entirely with state funds: "In 2003, when we started, there was only an idea; today, thanks to the support of Rosnauka, we have a scientific base, experience, first-class equipment, materials, and most importantly, unique knowledge. Another plus is the cooperation with the Moscow State Academy of Fine Chemical Technology named after MV Lomonosov. We attract young people to the project, in our team about a third of our employees are younger than 30 years old. " <br><br>  The ‚ÄúAspect‚Äù Association project is included in the program of the International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy, in which such renowned research centers as the Livermore Laboratory (USA), the Fraunhofer Institute (Germany) and the QMS Corporation (England) participate. <br><br>  Is it possible that at least somewhere government money is being spent wisely, now the question of the cost of such devices remains open. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2008/08/13/pribor.html">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36817/</a></p>
