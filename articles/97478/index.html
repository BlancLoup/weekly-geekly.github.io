The Kingdom and the horse in addition for the information about this girl)"><br><br>  And yesterday I was lucky to meet with the Taiwanese company management - accidentally seeing a fresh device from one of the bosses, I asked him for a couple of minutes for a test in clumsy English) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So I apologize in advance for the quality of the photo.  As it turned out, this is a very prototype, one of the first - such ‚Äúassemblies‚Äù usually do not reach Russia.  But according to the owner (and this was <b>Jerry Shen</b> , executive director of the company), the appearance of the device for release will not change.

Only here the back part in this case is not plastic, but the real metal one - such a cool one, with a fine polishing texture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/daa/c0b/d9b/daac0bd9b5e42eb84114021d10ee4837.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/474/db2/bae/474db2bae94c521a5a99f374d2bc9c64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It has nothing but a rubberized insert for a hand and eye of a 2 megapixel camera.  To the question ‚Äú <i>Why is the camera in an e-book?</i>  "Shen answered:" <i>Just imagine that you are a student.</i>  <i>What do you usually do with lectures?</i>  <i>Rewrite?</i>  <i>And then once - clicked - and all the lectures in your device.</i>  <i>The picture can be enlarged, the fine print is well read</i> . ‚Äù  The quality of the demonstrated image was really quite good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b5/7b5/069/0b57b5069a1e848a58288ff86c2f11c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The side ends are moderately sharp and there is nothing on them either.  A stylus is inserted into the small recess from above along the entire edge - you can do something on the screen only with your fingers, it will not work with your fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c11/793/431/c117934319a0409341d57ecfa9a101b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And below are several functional elements: three buttons (power, camera and voice recorder), a slot for microSD cards, miniUSB and a headphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c4/01e/2d5/5c401e2d5f42356f1110b1b04358d4a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The build quality does not complain - even top Sonya at this level do not (judging by the same PRS-900). <br><br>  Almost the entire front side is occupied by a large (8 '', 1024x768 with a sensitivity of 2540dpi) screen - it is not glossy, but not matte;  drawing stylus turned out to be ugly conveniently - as if on a tablet.  The screen is black-and-white and looks exactly the same as in e-books, but in this case there is a slightly different type of screen - a passive TFT-display without backlight.  Moderately - fingerprints after all sorts of buns remain, but there are practically no simple touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/220/8ee/453/2208ee453f1e431bfcedadab915aa85a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The promised turning over in 0.1 seconds is pure truth.  For example, the main menu is formed by a series of icons, the switching between them is literally animated.  You can switch between the icons not only with the stylus, but also with the touch strip located just below the screen.  There are several function keys under the screen, but they did not work in the prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7c/9c1/a96/a7c9c1a9646a379cf7f348556f59e46f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The download is very fast and apparently, the Linux distribution is flooded there, so there is freedom of action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a2/dc0/c10/8a2dc0c10e765dc338eb991cdea00111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the very top is the information dock, with the watch there and other wifi (yes, inside there is a built-in Wi-Fi module), but it was all inactive.  As with most of the menu items it was impossible to enter - they were all blocked.  But at the moment there were icons of reading, calendar, calculator, address book, notepad, voice recorder, photo album and settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/428/991/251/428991251127debcabcdce4f79b7f2b1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/559/ae1/cac/559ae1cacd6b1ec8a6492a4148e54522.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3d/5be/b43/e3d5beb43b2ea55fc2e9696f39fe83f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only working application is a digital notebook in which you could take various notes.  There are several tools to choose from, for each of which several levels of ‚Äúpressure‚Äù (grayscale) are available - a surprisingly very sensitive screen and it will really be possible to draw on it.  The truth is still the best with the pen, which is almost at a right angle to the screen - otherwise there were false positives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47f/838/e51/47f838e51cb505908e73867c020373f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/308/63d/0e4/30863d0e41a86c861b2c8b2350f68e7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae4/ce3/eae/ae4ce3eae51e90446cd47aaeaef2e397.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps this is all that was able to see.  Despite its production "dampness", the device is already working and quite smartly - I am sure that by the time of entering the market, there will be complete order with the software.  There are no exact TTXs yet (as well as information on working hours), but the fact that the device actually turned out to be exactly the same as in the picture pleasantly pleased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fc/6f2/e9a/0fc6f2e9abf52441a621a5b57d3ef758.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of the release date - Jerry Shen has promised that the device will appear by the beginning of the school year and the estimated price will be from $ 190-299.  And if this is really the case, then the current e-book market will have to fight for a place in the user's backpack - now even for $ 300 it is difficult to buy something worthy, not to mention a touch screen, a metal case and decent service all over the world.  So if someone is thinking about buying a reader, it may be worth waiting until the fall.  And for those who can not wait, in the near future I will try to make a review of several devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a44/a2e/5d8/a44a2e5d8c9e06360bd0d574bb6db54e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the company‚Äôs management came for a reason - several laptops were presented to the wide press in one of Moscow‚Äôs hotels: the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/95088/">bamboo</a> series and the sensational <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/96757/">NX90</a></b> .  However, I managed to do reviews of all these devices for Habr's readers long before the announcement.  Maybe next week I will write about an affordable (compared to the NX90) for the price of a laptop from a new series, almost completely matte and with a similar speaker system from Bang &amp; Olufsen.  In the meantime, I note only the fact that now the gloss (at least in laptops from ASUS) will become less and less - and this, damn it, pleases !!!  ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b6/2e2/d0a/5b62e2d0a2eb62ef82f4891b1e35a89a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If someone has any questions on the above-mentioned laptops, I will gladly try to answer them. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for your attention, stay in touch!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97478/</a></p>
