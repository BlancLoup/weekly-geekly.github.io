The risk group includes people of various professions and hobbies, for example, drivers, artists, photographers and, of course, people who work at computers a lot, they are also the most susceptible to this ailment.  In the advanced stage of CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome), inpatient treatment may be required, up to surgical intervention (special surgery to extract excess fluid from the joints).  Well, the best way to solve a problem is never to face it.  To do this, you need to engage in prevention through warm-up or specialized devices, such as a gyroscopic simulator. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66b/afb/9c6/66bafb9c69b39c963c3c8308f1e19cac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Today I will talk about 3 models of Powerball - Classic, Fusion and Autostart.  This is one of the most popular models at the moment.  They can also cover the entire line of wrist simulators, with the exception of metal devices.  Read more under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Packing and packaging </h4>  The Powerball Classic and Fusion models come in blister packs, while the Autostart model has a case in the form of a cylinder made of transparent plastic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/976/71a/072/97671a0722bccfcbe124dfc485565841.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the reverse side of the blister packs, <a href="">instructions for launching the</a> simulator and a photo of a <s>man who pumped his bitsuha with a gyroscopic simulator</s> with marked muscle groups that are affected by a Powerball. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/083/89f/40208389fd25a60327ef77c8badffb65.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But the most interesting is the packaging model Autostart.  To begin with, to open it, you need to remove the bottom of the flask, which is located <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/3cf/7c1/bd93cf7c1aa66c9e22aec7ba009fc6e3.png" alt="image">  <a href="">Mini-CD (23 MB)</a> with detailed instructions (Russian available) in the form of an HTML-page. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/792/934/275/792934275b84754b93d725fede0f7287.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Actually "interesting" is the practicality of this box.  Unplugging the upper part of the transparent plastic, the lower one turns into a stand for the Powerball, as it turned out - an extremely convenient and necessary thing, because of their rounded shape, "power balls" ¬© <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dcoder_mm/" class="user_link">dcoder_mm</a> often like to roll off the table. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efa/1f7/a7b/efa1f7a7b4ed8c5e68516e8e8607227e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The set of delivery for the Classic and Fusion models consists of the simulators themselves, brief instructions, a Mini-CD and a pair of laces for running the subject.  Accordingly, the Powerball Autostart is all the same except for the laces. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/268/e42/27d/268e4227d4d67d0a0affe2af92f5627f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For each of the devices is a lifetime (!) Warranty on the rotor and the speed counter.  In this case, in the event of a breakdown, repair is promised within 14 working days or replacement of the product. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a76/2c4/ccd/a762c4ccd4b8bc40d30059030bb5c267.jpg" alt="image"><br></a> <br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Appearance </h4>  Externally, the gyroscopic simulator is a small piece of spherical shape.  In most cases, the body is made of thick plastic of different colors and degrees of transparency.  There are also metal models, but they are positioned as devices for advanced ones, respectively, and their price is higher. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c5/bc5/754/1c5bc5754bf8aaa93014c24b9e871cc0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the upper part there is a rev counter or a seat for it, since there are models for sale with or without a speed counter.  The difference in price for younger models in the region of $ 20.  In any case, even if you initially purchase a model without a counter, you can upgrade it at any time.  Delov is there for 5 minutes, unless you have to overpay a little and donate not $ 20, but $ 25. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f0/0d6/dab/8f00d6dabb521b9496dabcaaed636558.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Due to the open bottom, you can see the "bare" rotor.  The latter has a hole for the thread with which the simulator starts.  Additionally, the Powerball case is framed with a rubber pad to hold it more firmly in your hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/cf9/6d1/ac7cf96d183c59b3a4c7c05077da2e98.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The exception is the Autostart model for which you want to start to ‚Äúwind‚Äù the rotor, and for better grip with the fingers there are two rubber pads. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/552/5f2/4195525f286e8c5bc599caedea1ce364.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Also worth mentioning is the backlight.  This in these simulators can be called dynamic, since the brightness of the glow varies depending on the speed of rotation of the rotor.  Most models in the Powerball line have a monochromatic glow, with the exception of one of the heroes of our review today - Powerball Fusion.  Its glow color changes smoothly from red to blue as the RPM increases.  The transition to the blue color is carried out at a speed of 8000 revolutions per minute. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gvp1zxUKk6Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjKXgnfoBgeBSTFOCjnKN4tRbOAVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Working principle and gut guts </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56b/36b/78a/56b36b78a064e5cc4f654423c279847c.jpg" align="right" alt="image">  The principle of operation of the subject is quite simple.  The device is based on a gyroscope consisting of a rapidly rotating rotor enclosed in a plastic sphere.  To set the rotor in motion, you can use a special rope that comes in the kit, then you need to make circular movements with your hand to increase the rotor speed.  The simulator during use must be firmly held in your hand, as the forces of action will try to deflect it in different directions. <br><br>  During the application of a constant external force to the gyroscope, it begins to rotate around a certain axis that does not coincide in direction with the main axis of the rotating rotor, i.e., precess.  In this case, the rotation does not occur in accordance with the direction of the external force.  The magnitude of the precession is proportional to the magnitude of the acting force.  In the case of termination of external influence, the precession instantly ends, but the rotor continues to rotate.

When the axis of the rotating rotor comes into contact with the upper and lower surfaces of the groove, this causes a precession and the axis of the rotor will start a circular movement along it.  The friction force between the axis and the surface of the groove can either accelerate or slow down the rotation of the gyroscope.  The greatest acceleration is achieved when the rotor axis begins to ‚Äúslide‚Äù along the surface of the groove as smoothly as possible.  Since the friction force is very important for this effect, the device should not be lubricated.  The maximum speed of rotation of the rotor is achieved while holding the sphere in the hand and constantly maintaining the rotation by the movement of the brush. <br><br>  With a more detailed physical principle of the Powerball can be <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D1%2591%25D1%2580">found in Wikipedia</a> , and we proceed to the analysis of the device.  For the beginning you need to remove the rubber pad. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc2/0f6/caf/fc20f6caf840bb9cd26bd84e3e1e1cc9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After that, unscrew the two diametral opposing cross screws. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b33/c68/c16/b33c68c16beb6ccd2bdd47c262f03081.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Next we need to disassemble the body, which consists of two halves.  To do this, install the Powerball on a hard flat surface (as shown in the figure below) and hit the seam sharply in a natural way.  As a result, the halves must be separated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2da/a75/85b/2daa7585b12ac686e8055773b3b03e9b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If it did not work out, then try to press it with a book with a hard cover; under load, parts of the body should bend a little and, accordingly, separate.  The only thing I do not advise is to ‚Äúpick‚Äù the seam with a screwdriver or other metal objects.  You will disassemble it, but it is more likely that there will be unpleasant dents marks like mine: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c32/e0c/6f0/c32e0c6f09991cc6cdcb73bfc68424e2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So, before us appeared the rotor, well, or part of it.  We don‚Äôt need the lower half, so we remove it and pull out the rotor from the upper part of the body. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/d23/d3f/465d23d3f7a58eeffd2863625b5c0fea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, on the upper part of the body, there is a speed sensor in it (optional).  To get it, you need to pry the latch with a flat screwdriver with which it is fixed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c65/799/4fe/c657994fee81a7400ed24e95c0d06fb3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The lower part of the board is virgin empty, only a couple of non-soldered pads for additional components are visible.  To get to the back side, you need to unscrew 6 small screwdrivers, one of which is hidden under the sticker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/406/49f/a60/40649fa6098dd2d896131be4f102ccf7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the upper part: a ‚Äúblob microcircuit‚Äù, a reed switch (considers revolutions) and all the necessary binding.  The electronics are powered by two GP377 batteries from which the counter, according to the manufacturer, will work up to 2 years. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/57d/3e1/51a57d3e1781666212d795f3d2bde7fe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We continue disassembly and remove the circular groove from the axis of the gyroscope.  And here be careful.  On both sides there are sealing gaskets that have properties to get lost due to their small size. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/318/761/181/3187611818af486991a9531a34eecc1e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The rotor consists of 4 parts: the axis, the metal base, the plastic shell and the board with LEDs (if the model has a backlight). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77d/be5/723/77dbe572324de065b0f61f05a34e289d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The backlight works due to the built-in dynamo; accordingly, no batteries are needed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0c/0c1/4ec/a0c0c14ecd4fcefd7c54487ee25cad69.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Internally, the device of other models is identical to the above.  The only exceptions are the metal Powerball and the Autostart version, which has a <a href="">special</a> <a href="">mechanism</a> for starting the rotor. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Quick start </h4>  Running the simulator is extremely simple.  All that needs to be done is to insert the rope coming in the kit into the groove on the rotor, then pull it out with a sharp movement, thereby giving rotation to the rotor.  Next, simply unwind the Powerball with slow circular motions with the hand (with a brush).  The main thing is not to start with quick short movements with your wrist, otherwise you will not be able to catch the rhythm, and it will be difficult to unwind the ball correctly.  <i>In the video below, I was a little worried, so the start was, let's say, not perfect.</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_82ptIxwB8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiEmbGxG5Sw-0s8csXkz-wlHukBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  With Powerball Autostart is still easier.  To start the simulator, you need to ‚Äúwind‚Äù the rotor in the direction given by the arrows on it.  Then unwind in the same way as the previous "ball". <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PK0ZVU2iemA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6DIFXqm5LJEc_nX1z2_KYA2xixg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  For conventional models, there is another way - starting the rotor with a sharp movement of a finger along the axis of the rotor, but here you need to get the hang of it.  I don‚Äôt always succeed even after two weeks of active exploitation. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> In use </h4>  Carpal tunnel syndrome is a lesion of nerve tissue (neuropathy) due to some adverse conditions.  Adverse conditions can be very different - usually it is the monotonous work of the brush or a long stay in unnatural positions.  Habrahabr has repeatedly discussed this topic.  I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the works of my colleague <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vvzvlad/" class="user_link">vvzvlad</a> and stabor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/stavor/" class="user_link">habrauser</a> that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/163269/">in the first one</a> , that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/40692/">in the second one</a> , the disease was dismantled, as well as methods for its prevention. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/49c/e9d/38e49ce9d3b0ca7081e5bee211306791.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In general, the scope of Powerball applications is quite extensive and is not limited to CTS prevention alone.  It can also be used to repair damaged ligaments and tendons after injuries to hands, sprains and fractures.  In such cases, it is recommended to rotate the Powerball literally several minutes a day, but in such a way that its built-in rotor works at a limited speed, that is, no more than 5-6 thousand revolutions per minute. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ef/7b6/021/2ef7b60212f6103c722ddb51e1f9f426.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But this is not the end of the application.  "Balls" equipped with counters enable people to compete in "who will wind up more."  Thus, the obligatory warm-up becomes also fascinating.  Moreover, the presence of an opponent near is not required.  On the official site of NSD (manufacturer of Powerball) there is a <a href="http://www.nsdball.com/scoreboard.php%3Fm%3DScoreboards">special table</a> in which records are made from all over the world (representatives from the CIS countries are also present there). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e05/16a/429/e0516a4290981b365ad99ec466036ddc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now as for the modes of operation of the counter.  There are 5 of them here. Switching is performed using the FCN button, and switching on and zeroing via ON / CLR.  In the first mode, the number of rotor revolutions that he performed from the moment of the last start to the moment of stopping is considered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0f/0ed/478/d0f0ed47884442d40b1aa661e10e7728.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The second mode is responsible for measuring the speed (RPM per minute) in real time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6db/c38/811/6dbc388112affefd9cba6e4525216ad5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The third and most frequently used mode is to display the maximum RPM (High score), i.e.  This setting captures your record and displays it until you dial a larger score or reset it using the ON / CLR button.  As soon as you start to rotate the simulator, the counter automatically switches to the fourth mode (New high score) - the counter shows the highest rotational speed reached since the last start.  If you have exceeded your previous record since the last start, the number on the counter will flash, and the new record will be recorded in memory as soon as the rotor rotation stops.  If your current result is less than a record, it will be displayed on the screen until the rotor stops, after which the High score mode will turn on again. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cec/80e/b28/cec80eb28600075e21b8a5b8244483fb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And, finally, the last installation is the measurement of the force index, its essence in calculating the number of revolutions made over a certain period of time (30, 60 and 90 seconds).  A great way to measure <s>your</s> strength (endurance?) With a friend. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dc/edc/2c3/8dcedc2c3182b969feeec1ce9013af2d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The display turns itself off after 40 seconds of inactivity. <br><br>  Speaking of records, it is worth mentioning one of the most experienced "tillers".  Grek Akis Kritsinelis absolute record holder in all possible modes and uses of the gyroscopic simulator.  For example, the maximum speed to which he was able to disperse the Powerball was - 16765 RPM.  The video below confirms this, and there are other records on the channel.  Well, I already gave the link to the <a href="http://www.nsdball.com/testimonials.php%3Fm%3DWorks">table with champions</a> above. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4TyqGUTj3TU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQyILoQM2iyDC5mWB4sE48YItEDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Results </h4>  Glory to the Blog (ours, Box Overview) in my 16th and I almost do not feel the symptoms of tunnel syndrome, but this does not mean that you can relax.  I spend a lot of time at the computer and in the near future this situation is unlikely to change, so prevention is not possible, it needs to be addressed.  And how to do it - you decide.  I chose a Powerball and now periodically spin it alternating with other exercises.  I stopped on the Autostart model because of the convenient stand and the very possibility of an easy launch.  So what to buy in every way I recommend! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Cost </h4>  The price of Powerball is very affordable.  So for the youngest <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/goods_Powerball%2B250Hz%2BClassic%2BBlue.htm">Classic</a> model you need to give ~ $ 27, for the <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/goods_autostart.htm">Autostart</a> model <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/goods_autostart.htm">$</a> 60, and the model with the Fusion glow will cost you ~ $ 70.  But the assortment does not end there; the official distributor of Powerball in Ukraine presents the <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/dir_powerball.htm">entire range of</a> hand simulators from NSD Power + a cloud of various <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/dir_accessories.htm">accessories</a> and spare parts. <br><br>  In conclusion, I advise you to buy exclusively from official distributors.  Since now the market has a huge number of fakes.  They cost a couple of hundred cheaper, but have a huge percentage of marriage and are deprived of a lifetime warranty.  And indeed any guarantee. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Related Links </h4>  <a href="http://www.nsdball.com/index.php%3Fm%3DHome">Products webpage</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.uaballs.com/">The site of the official distributor in Ukraine (a lot of useful information about Powerball)</a> <br>  <a href="http://powerball.ru/">Official distributor site in Russia</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/60208/">Overview on Habr√©</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D1%2591%25D1%2580">A page dedicated to gyroscopic simulators on Wikipedia</a> <br><br>  If you do not have an account on Habrahabr, you can read and comment on our articles on <a href="http://boxoverview.com/">BoxOverview.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189512/</a></p>
