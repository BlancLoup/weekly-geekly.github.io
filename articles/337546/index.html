      Option 1: use the ‚Äúturnkey solution‚Äù, partially adjusting it to the peculiarities of your business. <br>  Option 2: develop a system for yourself. <br><br>  The first option is all ready-made solutions, such as amoCRM, Bitrix24, Megaplan, etc. Is this your case?  Then we will discuss the problems that may follow this choice and how to get rid of them. <br><br>  <b>Employees partially use the system</b> <br><br>  One of the most unpleasant cases.  Because they seem to be used, but not completely.  And it is not clear what to do. <br><br>  To understand where this situation comes from, it is necessary to understand how employees act: any system is used by employees as far as it is convenient for them and how much it helps them solve their tasks. <br><br>  So where does this ‚Äúpartly‚Äù come from? <br><br>  It's simple.  The system begins to be used partially only when employees for some business processes have their own, simpler solutions.  Most often, such a problem arises if you have chosen the wrong system from ready-made solutions or have not set up a business process.  Let me explain with a simple example.  Suppose there is no conveniently organized chat in the system.  In this case, employees will periodically use WhatsApp and Telegram, even when communicating about work and clients.  In the beginning it seems that this stuff.  Well, let!  But step by step this leads to big problems, to the fact that the system is used less and less, and the necessary data are increasingly not getting into the system.  Such a problem is more common for ready-made solutions.  The inability to perfectly link all business processes with the system leads to the fact that the employee, in the case of some of the processes, himself finds a convenient tool for himself that solves his tasks.  Although the system had to do it.  And this leads to less and less use of it. <br>  By the way, looking ahead, this problem exists for the owners of the systems developed for themselves, but only if the system was developed by a person who does not understand how employees, for example, a freelancer, think and act. <br><br>  What to do ?: Competently approach the choice of the system, or develop a system "by itself". <br><br>  <b>The system does not automate all business processes.</b> <br><br>  Where does this problem come from?  She appeared already at the stage of selection.  Have you decided to automate all business processes?  Always forget about the phrase as ‚ÄúReady solution‚Äù.  Having decided to automate the entire company, the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe finished product will have to be abandoned immediately.  Having at least a month in stock, it is better to immediately become puzzled by the development of a system for yourself.  Since, whatever you are promised and whatever you do with a ready-made solution, such a system still has its own framework, the foundation on which it is built.  And no matter how much money you spend on its finalization, it will not be able to cover all the processes, take into account all the features.  As a result, it seemed like they wanted to automate everything, but you still have to do individual processes manually.  In addition, the more you try to change it, attracting different specialists, the more it will be ‚Äúbuggy‚Äù and become a structure of crutches, which at any moment may collapse.  Such a problem is encountered by all who are trying to implement a ‚Äúturnkey solution‚Äù and at the same time want to automate all business processes, but a special case is when they try to use 1C as a system. <br><br>  What to do ?: Develop a system for yourself, or be content with what you have. <br><br>  <b>Did not find the system suitable for your business</b> <br><br>  It's simple.  So you just did not find a developer who can make it for your business. <br><br>  What to do?  Search for a suitable developer and develop a system for yourself. <br><br>  <b>Employees do not use the system at all.</b> <br><br>  If this is your case, then you are clearly very "wise" with the choice of the system. <br>  Most likely, it is so complicated that training can not be done here.  And learning is a book thick with War and Peace.  Of course, I exaggerate, but the essence does not change.  I personally met such an option when the company independently tried to implement the cloud version of bitrix24, or made an unimaginable design from 1C that managers were forced to use.  Managers are not accountants.  They have other tasks.  I repeat, because it is very important: any system will be used as far as it is convenient for employees and helps to solve their problems.  Of course, you can force them to use it in an orderly manner.  But the effect of the system will be very far from what you could get with the right approach. <br><br>  What to do?  Competently approach the choice of system. <br><br>  <b>The system is periodically "buggy"</b> <br><br>  The most common option for the case when the "turnkey solution" is constantly trying to refine and patch.  It's like buying jeans with holes, and then stitching them up because you don't like them.  The sight is sad.  Do not misunderstand me, in any ready-made solution there are opportunities to supplement it and change it with already proven add-ons.  And they will work fine.  But when there are too many of them and when you go beyond them, you will not avoid glitches.  Such a problem may also arise from ‚Äúby itself‚Äù by the developed system.  But usually in the event that you hire a not very experienced freelancer. <br><br>  What to do?  Correctly choose and configure the system or immediately develop the system "by itself". <br><br>  To summarize, it is often the right decision to develop a system for yourself.  And it‚Äôs not hard to understand why.  I do not think that someone needs to explain, the better tailored jacket.  But there is a nuance.  For a small business it is unprofitable.  But for medium and large businesses this is probably the best solution.  You will not find any large business that uses a ‚Äúturnkey solution‚Äù.  Just as you are unlikely to find a small business that has developed a system for themselves.  But before you solve something, look at the problems that your colleagues encounter when choosing the second option, as well as their solutions. <br><br>  The second option is the development of a system for "myself." <br><br>  Is this your case?  Then let's get started. <br><br>  <b>You have been developing a system for a long time, but they cannot finish it in any way.</b> <br><br>  I think you yourself understood that the main problem here is in the choice of the artist. <br>  Someone wants to save money and therefore hires freelancers.  As a result, there are no guarantees of quality and fulfillment of the stipulated terms of the order. <br><br>  But at the same time I have one question for you.  And what did you do all the time while you were ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù writing the system?  In fact, the reason is that you did not control the result enough.  If you want everything to be on time, ask for weekly reports on the work done.  And if they tell you that it is impossible to do, change the developer immediately and run away from him as if from fire.  Just believe: in a week you can write a simple system.  And if you can not provide even the minimum result, then your time is wasted. <br><br>  What to do?  Choose the right developer and require regular reports on the go. <br><br>  <b>Employees do not use the system at all.</b> <br>  Such a problem is associated solely with the wrong choice of a developer who cannot understand: what do you want, your employees, and how your business works.  The outcome of a low-level specialist‚Äôs activity is a system that is absolutely inconvenient to use.  I will not tire of repeating it: any system is used as far as it is convenient for employees and helps to solve their problems. <br><br>  What to do ?: Find a performer who, even at the development stage, will be able to look at it from the point of view of the programmer, owner and employee. <br><br>  <b>The system is periodically "buggy"</b> <br><br>  This problem is always associated only with the choice of the developer and the engine. <br>  What to do?  Choose the right developer. <br><br>  Also with the second option is connected several well-established myths.  And if you go after them, the result also leaves much to be desired: <br><br>  1. ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù engine is better than samopisny.  And in fact, the buzzword professional means a paid and universal engine.  Here are just real statistics suggests otherwise.  More than 50% of all web services and almost any large project are written on self-written engines.  Why?  All the same jacket tailored to order.  Each has its pros and cons.  And this is a much deeper question than just the answer is what is better and what is worse. <br><br>  2. Total dependence in the development of the system "by itself" from the system developer.  Perhaps, but only if you contacted a freelancer who wrote such a clumsy code that any decent programmer (even for big money) will not modify it.  Well, if only for very, very large))).  And so any normal code can be modified. <br><br>  As you can see, basically when developing a system for yourself, all the problems are connected with the choice of the performer.  The most important criteria when choosing, in addition to banal honesty and experience, is the ability to look at the system from the customer.  Those.  look at the system not as a programmer, but as a user. <br><br>  Now you can develop a system that covers all the processes in the company, will have mobile applications and will allow you to supplement it with everything you need (for example, fingerprint scanners, etc.).  In the case of developing a system for yourself, there are practically no restrictions.  This is only a question of money. <br><br>  And if you competently and consistently approach the development itself, then gradually modifying the system, you can give less money than for a ready-made solution, and get a better result.  But this is up to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337546/</a></p>
