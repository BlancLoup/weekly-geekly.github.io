    <h2>  Practical steps for securing your container deployment </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Liz Rice</b> <br>  Location: 10 <br>  Rating: 3.93 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/2zWbsabxSQAq2qcY6saG4/52595628750a344e3a1c9db432745019/Liz_Rice_Practical_steps_for_securing_your_container_deployment.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSiCZ6v35gw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When switching to DevOps, the responsibility for security becomes part of the responsibility of each member of the team and in order for the security guards to be happy and calm, you need to prepare DevOps correctly.  This is a report from the head of the KubeCon program committee, Liz Rice, a good encoder and container security expert. <br><br>  You will learn step-by-step and in simple examples how to ensure security at each stage of the pipeline and what you need to do with your hands.  A good ‚Äúwarm-up‚Äù report for the selection. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  What we learned while doing our own emergency notification system </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alexey Kirpichnikov</b> <br>  Location: 9 <br>  Rating: 3.96 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/55koGPSUoUiguAYS6Sw6ME/ba89d588965743eda9308baddd0dfcee/Alexey_Kirpichnikov_What_did_we_learn_while_making_our_own_alerting_system.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_tk-Ewp4V0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you thought that sending alerts was easy, then listen to Alexey‚Äôs mesmerizing stories about all those regular and contingency situations that a monitoring system developer has to face.  All ideas and solutions were tested with sweat and blood during the development of Moira, which Avito, Kontur and Yandex.Money use. <br><br>  All decisions during the development of the alert system are made simultaneously in the development, design and administration, and the report focuses on how to combine them and not cause a conflict of interest.  Listeners very positively accepted Alexey‚Äôs story, many admitted that his stories about rockets and nuclear reactors helped to rethink the approach to alerts and learn something new (both in practical and in ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù sense). <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Happy life with Kubernetes in production </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Evgeny Dekhtyarev</b> <br>  Location: 8 <br>  Rating: 3.99 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/NKg77pl5yCYegmqukICiw/380cbc58d4169631c43f5f4d7200c979/Evgeny_Dekhtyarev_Life_of_happiness_with_Kubernetes_in_production.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E6O_TU_twf8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A detailed story about how in 2GIS it was decided to reduce the time-to-market, after which the developers switched to a new approach to managing and working with applications - using Kubernetes.  According to Eugene, it‚Äôs easy to get Kubernetes in production, but when there are several of them in different data centers, there are various nuances that you need to know about. <br><br>  Eugene talks about the necessary components of Kubernetes, how they are prepared, what problems they stumbled upon and how they were solved - regard the report as an ‚Äúinstruction‚Äù for deploying the environment.  It is perfect for those who want to know what will happen if you deploy several Kubernetes at once and how to fix it. <br><br>  A good balance between personal experience, depth of presentation, humor and presentation of cluster architecture with conclusions and morality. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  As we wrote an open source platform for managing different Kubernetes clusters: difficulties and their solutions </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alena Prokhorchik</b> <br>  Location: 7 <br>  Rating: 3.99 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6HI0rLShvaqweeS4ukqYqw/54c988d2b86ae44f05e99d0ed04ef81a/Alena_Prokharchyk_How_we_were_building_an_open_source_platform_for_managing_multiple_Kubernetes_clusters_pitfalls_and_soluti.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsAwuffrTT4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you are not familiar with Rancher (the open source cluster management platform Kubernetes), but want to meet you, this report is for you.  Wonderful Alyona talks about the product ‚Äúfirst hand‚Äù, shares stuffed cones, discusses how to correctly work with multiple clusters at once and how to solve problems. <br><br>  Listeners separately note the openness of the story: Alena describes how the product was developed, what it encountered during development and explains why it is needed at all and how it can help developers. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Keynote: The seven archetypes of a DevOps transformation </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>John Willis</b> <br>  Location: 6 <br>  Rating: 4.02 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6HI0rLShvaqweeS4ukqYqw/54c988d2b86ae44f05e99d0ed04ef81a/Alena_Prokharchyk_How_we_were_building_an_open_source_platform_for_managing_multiple_Kubernetes_clusters_pitfalls_and_soluti.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7FmABKOXLU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  An opening keynote from one of the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of DevOps - about why DevOps does not work in companies and how to fix it.  This is a great way to ‚Äúplunge‚Äù into newcomers to DevOps, sort through its essence and get a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to move, so that the principles of DevOps work properly. <br><br>  For this, John identifies 7 special patterns that appear in each company in which he worked and uses them to explain how an organization can transform into DevOps (it‚Äôs all about organizational culture).  Very honest and relevant information, literally tortured by vast combat experience. <br><br>  As some conference attendees stated - ‚Äúa very powerful guy‚Äù! <br><br><br><hr><br><h2>  Kafka on Kubernetes: The Mysterious Story of Creating a Cloud Streaming Data Platform </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Victor Gamov</b> <br>  Location: 5 <br>  Rating: 4.07 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://speaking.gamov.io/enaM1R/kafka-na-kubernetes-zagadochnaya-istoriya-sozdaniya-oblachnoy-platformy-potochnoy-obrabotki-dannyh">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23H5wCJXqPo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Who, if not the ‚ÄúKafka man‚Äù Victor Gamow, should talk about Kafka and Kubernetes, making it quick, fervent and very interesting? <br><br>  See: if you need an efficient, efficient, real-time, distributed data-processing platform, Apache Kafka.  If you need a scalable cloud application with high resiliency, redundancy and load balancing - these are Kubernetes. <br><br>  Having crossed the hedgehog with a snake, you get a scalable application that processes streams in real time in the cloud.  In his report, Victor talks about how to figure out this crossover, pays attention to the little things that one will have to deal with and helps with the choice whether to launch Apache Kafka or not. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Modern security with microservices and the cloud </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Seth Vargo</b> <br>  Location: 4 <br>  Rating: 4.10 <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qx2N6EDIIow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  An important talk about the importance of security in developer advocate microservice applications on Google by Seth Wargo.  He will talk about the basic principles of security and best practices of modern microservice systems, and as an example of a solution, he will use the free open source Vault and teach him how to work with it. <br><br>  Among the topics covered are static and dynamic secrets, ‚Äúencryption as a service‚Äù, new problems with the security of microservices, and much more.  The report will be useful to anyone who is even a little worried about the safety of their product and systems based on microservices. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Ansible playbooks is code: we test, test, integrate continuously </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Ivan Ponomarev</b> <br>  Location: 3 <br>  Rating: 4.14 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/2y8s3QHWlKGqyogKOueeca/6440bb8d95f8c2ad5434309f7adb948c/Ivan_Ponomarev_Ansible_playbooks_are_code_verifying__testing_and_continuously_integrating_it.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkP0PGMbWxY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Ansible has an amazing ability to turn into garbage at a wild speed and ‚Äúconverge to hell,‚Äù says Vyacheslav Kuznetsov from the DevOops program committee. <br>  And Ivan just talks about how not to turn the fragile result of work in Ansible into garbage - with the help of testing.  In Docker containers. <br><br>  For example, Ansible is difficult to maintain as the code base grows - fear of changes and errors appears, and a number of tools that Ivan offers can cope with them.  For example, perform static analysis, test scripts, and configure CI systems to work with roles in Ansible Galaxy. <br><br>  A very simple and useful ‚Äúat least now go and implement‚Äù format report with many examples.  Thanks to Ivan for being able to cope and perform well despite a cold - and you support him by watching the report! <br><br><hr><br><h2>  #DataDrivenDevOps </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Baruch Sadogursky, Leonid Igolnik</b> <br>  Place: 2 <br>  Rating: 4.15 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/62uTcjphWE2KUekkUgK06g/81cc6f642c36211f1198c3f5a62e3186/Baruch_Sadogursky_Leonid_Igolnik__DataDrivenDevOps.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEO9RLzAa_4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Data is our everything, and without it, "you are just another person with a very valuable opinion."  Traditionally peppy, bright and useful performance from Baruch and Leonid, both joint reports of which were included in the top five at the previous DevOops. <br><br>  Report on how to integrate metrics with end-to-end functionality from development, operation and testing in such a way as to better understand what is happening in the organization and how to make decisions based on data.  Practice, tips and examples of such metrics for DevOps, data-driven, which you can immediately put into practice.  Highly recommended for viewing to all DevOps evangelists. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Dumb services in smart networks: deploy like a ninja using Istio service mesh </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Anton Weiss</b> <br>  Location: 1 <br>  Rating: 4.22 <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/1gLh1qPmJGwsaye2CKgg6g/4ab1095a2f480fc4cb23c71adaad5e89/Anton_Weiss_Dumb_services_in_smart_nets_deploy_like_a_ninja_with_Istio_service_mesh.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/By-DEHiH5mg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And here is the best report according to DevOops visitors!  It is about the details and guts of the Istio technology - the open source implementation of a service sieve developed by Google, IBM and Lyft.  It helps in the operation of microservices on Kubernetes through monitoring, analysis, and provides stability - all in a centralized place, without any (almost) changes in the application code. <br><br>  Anton will explain why Istio is the approach that will allow services to not know anything about the platform and not bother about it, but simply to carry out their business functions without harm to the developer and architecture.  Of course, not without its own characteristics. <br><br>  Be sure to look at the report: Anton explains it easily and with simple examples and live demonstrations.  Deserved first place. <br><br><blockquote> While you are watching these reports, <b>DevOops 2019</b> is <b>being</b> prepared in full swing (Petersburg, October 29-30).  Among the speakers there will be many heroes of this top, loved by the audience: <b>Baruch Sadogursky</b> , and <b>Victor Gamov</b> , and rating leader <b>Anton Weiss</b> . <br>  Ticket prices are gradually increasing, the nearest increase is July 31.  You can see all the relevant information <a href="http://devoops.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D461765">on the conference website</a> , buy tickets in the same place. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461765/</a></p>
