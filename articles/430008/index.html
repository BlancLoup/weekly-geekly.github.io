  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ugears: horses, sailboats and other royal entertainment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nd/lz/ip/ndlzipuld3j5ro-2b1ahqbuiasg.jpeg"><br><br>  Last spring, the Ukrainian startup Ugears conducted the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/978262034/ugears-mechanical-evolution-highlights/">fifth crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise funds for a collection of wooden designers.  Another campaign, another collection - it seems that this is not news, but designers manage to come up with something new every time.  For example, a mechanical winding horse, stepping from foot to foot, or a sailboat with a proudly waving flag. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the glory of the designers / 3D puzzles Ugears passed by you, we remind you that these are prefabricated models with a characteristic design in the style of klokvork / steampunk.  For assembly only parts and instructions are needed, no extra tools or glue.  Although the candle for lubrication does not hurt, as the stationery knife - to separate the small Circuits. <br><br>  Every detail is pre-cut by a laser, and it is enough to squeeze it out of the tablet.  As a rule, the larger the model, the thicker the instruction, and the assembly is longer and more difficult.  It is not easy even in the physical sense, i.e.  Some elements should fit very tightly together.  This boom assembly will bring considerable pleasure.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f-/zd/im/f-zdimft5wgfvjdesfsg7vcetqi.gif"><br><br>  Most of the designers in assembled form move: trains roll on rails, combines twist a threshing machine, locks snap into place.  They are set in motion by a complex system of gears and engines with elastic bands. <br><br>  We talked about the models <a href="https://habr.com/company/madrobots/blog/411409/">from the spring collection earlier</a> .  Now it is time for new products that finally appeared in Russia. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-horse-mechanoid/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Horse Mechanoid</a> </h3><br>  The Ugears team has been working on this model for 8 months.  The difficulty was that the designers wanted the horse, as it should be, to move four legs without additional supports and not to fall. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MeJ_NUrB30U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Difficult engineering problem solved brilliantly.  Like other wind-up models of the Ugears, the horse is set in motion thanks to an engine powered by a stretched elastic band (it is called ‚Äúrubber motor‚Äù in the company).  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the mechanical model is the pendulum, which slows down the transfer of energy from the engine to moving parts and extends the total running time.  The legs of the horse are moving due to the grab mechanisms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/kt/nt/ooktntxw0j7xz6hea-0lyuz8rtm.jpeg"><br><br>  Particular attention was paid to the anatomical accuracy of the model.  The toy paces just like a live horse, carefully rearranging each limb and tapping with wooden hooves.  It should be borne in mind that the horse will not go far and will not ride away into the sunset, but, frozen in place, will not fall.  The wooden horse is perfectly balanced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k4/nh/fe/k4nhfefwjosr6ufbiszjudvkcaa.jpeg"><br><br>  A horse model is assembled from 410 parts in approximately 9 hours.  However, the construction is complicated, so for an inexperienced designer the process will be delayed. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-trimaran-merihobus/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Sailboat "Merihobus"</a> </h3><br>  The sailboat was the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù model of the crowdfunding campaign.  This is not just a sailboat, but a trimaran, three-hulled ship.  On the first boats of this type the ancient Polynesians sailed.  The modern trimaran was invented by Viktor Chechet, a former military pilot of the Russian Imperial Army.  He experimented with three-ship ships still at home in Kiev.  Chechet fully realized his idea after immigration to the USA. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/db_VNs_csro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  An elegant boat does not float because it lacks plating.  "Skeletal" design is typical for Ugears and is chosen specifically so that you can see the internal structure of the ship: frames, bulkheads, beams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9r/l6/hq/9rl6hqhtb2i6u4ecicznhs-ykf4.jpeg"><br><br>  The ship's steering wheel is controlled by sores, which are connected to the drive wheel at the stern.  Side keels support the sailboat in a stable position.  The side floats are connected to the main body by an elegant frame.  On them are working winches with lifeboats.  To bring the boat to the "water", you need to twist the handle of the mechanism.  The anchor also comes down with the help of a wheel: in Ugears they love such details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d-/aj/qj/d-ajqj9i-zgqfd8xbwevq8saum8.jpeg"><br><br>  Tri-sail can be raised or lowered.  The grotto is fixed on the mainmast and pulled down by a geek, it has its own halyard and levers for control.  The staysail twists around the head, for which a drum is provided.  The rig is very detailed, if not 1-in-1, then very close to what can be seen on a modern yacht. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/4r/tq/jv4rtqg_sbshovbshadlrhsosbw.jpeg"><br><br>  Finally, the flag on the mast rises and lowers its own winch.  On the nose there was a place carved talisman - seahorse.  The sailing ship is named after this sea creature. <br><br>  The total number of elements "Merihobus" - 237 pieces.  The assembly will take at least 15 hours, which will be a unique experience for any lover of sailboats and seas. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-heavy-boy-truck-vm-03/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Heavy Boy Truck VM-03</a> </h3><br>  From the sea, back to the expanses of land, on which the romp tractors.  The streams of these mighty cars are the blood of all developed economies.  In Ugears they like to create miniature versions of important equipment: among the wooden designers there were already tractors, and trucks, and a combine.  Now it's time to assemble your own tractor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/3a/v-/kw3av-0xpwdmuiiw17uwzt0y7jq.jpeg"><br><br>  The model for the Heavy Boy Truck VM-03 model was modern heavy duty vehicles.  The small tractor has a six-cylinder engine and a powerful rezinomotor, in one plant of which he drives as much as five meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/4n/pd/hy4npd8xs5_ooue59hlzdfb8qjs.jpeg"><br><br>  The model is notable for serious detailing; there is even a cabin for the rest of a tired chauffeur - with a wooden TV.  For the Heavy Boy, a large trailer was also invented, into which three flower pots are easily placed.  Trailer sold separately. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Y54aQEORAg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Heavy Boy Truck VM-03 is assembled from 541 parts in about 12 hours. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-v-express-steam-train-with-tender/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Locomotive V-Express</a> </h3><br>  Ugears designers are especially successful at trains and rail mechanisms.  Therefore, improvisation on the theme of technology of the Victorian century, the V-express steam locomotive, was among the models of the fifth campaign.  Old steam trains were taken for the sample, while the locomotive itself runs on the same rubber motor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/_q/c-/rv_qc-6jcgkaiofjzt9dfyii2co.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the updated design, the novelty is distinguished by high speed and efficiency.  One turn of the key is enough for the train to drive four meters.  The kit comes 2.45 meters wooden rails. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xb-6DomtlPM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The new road is not compatible with the old additional rail sets: the width does not match.  Ugears definitely decided to follow in the footsteps of Emperor Nicholas I, who, according to a popular historical legend, chose a deliberately incompatible with the European standard of gauge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/cw/9n/8ocw9nnfbycqyz1b0igcg8xtypg.jpeg"><br><br>  The impressive locomotive consists of ‚Äúonly‚Äù 538 parts.  Approximately the assembly process will take 10 hours, in reality it will take more time. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-roadster-vm-01/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">VM-01 roadster</a> </h3><br>  The pretty model of the Roadster VM-01 sports car is yet another return to retro, which is so much loved by Ugears designers.  Samples for a brisk winding machine served as post-war American cars - "Studebakers", "Fiats" and "Fords" 40s and 50s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s_7VTH2SXL8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the 18th century, Norfolian trotters were called ‚Äúroadsters‚Äù.  This fast and hardy breed of horses was bred as a working and draft, for long journeys.  Over time, the word "roadster" migrated to bicycles and tricycles, and then to open cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/4s/wk/if4swkw7pw9goge6k1p-rbtppki.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside the wooden "Roadster" is hidden functioning 8-cylinder engine.  To look at it, flip the hood lid.  But the impressive detail only decorates the car.  Her real rezinomotor starts a pair of turns of the key in the form of a wheel "spare wheel".  The model has a working transmission and suspension. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/_e/md/b6_emd8p_fgyiqusoaozyq_iwei.jpeg"><br><br>  Roadster VM-01 comes in the form of finished parts in the amount of 437 pieces.  Assembly time - 10 hours. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-bike/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Bike VM-02</a> </h3><br>  The VM-02 motorcycle model is the first wooden Harley developed by the Ugears.  Its design is inspired by the classic "steel horses" of the 30s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve_KB3XNMTo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The energy of a once-established rubber motor allows a small motorcycle to drive three meters.  The design of the VM-02 has a special stop, but the two-wheel model is well balanced and stands still and without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/0z/aw/jd0zaw92noml6ixnwyoltxgqvsm.jpeg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI need your clothes, boots and motorcycle‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Bike VM-02 consists of 189 elements.  In theory, it will take you 2 hours of free time to squeeze and join them according to the instructions.  If it does not come out so quickly - do not be discouraged and enjoy the process. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/ugears-royal-carriage/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">Bonus: Royal Carriage</a> </h3><br>  Together with spring crowdfunding in Ugears announced a special toy that was not included in the collection on Kickstarter.  It was a royal carriage model, timed to the wedding of Prince Harry and actress Megan Markle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3u/z7/pf/3uz7pfgj5ti0yf7irmg5z4jc9dk.jpeg"><br><br>  The prototype was a really existing State Landau crew in 1902.  It was used at the wedding of Harry's elder brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton.  On the same landau they drove on their wedding day through the streets of London to Princess Diana and Prince Charles.  True, in the end, Prince Harry and his bride preferred another carriage: Ascot Landau. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/kr/wa/rjkrwa2hsqvjw50iunnb0ojbv5i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Left: Ascot Landau with Prince Harry and Megan Markle.</i>  <i>Right: State Landau with Prince William and Kate Middleton.</i> <br><br>  The model is an open carriage, which harnessed four wooden horses.  A team is needed only for decoration, and a hidden rubber motor drives the carriage in motion.  The motor starts a few turns of the key with the Ugears logo, located in the rear of the wagon.  At one factory, the carriage passes 4 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h-/xk/re/h-xkreu5brnz2aqorlzkgzn-h4a.jpeg"><br><br>  The doors of the model, decorated with royal emblems, open and close.  A couple of lackeys are sitting on the heels.  The body is suspended with elastic bands so that it does not shake while riding.  Wheels are covered with the same rubber bands as tires.  The kit includes two sets of passenger figures: a pair of Prince Harry and his bride Megan Markle, as well as Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Duke of Edinburgh Philip. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-focKnzU2p0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The royal carriage is assembled in 4 hours from 290 parts. <br><br>  All designers Ugears, including new items, <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/ugears/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus">you can buy in Madrobots</a> . <br><br>  Right now, the Ugears team is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/978262034/ugears-games-unique-mechanical-devices-for-tableto">conducting another crowdfunding campaign</a> , already the sixth in a row (in a startup like Kickstarter).  Its main theme is board games.  In particular, backers are offered sets for assembling a screen for a game master, stands for game cards, and such a tricky thing as a tower for throwing dice.  We are closely following the work of the company and tell you about new designers in our blog. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/g0/i7/qqg0i7eriq4febfjqqehire4fnw.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dug_merihobus"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/1y/yw/bv1yywjgl2_cbtzvvtk4rup2jz8.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430008/</a></p>
