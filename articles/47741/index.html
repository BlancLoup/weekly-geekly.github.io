Under this slogan is the regular All-Russian festival of Internet projects ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù.  This is a new format, thanks to which it is planned to expand the boundaries of the use of the Internet and popularize it throughout Russia.  The uniqueness of the competition is that regional projects will be able to get federal publicity and declare themselves in all their glory. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The organizers of the New Reality Festival are the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies (ROCIT) and TTK.  The festival is supported by the All-Russian Internet MARATHON. <br><br>  The competition for the best Internet resources at the regional level is held for the third time with the support of ROCIT and has already managed to become a landmark event for the entire Russian Internet industry.  In 2008, a new interactive Festival website was launched, which is available at <a href="http://www.novreal.ru/">www.novreal.ru</a> .

      ‚ÄúA higher level of Internet penetration allows today, even in the most remote corners of Russia, to implement projects aimed at creating new opportunities for the development of users.  We are talking about Internet projects that provide freedom of expression, human self-realization and a unique environment for communication, which are aimed at developing the intellectual, aesthetic, moral potential of people, promoting humanitarian ideas and ideals, ‚Äùcommented Arkady Matkovsky, vice president for relations with public company TTK. <br><br>  It is worth noting that since 2008 the format of the ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù Festival has undergone some changes compared to previous years: the festival takes place at a different time, the criteria for evaluating nominees will be changed and supplemented, but most importantly, the contest nominations have been reformulated with the latest Internet community. <br>  There are still ten nominations, but they sound like this: <br>  1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET IN THE REGIONS (only ORGANIZATIONS) <br>  The personal award is given to a leader in the region who forms and develops the IT community.  The award is awarded to the regional leader by decision of the jury. <br>  2. BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET <br>  Nomination, in which the winner is the best business-oriented project, commercial organizations that conduct business on the Internet are invited to nominate. <br>  3. SCIENCE AND EDUCATION <br>  Internet resources that develop science and education on the Internet are nominated. <br>  4. CULTURE <br>  Nomination, designed to determine the best online resources in the field of culture: museums, library collections, theaters, etc. <br>  5. MEDIA AND MASS COMMUNICATIONS <br>  The nomination involved the websites of the media and media communication. <br>  6. REGIONAL AND URBAN INTERNET RESOURCES <br>  Websites are invited for nomination, the main content of which is aimed at the development and popularization of a particular region, district, city, etc. <br>  7. WEB 2.0 <br>  Nomination, in which Internet resources are estimated, which use the newest means of forming the user environment. <br>  8. NON-COMMERCIAL INTERNET PROJECTS <br>  In this nomination, non-commercial Internet projects take part, the main task of which is to solve the problems of society or to popularize socially significant ideas, projects, etc. <br>  9. INTERNET FOR CHILDREN <br>  Projects and resources intended specifically for children and their parents are invited for nomination. <br>  10. ENTERTAINMENT <br>  In this nomination, the best entertainment internet projects will be revealed: games, posters, Internet communities, etc. <br>  An undoubted innovation is the moment that the terms of the Festival "New Reality" are now extended, it allows you to cover a greater number of Internet projects.  And the culmination of the Competition will be the announcement of the festival laureates at the main event of the Internet industry, the Russian Internet Forum, which will be held in early April 2009. <br>  Representatives of the ten best Internet projects of the RIF-2009 Competition will receive special prizes from the Project Organizing Committee. <br>  So, the Festival "New Reality" passes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ September 2008 - January 2009, the main phase of the competition is underway: applications for participation are being accepted. <br>  ‚Ä¢ February - March 2009, the work of the expert councils of the festival begins, which will determine 70 regional winners. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In March, the Federal Jury will determine 10 WINNERS who will be awarded at the ‚ÄúRussian Internet Forum - 2009‚Äù, which will be held from April 1 to 4. <br><br>  At present, the acceptance of applications for the competition in the ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù competition continues, from January 2009 the Organizing Committee will start forming an expert body consisting of the jury of the Federal Expert Commission. <br>  You can apply at: <a href="http://novreal.ru/registration/">novreal.ru/registration</a> <br><br>  For more information, please contact the press service. <br>  Festival "New Reality" <br>  Phone: +7 495 718-8400 <br>  E-mail: pr@novreal.ru <br>  Web: <a href="http://www.novreal.ru/">www.novreal.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47741/</a></p>
