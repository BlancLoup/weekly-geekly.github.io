  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rat race</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I bought last winter the famous <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/peripheral/logitech-mx-revo.shtml">MX Revolution of a</a> wonderful company Logitech.  The mouse was acquired in the famous Ukrainian network for the sale of household appliances <a href="http://www.comfy.com.ua/">Comfy</a> .  I first went to the store, looked at the mouse, clarified the price, at that time it was 699 hryvnia (~ $ 85) + discount.  And when the seller got me from the shop window, it was covered with a thick layer of dust, and instead of wiping it, he looked at me for a long time.  The next day came in order to get this device.  When they began to punch the goods, it turned out that the price had increased to 760 hryvnia, although the price tag was the same.  And the seller refused to accept the discount card motivating it with the fact that it is like a promotional product, which goes at the lowest price.  To my question ‚Äúwhat kind of action is it if it was yesterday at 60 hryvnia cheaper?‚Äù, He silently lowered his eyes.  My Visa Gold was also refused to be accepted as it receives a 5% discount.  The most interesting thing is that since the opening of this branch it has not sold a single instance of MX Revolution.  After that, I decided to go on principle and achieve what I am entitled to by law, namely, to buy goods at the price indicated on the price tag.  In general, after long pleas and threats, the branch manager came, who allowed me to release the mouse at the stated price, but without a discount. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The mouse is wonderful, I will not describe its merits, because a lot of things have already been said about them :).  My wife is engaged in photography and digital processing of photographs, so she got the mouse.  But after a little more than six months, the spouse began to complain about problems with the left button.  According to her, from time to time a single press worked as a multiple.  I decided to check everything myself, and connected it to my laptop.  It is necessary to add that the problem did not immediately manifest itself, but with prolonged use I began to notice that when I selected something or when dragging it, when the button was held, the MouseUp action spontaneously occurred and was allocated from a new place.  Immediately, I did not attach much importance to this, but then this problem began to progress and manifested itself more and more often.  And then I remembered the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/tech_support/68179/">articles of the</a> respected <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/scandi/" class="user_link">scandi</a> and decided to try my luck in the support of Logitek. <br>  I had no particular illusions, but decided it was worth a try.  This is what my first letter looked like, which I sent via the form located at the company's office: <br><blockquote>  The mouse was acquired less than a year ago. <br>  The last couple of months, there are problems with the left mouse button. <br>  Very often, when you press the left mouse button, the action is triggered several times, or when a block is selected, the selection is removed and highlighted from the new location, as if the button were released and pressed again. <br>  The problem with the mouse is observed on different computers and different operating systems, with SetPoint installed and without it. </blockquote><br>  After 40 minutes came the answer from the support: <br><blockquote>  Vladimir, if there is a check from the purchase, I advise you to contact the store for a replacement, according to your description, the problem is in the product itself. </blockquote><br><br>  Yes, I still have unforgettable impressions from the moment of purchase.  Of course, I was sure that I would be ‚Äúshaved off‚Äù there, but there was nothing to be done, it was necessary to follow the instructions of the technical support officer. <br>  Before going, I got acquainted with the part of the Law on Consumer Rights that I was interested in.  It turned out that in 2006 significant changes were made to it.  If a deficiency was detected in the product earlier during the warranty period, then it was possible to demand that the product be replaced, money refunded or part of the costs compensated.  According to the new amendments, the deficiency is differentiated into ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù and ‚Äúnot significant‚Äù. <br>  Demand a refund or replacement of goods is possible only if the defect is recognized as significant.  In the case of a minor deficiency, you can only rely on the repair or refund of a certain amount covering this defect. <br>  A significant disadvantage is recognized if: <br><ul><li>  cannot be eliminated; </li><li>  elimination of this defect requires more than 14 days; </li><li>  makes the product something significantly different than under the contract (if you bought an iron, but because of a defect instead of heating it catches closed porn channels, then it can be exchanged without problems :)) </li></ul><br>  After reading this, I realized that changing the mouse in Comfy does not shine for me.  In the store, contrary to my fears, a rather adequate young man listened to me, and said that in any case, the decision to replace should be made by the service center, which is located in Kiev.  After that I suggested connecting a mouse to confirm the defect.  For ten minutes he stubbornly "tried" to reproduce the problem, but the fact is that if you press the button harder than usual, the defect does not manifest at all, I told him about it even when I described the fault.  She didn‚Äôt convince the seller several times in my hands in this way.  This is how our final dialogue looked like: <br>  <b>- I don‚Äôt see a problem here, I just need to press the button normally, all the more so that there are no any GOST standards regarding the effort that needs to be made.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- But excuse me, because when you press the button, a characteristic click is heard, just like when you release it, isn't it?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- It depends on what models.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Well, in this?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- You understand, even if I accept it for repair, the service will be checked in the same way, the mouse will be returned to you in the same condition in which it was accepted and another transfer fee will be required</b> (50, or 150 UAH, I did not hear) . <br><br>  After this phrase, I realized that I wouldn‚Äôt get any more from him, and decided to score on everything - take care of my nerves.  But when he came home and after working for a couple of hours, she decided to finish the job.

    <h4>  Second letter </h4><br><blockquote>  The store refused to replace, offered only repair after it is confirmed malfunction.  But the fact is that if you hold the button with force, then the malfunction does not manifest itself, and the technical consultant of the store, of course, could not detect the defect (the nature of the problem was communicated to him in advance). <br><br>  The mouse was bought for processing photos, but in this case it is simply not possible, because  Artistic retouching of photos implies multiple selection of the object and dragging it, but with these actions, the defect is fully manifested, and the selection is removed literally every 3-4 times. <br><br>  I myself am a fan of Logitech products, I consider it to be of very high quality, I own more than one Logitech product, including a webcam, a gamepad, and other mice.  I would not like to be disappointed in your products, because, as I understand, a mouse of this class should not have such problems. <br><br>  I would be very grateful for your understanding and assistance in resolving this issue. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Tech Support Answer: <br><blockquote>  Vladimir, just about the photo.  Take an A4 sheet, put your mouse + receiver on it, write your incident number on the sheet itself (012345-678910 so that we can see), take a photo of the whole thing and send it to me (do not make a big resolution). <br>  I also need your full address including your home phone number + zip code. <br><br>  We will do a replacement. </blockquote><br><h4>  Waiting for a miracle </h4><br>  Here it is, the magic word - replacement !!!  I remembered Craig Tucker's favorite phrase from South Park: ‚ÄúIf they sent me a new mouse, I would be soooo happy‚Äù :). <br>  Sent a letter with the address, attached photo mouse and receiver, and began to mentally prepare to break the old one. <br><br>  But to my great surprise, in the reply letter, there was not a word about any actions with the old mouse: <br><blockquote> Vladimir, I replaced your product.  Delivery from 7 to 10 working days, replacement and delivery of the product - completely free.  Delivery will come to your specified address. </blockquote><br><br>  By evening, two more letters arrived.  One from Logitek, generated by the robot, informed that the package was assembled and shipped, and the other from UPS, the carrier, contained a Tracking Number, by which the package could be tracked and the estimated delivery date, in my case it was November 6, that is a week later.  A couple of days later, on Monday, the package was already in the Kiev office of UPS.  On Wednesday, there was a message in the tracking form that UPS could not contact the customer, which is probably because I indicated my home phone number.  I decided to call the office located in our city.  An employee named Irina answered me.  One of the first questions she asked was: ‚ÄúAre you registered at the delivery address?‚Äù.  But I‚Äôm not registered at all, I‚Äôve received parcels from abroad for the first time, and I thought that they should send her home =) and therefore I indicated the address where I live.  It turned out that this is very bad and that UPS will not deliver the parcel to our city until I decide something with customs.  Well, come: ( <br><br><h4>  Customs </h4><br>  The customs officer said that the only solution to the problem with the mismatch between the address of registration and the actual address of residence will be an email in any form, from the sender with the correction of the address of the recipient.  Yeah, I thought that the registration was already abolished, but here such crap. <br>  I wrote a letter back to Logitech asking me to send my registration address to the carrier. <br>  Response letter: <br><blockquote>  Vladimir, your product should be transferred to you, since the city coincides both at the address of registration and at an unofficial address, and this is by law, I received this information from UPS in Ukraine.  Here is the UPS phone number in your city, if you have any questions, call this number: +380675698681. </blockquote><br>  This number was the number of Irina from UPS, with whom I spoke. <br>  I call Irina.  She offers me to contact her colleagues from Kiev, from whom Logitek received the information provided to me in his last letter, and ask them to clear my package (since they are so smart :)).  Here it is our sovok service, the staff of one organization cannot solve the problems between themselves.  Write down the phone, which I dictated Irina.  I‚Äôve been trying to reach the Kiev office for a long time: I‚Äôm busy, I‚Äôm not answering the phone. <br>  I'm calling.  The girl on the other end listened to me and gave the number of the responsible officer, as she does not have information on this issue.  Hour tried to dial a new phone, no one picks up the phone.  I can hardly dial the first number, saying so and so, they do not answer that number.  She offers to switch and O MIRACLE!  they pick up the phone.  I describe my problem.  I am told that in principle it is possible, but you need to talk to the head of the department, and give his number. <br>  I call the manager who informs me that their firm does not deal with the processing of documents, it only delivers the package to customs, all that is further is the problem of the recipient. <br>  I call again to the customs, I get on the man who informs me that in principle the problem is solved, you need to write a statement to the carrier, and he will write a statement to the customs. <br>  At lunch I go to clarify exactly what statements you need to write and in what form.  Benefit just 10 minutes walk from the office.  I get on the woman with whom I spoke on the phone.  She begins to explain to me: ‚ÄúCustoms must guarantee that the package will be received by the person for whom it was sent‚Äù.  And since the address of the recipient does not match the address indicated in my passport, they cannot do it.  She says politely, but her face at the same time becomes such that I begin to fear that she did not eat me. <br>  I get a certificate stating that I really live at the delivery address, take a spouse who is registered at this address, a marriage certificate, her passport, go back to the customs.  We fall on the same woman in the form.  We show documents.  We get the answer: <br>  <b>- The parcel will come, we will look.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- What to look at?</b>  <b>Is it not clear from these documents that the parcel is addressed to me?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- We must also make sure that this address is not a legal entity.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- What is the legal entity, the wife is registered there, in the passport it is indicated.</b>  <b>If the legal entity is located at the address, the premises are derived from the housing stock.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- The package will arrive, we will look.</b> <br>  Well, at least some shifts, although I have a feeling that she is mocking. <br><br>  The vicious circle, UPS does not want to bring the parcel to the city, until something is decided with the customs, and the customs can not answer anything until they see the parcel, which in principle is logical. <br>  I call Irina, I transfer conversation with customs.  She is trying to figure out from me there is some hope of victory.  I convince her that everything will be fine, she orders the package.  In principle, in case of a file, I have a backup plan.  I spoke with a lawyer I knew, who informed me that there is no reason for refusal by customs, so in case of failure I can write an official letter asking for customs clearance of my package addressed to their manager, then let them argue their refusal. <br>  While I was waiting for the parcel, I managed to find out what lucky I was: the estimated cost of the parcel is only 50 euros, up to 200 euros is not charged, but this is on condition that the courier has the status ‚Äúinternational mail‚Äù (for example, UPS), but if the delivery service has the status ‚Äú courier express delivery ‚Äù(as is the case with DHL and FedEx), then there is a conflict of law and the duty will still have to be paid. <br>  Only a week later the parcel arrives in my city.  With Irina, we agreed to meet at 14-00 at the reception of customs.  She warned that the paperwork may take more than an hour and said that the radio control had already passed for me. <br>  He was received by a customs official who spoke very politely and did not even glance at me, unlike his female colleague.  He asked for a copy of the passport and code, checked it with the original, then proceeded to open the package.  I inspected all the details of the packaging, put everything back in the box and informed me that the package was temporarily delayed.  While I was thinking about how ‚Äútemporary‚Äù Irina, under the guidance of a customs officer, filled out the documents and gave them to me for signature.  After that I was handed a package.  To say that I was surprised, it does not say anything!  It is obvious that for some people it‚Äôs easy to create problems for someone: ( <br><br><h4>  Let's sum up </h4><br>  I spent a little less than three weeks on everything.  For customs clearance, we had to pay 105 hryvnia 60 kopecks (~ $ 13), plus communication costs of about 50 hryvnia (~ $ 6).  I hope someone will benefit from my experience. <br><br>  <b>NB: I would like to thank the Logitech technical support staff, and ask everyone who read this post not to abuse trust.</b> <br><br>  <b>UPD: I apologize when I created a topic in Habr√©, I really missed a rather significant piece between the letter of technical support about the replacement and acquaintance with the customs.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75149/</a></p>
