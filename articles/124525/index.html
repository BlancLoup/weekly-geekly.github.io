  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio project and how to deal with it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Habr and its inhabitants. <br>  What prompted to write this post?  First of all, the poor state of some radio projects.  If even more precisely: errors that can be learned from the example of others. <br>  So, we shake on a mustache, maybe it will come in handy in life. <br><br>  In my lifetime I have seen three radio projects.  It all started in about the same way: ‚ÄúLet's make a radio, because we have something to tell people, and we know how to organize it.‚Äù  Well, let's arrange. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the teams, in all three cases, there were coders-programmers with hands growing from the right place.  But with a different attitude to life.  As it turned out later, this is also important.  The main thing: be patient, it is desirable more, because it is still for you hoo how useful. <br>  So, these same programmers easily set up servers for the radio, picked up the necessary software, formats, settings, and other necessary tools.  Of course not in one evening.  Setup took on different projects a different amount of time (which is not surprising). <br><br>  Information on the network about how-where-when-who can help you set up a server - the sea.  Although I think you yourself will cope with this task. <br>  As it turned out, the standard sound card (in 70% of DJs and ryeys) was suitable for medium quality ethers with the basic stream settings in the <a href="http://spacial.com/sam-broadcaster">SAM Broadcaster</a> program with parameters: High Quality (high quality) and 128kb / s format 44.1kHz, stereo.

      The quality of microphones and headsets is quietly omitted here, since it (quality) left much to be desired.  Although what's interesting is that sometimes the usual, seemingly cheapest microphone (hereinafter: the mic) exceeded the more expensive sound quality and, at a glance, the more serious model. <br><br>  So, after the test setup of the servers and the choice of the optimal settings for each DJ (with acceptable equipment for this) two new questions appeared on the queue: <br><ul><li>  How to pick up the equipment for reasonable money? </li><li>  How and where to create an information page? </li></ul><br><br>  The answer to the first question you can tell any technician.  Or at least a man versed in physics.  All the tips will help, from young to old: from the reception ‚Äúwind a long wire into a ring‚Äù to the techniques ‚Äúbuy an old, but time-tested, sound machine‚Äù.  In general - the flag in your hands, it is purely individual. <br><br>  But the second question can be solved on our own, without attracting the already tired of setting up the server and communicating with DJs, a programmer and a technician.  How?  Handles, their own.  First, decide what you need: as soon as possible, declare yourself online or show the World your professionalism and ambitions? <br>  Choosing the first - refer to social networks.  Groups, communities, accounts - your support and support.  Yes, and do not forget to write a few words about yourself and the project, select the name, if you have not yet reached out. <br>  Choosing the second - just do not forget to work on writing, and still stock up on ideas, paper, pencil and intelligent designers in the bargain.  And the designer, too, yes, yes!  Do not be afraid to use the engines for sites and redraw the templates.  Here you will again benefit from a proger and technician already rested by then.  Developed a concept, pulled the idea by the tail - go ahead!  Draw, work, rivet texts and sparkle with ideas. <br><br>  Happened? <br>  Not tired? <br>  We go further. <br><br>  So, we have assembled a team at the moment: programmer, technician, disinger, and the engine of the whole project - who can do little, except for building connections and jumping on the spot - the manager.  Someone is not enough ... oh, yes, DJ, darling, forgot.  Although each of the above can be a DJ, all the same in the state is better to recruit a couple of three of them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHow to dial?  Where?  Well, when will we air it already? ‚Äù <br>  Do not worry.  For the first test airs fit the already assembled team.  And after that will have to stock up on additional frames.  How?  The same pens, and the same social networks will help you.  Groups, communities, accounts - your support and support (for those who are in the tank).  Do not give up this opportunity.  So again we write the text.  Now about the DJ set.  We spread it in the net and like fishing - we are waiting for prey.  And while we are waiting, we are working on drawing up a plan of auditions, I will tell you the necessary case! <br>  Choose 4-5 assignments for a beginner: for diction, for reading aloud, for reaction, for awareness, and for imagination.  Just do not forget to go yourself, but it can be very ugly.  Chose-made?  Well done, and now finally decide who will listen and where.  We in all cases used the ‚Äúlive method‚Äù of communication in the notorious Skype program. <br><br>  Tip 1: listen to the whole team - objectively get.  How many times they tried to create commissions, as many times they encountered uncertainty and errors. <br><br>  Tip 2: Do not be lazy to create a questionnaire for applications.  This way it will be easier to weed out applications and time will save a lot more. <br><br>  Well, we staffed the staff.  Question: Who is in your team chief? <br>  Do not know?  So soon decide! <br>  Do you have a democracy?  From personal experience I will say: you will not go far on it. <br><br>  The main, preferably active and serious person at the post - is mandatory.  This is the key to success. <br>  Fewer problems, fights and incomprehensible conversations.  Outlined a plan - approved - work. <br><br>  Tip: Do not let the progro and / or equipment rest.  Depending on the nature of this can develop into big scandals.  And you simply will be without technical support.  Download their work: Setting up equipment for beginners, monitoring the server, site and other technical stuff.  And they can follow the base of the tracks too.  The main thing - do not give concessions. <br><br>  Immediately approve the grid, it must be followed.  No welter - another key to success.  Keep an archive of those esters and follow the information coming in the air.  To do this, you can enter an ether plan: lecture information, tracks and a list of sample questions for discussion with listeners. <br>  Stuck tedious, but effective.  I check the plans for about two years.  Many DJs twist and resist, but get used to.  And for newcomers, this is even calmer and you will be sure that they are ready. <br><br>  But it's all flowers. <br>  As a witness, I can easily say - without objectivity nowhere. <br>  The most difficult part in building a project is team organization.  People quarrel over trifles.  Different coalitions and conspiracies are formed.  Not sure about the person - we wave him a pen, you yourself will be more whole. <br><br>  And, perhaps, the post is long and tedious.  But this is only the beginning. <br>  Think carefully: do you need to intervene in this matter? <br>  Then oh, how sad it is to throw projects.  Without errors - nowhere, but sometimes they are difficult to fix. <br><br>  In general - good luck in all your endeavors! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124525/</a></p>
