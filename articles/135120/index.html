  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A gift from the company should also please!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Buying gifts for all sorts of holidays is almost the oldest task of marketers around the world.  At least that's how our work is seen by other departments.  And it is quite logical to expect that in the role of ‚Äúgift pickers‚Äù we have reached heights of skill.  The reality is much more prosaic, so after the new year, millions will receive corporate postcards with faceless greetings, non-writing pens with logos and other useless things. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, there are islands of hope in this ocean of identical souvenirs.  So, once I got a whole box of condensed milk.  This gift made an indelible impression on me and shaped me as a person. <br><br>  It would be dishonest to blame marketers alone in this situation.  Remember yourself when you are invited to a birthday party.  The need to choose a gift immediately throws you into a cold sweat, right?  And the eternal begins, "What do you give to the DR?  What you want, the main thing is attention. ‚Äù  Yes, the birthday boy himself does not really know what he wants, and now you break your head.  Well, if you know a person closely, and the budget allows you to donate some useful thing.  And if it is not?  So it turns out on the scale of the planet buying up useless things that are deposited on the shelves, in storerooms, at best, that can be peredarit.

      Now we will complicate the task, shifting it to the corporate direction.  Try to make a gift to a client, as a matter of fact to a stranger.  Yes, so that he liked.  And if there are ten such strangers?  And if a hundred?  Thousand?  What to do? <br><br>  In an attempt to save the planet from the migration of Chinese gifts from office to office, this post was born.  To give it the appearance of consistency, we will go from the budget - first consider the option of congratulations for 0 rubles 0 kopecks.  Then move on to more expensive gifts. <br><br><h4>  Gifts in the style of "Home - attention" </h4><br>  Not bad when there is a small list of clients that you personally know.  Then you can simply call everyone and congratulate with NG.  And send a postcard, of course.  It is only necessary to understand what to write in the congratulations. <br><br><h5>  Rule One: a warm word and a cat nice. </h5><br>  Congratulations can be written so that it will be more expensive than any gift.  The main thing is to be sincere, it will allow your words to be convincing.  In the complex relationship between us and our clients, we mostly try to be convincing only when we want to sell something.  But when it comes to greetings, standard phrases, borrowed at best from the greetings site, which is found on the first page of the search engine, are used.  And the result is something like this: ‚ÄúWe congratulate you on the upcoming New Year and wish you career accomplishments and labor feats‚Äù!  It turns out as sincerely as ‚ÄúThank you comrade.  Stalin for our happy childhood. <br><br>  If you think that writing sincere and kind words is difficult and long - you are mistaken.  That is the proof of all four words. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98e/1b4/891/98e1b4891f9dcdb8f58283052212961b.jpg"><br>  This message works flawlessly.  It will be wonderful to work as a greeting, for: <br><ol><li>  The main and only task of congratulations is to give a warm emotion. </li><li>  You can not want anything.  From the wishes all the same confusing little, they never come true. </li><li>  The more sincere, the better.  Of course, you should not send such a message to a person to whom you have delayed the delivery of goods for two weeks - the message will look like a mockery. </li><li>  Brevity is the soul of wit.  Long congratulations are an attempt to hide the stinginess of wishes behind the multi-storey construction of words. </li><li>  Laconic congratulations will be remembered.  Example: the equation E = MC2 everyone knows.  And now, who remembers the Schr√∂dinger equation, describing the change of state, given by the wave function, in Hamiltonian quantum systems?  That's the same thing.  Do not fence the forest of words! </li></ol><br><h5>  Rule two: write to a specific audience. </h5><br>  You will not please everyone.  If you make a gift that should suit all age groups, men and women, housewives and retired officers, you will get a wild mediocrity.  That the Strugatskys could afford to write ‚ÄúHappiness for all, for nothing!  And let no one leave offended. "  But they are classics, they are allowed a lot of things that are not allowed to us. <br><br>  In addition, if you think well, you can always find a place to add personality to your message.  Below - 3 different pictures for three different audiences: sci-fi lovers, musicians and bikers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25a/a81/8fc/25aa818fc31b47bccc1d2682a5d0bb75.png"><br><br>  Well, if there was a picture with Santa Claus for bikers, then you can certainly find it for other social groups! <br><br><h5>  Rule Three: Congratulate, Do Not Sell </h5><br>  Worse than mediocre greetings can only be mediocre greetings, followed by advertising.  Today I came to the post office: ‚ÄúBank XXX congratulates you on the upcoming New Year and wishes well-being and achievement of all your goals!  The bank is pleased to present you a unique opportunity to place your money very profitably and get the maximum income in the coming 2012 ‚Äù.  It is clear the desire of employees to fulfill the sales plan before the holidays, but congratulations should remain congratulations, why turn it into an advertising booklet? <br><br>  On the other hand, if you beat your "unique opportunity is very profitable ..." to invest money, you can avoid the unpleasant feeling of joining.  The easiest way to fasten greetings to the name of the year.  In the year of the rabbit, God himself gave cards to Viagra vendors, and in the year of the dragon, you may wish to get rid of fiery breath and heartburn and suggest Mezim.  Or you can just play with the numbers 2012, as we <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ru/company/news/2302">did</a> . <br><br><h5>  Rule Four: Take time. </h5><br>  Congratulations - this is not a task of the category "to be done, because it should be so."  This is your appeal to those people who carry you money, praise your products and advise you on what can be improved.  Once they have found time for you and your company, you, too, try to set aside a little of your attention for good congratulations.  Leave the idea to do it quickly.  Remember the phrase: ‚ÄúMasters lived beyond the river.  They did it quickly and cheaply, it turned out crookedly. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>So:</b> <br>  Rule One: a warm word and a cat nice. <br>  Rule two: write to a specific audience. <br>  Rule Three: Congratulate, Do Not Sell <br>  Rule Four: Take time. <br><br><h4>  Gifts in the style of "souvenir" </h4><br>  Branded key rings, pens and cups - this is already a classic.  This also includes calendars, which are good for giving to doctors.  Those hang them on the door - in most departmental clinics glass doors, I want to slap something. <br><br>  Lighters will also go, but they need to be distributed in clubs - where they abuse and smoke.  Here the rule is simple: the more expensive, the better, because the cheap thing is thrown away. <br><br>  Now about the cup.  The superiority of the cup over the handle or keyring is that there is enough space not only for the logo, but also for congratulations.  A vivid example of this is the text on the Starbucks glass ‚ÄúWe invite you to hear your desires and return hope to see the world not as it is, but as it could be.  Go ahead, make a wish.  After all, this is exactly what makes a holiday a holiday. ‚Äù <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b7/1ef/3f3/4b71ef3f342df97ce52b5c0a50c5608e.jpg"><br><br>  So Starbucks in a nice looking form invites you to visit its network of cafes.  Nothing prevents you from doing something interesting on a cup that you will give to customers. <br><br>  By the way, you can brand not only real-world objects.  No one bothers to make a small mobile application with your logo.  Of course, you still need to calculate how much it will pour out financially.  But if you have a lot of customers, it can be more cost effective to develop one application than to buy a mountain of gifts. <br><br><h4>  Gifts, with a hint of originality </h4><br>  Most of the unique gifts are more expensive, but getting them is more pleasant.  There really is enough imagination and budget.  When choosing, you can follow three simple rules.  The gift must be: <br><ul><li>  useful </li><li>  individual </li><li>  not domestic </li></ul><br>  What went well with us is a box with a set for mulled wine.  The gift was a wooden box containing dried cinnamon sticks, bags of spices and a bottle of wine.  To add beauty, it was all laid out on straw.  It looked very cute and even expensive, with a claim to sophistication.  I liked everything. <br>  The advantage of such a gift is that different customers can put different wines, depending on their preferences, status, and your budget.  Thus, in appearance, the same gift still emphasized the individuality of the person to whom he is being handed.  Cons - not for everyone.  The ulcers and coded will thank you with a venomous hiss. <br><br>  On another New Year, we gave, among other things, knitted mittens.  Plus the gift is that it is ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù, because many go skiing, and mittens to the ski jacket are perfect.  Cons - you can not guess with the size. <br><br>  This year they decided to give customers a gift that they would like to receive themselves, but on which money it seems to be a pity to spend.  Therefore, in 2012 we will present board games - mafia, alias, scrabble, poker.  Look at the reviews. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135120/</a></p>
