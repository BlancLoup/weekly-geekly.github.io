These are two days and several tracks of hardcore technical reports on C ++: concurrency, performance, architecture and infrastructure solutions - all so that your code looks better and does more.  The conference is aimed at experienced developers, no introductory reports! </p><br><p>  First, you can watch a completely free online broadcast.  It will be only the <strong>first day and the first hall</strong> + online interview between presentations.  What kind of reports - discuss under the cut. </p><br><p>  It is important that the broadcast will begin at 9:45 am (Moscow time), 15 minutes before the opening and will end closer to 7 pm.  All this time, you will be able to listen to reports with a few interruptions to online interviews with speakers.  The link will work all day, so you can open it only on the reports that are most important to you. </p><br><p>  Link to the site with video and program - under the cut.  In the same place, we will discuss a few things that will not be in the broadcast, but which are available to participants who came to the conference live. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/bu/n2/zzbun2l_tigwojklgptiqe0laus.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="gde-brat-translyaciyu">  Where to take the broadcast </h1><br><p>  The broadcast page is waiting for this green button link: </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/qt/3g/aaqt3glurqc8l4ug4itzcdyrhou.png"></div><p></p><br><p>  In the presence of a video player and the program of the first hall.

Nikolay is the author <em>of the</em> books ‚ÄúThe C ++ Standard Library‚Äù and ‚ÄúC ++ Templates‚Äù and a member of the standardization committee for almost twenty years.  His report will probably be one of the top on the topic of ‚Äúfuture and modern C ++‚Äù.  The report will tell about the problems of the language, the architecture behind them, who is to blame and what to do. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="100" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/pb/9x/ghpb9x50o3pmi5hwiopjzwp-euu.jpeg">  The second report is from Ruslan Harutyunyan from Intel.

Together with Alexander Schmidt from Artec 3D, we will understand how this approach (using RxCpp) helps us to abstract from working with complex asynchronous code, while simplifying its testing. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="100" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2m/ur/ub/2murubvrron9b7xffmtvkpbhorq.jpeg">  And completes the broadcast of the <a href="https://cppconf.ru/talks/11auqe0dbeawgemasoqws2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">‚ÄúMove-only C ++ design‚Äù</a> - a report by the famous speaker Ivan Chukich.  Ivan works in the PhD Computer Science department of the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Belgrade, specializing in programming language programming and contributing to KDE.  In this report we will deal with the architecture of uncopyable move-only types (‚Äúlinear types‚Äù) and with C ++ features that allow this.  For example, let's look at concepts from C ++ 20 or &amp;&amp; - qualified functions. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><p>  Total: the possibility of new standards C ++, optimization, and reactivity.  Everything you need to have a great Friday. </p><br><p>  If you want to get access to all reports in general (not only to the first hall) on Friday and Saturday, then you can <a href="https://cppconf.ru/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">purchase an Online ticket</a> .  In addition, so you will have all the videos of what happened. </p><br><h1 id="ne-vsyo-dostupno-v-translyacii">  Not everything is available in the broadcast. </h1><br><p>  At the time of publication of the article, you still have two days to agree on a ticket with the employer and get something from the following: </p><br><h2 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h2><br><p>  After each report, the speaker goes to a dedicated discussion area, where you can talk with him and ask your questions.  Formally, this can be done in a break between reports.  Although speakers are not required, they usually stay much longer - for example, for the duration of the next report.  Sometimes it makes sense to skip the report from the main program (if you bought a ticket, you will still have records after filling out the feedback) and spend it on focused communication with an important expert. </p><br><h2 id="dve-bof-sessii">  Two BOF sessions </h2><br><p>  BOF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> .  There is no division into a speaker and a participant: everyone participates on a par. </p><br><p>  At the moment, <a href="https://cppconf.ru/party/">two topics are</a> planned: "Different languages ‚Äã‚Äãversus C ++" and "Functional programming".  BOF on functional programming is conducted only in English). </p><br><h2 id="vystavochnaya-zona">  Exhibition area </h2><br><p>  In addition to the discussion areas during the break, you can visit the exhibition area.  There are several main activities: </p><br><ul><li>  The exhibition is a zone of stands of partner companies of the conference.  You can learn about interesting projects, technologies and teamwork leaders of the IT-industry.  This is the place where you and the company can find each other.  Please note that there will be representatives of companies that you will not meet face to face with every day (for example, Intel). </li><li>  Demo Stage is a dedicated stage for sponsors and partners, where companies make their reports, share practical experience and sum up the draws.  The program can be viewed on the website if you <a href="https://cppconf.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">go to the section with the program</a> and set the ‚ÄúDemo Stage‚Äù switch to the appropriate position. </li></ul><br><h2 id="vecherinka-s-pivom-i-muzykoy">  Party with beer and music </h2><br><p>  In parallel with the BOFs, a party starts at the end of the first day.  Drinks, snacks, music - all at once.  You can chat in an informal setting and discuss everything.  You can move from bof to party.  You can move from a party to a bof. </p><br><p>  In addition to this, there are two big contests: CPB and C ++ Quiz from JetBrains. </p><br><h2 id="jetbrains-c-quiz">  JetBrains C ++ Quiz </h2><br><p>  Do you know C ++ like the back of your hand?  Compiling code in your mind?  Do you read the latest draft standard C ++ for the night?  Check yourself - come to C ++ quiz from JetBrains, answer the questions and win cool prizes! </p><br><h2 id="chto-gde-kogda">  What?  Where?  When? </h2><br><p>  Sports tournament "What?  Where?  When?".  The rules are similar to the television version: the moderator asks a question, the team has a minute to discuss, at the end of which you need to give an answer.  The difference is that several teams play at once, so you need to discuss it neatly and quietly, and writing answers on a piece of paper will not work dramatically into the camera.  The two-time winner of the Crystal Owl, Mikhail Skipsky, leads the game, so the atmosphere is as close to reality as possible. </p><br><h2 id="kak-dobratsya">  How to get there </h2><br><p>  If you suddenly decide to come live, just in case, then we remind you that C ++ Russia will be held at the Congress Park of the Radisson Royal Moscow Hotel.  Congress Park itself is a huge underground complex, and the entrance to it is located in this small one-story building: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/zo/ue/zdzouevzj413qdt5shph4rq__cc.jpeg"></p><br><h3 id="pamyatka-uchastnika">  Member's memo </h3><br><p>  All details about the venue, the registration procedure and many other useful things are available in the participant's memo, which is always <a href="https://cppconf.ru/participant/">available on the site</a> . </p><br><h1 id="sleduyuschie-shagi">  Next steps </h1><br><ul><li>  If you are watching a free broadcast: you need to <a href="https://cppconf.ru/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">follow the link</a> on Friday, April 19th.  The broadcast will begin around 9:45 am Moscow time. </li><li>  If you want to get access to all reports and records after the conference: you need <a href="https://cppconf.ru/buy/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">to purchase an online ticket</a> . </li><li>  If you change your mind and go live: there are a couple of days to confirm this with your employer or to buy a personal ticket, all possible options are <a href="https://cppconf.ru/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D448322">here</a> . </li></ul></div>
