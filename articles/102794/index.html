From it you will learn about how much, how and when it is possible and conveniently with maximum comfort for a humanoid price in a place where work via the Internet is not overshadowed by smog from fires, abnormal temperature drops, the sounds of a running tractor and other legal cataclysms. <br><br>  Writing this post was not inspired by innate vanity or paperwork (who, by the way, also actively participated in the work and are co-authors), but a desire to help my neighbor to make a decision on optimizing work / home infrastructure with radical methods - by <b>sticking on Bali</b> .

      How to read this post?  I know two types of readers <s>that can read and not</s> : <br><br>  1. Those who love pobamburum leisurely, for about 30 minutes, savoring pictures and texts of super quality.  For these readers, to whom I, of course, belong to, I prepared the main text, which expresses thoughts about the organization of the flight and accommodation with minimal complications. <br><br>  2. And also those who read diagonally every third letter of the second word in a line, starting with the letter X, extracting only the essence.  For such people, to whom I, of course, belong to me, were written theses <b>bad advice</b> that we are too lazy to seek out in the main text.  To fully consolidate the material, I recommend to get acquainted with the first and the second part, to consolidate the material studied. <br><br>  And one more thing.  In spite of the dry introduction, the story will be conducted in an easy manner of easy-going humor with Yevgeny Vaganycham in the honorary box, with a large number of verbiage, digressions and mangled Russian words in the most perverted way.  If someone is not satisfied with this kind of presentation for any reason, I advise you to scroll through the text further, without going for a habrokat and be happy that the dear author has saved you from the painful reading on these lines.  In fact, this post combines a large study of traveling to a completely unfamiliar country without any agents of burning hell trips on the one hand, and valuable experience for which a lot of money was paid, which you, dear 1st or 2nd category reader, can easily save as a trip to Bali, and any other country in the world for remote work.  If you're ready, sit back in a chair more comfortably, we went. <br><br> <a title="wallpapers.free-review.net" href=""><img height="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/01/43/0143cffc7c609c5788f6e64223b9a370.jpg"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Until departure. </h2><br><br>  1.

Bad advice. <br>  14. Conclusion. <br><br><br><br><br><h3>  1. Briefly <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">about Bali</a> </h3><br><br><br><h3>  2. When to go. </h3><br><br>  From the above material, it became clear to everyone that the most peak tourist season is July, August + New Year holidays.  Bali first attracts surfers / surfers.  And if you go for fresh bodies from around the world, when, if not now?  The advantages of the high season are obvious - traffic jams from taxis and bikes, price increases by 20-40%, primarily housing, services.  Well, there are also minuses - this is an opportunity to get acquainted with a huge number of positively-minded mostly young people, without making any efforts to this. <br><br>  The low season is January - March due to the rainy season, which, however, according to eyewitnesses, passes unnoticed and mostly at night.  Because of its particular geographical location, Bali is always around 24-32 degrees, a light breeze from the ocean.  Humidity does not press, as in St. Petersburg at the same temperature, which is also a definite plus.  By the sun, a special conversation - the equator makes itself felt.  And if you remember the bad attitude towards you behind the sun, you should not expect any special favor here either.  Be sure to take a sunburn cream with a protection factor =&gt; 50 and a ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù gel, if you forget to smear something and there are signs of sunburn.  In general, responding to the main thesis of the chapter - you can go at any time, but in high season you must be prepared for more people with all the ensuing consequences with the search for housing / prices for transport and other services. <br><br><br><h3>  3. Where to go. </h3><br><br>  Bali is so good that they can find a place there as lovers in the evening can go and take part in nightlife, as well as those who rent a house / villa in groups and organize a totalitarian sect far from civilization or create a social network for%% related_syndrome.  For the latter, areas on the northern or central part of the island are suitable, where, among the shopping culture, people are looking at you with an open mouth <s>and a cocked gun</s> .  I have not been lucky enough to visit there, therefore, in the absence of objective information, these areas naturally fall out of this narrative.  We are also interested in housing in civilized areas, with normal Internet, masseuses and local rum. <br><br> <a title="Photoshop - iframe in Habr not insert, sorry. Google map click with comments" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms%3Fhl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF8%26oe%3DUTF8%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D112052500540881260244.00048e2bebeb5c219ad8a%26ll%3D-8.718146,115.19783%26spn%3D0.171375,0.307274%26z%3D12%2522"><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/8a7/cbdf9dcf4/where-bali.png"></a> <br><br>  The main habitats of foreigners in Bali are Kuta, Legian, Samenyak, Jimbaran, Denpasar.  Kuta is considered the central holiday mecca because of the simultaneous proximity of beaches, the airport, developed infrastructure and the popular resort name.  However, when choosing a hotel / house, you can safely navigate to all the surrounding areas, since there is no problem to get to Kuta by bike in 15-20 minutes.  Moreover, on Legian and Kuta, living for a long time seems rather difficult due to the very dense traffic of people and cars, constant noise.  The best option, in my opinion, is North of Samenyak and surroundings, Tuban, south of Kuta or Jimbaran.  There are a lot of private villas on Samenyak, this is a relatively expensive area, with all the consequences that follow and wipe you for money.  Tuban is a pretty good place, there are a lot of private houses for rent. <br><br><br><h3>  4. Buying plane tickets. </h3><br><br>  It's simple.  <a href="http://www.momondo.com/">Momondo.com</a> offers one-way ticket options during the high season for around 18-20 thousand rubles.  As a rule, these are 2 transfers and 25 hours of flight, taking into account connections and waiting times.  Pretty cruel, but quite tolerable.  Plus, if you take the Emirates or something at the level, long flights will be brightened up with free meals and drinks, which will shorten the way to a few bottles of wine.  The ticket, of course, is better to take in advance.  The second option is a direct charter to Denpasar ( <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26source%3Ds_q%26hl%3Den%26geocode%3D%26q%3Dbali%2Bngurai%2Brai%26sll%3D-8.748056,115.1675%26sspn%3D0.022523,0.038409%26ie%3DUTF8%26hq%3D%26hnear%3DNgurah%2BRai,%2BTuban,%2BKuta,%2BBadung,%2BBali,%2BIndonesia%26z%3D15">Ngurah Rai airport</a> ).  Only 10 hours scoop on board and you are in place.  Worth to suffer) At prices - you can take last-minute tickets, 1.5 weeks before departure, 15-18 thousand rubles.  Plus - this is a direct flight, without docking, inspection and tp favorite tourist nishtyakov.  Search for Transaero tickets <a href="http://www.tourdom.ru/birga/go2/">here</a> . <br><br><br>
<h3>  5. Buying / booking hotels. </h3><br><br>  Before renting an apartment / house should look options, orienting on the ground.  Therefore, booking a hotel is not expensive for a few days.  Usually 3-6 days of active searches are more than enough to find yourself a good option. <br>  The hotel can be booked through <a href="http://www.hotelscombined.ru/">Hotelscombined.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.baliblog.com/hotels">Baliblog.com/hotels</a> or through your <a href="http://adrenaline.ucsd.edu/HybridEnvironments/indonesia_trip/links/baliforyou/cheap_kuta_accommodation2.htm">local agency.</a>  The cost of hotels with online booking is $ 15-20 per day.  This money includes a full breakfast, daily cleaning, normal infrastructure. <br><br> <a title="baliwww.com/imagesgallery/kuta/bakungsari/overview.jpg" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/d3b/dd7ad451e/bakung_sari_hotel.png"></a> <br><br><br><h3>  6. Visa.  Insurance.  Last preparations. </h3><br><br>  So, the departure dates are known, there is a reservation, there is only a trifle left: this is the purchase of condoms, iodine visa.  Visa interests us for a long time, at least 3 months.  Therefore, we consider the following profitable option. <br><br>  Receipt upon entry.  Visa is given on arrival for up to 30 days.  Cost 25 $.  Plus, when leaving you will take an additional fee of ~ $ 15. <br>  For a visa is required to have a ticket to another country before its expiration.  However, a simple printout from Photoshop in Russian is enough to be believed.  This visa can be extended for another 30 days 1 time and for this you will have to drive 3 times to the migration service (near the airport).  For a longer period, all that remains is a vizaran to another country, where you will kindly issue a social visa for 6 months (2 initially + a possible extension for 4).  The most convenient place for such a design is Kuala Lumpur due to the fact that this word is difficult to remember, as well as the fact that it is one of the largest hubs of air traffic in the region and the homeland of AirAsia with tickets for $ 50.  The process of obtaining a social visa is described <a href="http://alexkorolev.com/viza-v-indoneziyu/">in</a> detail <a href="http://alexkorolev.com/viza-v-indoneziyu/">in this blog</a> .  For the price goes (for 1 person in US dollars): <br><br>  25 - <i>Visa for 30 days.</i> <br>  15 - <i>collection at departure.</i> <br>  110 - <i>The average price of tickets to Kowla Lumpur and back.</i> <br>  35 - <i>Invitation from a local.</i>  <i>Issued through the agency.</i> <br>  50 - <i>Social visa.</i>  <i>Through the Embassy of Indonesia in Kuala Lumpur.</i> <br>  260 - <i>Extension of the social visa for 4 months (65 per month), through the same agency.</i> <br>  50 - <i>Accommodation in Kaula Lumpur.</i> <br><hr><br>  <b>$ 545</b> Here is the issue price for a six-month stay + 30 days on the tour.  visa.  Part of this money - travel and accommodation can be attributed to micro-tourism, because you will not only do a visa there) <br><br>  What are the other visa options?  Work visa: requires a lot of documents.  Tourist visa for 2 months.  It is issued in Moscow if you have a hotel reservation for the entire stay (information not verified) or by extending a 30-day visa at the local migration service for another 30 days maximum.  Finally, a visaran with a permanent entry of a tourist visa for 30 days.  I read somewhere about bribes and extending my stay through them, but I don‚Äôt decide anything here, I wouldn‚Äôt have taken it myself if I didn‚Äôt lose all the money in blackjack before fasting ... <br><br>  <b>Insurance.</b>  Everything is simple here: we are going to Rosno or Rosgosstrakh and for 1 hour and 3-4 thousand rubles you can not worry about your life: if something happens, you will be buried as a local king, among mud and poverty.  But seriously, insurance is a must.  If you need urgent medical care, you are first asked for insurance / money, only then they start to fight for your life.  That is, in Indonesia there is a struggle for the patient‚Äôs wallet, and only then for his life.  Cost of honey.  services in Bali astronomical - call a doctor from $ 100 just for shipping it to your body.  In general, the average demage can cost you more than one hundred thousand rubles.  Insurance can be made both global and local, it will not be much more expensive.  To me, the world emergency aid with a coverage of 50,000 euros for 9 months rose to 5.5 thousand rubles.  Includes all costs of transporting and treating any injuries involving the provision of emergency medical care. <br><br>  Next you need to take care of the <b>first-aid kit</b> .  As mentioned above, it is better to take care of creams against sunburn and burns.  Next you need personal care products - Gel for washing hands for yourself, Miramistin for local women, a couple of condoms for flight, iodine, bandages, other trifles.  For waiting at the docking between flights, the Bodrost cocktail is well suited - an aluminum spoon, a lighter, a Maccon 3-in-1 and Reb Bull package.  Drugs.  Of course, they should be taken with you as much as possible, because in Indonesia there is an exclusive tour for all drag couriers with the death penalty as an extreme performance in one act at the end.  In general, on all the tickets, visas and airport pillars they write about the death penalty, how wonderful it is and how easy it can be achieved with a package of banal grass in your pocket. <br><br>  With the first-aid kit finished, what else to take on the road?  Magazines, books, movies and everything that will brighten up a long flight.  Pornography is also strictly prohibited in Indonesia, so that customs and magazines will be taken away for their needs by customs officers, and there is no hard-writing hard drive, keep in mind. <br><br><br><h3>  7. Transportation.  Taxi, bike, car. </h3><br><br> <a title="hendrawannews.blogspot.com/2010/02/blue-bird-promised-remove-attribute-on.html" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/a0f/b4974d502/Blue-Bird-Taxi.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Plane on the airport we are not allowed to steer, will have to look for a taxi.  We leave to the parking lot, we look at the cab with the order of a taxi, we ignore private traders on the way boldly.  Taxi to Kuta will cost $ 5-8.  In general, it is always better to take official cars with checkered, since they are everywhere.  I recommend the blue taxi (khm ..) - at the local called BlueBird, but it is the most common.  Riding to the capital - Denpasara back and forth got into as much as $ 8 with the agreement to wait for me there ~ 30 minutes and a couple of stops along the way to replenish the balance of the body.  The total travel time with a waiting area of ‚Äã‚Äã1.5 hours.  Dream to cam tru. <br><br>  We reach your hotel.  Halt.  Now it's time to get puzzled with your wheels.  We forget about renting a car - it is not suitable for everyday tasks.  Only for long-haul company for a few days.  At every corner they offer a bike, train, helikopter.  They can only offer the first in real life.  It is a bike from 1500 rubles.  per month, in local money it is about 550,000 Indonesian Rupees (IR).  We look at the condition, scuffs of the bike and the face of the driver-seller.  The bike should be in very good condition - clean, without significant chips and other demedzh, no 50-powerless holy fools - only 110 cubes and above.  If you ask for more than 600,000 IR, you can safely send until the price is 500-550 thousand <br><br>  To drive a bike requires internationally recognized rights, the Russians do not have this by default.  For renting is not a problem, tell me what you forgot when you transported on the moon / lost during the surf.  But the police may be interested.  About the bike and the police should tell a little more.  In general, the police are pretty friendly, but they also love money, so bdim 2m to the main rules of Bali. <br><ol><li>  You can‚Äôt <s>feed a cop after midnight</s> without a helmet.  When renting a helmet, they give it free of charge, while it is necessary that the first helmet be given back to the tenant, demanding better.  In any case, a cool helmet with horns / in the form of a German helmet / etc can be bought for 250 rubles on the trade streets. </li><li>  You can not cross the dividing line at traffic lights.  Even if the wheel comes 10 cm forward or on it, you will be fined. </li></ol><br>  If they slowed down - it doesn't matter, we explain in purely Russian that chocolate is not to blame for anything, the kid went to success.  You will be shown the price of your jambs and offered to give money on the spot.  I tried to bargain, it didn't work out - they talked about their integrity and cleanliness of the rows, khe-khe.  The size of the fine - from 300 to 900 rubles.  by default.  The lack of rights is still ~ 600 rubles.  If your trade skill shows more than 100 peep-bucks, you can negotiate over 50 for everything, such examples of ‚Äúcharity‚Äù on the part of the authorities are met regularly.  As for the lack of international driving licenses - here either include your favorite photoshop and make a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of rights with a couple of seals from KVD No. 2 for importance or buy a completely official certificate that your documents were stolen.  It is worth a certificate - about 1000 rubles., A month. <br><br>  By traffic.  Traffic, of course, is dense on Kuta, Legian and especially at the entrance to Denpansar, there are traffic jams, and traffic jams from bikes are labor jams) When in one direction there are cargo bikes: with propane cylinders, with fans of poi, surf, and simple hard workers Carrying the junk in the center in some self-made boxes, arriving at the saliva of local monkeys to the bike, do not always feel confident.  But this is before the first glass of rum - there are no restrictions on the permilles in your personal engine, so you can refuel anything and as much as you like.  When driving on a bike, the main rule is that there are no rules, those who signaled more strongly are right, so before each overtaking / maneuver, it is recommended to signal, and even better to shoot at <s>disturbing</s> air.  In general, the skills you learned from Road Rush 1-3 should be very useful here. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zFOWSCA9bg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhijphcSm_SRK6zCbcIr-YHdg-1Ptg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><h3>  8. Housing </h3><br><br>  So, we have a hotel for some time, now it is only left on the spot, driving a taxi or bike asking local residents about renting an apartment / house and choosing a convenient option.  There will be no problems with communication, the locals are happy to help in any situation, and even <s>traffickers are</s> souvenirs and even more so.  In addition, if you took a taxi driver, he can play the role of a guide, but this is as lucky. <br><br>  If we talk about a long-term lease for a period of more than 2 months, as described above, it makes no special sense to take shelter in Kuta / Legian.  We look around the neighborhood so that it is cheaper and not far from the center, if you want entertainment.  If you look for laziness on your own, <a href="http://www.balirent.com/">there</a> are several relatively inexpensive options, but the mediator is a mediator and I advise you to resort to the services of this fraternity last.  Through <a href="http://www.adpost.com/id/%3Fsta%3Dbali%26db%3Did_homes_offices%26website%3D%26language%3D%26session_key%3D">Adpost,</a> you can search for accommodation yourself, in principle, good options come across. <br><br> <a title="1.bp.blogspot.com/_bv5qNZvN8bI/SRGurFApfOI/AAAAAAAABXs/vlzBEaT_UFI/s1600-h/Bali+real+estate+paradise+property.JPG" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/774/583fd4594/Bali-view.png"></a> <br><br>  The truest way is to drive around on a bike and ask where it is cheap to rent a house.  Russian and Angloielators will soar you, that there is no cheap housing, that it is expensive and so, but do not believe them, brothers and sisters.  There are options for normal homes for $ 300 per month, in which you can live for 4-6 people.  You can even find a hotel / guesthouse with a monthly fee of 200-400 dollars. <br><br><br><h3>  9. Internet.  Wi-Fi, CMDA, 3G.  Voice communication (Spare Internet in the phone.) </h3><br><br>  The situation with the Internet in Bali is ambiguous.  On the one hand, a large number of eateries and Internet cafes with free or almost free Internet, on the other hand, the lack of normally developed access in the private sector.  This is due primarily to the fact that everything in Bali is sharpened for tourism and that is why hotels, cafes, temples and other public places are equipped with hot spots.  As for ordinary people, they don‚Äôt need your internet for cutting out wood, surfing and fighting for freedom.  If you are lucky and there is a telephone line in the house, you can stir up ADSL.  As soon as I meet such a view in real life, I will write off what it is and at what speed it runs through the terrain.  So either we are looking for an expensive and rare house with a ready Internet or we take a whistle-modem from a local operator with anlimit. <br><br>  What is unlimited wireless internet. <br><br>  <b>1. Smart Telecom.</b>  Provides Internet access through CDMA technology (EV-DO), guarantees real unlimited, without any restrictions on traffic.  The speed is up to 3 Mbps in on paper, my work is stable only at 200-300 kbps with Russians ip, at night and on weekends the speed increases noticeably.

Indosat.</b>  <b>Tariff XL.</b> <br>  It is found as a spare Internet and is used by default for voice communications / Internet in the phone.  The speed is quite decent - 0.5 - 0.9 Mbps for downloading via 3G channel.  I cannot orient at exact prices for megabyte operations, but on the whole it is rather expensive - for testing communication via Speedtest + opening 2 branches for Damaochka.ru I ate 60 rubles.  Totally almost 15-25 rub megabytes ... There are <a href="http://www.indosat.com/Indosat_3.5G_Broadband">rates</a> on Indosat for those who need specific packages and prices, but there is no smell of anlim.  You can buy almost any shopping street. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/a2a/9287cfb1a/XL1.png"></a> <br><br>  <i>Settings:</i> <br>  Setting GPRS Manual: Profile Name INDOSATGPRS <br>  User name: indosat <br>  APN: indosatgprs <br>  Password: indosat <br>  Gateway IP: 10.19.19.19 <br>  Homepage <a href="http://wap.klub-mentari.com/">wap.klub-mentari.com</a> <br>  Data Bearer: GPRS <br>  Dial Number (depends on your modem) - * 99 # <br><br>  <b>3. Simpati.</b> <br><br>  I can not say anything.  Calls come out at about $ 0.1 / minute of conversation, GPRS has set up, but its speed just killed.  speedtest.net never opened to the end in 4 minutes, and this is despite the fact that the 3G connection on the modem was on.

I didn‚Äôt do much research on this issue, but 900-1000 rubles a month should be enough for everyone to talk with the wind for a long time.  The cheapest are considered Simpati and XL from Indosat.  SMS cost some kopecks, XL even includes bonus packages. <br><br><br><h3>  10. Rest.  <s>Internet,</s> Surf, Drugs, Clubs, Women, other attractions. </h3><br><br>  Well, finally got to what this post was written for.  Of course, I did not participate in anything of the kind, but one friend of my friend heard from the Holy Father in the Vatican, to whom the sinner confessed, the following information. <br><br>  <b>Surfing.</b>  This business here is full.  If you want a Russian company, then go to the surf school <a href="http://www.surfbali.ru/">Endless Summer</a> or <a href="http://www.easysurf.ru/">Easy Serf</a> .  All are similar, an approximate price tag of ~ 6000 rubles for 6 lessons.  The price includes rental of the form, surf, insurance, training.  If you do not want to give money to compatriots, we are looking for any Indonesian on the beach in Kuta, who, as we know, are born right on the surfboard, and take a lesson for 400-700 rubles, the board is included.  Many people know more or less Russian, there will be no problems with communication / understanding.  In general, learn to stand and catch the waves under the force of everyone who has at least 2-3 hands and 1 desire to learn.  In the future, it makes sense to buy a surf bu for riding / breaking and resale before leaving.  At least many long-playing tourists do that. <br><br> <a title="img3.visualizeus.com/thumbs/09/05/04/blue,fun,girl,summer,surfing,bali-2c9bd774c061ae22eede012881057ad9_h.jpg" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/308/0c6e21969/bluefungirlsummersurfingbali-2c9bd774c061ae22eede012881057ad9_h.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Drugs.</b>  Well, let's start with the fact that for the interesting vegetation here is the death penalty.  Therefore, sales are mainly in the tourist streets of the local youth with strange seams around the neck.  According to an eyewitness, there is a certain form of local mafia, specializing in the bases in this matter with the aim of blackmailing a new victim.  In general, the whole conversation comes down to the fact that drugs are bad, but here it can be bad in the square. <br><br>  <b>Clubs.</b>  On the two main tourist streets / districts - Legian and Kuta, the main get-together is made up of visiting and local youth.  There are simple restaurants and clubs, and karaoke bars, in general, do not get bored.  For white people there are appropriate.  You and Mr. Franklin are always welcome everywhere.  Alko prices in clubs are relatively considerable.  Normal vodka ~ $ 5, Tequila ~ $ 6, Beer ~ $ 3 and so on.  Save special promotions and happy moments with specials.  at the price of certain cocktails.  Well, the fact that you can come to the club in any condition, even if you can go only on the eyebrows. <br><br>  <b>Women.</b>  Local representatives of the fauna are different, as well as all Indonesians, friendliness, smile and poor English.  Together with a loyal attitude towards alcohol, this gives an unimaginably wide scope for maneuvers.  At the same time, the likelihood of running into paid love is a little more than complete ... The question of value varies greatly - from simple charity to $ 50 per hour. <br><br>  <b>Other charms.</b>  They are not so many, but nonetheless.  A pair of volcanoes, lakes, ancient temples and cities, forests with monkeys, villages of the dead, wild islands, religious ceremonies - all this you will never visit as soon as you learn to stand on a surfboard. <br><br><br><h3>  11. Population. </h3><br><br> <a title="boston.com/bigpicture/2008/07/a_royal_farewell_in_bali.html" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/83d/8080fcf27/ubud3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Despite Muslim Indonesia, the people of Bali preach the local form of Hinduism, which guarantees their tolerance to our favorite forms of recreation.  All of them are listed in the Old Testament, only ~ ten.  Local people are amazed by their good nature, bordering on the sincere desire to cash in on you.  However, you can always expect to help you find the right road or orient you in finding the right services.  Bargaining here is accepted wherever there is no cash, although even there with several purchases you can ask for a discount.  I myself am not a fan of knocking out extra rupees from the seller, but in Asia it is a form of social game, and if you treat this accordingly, you can enjoy the process.  How to bargain in general, many <a href="http://traveliving.org/bargaining-with-asians">posts are</a> written, you can gossip the question normally.  He very conveniently asks anyone on a bike to bring anywhere, giving at the end of the route $ 0.5 for tea.  By the way.  Many restaurants / hotels additionally take taxes / service fee - pay attention to the amount in the check corresponds to the weighted average expectations. <br><br>  There are quite a lot of tourists, many Australians, many Russians, they will not be bored.  Among the tourists, there is a rather large percentage of those who have lived in Bali for years, thereby ensuring that one day you will not remain in your company the only whites on the island. <br><br><h3>  12. The total estimated cost of the trip. </h3><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The calculation is very approximate, designed mainly for those who want to pay a little, and receive a lot. We take a trip for 6 months, we count on one person in US dollars. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1000 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Round-trip ticket</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 100 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hotel reservation for 5 days in Bali</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 150 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Medical insurance</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 50 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First</font></font></i> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">aid kit on the road</font></i></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 480 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Visa for 5 months + 30 days for tourist</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 300 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bike rental for 6 months</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 200 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For gasoline.

Very approximate parameter. You can rent a house / apartment for 3 $ 400-700 dollars per month, you can villa for $ 100 per day. You can live in a simple hotel for $ 400 / month, you can buy a box from under the refrigerator.</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 200 - the </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet. $ 100 buying a modem with 3-month unlimited + payment of another 3 months. In principle, the company can immediately take a Smart router - it costs $ 160, the Internet is the same, but you can immediately distribute via Wi-Fi to sufferers.</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 150 - </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Voice communication. Here we are talking only about local calls, for international there is meditation and VOIP.</font></font></i> <br><br><hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Total: </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4730 dollars</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> without spending on rest / food per person for six months. How much is the last? The scatter is very high. In the north, you can dine for $ 1 in local markets to stock up for a penny. At the same time, you can merge in European restaurants and supermarkets / malls for $ 20 for lunch and a shopping basket at the level of Moscow region. For myself, I pledged about 3,500 in 6 months in order not to deny myself anything. Completed or not, I will write in 5.5 months.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a result, we get about 40,000 rubles a month on the nose. This includes a fairly broad, up to 50%, opportunity for savings with only one desire. Prices in Bali can vary at times even in one area. If you are targeting European stores / catering / service, you should be ready for one price tag. That's about $ 15 a day, including lunches and dinners in cafes / restaurants, level above average. But if there is a desire to experience Asia in all its cheapness, you can even live on $ 500 a month, but this is also not every stomach / thirst for consumerism can do.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For comparison - housing in the MSC costs from 20,000 rubles per month, plus transportation - a couple of hours of your favorite metroelectricity, plus meals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, it was never possible to leave less than 50,000, no matter how much I wanted it in St. Petersburg, a bit cheaper, but now the obvious price difference is not visible, only in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpublic catering and real estate.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 13. Bad advice. </font></font></h3><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> As promised above, instead of tedious text, the pair of practical advice on the merits. </font></font><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You can go to work in Bali at any time of the year, the most tourist season is July, August and the new year. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Tickets to take either in advance or on last minute deals are too cheap, we must take an aeroflot for the day. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Insurance for wimps, why pay 4000 rubles, if a banal accident can pay 100,000 for treatment? </font></font></li><li>        ,        ,         . : , ,    ..! </li><li>    ,   ,        ,  . <br></li><li>    ,     ,      100  ,   . <br></li><li>       .    .              . </li><li>          .          ! <br></li></ol><br><br><h3> 14. . </h3><br><br> <a title="bali-travel-life.com/image-files/villa-istana-bali-view.jpg" href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/97d/9539569de/villa-istana-bali-view.jpg"></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the end, everyone chooses a place and time for himself. Someone likes to work in his native Moscow, amid soft dense smog. Someone more like the native St. Petersburg rains and clouds, obscuring the sun for months. The purpose of this post was to show how easy and affordable it is to organize a great workplace for yourself in a large, spacious house where you can sleep and work on the veranda, eat and read habr there. With all this, your costs will almost certainly be obviously lower than if you would spend the same time in major cities of Russia. Although someone does not like the lack of: snow, passive aggression of the population, watchman syndrome, shtetl service, daily pushing in a stuffy transport, semek and give smartAfon to call even boys. However, this is largely compensated by palm trees, skirts, soft breezes,glimpses of one-story houses, surrounded by greenery, on the bike, friendly people from around the world. And the main thing here is a simple understanding that many people have this opportunity to choose a place for their work and it is much closer than it seems.</font></font><br><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 15.
