  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slot machines: where did they come from in the USSR and how are they arranged</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 30, RUVDS together with the Museum of Soviet Gaming Machines will hold the first Game Overnight old-school video game tournament in Russia.  Now there is a qualifying tournament, for 3 days already more than 300 habrizhiteley participated in the tournament.  Few were able to take the test.  You can try your hand at <a href="https://gameovernight.ru/">the game site</a> .  In the meantime, we decided to recall how the first machines appeared in the USSR, tell us a little about their device and help players practice before the tournament. <br><br>  Slot machines appeared in the USSR much later than in the rest of the world.  When in America and Japan they were already playing pinballs and arcade shooters, the Soviet people were just beginning to get acquainted with carousels, roller coasters and slot machines. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/430526/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/la/2c/e9la2cva0rt_f8twenptmlgb3we.jpeg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the summer of 1971, a large international exhibition ‚ÄúAttraction-71‚Äù was held in Gorky Park and in Izmailovsky Park in Moscow, to which foreign manufacturers brought 180 most different slot machines.  Most of the Soviet residents haven‚Äôt seen anything like this before, and even more so - they haven‚Äôt played anything, so it‚Äôs not surprising that 2.5 million people visited the exhibition in 10 days!

      Exhibition "Attraction-71": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/226/c20/c0e/226c20c0eeaf395c282e88080d94a123.jpg"><br><br>  For everyone, including the All-Union Union "Soyuzattraktsion", the departments that organized the exhibition, the enormous interest in slot machines and their future potential became apparent.  But instead of concluding contracts with manufacturing companies or buying out a license to manufacture the same arcades in the USSR, Soyuzattraktsion acted differently: out of almost two hundred foreign ‚Äúexhibition‚Äù machines, 30 of the most popular were selected and sent to Soviet factories, where Western prototypes were dismantled, carefully studied, and Soviet arcades were produced on their basis. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Production: military factories and consumer goods</font> </h2><br>  The factories at which Soviet specialists were sorting out and studying Western automatons were military.  In the main time, most of these plants produced components and sophisticated electronics for the defense industry.  It was no coincidence that automata appeared at military enterprises: no one began to build separate factories for "frivolous" devices, and military factories had sufficient resources and personnel for the production of automata.  In addition, every enterprise in the USSR, regardless of what was produced on it, had a financial plan for the release of ‚Äúconsumer goods‚Äù goods, one of the types of which were gaming machines. <br><br>  However, the Soviet planned model of the economy made adjustments to the issues of production: indeed, Soviet engineers dismantled Western automata and, on their basis, made Soviet ones, but only from the components available at a particular plant.  The ‚Äúplanned‚Äù set of parts that each Soviet factory received was not always suitable for creating one or another machine gun, so I had to work with what was before.  Because of this, engineers had to assemble complex designs that could be easily simplified (and cheaper!) If they had the right parts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Slot machines: classification</font> </h2><br>  From the beginning of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1990s, about a hundred varieties of gaming machines were produced in the USSR.  95% of them were copies of Western automata, the rest were original Soviet developments, some machines were produced for decades, gradually modernizing and improving, others were removed from production due to unpopularity, lack of payback or production difficulties. <br><br>  All slot machines can be classified using different division principles.  The easiest way - the distribution of topics.  So, the Soviet arcades can be divided into military, sports, shooting and racing simulators, pinballs, automatic rockers.  A more accurate and complex classification is technical, according to which all Soviet gaming machines are divided into electromechanical and electronic.  The latter are based on discrete logic, and to display the playing field in them, as a rule, a television screen is used. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Electromechanics: "Battleship"</font> </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/d82/b22/197d82b22242ba4675a0bd9ea8244f9a.jpg"></div><br>  The legendary Soviet slot machine - ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù - is an electromechanical arcade.  The purpose and principle of the game are well known to many who were born even in the late Soviet Union: take aim at the periscope (by the way, made in the image of the real ones) at the ships on the horizon and ‚Äútorpedo‚Äù - shoot at them, releasing torpedoes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70c/63e/a8b/70c63ea8b63b1b94fed4d1ce4dbfb23b.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Viewfinder</font></i> <br><br>  The player has 10 torpedoes at his disposal, and in the event that all 10 shots reach the goal, the player will receive a reward - 3 additional torpedoes. <br><br>  The Soviet "Sea Battle" was copied from the American Sea Rider and Sea Devil machines, produced by Chicago-based Midway since 1969.  American manufacturers realized that the linear arrangement of the game elements greatly influenced the dimensions of the arcade, making it impermissibly cumbersome, therefore the principle of mirror reflection lies at the heart of the arrangement of the internal components. <br><br>  The panorama of "combat" actions, that is, the playing field itself, is located vertically, but being reflected in a mirror set at an angle of 45 ¬∞, looks horizontal.  The imitation of the sea is made of glass, on which a picture of the sea is applied, and under the glass are the torpedo movement trajectories - 8 ‚Äútracks‚Äù, each with 10 light bulbs. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e6/78f/86f/9e678f86f7baf8358ff315d5c34871ad.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Top view of the mechanism for selecting the trajectory of the torpedo.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">On the left you can see 8 contacts responsible for the tracks.</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/457/e0c/0e9457e0c98b9623567d5b7cad1fffd1.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The mechanism that drives the ships.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Located at the bottom of the machine.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">On the left you can see the chain on which the figures are fixed.</font></i> <br><br>  Launching a torpedo, the player actually closes one of the 8 pins of the torpedo's flight path selection mechanism, the light bulbs in the selected ‚Äútrack‚Äù light up one after the other, creating the illusion of a dynamically flying torpedo.  When the last light bulb coincides with the sensor on the ship, the biggest explosion light turns on, the circuit closes, the player gets a point.  Such a principle of fixing the torpedo route makes the device technically more reliable, and, at the same time, the launch of a torpedo becomes for the player less predictable. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/349/ad5/741/349ad5741fe1b641b1ad2c596d41448f.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Drive with engine and scoreboard explosions assembly.</font></i> <br><br>  The ships being fired are flat iron figures attached to a conventional chain (this one is also used in bicycles), which moves along a circular axis.  After a torpedo hit, the light in the machine turns off, signaling the player about success, the ships stop and then start moving in the other direction. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://morskoy-boy.15kop.ru/game/">Play Sea Battleship</a> <br><br>  "Sea battle" was produced at the Serpukhov radio engineering plant "Ratep" since 1974.  In Soviet times, the main products of the enterprise were radar control systems for anti-aircraft missile and artillery systems, firing control modules for shipborne interference systems.  Interestingly, the other machines, produced here, - "Pilot" and "Puck!  Washer! ‚ÄùArranged according to a similar principle - using mirror reflection. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d93/df2/8c3/d93df28c320c08eb9469f9a71fa3b5bc.png"></div><br>  In total, the plant produced several variants of ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù: for the domestic market and export to the socialist countries and to Finland.  One of the versions of the machine was designed specifically for training the crews of submarines of the Navy of the USSR.  These machines did not have a coin acceptor, and the inscription "Sea Battle" was replaced by the abbreviation "ET-10M."  The mysterious abbreviation is simply deciphered: ET - electronic simulator, 10 - the number of shots, M - modernized.  This version of the ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù was installed only on nuclear submarines - there was enough space for them - to entertain sailors on long hikes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Electronic arcade</font> </h2><br>  <b>"Towns"</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/340/a66/8a4/340a668a4dec72f71e05c6111a5c3385.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The front panel of the machine is open: a coin-receiving mechanism with a drive is clearly visible.</font></i> <br><br>  Electronic gaming machines for the most part are original designs in which borrowed Western ideas are implemented on a Soviet technical base.  But there are also completely original Soviet designs, the most famous of which is the Gorodki slot machine. <br><br>  The gameplay of ‚ÄúGorodok‚Äù was created on the basis of the old Russian game of the same name, which in the course of the 20th century quickly turned from folk fun into a mass sport with its own rules, tournaments and associations.  In the 1960s, the towns were the second most popular sport after football, so it is not surprising that, following the actual sports activity, its ‚Äúarcade‚Äù version was created. <br><br>  The arcades were developed by employees of the Central Research Laboratory of Attraction Techniques (CNILAT), a division of Soyuzattraction, engaged in scientific research and sociological research.  The player is given the same task as in a real sport: knock out the city pieces with the least amount of bits. <br><br>  The set and order of the appearance of figures on the screen also coincides with the rules of the classic sport: from the simplest ‚Äúcannon‚Äù to the most complex - the ‚Äúletter‚Äù. <br><br>  On the kinescope of the automaton, the view of the game is presented from above, therefore everything that is displayed on the screen - bits and figures - is translated into a two-dimensional pixel format.  To make the game more interesting and more difficult, the figures move, and the bit flies out automatically after 5 seconds. <br><br>  The Gorodki submachine gun was manufactured at the Terminal plant located in the Ukrainian city of Vinnitsa.  In Soviet times, the company was a "monopolist" in the production of displays and screens, including for the defense industry.  The plant also produced consumer goods, including slot machines.  It was profitable for industrialists to use displays in their products, therefore, among the gaming machines for production, we chose those in which kinescopes were used to display the image.  So, together with the "Towns", "Terminal" produced "Motor Racing", "Fighters" and all the machines on the basis of the platform TIA-MTs-1. <br><br>  <b>TIA-MTs-1</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ee/5ae/ea6/1ee5aeea6aa09e35b6b62247c62b73d8.jpg"></div><br>  Multi-color color television slot machine, better known as TIA-MTs-1, is a type of Soviet electronic slot machines with interchangeable game programs.  In the Soviet Union, all TIA--1 automata were produced in identical cases, which differed only in color, the content of the game instruction and the designations of the controls. <br><br>  On the basis of the TIA--1 platform, 12 original games were created: ‚ÄúThe Little Humpbacked Horse‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Snow Queen‚Äù, ‚ÄúSOS‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Catfisher‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Star Knight‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Fighter‚Äù, ‚ÄúKotigoroshko‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Island dragon "," Treasure Island "," Auto Racing "," Billiards "," Towns ".  All games for TIA-MTs-1 were developed by Extrema-Ukraine in the mid-1980s, and the machines themselves were produced at the Terminal production association. <br><br>  Structurally, the machine consists of a monitor with a 16-color screen and a resolution of 256x256 pixels, a control console and a base, in which the blocks of the elements of a gaming machine (BIA), made in the form of separate boards, are located. <br><br>  The block BIA-100 is designed to process logical information in accordance with the game program, converting a digital code into analog color signals R, G, B;  generating sound signals, controlling the coin acceptor and communication with the control panel.  BIA-101 is designed to form synchronization series and background image elements.  BEIA-102 forms moving objects of the image, and BEIA-103 is needed to store the game program, background pictures, moving objects and other operational information.  Actually, in order to change the gaming game program in the machine, it was necessary to replace the BIA-103 block. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Racing machines of the tournament: "Highway" and "AutoRally"</font> </h2><br>  At the <a href="https://gameovernight.ru/">Game Overnight</a> tournament, participants will have to fight each other not only in cult video games, but also in no less legendary Soviet racing arcades - ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutoRally‚Äù.  To be at the tournament fully armed, we offer to prepare in advance and learn all the subtleties of the gameplay of Soviet arcade races. <br><br>  <b>"Highway"</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b8/478/885/6b847888501465d7fe4657530031c164.jpg"></div><br>  "Highway" - an electronic racing arcade, which in the battle for popularity can easily compete with the "Battle of the Sea" or "Sniper".  The machine simulates car races on different track variants, the course of the game is displayed on the TV screen, and you can play the ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù alone or together, driving your car using the steering wheel and the gas pedal. <br><br>  Players can choose one of the route options: <br><br>  The <b>‚Äútraining track‚Äù</b> mode is the easiest option of racing, in which oncoming cars are static <br><br>  <b>"Racing" mode</b> - the track with an opposite lane, where virtual rivals drive different cars - both standard and supercars are twice as wide as the "norm". <br><br>  <b>The ‚Äúspecial‚Äù track</b> is racing with static vehicles with special vehicles.  The player must maneuver, passing other cars forward or overtaking them.  The game is complicated by occasionally passing special vehicles, whose speed is significantly higher than the total flow. <br><br>  <b>"Night" mode</b> simulates artificial lighting from car headlights.  In complete darkness of the "night" mode, you need to remember that at the same time on the lane there can be two cars moving in the opposite lane. <br><br>  <b>Ice mode</b> is a race with passing dynamic cars in which virtual rivals slide in the same direction as the player.  At the same time on the screen can be displayed three race cars of "rivals". <br><br>  ‚Üí Choose a track, practice and play ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù <a href="http://magistral.15kop.ru/game/">here</a> <br><br>  And in the ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù slot machine, the route is selected by using touch (!) Devices on the machine panel! <br><br>  <b>"Rally"</b> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/697/533/a07/697533a073726800dfae270c99d12b3a.jpg"></div><br>  Avtoralli-M is another Soviet racing arcade for one or two players.  The control principle is typical for many racing cars - at the disposal of the player the steering wheel and the gas pedal, the process of the game, as well as in the "Highway", is displayed on the TV screen located horizontally, but the game situation is different. <br><br>  The goal of a player in Avtoralli is not to overtake an opponent, but to collect as many points as possible, which are ‚Äúscattered‚Äù across the board in the form of green flags.  To win in AutoRally, players need to run into them, collecting points.  But blue oil stains, red flags and white barriers should be avoided: when a player hits them, the player loses control and speed.  A few seconds before the end of the game, the glasses begin to flash: at this moment it is better to concentrate and hurry, because the number of points on the touched flag doubles. <br><br>  The Avtoralli-M machine gun (the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, as in many other Soviet arcades, means ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù) was produced at the Kontur production association in Tomsk.  In Soviet times, the company mainly produced numerical control devices and electronic stuffing for rockets. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://autorally.15kop.ru/game/">Play AutoRally</a> <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b>  We invite you to take part in the first in Russia tournament on the old school video game <a href="https://gameovernight.ru/">Game Overnight</a> .
