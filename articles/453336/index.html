In this case we consider laser with a diode solid-state laser, since  the CO2 tube goes under other tasks, it costs twice as much and is difficult to maintain.  The pyroprinter works with a nichrome thread, exactly the same as manual burners from childhood. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Where to start the choice of the machine for burning? </h4><br>  It depends on what you want to receive and what task you will set for the machine.  These machines are sharpened for different purposes.  As if to look at the drill and screwdriver, which to some extent can cope with the tasks of each other, but it will not be convenient and not the best way out.  Therefore, let us examine in turn for what tasks this equipment was created.

    <h4>  Laser tasks </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/5r/sb/ig5rsbusmf51d-d2fbxsiyrcgrg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  To begin with, the laser burns through the non-contact method, therefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter to it the thickness, surface irregularities and edges of the workpiece.  Another advantage of the laser is a large selection of materials for burning.  The laser works with materials such as: wood, plywood, veneer, leather, aniline, eco-leather, paper, cardboard, felt, jeans, ceramics, glass, etc. <br>  Moreover, some materials only engrave, and some can even be cut.  Particularly interesting for scrapbooking. <br><br>  Example of work done on a laser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gd/w_/dd/gdw_dd-j1e6ttyn1_ltjefaosvi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The laser machine is sharpened by applying a vector image and text to a large number of materials.  With the help of a common laser, they engrave phone cases.  He easily and quickly copes with a very small text, the type of what is used for business cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/y4/im/ouy4imw1d-a48imua6yzzxran0y.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  With the burning of portraits, the laser does not do well, because  he has a method of applying the image dots.  This method poorly creates a penumbra, and where it is without a penumbra in a portrait.  On closer examination, the portrait looks like a printout in a cheap newspaper. <br><br><h4>  Tasks for nichrome </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/z9/eg/ztz9egewzwa0swdgqfjluuucdyc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Perporinter works with nichrome wire and applies the image by the contact method, therefore for this machine, the flatness of the flat surface on which the image is applied is important.  Also, the machine is important that the surface was rectangular or square.  On a round surface, the machine will not be able to apply the image, due to the cleaning of the sting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/4o/o8/xd4oo8cshp6jsy8yysjqa6fa6se.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The machine was created for the burning of portraits and other raster images, such as landscapes, still lifes, animals.  Pyroprinter copes with burning text, but not too small.  Those.  This machine will be able to sign the work with the phrase "Happy Anniversary", but will not be able to burn out a business card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/rf/gu/gcrfguovltwxub6rc27pvpt9sra.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  We figured out the purpose of the machines.  But besides the tasks of machine tools, there are other characteristics that your choice may depend on.  For example, this is an opportunity to put equipment at home or in the office. <br><br><h4>  CNC installation at home </h4><br>  Why do we immediately raise this question about the choice of the machine, as such small machines are interested in home business.  And often arises about the installation of the machine for the first time home, and maybe constantly going to keep the machine at home. <br><br>  In this regard, the pyroprinter wins, since this CNC works almost without smoke.  He can get barely caught smoke with a black background image, but this smoke will be less than from a match.  Such a machine does not require a separate room and almost without noise. <br><br>  The laser, of course, it is desirable to put in a separate room, because the glow can press on the eyes with a constant stay.  Be sure to wear glasses - without them, neither.  Laser smoke is much more, especially when working with the skin there is still an unpleasant smell. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Choose a machine based on your tasks and location capabilities.  Software at both machines is not difficult to work, so do not pay attention to it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453336/</a></p>
