  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a domestic cloud hosting provider</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear readers!  In my article, I want to analyze companies that provide cloud hosting services in the territory of the Russian Federation.  The analysis is carried out from the point of view of the average user, who was faced with the task of acquiring hosting in the cloud.  The main criteria for the analysis will be made - support, cost, flexibility (as one of the main criteria), transparency of pricing policies, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will consider the following companies: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://activecloud.ru/">ActiveCloud.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://slidebar.ru/">Slidebar.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://cloudone.ru/">Cloudone.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ispserver.com/">Ispserver.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://selectel.ru/">Selectel.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://clodo.ru/">Clodo.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://scalaxy.ru/">Scalaxy.ru</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Let's get started <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/12b/eb3/7fe12beb3c90c0af64ce46683e031597.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://activecloud.ru/">ActiveCloud.ru</a> <br>  This company has been known for quite a long time in the market of hosting services (over 5 years) and has established itself as a very reliable and stable platform for the allocation of resources.  More information about the service ‚ÄúCloudServer.  Cloud hosting ‚ÄùI found the following disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  No free backup </li><li>  Lack of flexibility </li><li>  Pretty high price in general </li><li>  Quite high cost of additional resources (Additional 100 GB of space - 1625 rubles / month, Backup from - 6 RUB. For 1 GB / month) </li><li>  No payment for used resources (only monthly payment) </li></ul><br>  However, I want to note that with the order of a more powerful server, the price is reduced.  The rule ‚Äúwholesale is cheaper‚Äù.

      Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Very competent support and good knowledge </li><li>  Stability and reliability of equipment </li><li>  The ability to replace equipment based on customer needs </li><li>  Deservedly high prestige among hosting companies </li></ul><br>  Let's put it all together.  Unfortunately, as a user of services, it is difficult for me to see the difference between the service ‚ÄúCloudServer.  Cloud hosting "and a simple dedicated server, with the exception of the ability to quickly migrate machines when a node fails.  If you know the average (and peak) loads on your server and you are ready to pay for the stability and brand to the detriment of flexibility, then <a href="http://activecloud.ru/">ActiveCloud.ru</a> will be a worthy and competent choice. <br><br><img src="http://slidebar.ru/_i/logo.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://slidebar.ru/">Slidebar.ru</a> <br><br>  Studying the offer of this provider raises too many questions to which you can get answers only in the support service.  Simply put, I had the impression that the service was rather ‚Äúraw‚Äù to seriously compete in the market. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  The prospect of building a Linux kernel yourself to support multi-core </li><li>  No free backup </li><li>  Complete lack of information on additional services (IP, administration, etc.) </li></ul><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Flexibility in all parameters </li><li>  Quite operational support and a rich knowledge base. </li><li>  Low cost of services </li><li>  Hourly payment </li></ul><br>  Let's put it all together.  Despite the full flexibility, there is a lot of "but."  There is no full-fledged support for Linux, too little information is provided on the site of the service, which makes it difficult to calculate the real value of the final product, payment is made in full, even when the machine is turned off  It's unclear why I need to pay for unused RAM, for example.  Personally, I do not see any advantages of this service over competitors.  Maybe it looked bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/569/815/58d569815539cc6bc49aef15ed33df83.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://cloudone.ru/">Cloudone.ru</a> <br><br>  Having visited the site, I realized for myself only one thing: ‚ÄúVery, very expensive!‚Äù Having considered this service, I did not find more than one advantage over the offer of <a href="http://activecloud.ru/">ActiveCloud.ru</a> .  Perhaps these advantages exist, but for a user who chooses cloud hosting, they are hidden (due to the stinginess of information about the main and additional services).  For me, a similar approach of a young company (2010) to presenting itself in a market with a considerable number of competitors is not clear. <br>  I decided not to disturb the support service in terms of the benefits of their service and additional services. <br><br>  I would like to separate the following 2 sentences into a separate group. <br><br><img src="http://ispserver.com/img/pic_top_1.jpg" alt="image">  <a href="http://ispserver.com/">Ispserver.com</a> <br><br>  and <br><br><img src="http://selectel.ru/static/images/selectel_logo.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://selectel.ru/">Selectel.ru</a> <br><br>  Services that provide these companies can be safely called cloud computing.  My experience has shown that both services provide services at a very high level.  I apologize in advance if someone does not like it, that I combine two completely different service providers.  But my article is written on behalf of an ordinary user and, unfortunately, for the majority of those, these two companies are very similar. <br><br>  General advantages: <br><ul><li>  100% flexibility in all parameters </li><li>  Great support </li><li>  Fully transparent payment system </li></ul><br>  General disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  The difficulty of calculating the approximate monthly cost for an inexperienced user </li></ul><br>  The only drawback that I see is the difficulty of calculating the cost of one reporting period.  For most users who have not previously administered their own servers, it will be almost impossible to calculate a budget.  I would call <a href="http://ispserver.com/">Ispserver.com</a> and <a href="http://selectel.ru/">Selectel.ru the</a> choice of people who know exactly what they need and in what quantity. <br><br>  I would like to describe the last 2 projects in more detail, since  for the average user (new to the use of cloud hosting), <b>in my opinion</b> , they are the most attractive.  And this helps to achieve a slight limitation of flexibility, namely a bunch of parameters (CPU and RAM).  So: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/316/b7c/56f/316b7c56f3a058b762b583e2df6e24c7.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://clodo.ru/">Clodo.ru</a> <br><br>  Pretty young company that is developing very fast and provides high-level services. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  Opportunity to unknowingly greatly exceed the expected costs of the <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/scale-server/review/">Scale Server</a> </li><li>  No windows </li></ul><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Flexibility in all parameters </li><li>  Excellent support and updated knowledge base </li><li>  Low cost of services </li><li>  Hourly payment </li><li>  Large selection of operating systems </li><li>  Free control panel </li></ul><br><br>  Let's put it all together.  The only drawback I encountered is the lack of restrictions on the use of CPUs in the Scale Server service.  This can lead to a significant overestimation of the cost of services relative to the predicted value when creating a server.  The site is all indicated, but implicitly.  Support this question bypasses quite correctly. <br>  ‚ÄúAs the load increases, the flow of funds may increase‚Äù <br>  By and large, this is not such a problem, you can always use cpulimit and save yourself from possible overruns of resources. <br>  When using the Virtual Server service for every 256MB, the allocation of 6.25% of the core power and no more is guaranteed, which is not enough for me. <br>  I would like to draw attention to a very convenient support system that synchronizes communication in ICQ with requests for support from the control panel. <br><br><img src="http://www.scalaxy.ru/images/company_name_with_dot.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://scalaxy.ru/">Scalaxy.ru</a> <br><br>  Also quite a young and dynamic company that you should pay attention to. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><ul><li>  A small selection of Linux systems </li><li>  A bit limited functionality at the moment. </li></ul><br>  Advantages: <br><ul><li>  Flexibility in all parameters </li><li>  Excellent support and good knowledge base. </li><li>  Low cost of services </li><li>  Hourly payment </li><li>  Windows availability </li></ul><br><br>  Let's put it all together.  Speaking of a small selection of Linux distributions, I meant Debian, Ubuntu, CentOs, OpenSUSE.  If to judge purely subjectively, then 4 systems are quite enough, but if taken broader, then not enough. <br>  It is important that the service lacks the ability to bind several IPs to one machine (they promised to fix it soon). <br>  I did not find any hidden pitfalls, there is no opportunity to pay more than what is written. <br>  450 MHz is guaranteed for every 512 MB of RAM, but with free capacity, processor resources are allocated additionally and for free, which is very pleasing. <br>  I want to draw attention to the phrase ‚ÄúFor each additional <br>  virtual machine slot <br>  0.5% discount is charged. ‚Äù  When ordering a large car discount is obtained decent. <br><br>  About <a href="http://clodo.ru/">Clodo.ru</a> and <a href="http://scalaxy.ru/">Scalaxy.ru</a> together: <br>  Both companies are very young and dynamically developing.  Like all they have technical problems, but they introduce a new product to the market and this product is now in great demand.  Without errors this can not be done.  Each company has its own explicit and implicit advantages over the other for solving different tasks, at about the same cost of services.  I also want to note that both companies are quite sensitive to the wishes and interests of their customers, which greatly facilitates communication with support and the procedure for making proposals for functionality and services. <br><br>  Conclusion <br>  Although my opinion on the choice of a cloud hosting provider is purely subjective, but I hope that this article will give a certain circle of people a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich direction to go when choosing a site to host their projects. <br>  Sincerely, Dmitry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116712/</a></p>
