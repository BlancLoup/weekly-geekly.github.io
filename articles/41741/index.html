  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About MacBook, and how I visited the office of Habr</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened (it was supposed to happen, as the bokonoists say) that the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/fppp/41371/">news</a> that I won a MacBook caught me on a business trip in the capital of our country.  I had a chance to pick up my prize in person. <br><br>  What I actually did. <br><br>  After a certain amount of telephone conversations with representatives of Habr, I got to the office.  He came before the appointed time, and for ten minutes walked in circles, overwhelmed by various feelings.  Then the hall, corridor, elevator.  Doors to the office. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And in the office there is a muffled light, a sofa, a huge monitor from the nearby desk.  I was in the heart of Habr :) Some small things on the tables, Darth Vader's helmet on the cabinet, radio-controlled cars in a box in the corner.  Then I realized that I immediately liked it there.  There was absolutely no official atmosftera suits and ties.  As if they come here not as a job, but simply move to another place, and people's life goes on.  In general, a cozy office in which good people work.

      To the room were two girls from iProLab, one of whom introduced herself as a director.  Workers of Habr were treated to tea, told a little, asked a little.  And I was exhausted by Moscow, work and cold, but I tried not to show my mind :) He told me that this was my hobby, that I was a programmer, and all that. <br><br>  Then the official part ended smoothly, we went out into the hall, and the historical moment of the prize presentation came. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ab/f03/970/4abf03970b8646f88e8767e107c5362c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSC01108-small"><br><br>  IProLab representatives give me a laptop.  (On the photo there are invisibly some more Habr employees. Try to guess where they are :) <br><br>  Once again I will say: thanks to Habra and everyone who voted for me.  Special thanks to the sponsor - <a href="http://iprolab.ru/">iProLab</a> .  And this is not an advertisement at all.  Just the very moment in that very office is remembered to me every time I see this computer.  And it will be remembered for a long time. <br><br>  And then I left.  With macbook.  In mild stupor, still not believing that this really happened. <br><br>  Someone asked to write about the impressions of working with poppy seeds.  For me, who first used a poppy, it was something.  But that's another story ... <br><br>  Until we meet again, friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41741/</a></p>
