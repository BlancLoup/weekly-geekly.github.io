In addition, the start-up enthusiasm significantly reduces the level of material investments at the start and with further scaling of its service. <br><br>  To overcome all these difficulties will help the cloud platform, the use of which will allow a startup to quickly launch its own solution, provide infrastructure and manage resources.

      <a href="http://l.techdays.ru/go/azuretrial">Microsoft Azure is a</a> full-featured cloud platform that is available to startups completely free of charge through the <a href="http://aka.ms/habrazuretalks">BizSpark</a> program. <br><br>  Using BizSpark, a startup receives an MSDN Ultimate package (equivalent to <b>$ 15,000</b> ), which allows, in addition to cloud services, up to <b>$ 9,000</b> a year, to obtain Microsoft licensed software for developing, testing and <b>launching</b> its applications for free. <br><br>  Many novice IT startups are not familiar with BizSpark, and are unaware of what tasks a startup can be solved using a cloud platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to take advantage of the cloud platform, it was convenient for any IT specialist who is not even familiar with the Microsoft ecosystem. Microsoft Azure cloud service offers <b>full support for a</b> large number of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(NET, PHP, Python, Java, Node.js), development tools, frameworks , repositories and other tools. <br><br>  Microsoft offers startups access to cloud services through the BizSpark program. <br><br><h3>  Terms and features of the program BizSpark </h3><br>  Startups - participants of the <a href="http://aka.ms/habrazuretalks">Microsoft BizSpark</a> program, are provided with a monthly balance of $ 150 per account and additional discounts for using Microsoft Azure services in order to develop, test and deploy your services. <br><br>  A startup team can register up to 5 accounts and get $ 750 per month to use cloud capacity.  And thus, the team will have the opportunity to build a complete IT project infrastructure in Azure using existing accounts, for example as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  1 account - Placement of the project site </li><li>  2 account - Software development and everything connected with it </li><li>  3 account - Internal software version testing </li><li>  4 account - Environment for the final check of the software before launch, without prejudice to current users </li><li>  5 account - Tools for managing team work </li></ul><br>  Participation in BizSpark is free, and you only need to <a href="http://aka.ms/habrazuretalks">register</a> your startup program. <br><br><h3>  Azure capabilities for startup needs </h3><br>  When a startup receives a BizSpark subscription, it chooses how to spend the balance provided to Azure.  Microsoft provides the full functionality of its cloud platform for a startup, without any restrictions. <br><br>  You can use your $ 750 for any Azure services, depending only on the needs of the startup - for example, for virtual machines, websites, cloud services, mobile services, storage, SQL databases, content delivery networks, HDInsight, media services and more. . <br><br>  There are a huge number of usage scenarios for Azure services for the needs of a startup. <br><br>  <b>Virtual machine</b> usage scenarios <b>:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Using ready-made images, you can easily deploy SQL Server in a few minutes.  You can create virtual machines <b>for rapid development and testing</b> , or deploy complex <b>production</b> applications covering many Azure regions. <br><br></li><li>  You can deploy a full range of <b>open and community-supported operating systems</b> , as well as software solutions in Azure.  In Azure, you can choose the full range of Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and SUSE, community-supported solutions, such as Chef, Puppet and Docker, along with other products such as Oracle Database and Oracle WebLogic Server. <br><br></li><li>  With the help of <b>virtual networks,</b> we can monitor and configure all aspects of your work with the network, identifying subnets and preferred DNS IP addresses.  You can securely connect to virtual machines in Azure over a secure VPN connection over the Internet <br><br></li><li>  You can more widely use <b>D-series virtual machines</b> to suit your needs.  These VMs are faster and store more data: they have faster processors, more memory, and a temporary disk based on SSD storage, which significantly increases the speed of your VM's temporary storage. <br><br></li><li>  Run your <b>HPC applications</b> on high-performance A8 and A9 computing instances in Azure, and take advantage of the back-end network with an MPI delay of less than 3 ms and a non-blocking bandwidth of 32 Gb / s.  This <b>background network</b> uses RDMA technology that allows parallel applications to scale across thousands of cores.  Azure provides large amounts of memory and CPU class HPC for maximum performance.  <b>Scale your resources and pay only for what you use.</b> </li></ul><br>  Or scripts for using <b>websites with SQL databases:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Use ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Node.js or Python.  Run popular <b>web applications and CMS solutions</b> , including WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Umbraco and DotNetNuke <br><br></li><li>  Azure makes it easy to <b>create data processing solutions</b> and use them with your web applications.  Microsoft SQL, MySQL, Document DB, Search, MongoDB, Redis and Azure Table Storage are supported.  Test your applications with SQL and MySQL databases for free <br><br></li><li>  Run web applications in a high availability environment using <b>automatic fix</b> .  Web applications deployed using Azure websites are self-contained and hosted on virtual machines dedicated to your applications. <br><br></li><li>  Azure allows you to quickly scale up or down to handle any incoming client load.  Manually select the number and size of virtual machines or set <b>autoscaling for servers</b> <b><br></b>  on load or on schedule <br><br></li><li>  The Azure platform allows you to create websites that use data from your own data center.  <b>Hybrid connectivity and VNET make it</b> easy to securely access data from local data centers or anywhere in the world.  Use Azure Active Directory to organize access only to your employees or partners <br><br></li><li>  Configuring <b>continuous deployment workflows</b> using VSO, GitHub, TeamCity, Hudson, or BitBucket allows you to automatically create, test, and deploy a web application <br><br></li><li>  <b>Integration with Visual Studio</b> allows you to centrally implement a full cycle of application management.  By integrating with Azure VS, you can create and continuously publish your web application.  With VS, you can debug in the cloud and use live log data <br><br></li><li>  Create multiple <b>private test environments and staging environments</b> for your web applications.  Use them for testing before deployment.  You will be able to go into the work environment without any delay.  Web applications are preloaded, which ensures maximum efficiency for the client </li></ul><br>  As well as scenarios for the use of <b>mobile services with databases:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  A highly scalable push notification subsystem that can quickly send millions of messages to iOS, Android, Windows or Kindle devices.  Using <b>a notification hub,</b> you can send notifications to specific users or to entire groups of users with a few lines of code, regardless of the platform used. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Integration with social networks</b> Facebook, Twitter, Google.  Mobile services allow you to customize user verification with user accounts with just a few clicks. <br><br></li><li>  Simplified configuration of built-in <b>auto scaling for mobile services</b> and notification hubs to suit your application needs.  Automatic scaling allows you to expand or collapse resources depending on their actual use. <br><br></li><li>  Create a <b>server part</b> in C # or NodeJS for any mobile application on iOS, Android, Windows, HTML5. </li><li>  Integration with SQL, MongoDB, DocumentDB, search service <br><br></li><li>  Implement <b>offline data synchronization</b> in your application.  Do not limit the application to only those areas where there is access to the Internet.  Save data locally and synchronize it when the connection is resumed. </li></ul><br>  And this is only part of the capabilities of the cloud platform from Microsoft, which, by the way, is developing rapidly and provides new services to developers almost monthly. <br><br>  Additional materials, useful links and resources on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dn133038">‚ÄúMicrosoft Azure for startups‚Äù.</a> <br><br><h3>  Successful cloud startups </h3><br>  <a href="http://aka.ms/habrazuretalks">BizSpark</a> program for start-ups in Russia exists not the first year and has its own history, accumulated experience and outstanding graduates. <br><br>  BizSpark graduates are startups who, within the program, using all the advantages of the cloud platform, built a profitable business and won large audiences of users by offering them quality solutions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b72/98f/021/b7298f021a514d49831fb70728918566.png" width="367" height="275"><br><br>  <a href="http://news360.com/">News360</a> - a popular news service on all platforms <br><br>  The solution includes a tool that allows processing and linguistic analysis of more than 150,000 articles daily in real time.
