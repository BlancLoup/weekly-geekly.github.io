And, perhaps, no one can cope with this better than live video broadcasting services, where you can view and organize video streams in real time, communicating with viewers and other authors. <br><br>  If you have a webcam and an idea about organizing a live broadcast, which would be interesting to others, then you will have direct access to one of the social video services. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">Ustream.tv</a>

     <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/ustream.jpg" align="right"></a>  The service was launched a little less than a year ago, and at the moment its user base numbers about 130 thousand people.  The project is focused primarily on those who want to broadcast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Among the many similar services, by the way, abounding in bed scenes, Ustream looks pretty decent.  Rumor has it that the authors of the project are in the process of negotiating with Microsoft about a possible sale. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.blogtv.com/">BlogTV</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.blogtv.com/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/blogtv.jpg" align="right"></a>  BlogTV is one of the pioneers among online video broadcasting sites: having opened back in June 2006, it attracted $ 3 million in venture capital investments, thanks to which it quickly and successfully developed, collecting a considerable base of regular users.  The project is a partner of AOL and integrated into Facebook.  In 2006, he received the GMCA awards as the best video broadcast service for mobile devices. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mogulus.com/">Mogulus</a> <br> <a href="http://www.mogulus.com/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/mogulus.jpg" align="right"></a>  If you need high quality pictures, then Mogulus is for you.  Unlike competitors, it, thanks to its unique technology, allows you to organize broadcasts in high resolution, with minimal loss of speed.  The project is still quite young, but it has already managed to attract a lot of attention, and even was awarded the right to broadcast the awards ceremony <a href="http://crunchies.techcrunch.com/">The Crunchies</a> , which I already <a href="http://www.techhh.com/archives/38">wrote about earlier</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.livevideo.com/">Livevideo</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.livevideo.com/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/livevideo.jpg" align="right"></a>  The project belongs to the company <a href="http://www.liveuniverse.com/">LiveUniverse</a> , which, by the way, recently bought a <a href="http://revver.com/">Revver</a> startup on the verge of <a href="http://revver.com/">balance</a> .  Livevideo focuses on bloggers.  The project has quite good support: the parent company has partnership agreements with Warner Bros., EMI, T-Mobile, Comedy Central, etc. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.stickam.com/">Stickam</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.stickam.com/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/stickam.jpg" align="right"></a>  The most popular online broadcasting service: its user base has more than 600 thousand people!  This is argued, apparently, not so much by the fact that it was launched earlier than its counterparts, but due to the absence of bans on the placement of adult broadcasts, moreover, Stickam shares its infrastructure with the Live Sex Shows services. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.justin.tv/">JustinTV</a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.justin.tv/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/justintv.jpg" align="right"></a>  The service is named after its founder, Justin Kahn, who once decided to organize a live video broadcast of his life, not for a minute without going offline.  And to implement his ideas, he decided to make a startup, for which he assembled a team and received the first investment from <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> .  The project was launched in March 2007 and is now one of the most popular platforms for streaming video. <br><br>  <a href="http://loadup.ru/broadcast/list/">Loadup</a> <br><br> <a href="http://loadup.ru/broadcast/list/"><img src="http://www.techhh.com/images/loadup.jpg" align="right"></a>  In runet, from popular projects, it is possible to distinguish, perhaps, only the video hosting service of LoadUp, or rather its video broadcasting service.  There are minimal functions here, and there are very few users so far: at any time you will find here a couple of dozens of broadcasts that are viewed by a total of no more than a thousand people.  What is remarkable: even though several different thematic categories are presented here, the ‚ÄúErotica‚Äù section of the authors clearly holds a special place.  The requirement to place non-child broadcasts in this category is not just placed in the most prominent place and bold, it is also carefully supplied with a link: the authors kind of invite you to visit the most popular section, where 95% of all users of this wonderful service are sitting. <br><br>  - <a href="http://www.techhh.com/">From here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20665/</a></p>
