  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Execute can not be pardoned. On the system of punishment and re-education in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I spoke with one of my acquaintances who ignored most of the rules of the road.  And suddenly, recently began to observe most of them.  To my question about the reason for this, there was a direct answer: ‚Äúfines raised, NOW EXPENSIVE TO BREACH‚Äù! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a certain type of people who, before a crime (i.e., violation of the established rules, the law), will not be deterred.  He always hopes for his "happy thieves star" and goes to crime without thinking about the future.  Usually, in the thieves' jargon, they are called the ‚Äúcat‚Äù - the native inhabitant of the prison.  You will not frighten him with another time, but he does not want to work hard from work until morning.  Most of the other prisoners are very well characterized by the ‚Äúbandits‚Äù from the film ‚ÄúOperation Y and the Other Adventures of Shurik‚Äù.  Main frame: ‚ÄúBurglary, 5 years.  Um, no, that's too much.  Hooliganism - up to one year.  It is just right! ‚Äù  It turns out that increased punishment for a crime leads to a more peaceful sleep of citizens. <br>  A few years ago, mitigation of punishment occurred.  For example, for rape they gave 15 years, now 7. The number of such crimes has increased several times.  In some Emirates, for transporting vodka into the country threatens with execution.  After the adoption of this law, in the country it is impossible to find alcohol for any money.  Maybe we should think about strengthening the punishment? <br><br>  Head over to the other side.  How much is the content of one offender?  You can calculate how much money is allocated for its food and say that it is cheap enough.  In fact, for the work of the prison, the overseers (supervisors) and the guards who are paid salaries are needed.  To prevent prisoners from dying in too large quantities, there are doctors in the prison.  Also, the prison can not do without water and electricity, which means plumbers and electricians are needed.  If you think about it, then the prison is ‚Äúserved‚Äù by a huge number of people: escorts, police officers, lawyers, computer scientists, drivers, telephonists and another huge number of people.  Their salary is also included in the cost of prisoners.  The prison should be supplied with heat, water, light and repaired, so the costs are all increasing and increasing.  From the state budget are allocated money that could go to retirement, medicine, education and science.  After killing or robbing a person, the offender goes to prison, and his victims pay for his maintenance.  Similarly, a criminal who has been jailed 2 times or more is practically ‚Äúnot amenable to re-education‚Äù and will spend his whole life between crimes and prison.  Hitting even a short time in prison, blocks a person in the future the opportunity to work in very many organizations.  So, having stumbled once, he will go to the crime and continue to feed. <br><br>  I propose 2 cardinal solutions: <br>  1. Increase the time for crimes by 3-5-10 times, which will immediately reduce the number of crimes. <br>  2. Return the death penalty.  Moreover, the death penalty should be given not only to outrageous maniacs, but to simple recidivists.  If a person chooses his life as an outcast, he himself decided to separate himself from society, then there is no need for society to support this.  Also to introduce the death penalty for serious and very serious crimes.  Now the company of gopniki and bastards will get drunk, desecrate a schoolgirl or beat up a person to fractures or injuries and get 3-5 years for it.  In this case, the victim and his relatives will pay taxes for the maintenance of criminals.  Execution for such crimes will cool a lot of hotheads.  And which will not cool dry lines of the criminal code, those forever cool bullets after the trial. </div>
