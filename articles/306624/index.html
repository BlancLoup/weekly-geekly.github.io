  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The creators of the film Zero Days shed light on the authors of Stuxnet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About Stuxnet has been said and shown already enough many times to return to it again.  However, this time, we decided to do it.  This is due to the fact that the long-awaited documentary by the famous director Alex Gibney, entitled <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5446858/">Zero Days,</a> was released in the United States.  The film has already earned the most positive reviews and ratings, not only from ordinary viewers, but also from experts from various fields around the world.  Zero Days was truly the first full-length feature film of such a high level, in which the central theme is Stuxnet and methods of conducting cyberwar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/448/c15/89e448c15f6343b691894b18927ad282.png"><br><br>  For the viewer, the accessible language describes the zero-day vulnerabilities, the so-called state-sponsored cyber attacks, as well as political opposition between countries, not only in cyberspace, but also in real life.  Of course, the most interesting point was the explanation of the involvement of certain special services in the development of Stuxnet.  According to one of the employees of the NSA, Stuxnet was a major secret project of the secret services of several states: the CIA, the NSA, the US Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCommand, the UK Government Communications Center (GCHQ), as well as the Israeli MOSSAD, and the electronic surveillance unit 8200.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The film is provided with comments not only security-experts, but also managers and employees of the NSA, the CIA, as well as the US Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCommand, which makes it really impressive.  The film's authors indicate that the intelligence services of the United States, Israel and the UK decided to resort to cyber-weapons to stop Iran‚Äôs nuclear program after they realized that it was impossible to achieve a similar result by political means. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42f/c13/a05/42fc13a05517480194024e446a6c188a.png"><br><br>  The film also mentions the previously acclaimed in connection with the Snowden revelations of a NSA cyber division called Tailored Access Operations (TAO), which specializes in tracking and cyber intelligence on computer networks around the world.  According to Snowden, it was TAO that was behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore">XKeyscore</a> complex user <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore">collection program</a> . <br><br>  The film's authors indicate that the CIA was deeply involved in this project, with the main work on the development of the Stuxnet code was carried out by the NSA, the Israeli electronic intelligence unit 8200, as well as by the US cyber command (United States Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCommand).  It was shown that at that time the head of the NSA played one of the leading roles in cybernetic command, and both structures were physically next to each other. <br><br>  The NSA employee mentioned above also confirmed the fact that the code name of the cyber operation for using Stuxnet was ‚ÄúOlympic Games‚Äù ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25C2%25AB%25D0%259E%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25C2%25BB">Operation Olympic Games</a> ), and the authors themselves never called it Stuxnet.  Earlier we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/259181/">wrote</a> that the US intelligence agencies also planned to aim Stuxnet at North Korea.  She also said that the work of Stuxnet and its PLC-code was thoroughly tested using special test sites of industrial facilities in the USA and Israel, in particular, the Sandy National Laboratory in Albuquerque, Oak Ridge National Laboratory of the US Department of Energy, nuclear research center in Dimona (Israel), while the samples were prepared as hardware, identical to those for which Stuxnet was going to aim in Iran. <br><br>  Official site Zero Days <a href="http://www.zerodaysfilm.com/">www.zerodaysfilm.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306624/</a></p>
