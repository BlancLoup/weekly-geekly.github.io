  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the creation of fermer.mobi</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell you how I created a <a href="http://fermer.mobi/">browser-based online game</a> for mobile devices, which is currently: <br>  - occupies the 3rd place in the <a href="http://waplog.net/">waplog.net</a> rating (it is the largest ruwap counter); <br>  - 4th place in mobile classmates ( <a href="http://m.odnoklassniki.ru/">m.odnoklassniki.ru</a> ); <br>  - the audience of the game is ~ 300 thousand hosts per day; <br>  - online day ~ 12 thousand; <br>  - The number of registrations is already approaching 500 thousand. <br><br>  This story, in my opinion, is interesting because: <br>  - I created the game, launched it and promoted it alone, without investors, without partners; <br>  - I have never been a manager, businessman, marketer, I am a programmer; <br>  - In addition to money for the maintenance of my family, I invested in the promotion of only 50 thousand rubles. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Before launch </h4><br>  In fairness, it should be noted <br>  that over the past three years I have participated in the development of four products, two of which, one can say, have become stellar: <br>  "Barbarians" <a href="http://barbars.ru/">barbars.ru</a> ( <a href="http://barbars.ru/">Overmobile</a> company) and "World of Shadows" <a href="http://vten.ru/">vten.ru</a> (company Pleitoks).  And this experience certainly helped me a lot.

    <h5>  October 1-2, 2010 </h5><br>  I am leaving the Playtox team. <br>  At that moment I had the thought that I no longer want to play games. <br>  I'm starting to develop a blogger engine with very cool adjack controls, entry through openid, cool plug-in architecture, etc. <br><br><h5>  October 26, 2010 </h5><br>  I start the service inspectidea.com, and write <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/106973/">an article</a> about it in the hope of attracting users, but on the same day I understand that the project failed, I hide the article in the draft (I‚Äôve opened the link to work), and in another couple of days I stop the service. <br><br><h5>  October 27 - November 3, 2010 </h5><br>  I come to the conclusion that all the projects that I have done before myself: linkomatic.ru (no longer works), <a href="http://kinoestet.ru/">kinoestet.ru</a> (for friends), inspectidea.com (no longer works) did not bring me a penny, did not even pay for hosting, and I did not know how to monetize them, I just did, I thought the money would come, but the money did not come. <br><br><h5>  November 4, 2010 </h5><br>  My wife offered to make a game, because I have been doing this for the past few years, I am good at it, and there is money there.  The plot of the game we chose the banal - Farm. <br>  I study the market.  I see that the niche is not occupied.  I decide to make a game. <br>  On this day, I made the first commit.  Work has begun. <br><br><h5>  December 18, 2010 </h5><br>  The day of the launch of the project. <br>  Started buying advertising. <br><br><h4>  After launch </h4><br>  Model of the game is free-to-play, that is, you can play for free, but if you want to speed up the pumping or just buy yourself a beautiful profile, you can invest money in the game. <br><br><h5>  Billing </h5><br>  The opportunity to pay me the money I screwed up only a week after launch. <br>  For receiving payments via SMS, I chose <a href="http://smscoin.com/">smscoin.com</a> , for the rest of the <a href="http://robokassa.ru/">robokassa.ru</a> (by the way, they both work with individuals.) <br>  They began to pay almost immediately, but pathetic crumbs. <br>  As a result, about a month had to wait at least how much significant payments. <br>  All this month I puzzled what is so tasty to sell to the players so that they start paying. <br>  I spent a lot of time communicating with the players, and gradually I began to feel the audience better and better, and began to understand what they want. <br><br><h5>  Advertising </h5><br>  As soon as the advertisement began to pay for itself, I began to buy more of it. <br>  I bought it mostly here: <a href="http://mobiads.ru/">mobiads.ru</a> and <a href="http://octobird.com/">octobird.com</a> <br><br>  Advertising should be monitored clearly, I saved each user through which channel he came in, and then analyzed: <br>  - conversion of clicks in registration <br>  - conversion of registrations into active players <br>  - how many payments each channel brings <br><br>  Thus, it is easy to determine the quality of the traffic of each advertising campaign, leave good, disable bad ones. <br><br><h5>  Pictures </h5><br>  At first there were no beautiful pictures, I ordered them from freelancers much later, when it was already with what. <br>  Appreciated the charms of <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> .  Worked with very good illustrators. <br><br><h5>  Hosting </h5><br>  My first server was one of the cheapest VPS, since then I have moved 3 times to more powerful servers. <br>  For hosting, I chose <a href="http://hetzner.de/">hetzner.de</a> .  Because, firstly, it is cheaper, secondly, you understand why. <br>  At the moment, the game is spinning on the server <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produkte_rootserver/eq10">EQ10</a> : Corei7 6 cores, 24GB RAM, raid1 on SSD screws. <br><br><h5>  Partnership </h5><br>  In early April, I signed a contract with Overmobile, which is currently not only a game developer, but also a publisher. <br>  On April 8, 2011 we launched my game on <a href="http://m.odnoklassniki.ru/">m.odnoklassniki.ru</a> , and a few days later on <a href="http://spaces.ru/">spaces.ru</a> . <br><br><h5>  Technologies and software </h5><br>  Developed with: java, hibernate, wicket. <br>  Everything is spinning on: debian, nginx, tomcat, postgresql. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  I will be glad to answer your questions in the comments or in PM. <br><br><h5>  UPD </h5><br>  In the comments they ask how much they earned.  I answer: <br>  He earned enough to create a company, rent an office, hire a professional programmer for the further development of the project, and proceed to the next project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119329/</a></p>
