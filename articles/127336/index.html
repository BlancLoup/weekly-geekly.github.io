  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automation of calculations of the municipal center of the city based on 1C: Enterprise 8</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all.  The topic of our article today will touch upon the problem of public utilities, as well as a solution with which we were able to localize and completely correct this annoying flaw. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Problematics <br><br>  The history of the relationship between public utilities, the population and the state is very similar to the famous Krylov fable "The Swan, cancer and pike."  On the part of the population, the calculation and payment of utility bills is becoming a global problem for half a day, or even more.  The communal service is also not so rosy as it may seem to us from the outside - every apartment needs to be provided with a payroll, every payment received from consumers needs to be somehow taken into account, the amount of receivables properly estimated, how to carry out periodic reconciliations, metering checks and dozens of important and necessary functions.  And finally, the third "power" - the State.  As part of its social obligations, the state provides benefits, subsidies, monitors the level of payments.  As a result, low staff efficiency, a bloated staff of various subscriber services, queues at banks and Novakom, and, as a result, in state institutions, inefficient use of resources, both human and material. <br>  In the aggregate, all these difficulties lead to a decrease in the overall performance of the housing and utilities system, the impression of which is often not up to par.

      A solution to the problem. <br><br>  At that time, several separate information databases, ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù and ‚ÄúCard Index‚Äù, were used as accounting systems.  For some enterprises, these systems were the only software that provides for the calculation of charges for services, and provides information on mutual settlements with the population.  It should be noted that the system was closed, and the information in it was not available for independent analysis. <br><br>  The scheme of the settlement center "YOU" and "Card Index": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5946ee72/de15de7c/f0485aa7/28925ed1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having drawn conclusions, the management of the Kommunalnik company, made a decision on the organization of a single communal billing center, the launch of which would remove at once the many points of sticking between services and customers.  As an option, our company proposed to create a utility settlement center based on 1C: Enterprise 8. <br>  So, what exactly is this communal billing center?  Justify ... <br>  By its very nature, it is simply a database of all residents of a certain territorial unit (district, city, or several districts and regions).  It contains information on all consumers of utilities, utility charges in the context of each subscriber, payments and other necessary information with which all interested parties work in real time. <br><br>  The tasks were set as follows: <br><br>  1. To develop a database of all residential facilities in the city with an accuracy of an apartment and its own personal accounts system (each service has its own personal accounts system that is not related to other public utilities). <br>  2. Develop a database of city residents. <br>  3. To organize the data exchange interface with municipal utilities of the city for the exchange of information on charges, payments of benefits and subsidies for each personal account. <br>  4. Organize the on-line work interface for banks accepting payments for public services. <br>  5. Develop an interface for exchanging data with the departments of local executive committees for the exchange of information on the benefits and subsidies provided for each person and each family, respectively. <br>  6. Develop a mechanism for calculating and charging fees for housing services for each personal account, as well as provide additional service mechanisms for various city services taking into account the specifics of their activities. <br><br>  As you have probably already guessed, the creation and implementation of such a database immediately solves a significant amount of problems: a specific person no longer needs to have a bunch of payment books in order to calculate the utility bills himself.  Enough to come to the bank, give your address and last name.  A cashier in a bank connected to the settlement center system will be able to provide all the necessary information about the debt of the tenants of this apartment for all utilities services, accept payment, issue a general receipt of payment.  Information about the perfect payment instantly gets into the general database, which is accessible to all utilities, more precisely - each communal service works with its own data, with its own charges. <br><br>  For the stated 6 months, by the efforts of 5 specialists, it was possible to develop on the basis of 1C: Enterprise 8 a specialized solution "Infors: communal billing center".  As part of the development of this solution, the following tasks were successfully accomplished: <br><br>  1. Develop an address classifier of the city with the following details: district, street, house, apartment, personal account.  Moreover, storage and some technical information about real estate objects, such as the composition of the rooms of each apartment, indicating the total area, residential and heated areas.  For residential buildings, storage of such technical indicators as various aggregate indicators of areas, number of floors, number of apartments with details on the number of rooms, etc. is provided. <br>  2. Develop a database of all residents of the city with the provision of appropriate interfaces and jobs for the passport office of the city.  The information with which the passport offices work is detailed information about individuals living in apartments, respectively, information about the registration of an individual, and, very importantly, about the history of registration for each apartment.  Thus, it became possible to put a computer in each passport office, and with noticeably less effort to start issuing all sorts of certificates about the residents registered in the apartment, and on any date, about family composition, etc., to register and discharge citizens.  Also, the database of residents contains information about the beneficiaries and about the benefits to which they are entitled.  An interface for data exchange with the relevant government service was also developed. <br>  3. Develop a database of utilities with reference to each personal account, as well as a base of tariffs for utilities. <br>  4. Develop a mechanism for calculating and charging fees for housing services, taking into account the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments, the number of people living at the moment, the residents have the right to a benefit (benefits), taking into account the calculation of the size of ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù benefits, when several people have the right on various benefits. <br>  5. Developed data exchange interfaces with municipal utilities of the city, which already have their own software for calculating their utilities (regional power, city gas, city water supply system, heating network, etc.). <br>  6. A special subsystem has been developed for receiving payments from city banking institutions that accept utility bills. <br><br>  Total. <br><br>  As a result of the work done, there are no settlement books in the city anymore, there is simply no need for them.  The collection of money and meter readings is done in the bank, all information is entered into the database.  By the end of the day, the municipal service already has information on how much money a bank has collected per day for its public utility services.  For a month, information is known about what receivables were generated for utility services for the house, for each apartment.  It is possible to track the dynamics of changes in such debt. <br><br>  The passport office works quickly and efficiently.  The queues for receiving all kinds of certificates disappeared, all documents are processed very quickly, without using a paper file. <br>  Information on the benefits provided to the population is provided to the relevant state services almost instantly, the accrual of subsidies takes place with significantly lower labor costs, since  the corresponding service receives in electronic form all the information necessary for the calculation, and, in turn, transfers information on subsidies to public utilities through a central database. <br><br>  The overall result of the work is a significant increase in the efficiency of the work of all participants in the process and undeniable benefits for ordinary citizens. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127336/</a></p>
