  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Correction of the spirit of Internet traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over tens of thousands of years of existence, mankind has formed a great multitude of religious, philosophical, and ideological teachings.  However, with the rapid development of natural sciences in the last hundred years, the tendency in society has emerged and strengthened is to try to describe all the observed phenomena in materialistic terms, without taking into account the spiritual side of the issue. <br><br>  In the IT world, it is not customary to take the intangible seriously, but everyone knows the joke about system administrators setting up a server using a <b>UFO</b> or a shaman tambourine.  And very many who dealt with fairly large and complex systems, there was a situation when certain phenomena cannot be explained in terms of physical processes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Any reasonable person to agree that to abandon the centuries-old experience because of the fleeting fashion for rationalism is not worth it.  To find out if this experience can be applied to IT, our friends from <a href="http://www.colocall.net/">Bell</a> gathered a theological working group tasked with determining the appropriateness of using symbols and artifacts from different religions to increase the stability of network equipment. <br><br>  In the process of researching the issue, it was found out that there is simply no such experience.  The only ones who massively and successfully use religious artifacts for practical purposes were taxi drivers and minibuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3f2c4031/bda6ded5/d88f3e75/35c5ee1a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/44ef4172/370f258c/8c110235/affdf735.jpg"><br><br>  Accidents statistics on the example of one large metropolitan fleet showed that there is a correlation of icons and accidents!  Cars equipped with Orthodox icons on a torpedo got into accidents by an average of 20% less, and the damage from accidents in material terms for such cars was almost 40% lower. <br><br>  Actually, the <b>Universal Platform for Correcting the Spiritual Component of Network Traffic</b> (PKDS-01-04) was developed for the study. This is a passmount-made passive network device with a height of 1 unit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7708b64c/a0a84f6d/39d14319/74234195.jpg"><br><br>  The device is 4-port, usually included between the server and the switch, or between switches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/093004ea/39183cc8/73c7dae1/af7a1031.jpg"><br><br>  Inside is arranged quite simply, only 4 UTP loops: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/eaab2d7d/d71e2943/5255658e/306b62cb.jpg"><br><br>  On the basis of the PKDS-01-04 platform, the first test sample was assembled using Orthodox accessories as an active artifact.  Called it " <b>Traffic Orthodoxy</b> ": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/eb4382f6/0d6b6e9c/f16259a9/1e8d6cae.jpg"><br><br>  After a series of experiments, it was determined that <b>Pravoslavizator</b> has no measurable influence with instrumental means, but there is some influence and even amenable to counting! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5b89e849/10c4d891/6ab61131/d0ff92ec.jpg"><br><br>  For example, when the server that hosted the forum was turned on through it, the aggressiveness of its visitors decreased, and the moderator's load in average monthly terms decreased by 30-50% <br><br>  One of the most authoritative network media in the country also took part in testing the device, and its staff noted that the comments of visitors to the articles have become, on average, more friendly. <br><br>  Some negative phenomena that still need to be checked are noted.  For example, the hard drive twice failed in the server on which the porno rating is posted.  It is possible for such orientation of the projects " <b>Orthodoxy</b> " is not suitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/30d95bd0/cbbbbe7b/abb830e9/7406f403.jpg"><br><br>  Several modifications of the device are proposed, which are now at the final stage of testing: the <b>Kosherizer</b> , the <b>Halizer</b> , the <b>Sovietizer</b> , the <b>Perunizer,</b> and several other options for adherents of various religions, including such exotic ones as worshipers of Cthulhu and Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5058e46d/a0df3e20/c9544f41/439ed6cd.jpg"><br><br>  To date, the <b>PKDS-01-04</b> device has been prepared with a set of stickers for self-assembly and installation of existing artifacts (artifacts are not included in the package). <br>  Finished devices will go on sale after extensive testing and comparing the effectiveness of various artifacts. <br><br>  Before ordering, make sure you understand the date of publication of this news. <br><br>  <b>All have a good day and good mood!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116605/</a></p>
