  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will bring you success in 2008? Read Richard McManus's opinion.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Which network applications and trends will achieve the most success in 2008?  In this article, the authors of the blog <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a> reflect on current trends in Web technologies and make impatient assumptions about what 2008 can bring us.  Topics include <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> , semantic networks, online advertising, recommendation systems, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://www.digg.com/">digg</a> , open standards, Mobile Web, search engines, and more! <br>  So, read our forecasts for 2008 and do not forget, please share your own in the comments. <br>  the original is <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/2008_web_predictions.php">here</a> <br>  The translation was made by the startup portal <a href="http://www.liveidea.ru/">LiveIdea.ru</a> <br><br>  Richard McManus, editor, ReadWriteWeb: <br><ul><li>  In 2008, semantic applications will become popular as they are able to provide better content and better data transfer.  I think it will be search engines like <a href="http://www.hakia.com/">Hakia</a> and <a href="http://www.powerset.com/">Powerset</a> , ‚Äúwikipedia‚Äù initiatives like <a href="http://www.twine.com/">Twine</a> or <a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> and applications that use semantic technologies ‚Äúinside themselves‚Äù (such as <a href="http://www.adaptiveblue.com/">AdaptiveBlue</a> or <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> ). </li><li>  In addition to the first point: in 2008 Google will experiment more with semantic networks.  The Knols project, although not quite semantic, is already the first step in this direction. </li><li>  Web services platforms will become a battleground for tough challenges in 2008: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla and others will compete for the opportunity to provide consumers with network operating systems and data storage on the Internet.  Unfortunately, this can put an end to many startups in this area. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> and / or <a href="http://www.thinkfree.com/">ThinkFree</a> m will be acquired by large companies that want to hook into the Web Office space. </li><li>  The online advertising market will merge after a wave of acquisitions that occurred in 2007.  CPM (cost per 1000 impressions = price per 1000 ‚Äúimpressions‚Äù) will continue to dominate for media brands, and CPC (cost per click = price per one ‚Äúclick‚Äù) for niche ones, although there will also be experiments with <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">VRM</a> and other forms of narrow targeting. advertising.  However, privacy issues will not allow the latter to dominate.  So much desired form of CPA (cost-per-action - price per action) will continue to be just a dream, because it is not profitable for publishers. </li><li>  Large Internet companies will surprise us with the introduction of open standards and attempts to compete with each other using unique properties, rather than data locking (it is possible, of course, that we are only wishful thinking!). </li><li>  The most interesting network innovations in 2008 will occur not in Silicon Valley, but in Asia (China, Japan, Korea).  At least one new project from China will break through into the US market in 2008 with success similar to <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter's</a> success - and most likely it will be Mobile Web. </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  Twitter will be in demand. </li><li>  Most ad networks will start producing their own content and advertise it;  some content companies will be bought by ad networks. </li><li>  Online video (both normal and mobile) will become so ubiquitous that everyone will begin to wonder how the Internet used to do without it.  However, this will not be perceived as a great achievement. </li><li>  Some large companies will allow you to log in via OpenID, which relates to your account. </li><li>  The value of recommendation systems will become even clearer;  The era of information will be proclaimed. </li><li>  People will rebel against Google, at least a little bit.  Probably. </li><li>  People involved in the new web will do something really big, before which we all will tremble. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> will be in demand. <br>  The issue of confidentiality will become increasingly urgent, but people will not take any action in most cases, so things will not change.  Some companies and groups (read: Mozilla) will be engaged in improving the control of privacy for users, while others (read: Facebook) will continue to engage in "packaging" and slide down the slope.  This will alienate some users, but I doubt that their cup of patience will overflow in 2008. <br>  OpenID will be accepted by many startups and larger network companies, but most users will not start using it - wait a couple more years. <br>  Facebook will continue to grow, and their platform will be taken over by other major social networks.  Google will have to be nervous. <br>  Using Mobile Web will be a separate story in 2008.  It is already quite popular in many countries of the world, and the West is also about to fall under this influence.  With the advent of new mobile devices that make it easier to surf the web, people will be more and more online, even when they are far away from their computers. <br>  Ubiquitous media coverage will be a catalyst for users to become accustomed to web-office applications;  Microsoft will be forced to revise its policy in this regard and will offer a full office package online (the latter will not happen in 2008).  Offline mode (Gear, AIR, Silverlight, etc.) will be the thing that will outweigh the balance and attract the main part of users to the still unfamiliar world of web office applications. </li><br>  Now it's your turn to tell us your web forecasts for 2008.
