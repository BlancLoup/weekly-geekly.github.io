  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Incompetence of bank staff</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently went to Promsvyazbank to order a card from them and finally get rid of webmoney and switch to a more civilized payment system.  I ordered an income card which seemed to me profitable, inexpensive to maintain (200 rubles a year) and most importantly - the nearest branch with an ATM was 5 minutes walk from my house. <br><br>  I was offered to activate the SMS-informing service, but since  this is debit <br>  card, I refused it.  In fact, the card is necessary for me only for operations through the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yesterday I had to urgently extend several domains, but there was no money left on the cards.  I had to go to Promsvyazbank, throw money on my debit ‚Äúincome card‚Äù. <br><br>  He returned home, went to the site of his registrar, extended all the domains that needed it, and went for a walk and was never surprised that <b>there was no SMS notification</b> .  The next day, I barely went to my personal account on the bank‚Äôs website and was surprised to find that, in addition to the renewal amount, they charged $ 9 for SMS informing and $ 25 for servicing the card.  Violently rushed to the phone and called the round-the-clock technical support.

      Further I bring dialogue with the operator: <br>  - Hello.  Be so kind as to explain to me how $ 9 for SMS informing and 25 for card servicing were written off my card, whereas, it should cost 200 rubles.  When making a card, I refused to SMS informing, but you connected it to me, and when I paid for the service yesterday, I did not see any SMS on my phone due to the debiting of money from the account. <br>  - <i>Your card number, last name, middle name and secret word?</i> <br>  - xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx, ***** ****** ****** and **********. <br>  - <i>Thank you, that's right.</i>  <i>Wait a minute, please. ... You were charged $ 25 for servicing a Mastercard Standart name card and it could not cost 200 rubles, because so much are not registered cards.</i> <br>  - How is this possible?  I took a card that cost 200 rubles, but it turned out that it costs $ 25.  You tore off $ 25 from me and connected to a paid service, which I refused and tore off another $ 9, and your paid information did not reach me when I wrote off the money from the account. <br>  - <i>‚ÄúNon-registered cards‚Äù you can not make transactions over the Internet.</i>  <i>SMS notification did not come because the number is not specified.</i>  <i>Did you indicate your mobile number in the office</i> ? <br>  - Yes, of course I did, now in any application form the number must be indicated.  But I refused SMS informing because I don't need it.  I ordered a debit card, because I deposit into the account as much money as I will spend on this or that operation.  I need to buy a $ 25 T-shirt, I go to the ATM and put $ 25 on the card. <br>  - <i>You need to go to the office and enter the phone number to activate the SMS-informing service.</i> <br>  - I can not refuse this service and return the money? <br>  - <i>It is more profitable for you to specify a number.</i>  <i>Money is not refundable.</i> <br>  - Good.  I will take action on the fact of robbery, I will report to the police. <br>  - <i>good</i>  <i>Goodbye.</i> <br><br><br>  As a result, for the usual MasterCard Standart DEBET, I paid $ 25 and $ 9 for an option I didn‚Äôt need that I didn‚Äôt connect.  Issuance of cards and SMS information in many banks are provided free of charge. <br><br>  To be honest, the money is very sorry, I do not earn so much money to lose $ 30 at a time and I can not afford to sue, because  I will spend more and get nothing.  In general, I wonder how they connected the ‚ÄúSMS informing‚Äù service to me without specifying my number?  How do they have the right to talk about one thing and sell the other? <br><br>  From this Sharashkin office remained an unpleasant aftertaste.  Be careful, even such large banks are able to commit such that even the contract does not help you to return the money. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92960/</a></p>
