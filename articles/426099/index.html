  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Typegram news</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Two months passed since the <a href="https://habr.com/post/420107/">announcement of the typegram</a> on Habr√©.  And I have for you just a terrible amount of news and cool stories!  Everything is developing so rapidly that it is even scary.  I'll start with a greeting: <br><br><blockquote>  Hi, my name is Vadim, I am submitting a <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/">typegram</a> project.  Typegram is an online open source publication platform. </blockquote><br>  This is what I was trained to do at the YC startup school.  Start by introducing yourself and your project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, we (more precisely, I) somehow strangely came to this wonderful place where a lot of schizoos like them saw their projects and talk about their achievements and failures every week.  There are also lots of useful videos from successful mentors with an extraordinary approach.  The story is interesting and atypical.  About my first impressions and how everything happens, I already <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/%40recoilme/89">wrote</a> , I will not repeat.  There are links to videos of past years.  When I finish school (in three weeks) I will definitely write more.  Let's <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/tgram">move</a> on to interesting things (all I‚Äôm going to talk about is the open access to the <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/tgram">githab</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Let's start with the monsters:</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a75/cff/07b/a75cff07be4c0406ea87e800ece973b5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Each user now has a personal mascot, a monster or avatar to put it simply.  Each avatar is unique and generated for username.  Here, for example, avtokarka designer who painted monsters: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31a/9e8/7d1/31a9e87d1413c60f29ed86202e9b76aa.png" alt="image"></div><br>  How it works?  When you first request to the address <a href="">ru.tgr.am/a/username.png</a> - the server checks if there is a picture with that name.  If there is - renders.  If not, it collects pictures from parts, in the <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/tgram/tree/master/data/monster">github.com/recoilme/tgram/tree/master/data/monster</a> folder, there are pictures of body parts, and they are simply collected in one image.  It turned out very convenient.  First, everything happens on the server and once (there is no javascript brakes).  Secondly, the <a href="http://be.net/razuvaev">designer</a> simply threw the pictures into folders and voila (in fact, he had been drawing a grid in Photoshop for a week so that he wouldn‚Äôt run into his mouth and it would be cool).  If, suddenly, you want to supplement the monsters library with your own works - well.  Here is another <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/govatar">code</a> that was alienated from bindata, which formed the basis.  If you want to try a generator from the command line, for example. <br><br>  <b>44 Essay.</b> <br><br>  An unexpected turn, but very important.  Unexpected, because not about dev, but important because man is a playful and creative being.  I do not remember who said, but not the point.  We launched a contest for beginning authors - 44 essays.  Well, how they launched, launched his telegram, the Hemingway Channel will call, but the works themselves are placed on a typegram by the tag <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/mid/%3Ftag%3D44esse">44esse</a> <br><br>  Anyone can take part in it.  There will be an offline art party with reading the best stories, but without iPhones at the end of the event.  I think this is important, because after the announcement on Habr√©, many people began to publish stories on a timegram.  And it's great and interesting.  <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/%40recoilme/143">Try it</a> , it's free. <br><br>  <b>Email Integration</b> <br><br>  Good old email is great for sending notifications.  For example, when a user is mentioned in a comment.  Here my fuse to write a full-fledged competitor gmail was not enough, I'm sorry, and the banal smtp integration was screwed.  Technically - the letter sends Yandex.  You just need to kick it.  In go it is simple.  Try it, look at the <a href="">code</a> , if you also want to just send the pushes. <br><br>  <b>Telegram Posting</b> <br><br>  There was a <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/%40recoilme/85">script</a> that sends the article to the telegram.  This is a very controversial thing.  In telegrams absolutely everything is bad with formatting materials, on the one hand.  It is extremely inconvenient to write long posts in it.  Now you can write a post in a timegram, and if it is tied to a channel, everything will happen automatically.  Looks like magic.  But there is little practical use.  Because, as a rule, it is more interesting to write a banal eyeliner with a link to the article at the end than to pass through this hellish converter.  In general, this feature, technically interesting, is practically of low value.  Implementation on <a href="">github</a> <br><br>  <b>Statistics Server</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9d/09f/531/f9d09f531c1a5551466e2e99e208384d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I specifically bombed by how well implemented analytics counters.  And even more bombs from the fact that <b>they all</b> follow the users to show then the toilet, at the most inopportune moment.  Fortunately, there are free alternatives.  I chose the <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/%40recoilme/146">Fathom</a> project. Now the statistics can be viewed directly in the timeout: <a href="https://stat.tgr.am/">stat.tgr.am</a> and no toilet bowls.  There is also its own, primitive statistics - right in the project code.  Every article has counters views.  DAU and WAU are measured for each subdomain, and all this is implemented without collecting personal data on the server. <br><br>  The features planned in the near future: <br><br>  <b>Server less android application</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/882/36c/bad88236c83ba118203b283ad601a260.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We came up with a very interesting concept.  On mobile platforms - the time program will work as an instant messenger.  Notifying status changes - instantly.  How it works. <br><br>  Google has such a thing as notifications.  It's funny that in addition to the usual notification - there are hidden "parcels".  You can send an arbitrary json to the application, and it will be treated as a push, but without an alarm message at the top of the screen.  Well, or with an artificially created notification, here it is to your taste.  There is still such a thing as channels.  So, put it all together.  An application subscribes to a typegram / all channel. For example.  And on the user's personal channel typegram / recoilme - for personal notifications.  When publishing a new article - the server sends to FCM - notification - a new article has been published.  The application processes it and renders.  Conveniently.  Real time.  And no requests from the application to the server.  So far we have collected only a working prototype.  Description of the idea here: <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/tgram/issues/107">github.com/recoilme/tgram/issues/107</a> <br><br>  And you can see how it is implemented on the side server <a href="">here</a> .  The application saws <a href="https://habr.com/users/chukachichi/">habr.com/users/chukachichi</a> - as soon as it becomes shameful - promised to put it on the githab) <br><br>  <b>Dogecoin</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69a/e4e/8f7/69ae4e8f74defc008928888e5d69a73a.png" alt="image"></div><br>  We will build this most cute cryptocurrency in the world right in the <a href="https://ru.tgr.am/%40recoilme/162">engine</a> .  Each user will have a wallet and the ability to donate in one click.  And yes, if you are interested in this topic - ishue is free!  Want to try?  Wellcome. <br><br>  In the end, I would like to thank once again all the <a href="https://github.com/recoilme/tgram/graphs/contributors">visible</a> and invisible contributors.  Without you, the timing program would not have developed so rapidly.  And many of them came from Habr.  Come and you.  Opensource is above all fun and makes it possible to realize the most daring things.  No one will allow you at work to introduce Dogecoin to the site as payment.  And on the typegram - you will be met with open arms! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426099/</a></p>
