As you know, a huge amount of resources and there is no lack of information.  The most important thing is to choose what to read.  We looked at and tried a lot of resources, gathered for ourselves an internal base of useful things, and then decided that it was important to share this with the community. <br><br>  Below is a large list of channels, blogs and books, useful for product managers, which I read and recommend: about product management, entrepreneurship, management.  If there is something well complementing this list, well in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/ng/mc/ijngmcy11romgya_abivwtwrkra.png">

In this remarkable book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, art, and almost all areas of human activity can significantly affect how we think about our talents and abilities.  People with a fixed mindset ‚Äî setting on a given ‚Äî have less chance of success than people setting on growth ‚Äî those who believe that abilities can develop.

Solve quickly‚Äù, Daniel Kahneman, a well-known psychologist and Nobel Prize winner in economics, introduces us to an innovative outlook and explains the two systems that control our thinking.  The first is fast, intuitive and emotional;  the second is slower, more thoughtful and more logical.

This is technically true, but not quite true.  You generally should not ask whether your business is a good idea.  This is a bad question, and everyone will deceive you.  In fact, no one is obliged to tell you the truth - you need to understand what to do right, on your own. <br>  <sub>Consumer psychology, customer development</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/">Sprint, Jake Knapp</a> </td><td>  The unique five-day process of transition from problem to prototype from three design partners from Google Ventures. <br>  Companies that invest in Google Ventures face big questions every day: where is it important to focus and where to start?  What will ideas look like in real life?  How many meetings and discussions do you need to make sure that the right solution is found?  Business owners and investors want their companies and the people who manage them to be ready to answer these questions - and quickly.  And now there is a sure way to solve their problems and test solutions: sprint. <br>  <sub>Product design, product growth</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422/">Make time, Jake Knapp</a> </td><td>  The Make Time book is not about performance, and not about how to perform more tasks.  It does not offer unrealistic solutions, such as giving up a smartphone or social networks.  Everything does not come down to a radical restructuring of your lifestyle;  on the contrary, we are talking about small changes in your environment in order to free yourself from constant employment and distraction. <br>  Be sure to read to anyone who has ever thought: ‚ÄúIf there were more hours in the day ...‚Äù, Make Time will help you to stop responding passively to the demands of the modern world and begin to deliberately find time for things that matter. <br>  <sub>Productivity</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/">Zero to One, Peter Thiel</a> </td><td>  The book presents an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new look at innovation: it begins with what it teaches to ask questions that will help you discover value in unexpected places. <br>  <sub>Startups, grocery thinking, product growth</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-Mainstream-Essentials-ebook/dp/B000FC119W/">Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey A.

Based on a truly radical idea - that great companies can fail precisely because they are doing everything right - this best-selling Wall Street Journal, Business Week and New York Times Business is one of the most provocative and important business books ever written.  Entrepreneurs, managers and CEOs ignore her wisdom and warnings at their own risk. <br>  <sub>Startups, grocery thinking</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building-ebook/dp/B00DQ845EA">Ben Horowitz</a> </td><td>  Co-founder Andreessen Horowitz and one of the most respected and experienced entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley offers important tips for creating and launching a startup - practical wisdom to solve the most difficult problems that are not told in business schools. <br>  <sub>Managing people, startups, growth</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012">Creativity Inc., Ed Catmull</a> </td><td>  Witty book about creativity in business from the co-founder of the studio Pixar Animation.  Creativity, Inc.  - This is a book for managers who want to bring their employees to a new height, a guide for those who strive for originality, and the first ever trip with full access to the Pixar Animation management center, where some of the most successful films in history were created.  In essence, this is a book about how to create a creative culture, but, as Ed Catmall himself says, ‚Äúthis is an expression of ideas that embody all the best in us‚Äù. <br>  <sub>Management</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Kim-Scott/dp/B01KTIEFEE">Radical Candor, Kim Scott</a> </td><td>  Radical Candor is a fairly simple idea: to be a good boss, you must take personal care at the moment you are challenged.  Without caring, you create an unpleasant experience and aggression;  caring without offering complex tasks is destructive sympathy.  When you do neither of these things, it is manipulative insincerity. <br>  This simple structure can help you build better relationships at work and fulfill three key responsibilities as a leader: creating a culture of feedback (praise and criticism), creating a cohesive team and achieving results that you are proud of. <br>  Radical Candor offers a guide for those who are confused or exhausted by a manual written for bosses and those who manage bosses.  Based on many years of experience, the author provides useful lessons for the reader;  he shows managers how to succeed, while maintaining humanity, find meaning in their work and create an environment in which people love their work and their colleagues. <br>  <sub>Management, feedback</sub> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951">The Goal, Eli Goldratt</a> </td><td>  The exciting, fast-moving thriller-style narrative of The Goal is changing management thinking around the world.

This realistic story shows how a completely different kind of corporate culture is a powerful model for success, and how, by focusing on the happiness of the people around you, you can significantly increase your own. <br>  <sub>Culture, customer happiness</sub> </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445322/</a></p>
