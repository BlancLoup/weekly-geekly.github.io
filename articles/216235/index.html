  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The sacred cow, karma and mustache: how and why the Indians are not indifferent to IB</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, she has been to India.  Apparently, such karma is in my mustache: Hindus love me, and I, too, like India as a whole.  Today we will talk about how rich the world of information security of this country is, what conferences are held in the main cities, and, by tradition, we can‚Äôt do without small sketches from everyday life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06b/fe0/5fb/06bfe05fba607403624c0aa4ea117ec7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Delhi (GroundZero 2013) </h4><br>  Delhi, or New Delhi (even the Indians themselves are confused here) is the capital of India.  I was invited there for the conference Ground Zero, an absolutely new event, made extremely qualitatively not only by the standards of India, but also by world standards.  The organizers chose the most correct approach to the organization of such events.  UBM Media was responsible for the commercial part - a company that owns many IT and IB conferences in the States, and more recently in the world.  Among their assets are such well-known conferences as BlackHat and Interop, as well as the Internet resource DarkReading (DarkReading.com).  The organizers of local conferences and local sekuriti parties, including NullCon, Malcon, Clubhack, Cocoon, Innefu, were also responsible for the content.  It turned out a kind of killer mix.  The only clear disadvantage of the conference was its tough focus on the Indian state, which predetermined the content of half of the reports as ‚Äúpugalki‚Äù about cyberwar.

The program consisted of 4 days, and in the first two all reports were ‚Äústacked‚Äù, and the other two consisted of workshops lasting 4‚Äì8 hours each.  Unfortunately, this year, the first 2 days overlapped with ZeroNights, so I only managed on the last day to my workshop. <br><br>  Traditionally I will not go into the details of my own and other people's performances, since they can be viewed on the website.  Let me just say that after the night flight and the past ZeroNights, I was slightly out of shape, so I asked the organizers for help to bring a redbul bottle to the report.  In the end, every half hour of the four-hour speech, they brought me a red bull.  For the fifth time, the audience applauded almost standing up.  Overall, it was an unremarkable mini-training on the basics of SAP security. <br><br>  The main feature of the conference, in my opinion, was that they managed to invite John McAfee himself as the keynote speaker.  The legendary man, my idol, the crazy founder of McAfee, who is always accompanied by various rumors.  They say, for example, that he was hiding in Belize from the American authorities, was accused of killing his neighbor in the jungle, owned a clandestine laboratory for the production of psychostimulants.  Makafi all his life was fond of extreme sports and differed insane antics.  By the seventieth anniversary did not lose his sense of humor, and even released a video about how to remove antivirus Makafi. <br><br>  All these colorful details are for the sensitive public.  Professionals appreciate McAfee for his original and tough approach to business.  He took a fee for the speech, but could not come personally because of problems with the visa.  As a result, visitors were content with videotape of his speech, where he had been promoting his new startup for 30 minutes!  This is the top management in marketing.  Briefly outline the essence of his new "chips."  At such a young age, he moved to Portland, the capital of hipsters, where I was just flying, describing this story, and got carried away with an ‚Äúincredible‚Äù idea that the whole world would soon hear about.  Namely, under all this hype with Privacy and Snowden, he decided to make his Internet, <s>with soft toys and pink unicorns, butterflies</s> , with a special device through which access is provided, so that no one can "trace" or decipher traffic, and generally nothing can not do with it.  A kind of hardware TOR, which "good Robin Hood" John will distribute to all to escape from the evil NSA. <br><br>  Naturally, the conference was held in the coolest hotel in Delhi, where gos stayed.  There is even a hypermode club for golden youth, where for the first time in my life I met a well-dressed pretty Hindu.  Unfortunately, like many hotels in India, their owners are sure that it is enough to simply build a palace, decorate it with gold leaf, hang a sign ‚Äú5 * hotel‚Äù, and you can do nothing else.  And the fact that in 20 years the walls begin to bubble, the gilding to rust, and the shells crack, they are of little concern.  However, me too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/031/3d9/42a/0313d942a4936b137588e4e8849a8b6f.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Profile: </h6><br>  Attendance: 500-600 people <br>  Visitors: 90% - Indian gos, foreigners - no more than 5% <br>  Format: 4 days (2 days reports in 3 tracks, 2 days workshops in 2 tracks) <br>  Price: $ 67‚Äì134 <br><br><h4>  Mumbai (CISO Platform Summit 2013) </h4><br>  After Delhi, I almost immediately flew to Mumbai for another newly created CISO Platform Summit event.  Organized by the CISO Platform professional community.  It is an extremely interesting format: in general, it‚Äôs not even a conference at all, but rather a platform for sharing experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcd/268/2d1/bcd2682d1e168d0f6b8579dadeafb063.jpg"><br><br>  The speakers included about 80 people, with a total number of visitors of about 200. For the most part, short TED-style performances and demonstrations of 10‚Äì15 minutes were presented about a significant project that one security officer wants to share with others.  It turned out such a concentrated exchange of experience.  In addition, there were round tables at the conference where security leaders discussed various issues. <br><br>  <i>Mumbai is a city of contrasts, the craziest place.</i>  <i>You can love and hate him fiercely, but it is extremely difficult to remain indifferent.</i>  <i>A place where glossy luxury with inconceivable dirt and poverty intersects, a place where the line between the poor and the rich turns into an abyss.</i>  <i>This is not at all like in Russia.</i>  <i>Only here, you can probably get out of the posh hotel, where in the toilet the servant opens the door to the toilet, and you see the family living in the boxes right by the fence.</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebf/68b/45b/ebf68b45b61b8be245cb4bf33785654d.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>In Mumbai, I managed to walk a little more, and I went straight to the slums of Dharavi.</i>  <i>The taxi driver looked at me for a long time, trying to decide whether I had the wrong address or damaged my mind.</i>  <i>In his opinion, we had to go to the gates of India or beautiful gardens, beaches.</i>  <i>‚ÄúGod, man, why, you can also download‚Äú beauty ‚Äùon the Internet, drop it, go to the slums,‚Äù I said.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, Dharavi is known for being the largest slum in Mumbai and has about half a million Indians.</i>  <i>Not so much.</i>  <i>For comparison, the population of black taunship Kayelish in South Africa has exceeded one million, but what about Mitchell's Plain, a suburb of Cape Town, where color people live and where Die Antwoord hangs out and shoots their clips, I generally keep quiet.</i>  <i>But Dharavi became famous throughout the world thanks to the film "Slumdog Millionaire."</i>  <i>It was there that the famous pipe was located, along which people walked in the absence of a road buried under meter-thick layers of garbage.</i>  <i>Now the pipes are gone, and the area itself has become much cleaner.</i>  <i>I went there to take pictures of the locals, but in the end I myself became the object of "photo-hunting".</i>  <i>As the Indians have explained, the new Bollywood blockbuster Ram Leela recently released, the main character of which I reminded them.</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc5/a95/25c/dc5a9525c92fb9b563629f70f2f74fa0.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>It's funny that the boys from the slums for 5 meters immediately learn the latest model Lumia, while adult IT people from the same CISO Platform think that this is a Samsung.</i>  <i>In general, Indian children are very advanced.</i>  <i>I even gave one ZeroNights t-shirt - let him popularize the topic.</i>  <i>According to the local security officer, I found the best place to advertise the conference, because it turns out that the slightest specialists grow from these slums.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b96/215/3b5/b962153b50b035485dd7bb88c0974b3e.jpg"><br><br>  It was there that I had the idea to distribute ZeroNights attributes around the world and photograph people from all over the world in clothes with our emblems, leave flags in the most remote points of the world.  The initiative was supported by our entire team, and we will also welcome your participation.  So far, only about 10 countries have accumulated, but I want to jointly flood the whole world, of course.  ZeroNights can be tracked using the #ZeroNightsWorld hashtag.  The rules are simple: take photos of people who are easily guessed by local signs, in ZeroNights attributes (for example, a taxi driver in Bangkok or a kebab seller in Turkey), and tweet with the #ZeroNightsWash hashtag, indicating the country, city and a short description.  The authors of the best works will receive free tickets and will go down in the history of this megaproject. <br><br><h6>  Profile: </h6><br>  Attendance: 200‚Äì250 people <br>  Visitors: 80% are security managers of Indian companies <br>  Format: 2 days, about 80 mini-reports <br>  Price: $ 125 <br><br><h4>  Goa (NullCon Goa 2014) </h4><br>  Well, we got to the most famous Indian conference, which celebrated its 5th anniversary this year.  Somehow I could not get there before.  And finally, in mid-February, I found myself on a business trip to Goa.  Sounds good.  As expected, the atmosphere at the conference is extremely relaxed.  But otherwise, if from the venue of the event to the beach just a few meters depending on the tide (then 5, then 20, though, really, counted). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f7/dcc/47b/8f7dcc47b5a031b565645af071fa123e.jpg"><br><br>  Probably, only ShakaCon in Hawaii can be compared with this conference, but I was not there, I did not know.  This year, NullCon had the most people, about 500 people.  Even in my two-hour workshop, which was held in parallel with two reports, it huddled under 50 Indians, which is quite a lot for such a specific topic as SAP Security.  Although it should be noted that in India now this direction is actively developing.  Among SAP consultants, there are more and more Indians, the topic is actively ‚Äúheating up‚Äù (by the way, we again aggressively recruit people, write, even if there are no specific vacancies posted). <br><br>  The conference was held on February 14, in connection with which there was a big heart-shaped Tory for dinner, and the conference slogan ‚Äúlet's spread love not viruses‚Äù testified to the mimicity of the event.  The conference is inhabited mainly by pentesters and consultants from all over India, but I even met a couple of Europeans from Copenhagen who came as visitors. <br><br>  As for the reports, the keynote from the organizer of BlackHat should have been interesting, but, unfortunately, I overslept him, went to the Qualys report about SCADA, ‚ÄúI learned a lot of new things‚Äù. <br><br>  In general, most of the time I spent in communication.  There I met my followers, one guy promised to grow the same mustache by next year.  Check it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aef/c8c/c7d/aefc8cc7d357ebf34e5bf14adc74eb97.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Profile: </h6><br>  Attendance: 500 people <br>  Visitors: Pentesters and Consultants <br>  Format: 2 days reports (2 tracks) + workshops (1 track), 2 days trainings <br>  Price: $ 115‚Äì288 <br><br>  As for Goa itself, I am a little disappointed.  Well, yes, warm, cheap, beaches, but the same can be found in other places of the world, and it is warmer, cheaper, cleaner, and without a crowd of absolutely wild Russians from Tagil and washed drug addicts from around the world.  Yes, and no nightlife there is long gone: most clubs close at 3 o'clock, and the main occupation of the locals is sticking to the ceiling. <br><br>  Of course, we will not do without animal species again.  Unfortunately, it is more difficult to find a dead cow in India than a dead child, because they practice burning rituals.  Therefore, here is a living farewell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20e/c4e/416/20ec4e4165d552922b64fd679114bb58.jpg"><br><br>  That's all.  Follow @ZeroNights on Twitter, see new photos, participate in the #ZeroNightsWorld project! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216235/</a></p>
