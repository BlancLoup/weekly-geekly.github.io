    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Make sure your dreams are worth the effort.</font> </h2><br>  Just dreaming about where you want to live and what you want to do is not enough.  You need to look a little deeper, explore the dream and decide whether to devote your life to its realization.  Ultimately, what is required to make a dream come true?  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/formula-provala-kak-perestat-sabotirovat-sebya/">Devotion to oneself</a> , indifference to the opinions of others, and discipline that stops ordinary people. <br><br>  Is your dream worth staying up until two in the morning?  Is it worth spending Saturday morning to work on it, when you can lie down in bed, eat Lucky Charms flakes and watch the TV series ‚ÄúMarine Police: Special Department‚Äù?  Is it worth the risk if there is a chance of total failure? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Do not dream of being.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">Think about actions</font> </h2><br>  Dream about making X, and do not imagine yourself as the person who creates X. <br>  Simply put, if your dream is to build a startup, everything is fine.  And if you dream of turning into Elon Mask, you should not continue in the same vein.  If you use a quote from the Disney cartoon, then "your dream smells bad." <br><br>  You need to ask yourself what you really dream about: your dream is the ultimate and only goal, or is it more like a journey?  In the second case, you will spend every day life, acting, and you will never be able to stop, because you will not call a single point on this road a destination. <br><br>  If your dream is based solely on moving to an imaginary finish line, an endless journey awaits you ahead. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Stop thinking about imperfections.</font> </h2><br>  Dreams will never work like you did in your imagination.  If you actually manage to revive them, they are likely to be slightly (or even radically!) Different from the idea.  And this is absolutely normal!  You are a man, not a clairvoyant.  How did you expect to know what reality would be? <br><br>  Reaching a certain point, you can not leave the case simply because everything is not quite perfect.  If you really want to translate your dreams into reality, you need to learn to accept them as they are, and appreciate what you have worked so hard on. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Define your dreams</font> </h2><br>  When someone asks you what you want to do, you can not freeze and say that you have forgotten. <br><br>  When someone asks such a question, you have to straighten up, look into his eyes and answer that you are dreaming about creating a technical company that will cost billions of dollars one day, and its products will conquer the world.  Or you want to help disadvantaged immigrants.  Or think about writing a book that could shake the basics. <br><br>  If you want to revive your dreams, find out exactly what they are.  When defining them, be tough and avoid vague wording.  Understand them by making a short presentation, and why learn it.  You will take possession of your dreams and become proud of them, only by fully understanding what they are. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Be proud of your dream.</font> </h2><br>  Some people keep their dreams a secret.  They like to hide them, partially protecting their dreams, and partly - themselves.  There are several reasons for this.  One of them is that it is easier to give up a dream if the only person who knows about it is yourself.  In this case, your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-otklyuchit-vnutrennego-kritika-i-ignorirovat-stremlenie-k-sovershenstvu/">failure</a> will be obvious only to you. <br><br>  Another reason is that we are all chronically afraid of ridicule.  It is the fear of being ridiculed for something deeply personal.  And because of him, many people never take their dreams seriously and never make active attempts to carry them out. <br><br>  There is something tragic in a person who has dreams, but never follows them.  In the one who keeps inside a small promising light, dying over the years and in need of faith and recognition that help dreams to survive.  Ignoring your own dream and letting it eat pieces of the soul, you become embittered and frustrated by the bore that no one wants to meet at the party. <br><br>  Protect your dreams.  Obey them.  Believe in them and do not let any " <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-uspeshnye-lyudi-spravlyayutsya-so-svoimi-toksichnymi-opponentami/">gifted person</a> " make fun of you for them. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">5 major mistakes or why your rational decisions do not work?</a>  . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297290/</a></p>
