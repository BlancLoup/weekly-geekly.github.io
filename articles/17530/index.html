I'm not a geek.  And a month ago I had no idea what communicators are (I enjoyed using the Sony Ericsson K750i phone).  However, apparently, due to the increasing care of the network and the ever-growing feeling of lack of information, the GPRS Internet on the screen of 176x220px began to seem to me that it does not allow us to live a full and fulfilling life. <br><br>  In addition, I had a bad habit of working all the time, sitting at a large stationary computer.  (= I wanted something more frivolous and accessible in places other than an apartment and an office. Something that could tear me away from continuous coding. And since I realized a long time ago that I could not get away from the computer, I thought up to change the form of the computer itself. A clever idea, do you not find? (= <br><br>  My brain was immediately attacked by the notorious iPhone.  Everyone around me began to tell me that there was only an iPhone: nothing more.  Yes, the two-finger touchscreen struck my imagination.  It is as if the border between the physical and those on the screen has been erased.  And the speed and ease of access to information in the browser!?  Yeah.  But.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the iPhone, I immediately disliked the following things: <br><ol><li>  Lack of official sales in Russia </li><li>  The policy of binding to specific mobile operators </li><li>  Closed for ordinary MacOS users </li><li>  The fundamental lack of Copy / Paste function </li><li>  Mass hysteria around the device - in particular, Mac style - in general </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>So, I rummaged in the internet and came across a pretty device in pictures: HTC Touch</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9b0/8f7/fc4/9b08f7fc4390354a72f4ab889cecbb93.jpg" width="210" height="344" alt="HTC Touch" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9bc/12a/567/9bc12a567bb067b9c46de0091cb0cd4b.jpg" width="210" height="378" alt="iphone" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><br>  Most of all, I was pleased with the small size of the device (almost the same size as a regular phone), plus the notorious Touch word that captured my brain. <br><br>  Having played with the device for three days and three nights, I realized that it was completely worth living, but it should not cost 16 thousand rubles!  Devoid of the above disadvantages of the iPhone, the HTC Touch, however, is endowed with a whole fan of its own absurdities.  However, I do not want to describe my grievances now. <br><br>  <strong>Better talk about the technology TouchFLO, claiming an alternative to tachi in the iPhone.</strong> <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúTouchFLO ‚Ñ¢ is a special feature that allows you to work more comfortably with the touch panel on your device.</em>  <em>With TouchFLO, you can scroll the screen and move around it, just by moving your finger</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  (HTC) <br><br>  Delving into the internet, I realized that this technology is by no means the prerogative of a specific communicator model, as claimed by its manufacturer.  There is a very interesting and absolutely free program <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D56118%26st%3D180">FTouchFLO</a> . <br><br><h3>  FTouchFLO </h3><br><br><blockquote>  Allows you to manage any PDA with Windows Mobile 5/6, using your finger instead of the stylus.  It allows scrolling window contents in most applications (Interner Explorer, Outlook, File explorer, MS Word, Notes, Contacts etc.), where there are vertical or horizontal scroll bars.  In addition to the ability to scroll with your finger, FTouchFlo also provides the ability to launch programs.  You will be able to launch up to 4 of your favorite applications, simply by swiping your finger across the screen in one of four directions. </blockquote><br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe TouchFLO technology also includes a touch cube with which you can launch messaging programs, Internet Explorer¬Æ Mobile and others.</em>  <em>You can also add favorite contacts, play music, and view images and video files</em> . <em>‚Äù</em>  (HTC) <br><br>  It turned out that this function exists by itself, apart from the specific manufacturer of communicators!  The program is commercial, called <a href="http://www.touch-commander.com/">Touch Commander</a> .  However, you can easily find the <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D57170%26st%3D300">free version of the program</a> (= <br><br><h3>  Touch commander </h3><br><br><blockquote>  In essence, it contains inside itself an implanted FTouchFLO (the FTouchFLO program is detected among other files immediately after the installation of the main program) and additionally implements a so-called.  <strong>touch cube</strong>  More precisely, it is not a cube, but a trihedral prism.  The prism opens with the movement of a finger from bottom to top, closes with the movement from top to bottom.  and flipped through the movement left and right.  These are three independent screens with a custom number of cells, in each of which you can put a link-icon on any program of the communicator. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/noJm-SbaWwo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh52T2KvQePZ7yyUwwrCpNectaFDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></blockquote><br><br>  PS I would like to know who else is using these programs and on which devices?  What are your ratings on this technology? <br>  PPS I personally tried to run these programs on my HTC Touch and they came into conflict with the functions that were wired inside, which I could not turn off.  A pity - the possibilities of touch programs exceed the capabilities provided by the manufacturer of the communicator <br>  I also tested the programs on DELL Axim X51V (Heck, thank you!) And a little upset - I could not learn how to run the touch cube.  But FTouchFLO, set separately earned!  Although I most wanted exactly a cube.  It seems to me that it is best adapted to the interface of existing communicators. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17530/</a></p>
