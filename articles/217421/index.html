Nevertheless, no matter how well the process is set, a problem or difficult task may arise, the solution of which sometimes lacks the usual resources, and you need to seek salvation in new ones or even combine several. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that before we start working on a project, we calculate the amount of work, that is, the total number of words or characters in the text, in order to orient the customer at a cost and orient himself in terms. <br>  However, there is a rather simple type of project, which often takes a lot of time when calculating statistics - this is localization of sites.  It would seem that the file format is as simple as twice two (HTML) - take it and load it directly into the program.

      Yes, everything is very simple if the client‚Äôs site is one-page and there are no tabs, link links and additional pages that also need to be taken into account and translated.  But if this is not the case, this is where the ‚Äúterrible dream‚Äù of the project manager begins, who has to go through the entire site, unload page after page, save them in HTML and only then upload to the program and calculate the statistics. <br>  In search of a solution to this problem, we stumbled upon an Easyling program, which is a development of a Hungarian company and is positioned as an automated translation program designed specifically for working with websites.  She partly solved our problem of counting statistics throughout the site, moreover, it turned out that she has a number of quite interesting features, which I would like to tell about later. <br>  Easyling functions online, i.e. all the work is done on the developers site after users register and enter their credentials.  The interface is localized only in English. <br>  To get started with the program, you need to create a project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e7/874/090/5e787409025e7b481883d29e8fa2b220.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All you need to do here is to enter the address of the site you are working with, specify the source language (the language you are going to translate from) and click on the Add project button. <br>  If the client‚Äôs site is multilingual (for example, the site itself is completely Russian, but there are certain phrases or articles in English), using the built-in Google Translate mechanism (if the user has an API key), you can run the site analysis and include only the original language in the statistics was selected (Process pages in source language only). <br>  Using the Include pages only starting with and Ignore these paths windows, you can include or exclude certain pages of the site from it. <br>  Next, the program automatically calculates statistics, and then displays the result in this window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8e/a84/487/d8ea8448722003f0eaec222612063637.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Take a closer look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cf/970/75e/9cf97075ee1c4787226697823ce44bc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The program is able to recognize such site elements as domains, CSS tables, Java scripts, images - everything that in no way relates to textual and translatable information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b4/673/2e5/0b46732e51211575f8fe96c1bdef7196.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The program also allows you to work with each page separately, i.e., you can view the entire list of web pages on the site and decide whether to include them in the translation (similar to the order of project creation, but even more detailed).  And for each page there is a preview and the ability to go to the translation of any selected page (we still remember that this is a CAT program). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/4d7/92e/abb4d792e88615405ce1b2c8a025b912.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But the most interesting thing about this option is the possibility to exclude a certain list of pages from the calculation with a few mouse clicks (both by selecting them individually and as a group), after which the statistics on the site are updated (for example, I excluded all pages starting with / about): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a0/74d/aaa/4a074daaaac76ec0b851f76ce42707a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What really bribed Easyling was compatibility with other automated translation programs: it supports importing into CSV and XLIFF formats (suitable for almost all CAT programs currently on the translation software market). <br>  To start the translation (which can be done directly in Easyling), it is enough for the user to specify the translation language (there may be several) and select Translation in list view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bde/891/006/bde891006082c9a91425d432d5c90b81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The user's workspace allows you to translate the site text segment by segment (by default, segmentation occurs in paragraphs) and use the site preview as you work.  Thus, if the user has translated some part of the text and he goes beyond the button, table or any window on the site, it can be immediately traced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5c/6f1/53b/f5c6f153bf4d372fe09b41ee26835e00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the supporting translation mechanisms, i.e., machine translation programs are a matter of taste.  We never use them, but the presence of this function may seem essential to many.  Therefore, I can not say that three machine translation programs are built into Easyling: Google Translate, iTranslate4eu and Bing Translator, which can be used while working on a project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/511/728/137/511728137966f5a9c681a4594befd4fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, in the process of testing this program, I was pleasantly surprised by some of its capabilities.  Despite the fact that we have already decided on the main program of automated translation, Easyling has simplified our lives when calculating statistics for sites.  After that, I would like to say that the proverb ‚ÄúYou know less - sleep better‚Äù is incorrect when it comes to localization.  And in general, we are not looking for easy ways, but sometimes it‚Äôs so cool when they are. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217421/</a></p>
