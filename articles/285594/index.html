The story is largely subjective, but does that make such stories interesting? <br><br>  About me: I am 31 years old, I am from Sevastopol (yes, there are more and more people on Habr√©), I graduated from SevNTU.  I have a beautiful wife and a seven-year-old son.  Engaged in an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yasno_tv/">educational project</a> .  Before moving to Denmark, we lived in Kiev for 6 years.

    <h4>  Reasons for moving </h4><br>  We are not "poravalitiki."  In general, we lived very well in Ukraine.  Of course, we understood that the terms of many are not sweet.  Anyway, to flee the country, grabbing a tractor, did not pull. <br><br>  The whole idea originally came from his wife, her arguments were as follows: <br><ol><li>  see the world </li><li>  give his son the opportunity to learn in a multilingual environment. </li></ol><br>  The arguments are good, but I was convinced by very different things: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  I have already been to Denmark and managed to formulate for myself the idea that this is a country of victorious common sense.  Why not go and learn life from them - Peter I sent the young to Europe to learn from their experience. </li><li>  The turning point was the reading of an article about the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2591%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Kurenyovskaya tragedy</a> : in 1961, a plant dam broke in Kiev, and in the early March morning a 14-meter wave of mud and sand flooded an entire area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKiev and buried thousands of people (it remained secretly for a long time - letters were lyustrized, Soviet aircraft flew around the place tragedies, and so on).  I thought that then Chernobyl happened, and now on the nose the universally predicted breakthrough of the Kyiv Sea dam is already very decrepit ( <a href="http://kiyany.obozrevatel.com/life/96057-kievskaya-ges-vozmozhen-li-apokalipsis.htm">here it is</a> more detailed on this subject).  The reasons for all these man-made disasters, I think, are poor management, and since there are still no glimpses of this issue here, I decided to wait out the situation somewhere far away for a few years.  You can consider me a paranoid, and thank God that I was wrong this year, but <a href="http://newsradio.com.ua/rus/2013_04_11/Kiev-ozhidaet-samij-bolshoj-pavodok-za-34-goda-Gidrometcentr/">is it really wrong?</a> </li><li>  in the Scandinavian countries everyone speaks English.  Like us, they teach it from elementary school, but, unlike us, they also use it, so you can explain with all (even with the homeless). </li></ol><br>  At some point, I even had a choice between Denmark and England, but, first, Denmark seemed to me to be more active, technological.  Secondly, the Danish visa allowed to travel freely throughout Europe, and the British - only in the United Kingdom. <br><br><h4>  Visa issues </h4><br>  The company where I worked before made me an offer to move to Copenhagen.  I already had a good account of myself at that time, and for Europeans, as you probably noticed, it is important to discuss working ideas on the spot, and not via Skype. <br><br>  The proposal was as follows: <br><ul><li>  I was given a salary and about the amount that will remain after taxes.  About the money below. </li><li>  the company paid for the entire visa process, including my wife and son, </li><li>  also paid for the flight and transportation of things </li><li>  Of course, I had to pay for the housing myself, but promised to help in finding housing (this is a problem, also lower) </li></ul><br>  The chef sent me a pre-filled form;  I entered my data in it, reported on top of more waste paper and passed to the visa application center.  A temporary visa for 90 days was given after 3 weeks.  For the money came 315 UAH ($ 40) visa center and 2112 UAH ($ 260) to the Danish consulate with each person. <br><br>  The ease of obtaining a visa was due to the fact that programmers are included in the so-called white list - a list of professions whose representatives are welcome in this country.  In addition to engineers, there are doctors and teachers.  " <i>Our motherland is beautiful, and people need it</i> ."  To get into the white list, you need to attach a diploma in the profession (at least 3 years of study) - this was the first time in my life when I really needed a ‚Äúcrust‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition, obtaining a visa and residence permit is easier for those who have a high salary.  Note: the salary above 31,20 kroons is considered high, and the minimum salary of web developers is just a little above this figure. <br><br>  My wife and son were applying for a visa when I was already in Denmark, and here the confusion began.  Their documents are constantly lost.  My wife, on the one hand, called the Ukrainian embassy (they had already memorized our last name and recognized my wife by voice), for my part, I twitched the Danes.  Embassies exchange visa documents by email, and they immediately send and receive 2 files (packages of documents for wife and son) only from the third time, and each time after the next attempt they had to wait a couple of weeks.  This process took 4 months with constant calls from us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3be/a3b/507/3bea3b507b059cb9073493591fb13a9f.jpg" align="right">  As I said, a temporary visa for 90 days is given - just a stamp in the passport.  In addition, I was given a document where my taxpayer code was specified - the omnipotent ID in Denmark, as it turned out. <br><br>  Within a certain period of time (also about 3 months), you need to contact the Ministry of Integration in Denmark, where your fingerprints are taken and a biometric photo is taken, and in a few weeks you will receive a "Dane card" by mail.  Now for four years you are a temporary immigrant and expat. <br><br><h4>  Salary, taxes </h4><br>  Finstrip will not do, but you can find out the average salary by profession at <a href="http://www.jobindex.dk/cgi/cv/salaryindex.cgi">JobIndex</a> : enter ‚Äúwebudvikler‚Äù (‚Äúweb developer‚Äù) in the search bar and you will see this picture.  You can try to adjust the age, experience and location - everything, as in <a href="http://jobs.dou.ua/salaries/">preschool</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de9/d1c/609/de9d1c609cf5dad6cd66c11dfcb55b22.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1 - the average salaries of web developers in Denmark</i> <br><br>  Taxes are paid immediately at an approximate, overpriced rate (I had 38%).  Everything is paid by itself, I just get money into the account (I understand that we have an accountant, but personally I do not do anything for paying taxes).  After the New Year, the tax administration SKAT recalculates the funds received and makes tax refunds, the amount of which can be immediately viewed on the website.  I didn‚Äôt really roll my lip and didn‚Äôt look at anything anywhere, although at work many people discussed it closely.  I was very surprised when in March I dropped about half of my monthly salary from above. <br><br><h4>  Transportation of things </h4><br>  While I was in Denmark, my family loaded our belongings (things, books - of course, no furniture) into a dozen cardboard boxes, transported them by ‚ÄúNew Post‚Äù from Kiev to Sevastopol, and there TNT had gone through Germany to Copenhagen. <br><br>  For money, Sevastopol-Copenhagen came out around ‚Ç¨ 320. <br><br>  It went about a week.  I got a call from the courier service, and we agreed when I would be at home.  When I came back from work, there was already a large wooden pallet at the entrance, and on it were our boxes, wrapped tightly with film.  Surprisingly, everything was in place - such orders.  For half an hour I dragged things into the apartment. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  Who was looking for a place to live with us, he knows: the task of the Russian realtor is to create a stir.  "We have a lot of people who want to get to this apartment, so let's quickly decide."  The pillars of ours have been picked up by the ads ‚ÄúRenting Cheap‚Äù. <br><br>  In Denmark, the opposite is true: apartments fly away in an hour, and there‚Äôs a real turn for them.  It looks like this: there are special real estate sites where the owners post ads for housing (I assume that it is free).  Those interested leave a request on the site.  After some time, we realized that the owners stupidly ignored us and did not call us back.  Then we bought a paid subscription (something about $ 20 per quarter), and we could see the direct phone number of the owner, and I began to call.  At the end of the line, I was usually awaited by voice mail, and I gave out already learned text compiled with the help of colleagues: I was recommended to mention where I was from and what was my family composition, and also that I had a job in Copenhagen.  Some said that foreigners are more willing to rent, others vice versa.  Anyway, I started looking for an apartment in July, and we drove in November (the family at that time received a visa in Ukraine). <br><br>  At the same time, it is not at all important whether the apartment is far from the center, 5 minutes to the metro or 15. This is connected in my opinion with the fact that here the wealth is distributed evenly.  As my friend Sergey Komar said, ‚Äúyou leave for Copenhagen - and everywhere they have a small Copenhagen‚Äù.  Everywhere there are bike paths, parks, benches;  purely.  The only thing that, in my opinion, can greatly affect the price, is a view of the sea.  What's more interesting, the Nazis did not bomb Denmark, so the new buildings are listed on a par with the houses of the end of the XIX century. <br><br>  For the first 2 months, my company found an apartment for me, then I lived in DanHostel in a room with 5-7 tourists and tourists, taking turns every day.  In Europe in June-July - it's time to travel graduates, so it was fun.  For 3 weeks, nothing was missing from me, although I went for a walk every evening and left my MacBook under the pillow.  Once, a note was waiting for me next to Aksyonov's book: ‚Äú <i>Russian, who are you? You come when we are already asleep and leave while we are still asleep</i> .‚Äù  That was cute. <br><br>  A hostel in the city center cost CZK 150 per day ($ 30) in a room for 8 people, 170 CZK in a room for six.  In any case, it is not as scary as it seems - bunk beds, there is no stable feeling, on the contrary, everyone has a holiday mood.  The hostel has a kitchen, wifi, washing machine.  In a month, a little more than 5,000 kroons ($ 1,000) came out - upon check-in, one has to buy an annual card of their network and a set of bed linen.  Highly recommended, DanHostel is one of the best;  require a corner room on floors 11-14, you will not regret.  It is very centrally located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2d/6ff/5ec/c2d6ff5ec56ccc5573b046d1d16c5974.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 2 is a view from the DanHostel window onto the center of Copenhagen.</i> <br><br>  I also rented a private room in Fredericksburg (good neighborhood) for 5,500 ($ 1,100).  All the apartments we looked at were around 8,000 kroons ($ 1380) - but these were either small apartments, or far away, or not at all.  We rented a newly renovated apartment the size of our treshka in Amager (a good coastal area) without bargaining for 10,000 kroner ($ 1,700).  Amager (simply ‚ÄúAma‚Äù in Danish) has always attracted me with the proximity of the sea and modern Danish architecture, so, although it is a little expensive, we like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/685/1ce/027/6851ce027dbc9170a7f736a621ec4141.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 3 - Amager District: Amager Strand Beach with Windmills View</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e1/9ee/dae/3e19eedae0407202bebbf113685df512.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 4 - Amager District: ITU University Famous Student Residence (elite even for locals)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b5/e03/ea0/1b5e03ea08bb6206a2267224654d59c5.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 5 - Amager District: the same hostel, inside view</i> <br><br><h4>  the Internet </h4><br>  We submitted the application for connection to the Fullrate provider before the New Year, and we were hooked up in the middle of January.  The monthly fee is 199 CZK ($ 34).  We also charged 99 CZK for one piece of equipment for one time, 299 CZK for connection, but the wifi router was proudly declared free. <br><br>  The shield is located directly in the apartment - in the same place the plumbing and telephone jack, through which the Internet is distributed.  When connected, the tuner did not enter the apartment, but did everything somehow on the distributor below, in the basement.  The router came by mail as promised, so we inserted the plug into the socket and that's it. <br><br><h4>  School </h4><br>  Obviously, my seven-year-old son does not know Danish, so he cannot go to school.  We tried to get into the Russian school at the Russian embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãbut there is a very limited number of places that go to the children of the consuls and employees of Aeroflot.  Besides, I thought that moving abroad, but studying in a Russian school is somehow strange.  We have other tasks - to adopt local experience, so we began to consider local options. <br><br>  We went to school in our area.  The courteous Turkish director explained what we should do: first, the son needs 1-2 years to go to a special preparatory school, where he will play Danish with other immigrant children.  Then, if the knowledge of the language comes to the desired level, he will be able to go to school at the place of residence. <br><br>  There are one or two preparatory schools in the city.  To solve for us, the parents, the issue of logistics and the safety of children, children from home to school carry on a taxi.  This is very, well, very expensive pleasure paid by the commune - the district administration, the mixture of the district committee with the housing office, only adequate.  It looks like this: every morning at exactly 7:27 a local taxi drives up to our house - a new Mercedes with a Hindu driver; in a year, the taxi was not late any time.  At 8 o'clock the son is at school, at one o'clock the teachers arrange them in cars.  Having brought the child home, the taxi driver waits until we show up from the balcony and wave our hand to him, saying that we are at home, everything is okay. <br><br>  There are 6 people in the class of the son: in addition to my Rusak - the Japanese Sanksan, the Hindu Obishak, the Negro-Somali Obilache, the Pole Demyen and the Arab Mohamed.  The teacher is a Turkish woman, in a headscarf, she does not know English, only Turkish and Danish;  she is polite, but strict, her son likes her very much. <br><br>  This is a great stress for a child - they have no common language, only body language and common sense.  There are a lot of incomprehensible situations when children cry for resentment, because at their age everything is not so clear in life, plus they cannot express it in words.  Therefore, often, while waiting for a taxi, we tell our son that we understand how difficult it is for him, but we are proud of him that he succeeds - and I see that it fills him with new forces.  Six months later, he began to communicate tolerably well - he plays with the locals in our backyard. <br><br>  There are many rumors about the subject of Scandinavian education.  I want to understand its differences from ours, but for now I can say that children are taught not so much encyclopedic facts, as much as independence and the ability to communicate. <br><br>  Wife went to the parent meeting.  Parents came one at a time to the director's office, where the director, teacher and translator were waiting for them from the language that the parent speaks. <br><br><h4>  Child benefits </h4><br>  Some official information.  The amount of payment depends on the age of the child.  You get a fixed amount for each child. <br><br>  The figures for 2013 are: <br><ul><li>  0-2-year-old child: 4299 DKK per quarter </li><li>  3-6 years: CZK 3402 per quarter </li><li>  7-14 years old: 2679 CZK per quarter </li><li>  15-17 years: 893 crowns per month. </li></ul><br>  There is also a multiplier depending on the length of your stay in the country: <br><ul><li>  from 6 months - you are paid 25% of this amount, </li><li>  after 1 year - 50%, </li><li>  in 1.5 years - 75%, </li><li>  after 2 years - 100%. </li></ul><br>  This is called the accrual principle, which also applies to foreigners working in Denmark. <br><br><h4>  The medicine </h4><br>  I have a dissonance from local medicine, which can be expressed like this: it is better to have cancer here than to catch a cold.  Will explain. <br><br>  In Denmark, there are 2 layers of medical care: let's call them Front Front and Real Medicine, respectively. <br><br>  Front Front - this is a doctor, to which you go with any questions: it hurts, itches, worries.  These therapists are very calm people, and the main answer is: ‚ÄúIt will pass by itself‚Äù.  Well, they can recommend you drink more tea (while the Danes look at you with all their eyes if you put raspberry jam into tea).  Seriously, it seems that the task of the Front Front is to prevent you from accessing Real Medicine;  it seems like saving taxpayers money.  At the same time, their competence leaves much to be desired - someone had a doctor doing a shot, sneezed into her palm, did not wash her hands and didn‚Äôt rub the place of the injection with alcohol, someone had treated allergic rashes as simple acne, someone had a cold 4 weeks (they went to 3 doctors, listened to "it will go away" and it seems they found a Russian specialist). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b7/c62/eaf/8b7c62eaf4d577df521e2f38b2c77807.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 6 - Front Front.</i>  <i>Reception.</i> <br><br>  You are credited with a particular doctor at the place of residence.  There is a list of doctors in each district, and you can choose the one you like.  Most often in the commune only one question is asked: ‚ÄúWhat gender of a doctor would you like?‚Äù.  When this sensitive issue is resolved, a card arrives in the mail for honey.  service - it must be presented at the reception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3c/b63/565/b3cb6356571213a04ee69a8863862f37.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 7 - Medical Card</i> <br><br>  But Real Medicine is white coats and the latest equipment. <br><br>  An interesting moment.  At the reception desk, you are told how to get to the necessary room like this: ‚ÄúFollow the green line on the floor‚Äù - 5-6 different-colored lines diverge from the rack.  On the floor - a machine with free coffee, paintings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f23/758/e32/f23758e321fa0c0acb6efe9bf1f9aa50.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 8 - Clinic</i> <br><br>  The Danes are a seasoned people.  They wear T-shirts when we wear sweaters with a throat.  I heard about kindergartens, where children in any weather all year round sleep in the quiet hours in the fresh air - of course, wrapped up and under a canopy, but still cool. <br><br><h4>  Do not think that I mention casual - work </h4><br>  The place of work is indicated on the ‚ÄúDane card‚Äù.  If you quit this place, you must notify the appropriate authority within 2 days (at least by email), and then you are given six months to find a new job. <br><br>  They work mainly from 9 to 17, after 17 people actively go home.  Lunch break half an hour.  Delivery of meals to the office is common: the employee himself pays 50%, the rest is paid by the company. <br><br>  Discussions are held in English, but each Dane will consider it his duty to tell you how great it would be if you began to learn their language. <br><br>  The Danes are nationalists, and they firmly believe that Danish developers are the best.  I believe that the issue of nationality has little effect on professional skills. <br><br>  When we were looking for developers, and I sorted the summaries sent, there was a lot of rubbish.  I remember the brightest resume for the position of PHP developer: "The <i>last place of work is a hotel cleaner. The front works: hotel rooms, a hall, corridors, a conference room, a banquet room</i> ."  It seems that this is due to the fact that people sitting comfortably on the manual are obliged to send several resumes per month for a tick, so they send something anyway. <br><br><h4>  Happiness at work </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aac/70f/ee3/aac70fee3b7dea7828d8e0d4ebfd5797.png" align="right">  It is interesting how words in a particular language convey the spiritual values ‚Äã‚Äãof its speakers. <br><br>  Wikipedia says that the Japanese language has the word " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">karoshi</a> ", meaning death at work from overwork.  I heard that when Asian hard workers want to protest, they work twice as much. <br><br>  In Denmark is not the case.  At work should be good and pleasant to work.  This they call the special word ‚Äúarbejdsgl√¶de‚Äù (‚Äúarbeide‚Äù, as you know, ‚Äúwork‚Äù, and ‚Äúgl√¶de‚Äù - tracing of the English word ‚Äúglad‚Äù, I mean joy).  Unlike the Greeks, whose pleasure led to <a href="http://m.forbes.ru/article.php%3Fid%3D48959">economic problems</a> , the Varangians use endorphins to increase their productivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/180/8ab/042/1808ab0421ecc4ef3f99047a6c0bdbda.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 9 - happiness at work as I saw it.</i>  <i>In addition to the joystick and the dogs in the cockpit, he also has a cigarette and music.</i> <br><br>  So that foreigners could feel the spirit of this idea, a special website was created. <a href="http://whattheheckisarbejdsglaede.com/">What the heck is arbejdsglaede !?</a>  .  Look, there is a minimalist video about what it is and how it is achieved. <br><br>  As a result, I‚Äôll say: abroad, of course, it‚Äôs good, but as soon as my project in Denmark comes to a logical conclusion, I plan the whole family to return home to live in the Ukrainian expanses - we have better.
