They buy, and then they always repair something there.  They will always find what to fix there.  And then this car simply stops to stop from these "repairs".  And the sufferer is towed to the service.  In resuscitation so to speak. <br><br>  Open source ERP systems also love about the same "Kulibin".  Well, they like the process of ‚Äúcreation‚Äù and that's it. <br><br>  The other day, a corporate email received a letter from one such amateur dig deeper.  This letter is nothing but a reaction to <a href="http://avaerp.com/company/forstaff/qq/opensource">this video</a> (more precisely to the upper video. The lower one is later recorded), where I explain to my managers what an open source ERP system is and how it all ends, as a rule.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Here is the text of the letter of the offended open source admirer (punctuation and spelling errors are preserved): <br>  ‚ÄúDear, compare the turnover of your company with the turnover of OpenERP, and then try to understand that there are different business schemes.  Open source and its support is the best advertisement.  The customer is always right.  He wants to run through a minefield, let him run.  One out of a hundred reaches the rest, the rest will get to the doctor, i.e.  will return the money. " <br><br>  "Dear" - this is probably me. <br><br>  No, well, that's fair, even funny.  What hurt the poor fellow?  The fact that I have an opinion on this? <br><br>  Now seriously.  Let's look at it publicly. <br><br>  <a href="http://erp-shik.livejournal.com/13609.html">Somehow I have already written my opinion</a> about one of the most popular open source erp systems. <br>  Well, now let's deal with the next no less popular. <br><br>  The author suggests that I compare the <a href="http://avaerp.com/company/news/2012/01_06">turnovers of my company</a> with the openerp turnovers.  There is a problem.  Because in Russia, apparently, openerp momentum stubbornly strive to zero.  I just could not find a single company that would introduce this product in Russia.  So where does the turnover come from? <br><br>  However, <a href="http://arterp.ru/">there is one</a> .  There among the clients (or rather the client) in Russia is the company MegaTorch.  And what a coincidence it is necessary - this company turned to us on 03/20/2011 ... Apparently not from the good life with OpenERP.  Applied in writing, if that.  So the letter in the editorial, as they say, is available. <br><br>  Yes, here it is.  It is right on the main page of something like a review function.  Here do not be lazy, click.  Actually there it comes down to phrases like: <br>  ‚ÄúIntegration with sales, point of sale, and a discount campaign.  Management of the purchase price and sale price ¬ª <br><br>  Of course, asking <b>how</b> it all happens is not worth it.  Because this, apparently, is not entirely known. <br><br>  But when <b>we</b> describe a functional, for some reason from theses we make references to instructions, where it is written <b>exactly how this</b> is done.  Or maybe you just need water too?  SUCH, you know, you can pour ... <br><br>  I tried to find information about real implementations.  Well, what the hell is not joking, suddenly find? <br>  Not found.  Maybe something was not looking.  If anyone knows, write in a personal, I will not be lazy, call (come) there.  Damn interesting to see it. <br><br>  Only there is a nuance.  It is necessary to determine the concept of "implemented."  Implemented, it means: <br>  - the company receives from this system such primary documents as invoice, invoice, bargaining-12, ttn.  Well, at least these.  And also leads all contractual activities. <br><br>  - all financial statements about the real state of affairs (in the mode close to online) in the company are also received by the management from this system.  I mean ‚Äúprofit-loss‚Äù, ‚Äúmoney flow‚Äù, ‚Äúbalance sheet indicators‚Äù.  Monitoring these reports says that everything is OK with the implementation. <br><br>  At least these two requirements to be satisfied, and there will already be something to discuss (watch). <br>  And the introduction of the type ‚Äúwe have been muddy for half a year and fouled up the entering of orders‚Äù - this is of course a woufff, but we will leave it to discuss the ‚ÄúKulibins‚Äù among themselves in the smoking room. <br><br>  So who needs an open sorce ERP system in Russia? <br><br>  I think that they are needed by those who: <br>  - damn fond of experiments.  And preferably without risk to your own wallet.  For those who like to ‚Äústir up another one in order‚Äù, in order to later screw up something cool on some forum.  Or even put there a piece of source code with great pride.  It's wonderful when you ‚Äúsaw and cut down‚Äù something there, and you also get paid for it.  Checks something chef. <br><br>  - thinks that by implementing the open sorce ERP system, he will be very independent.  Can I ask then?  From whom independent?  From the manufacturer?  This is yes, I agree.  What about the dependence on ‚ÄúKulibin‚Äù, to whom this all may get annoyed at some point and he will decide to change his job? <br><br>  - thinks it's cheap.  For some reason, they do not consider it necessary to add to the cost of the project the salary of ‚ÄúKulibin‚Äù (or maybe not one), which you will always have to pay, regardless of whether it will do something or not. <br><br>  You can still talk a lot on this topic.  The best indicator is the real implementation.  Show me real implementations of such systems.  I will not ask for introductions that did not crumble with the dismissal of ‚ÄúKulibin‚Äù.  And so everything is clear. <br><br>  To understand why there are so few implementations of such systems in Russia, you just need to understand where they came from and for what reason.  All such systems are Western.  It's simple: in the west, classic ERP systems and their implementation are cosmically expensive.  So there was an alternative.  But in Russia, the situation is slightly different.  This is the first. <br><br>  Secondly.  The complexity of the accounting and workflow in the west compared to Russia is just a children's sandbox.  If you show the American businessman our invoice and tell him how the lines are split up on the CCD (after telling him what it is), tell him about all the difficulties with calculating the VAT, then show him the bargain-12, and to fix the nightmare then he will be horrified for a week after that night.  They are there just an order of magnitude easier. <br><br>  Therefore, the "finish" open source ERP system to the Russian realities - this is like the moon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136104/</a></p>
