We have been engaged in laptops for more than 10 years.  The backbone of the company over the years has been wonderfully preserved, we know the subject of our work well, we have seen and seen laptops not only from the side or from behind the counter, but also from the inside, and in parts, and in comparison ... <habracut>

      The first version of the site notik.ru appeared in 2002.  Since then, changes and develops, and with it the company as a whole.  Only in 2009 did the site become a full-fledged online store (cart, personal account, product comparison, etc.).  And despite this, all these years we have been innovators of the online trading of laptops.  The invented and created original structure for searching laptops by parameters was repeatedly ‚Äúcopied‚Äù on dozens of resources, we were the first to offer buyers a presentation of the commodity items of laptops with sorting ‚Äúby model‚Äù and few competitors still managed to implement something similar.  Disadvantages site compensated.  Instead of the generally accepted virtual services, the company focused its attention on services fundamental to trade.  (Availability of goods, logistics, advertising, etc.) <br><br>  The overwhelming number of online stores are trying to attract a buyer only with their price.  Many consider that, apart from the price of the buyer, nothing interests or should not interest.  We have always tried to take into account the interests of customers.  Want to see and touch, compare laptops "live" in Moscow?  Please ... So in 2006 our first retail store opened. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da6/075/c93/da6075c931d6f5a748217bf4792b0b36.jpg" alt="note shop"></div><br><br>  In 2010, we already have 5 points of sale.  Could there be more?  It could, but does not seem appropriate.  The number of sales is determined not only by the number of stores.  With the expansion of the range will increase the number of outlets. <br><br><h2>  Geography </h2><br>  In Moscow, we have already been chosen by more than 100,000 customers.  We very much hope in the next two years to dilute this number with buyers from other regions.  First of all, this concerns St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region. <br><br><h2>  Range </h2><br>  On average, over the past year, the range was at the level of 350 notebook models + netbooks. <br><br>  You may have seen a lot of store catalogs, in which the range reaches 500-800-1000 + models.  Here we must take into account one moment - AVAILABILITY.  We practically do not keep laptops on the site, which we do not have in stock.  If the model remains on the site, we expect it to arrive soon or it is there, but an order has already been issued for it and it is waiting for its buyer.  90% of laptops from the site can be seen in our stores. <br><br>  The range is constantly expanding.  In the near future we will begin to sell laptops Packard Bell. <br><br>  In terms of such a parameter as the ‚Äúassortment available‚Äù, we are <s>most likely the</s> absolute leader in Russia among all who sell laptops. <br><br>  Further expansion of the range will occur at the expense of all similar types of electronic devices with laptops.  These are nettops, monoblocks, tablets ... Monoblocks can already be found in our stores. <br><br><h2>  New site </h2><br>  In September 2009, we launched a new version of the site.  Take the vector of development of services for site visitors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/ede/b2e/f23edeb2efdd8ddf9ed55f17dc1a808a.jpg" alt="muzzle notik"></div><br><br><h2>  Services </h2><br>  In principle, we got to the main thing. <br>  This is actually what we are here for.  What we came here with. <br><br>  In our opinion, specialized portals cover the subject of laptops less than they should / would like to. <br>  We have plans not only to sell laptops, but also to become a source of interesting information for everyone who is somehow interested in it.  Information is diverse and impartial, although at times, of course, subjective.  We are already writing full reviews of laptops that we plan to post, including on Habr√©. <br><br>  We test all laptops that come to us.  <a href="http://www.notik.ru/benchmarks">Look at the benchmarks.</a> <br>  While this is not a very large set of tests, but on a very, very large number of models. <br><br>  There will be a service that will allow you, if you find it interesting, to test one or more laptops in a specific program or using an unusual method.  Whether it is a test in a game or a test in a program or a test of a single item of a laptop. <br><br>  In addition to the pivot table, we will make a certain "chart" of laptops. <br>  The basis of the chart will include statistical data not only on performance and other physical parameters of the laptop, but also on complaints, percentage of returns ... problems identified during presales.  The release is likely to be expected closer to the beginning of the new "season", i.e.  by September and the quarter back to school, but we will try to make it earlier. <br><br>  If interested, then we can launch the best-selling models by category and price niches now. <br><br>  By itself, the statistics of complaints will also be presented ... with comments of service and complaints. <br><br>  <i>What breaks most often.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What are the symptoms and what are the consequences.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Which series are the most reliable.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For what models the biggest return.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What a series of problem.</i> <br><br>  There will be an answer to these and many other questions. <br>  An example of a similar <a href="http://www.notik.ru/information/topic/319">article about laptop claims</a> . <br><br><h4>  We hope for a lively interest from the habr-community. </h4><br>  ... and satisfy this interest :) <br><br>  ps If you have questions - ask, answer. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84464/</a></p>
