The network provides round-the-clock transmission of real-time seismic data.  Separate points of this network are equipped with hardware complexes providing the transfer of not only seismic, but also various geophysical information and are additionally equipped with video cameras for monitoring volcanoes.

      One of the main segments of the wireless network is located in the districts of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and Avachinsky Gulf, the remote points of the network are located in the region of the pass between the Avachinsky and Koryaksky volcanoes, as well as on the Pacific coast - Nalychevo and Russkaya Bay.  All remote locations operate autonomously by using solar panels in tandem with batteries. <br><br>  An example of a video image transmitted by the complex equipment.  Volcano "Nameless". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8e/804/fa6/a8e804fa6a19c0cdbdbdf167ce811d64.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Weak information about the climatic conditions of this region: the absolute maximum temperature reaches + 34 ¬∞ , the absolute minimum from minus 24-26 ¬∞  on the islands to minus 49-60 ¬∞  in the north and in Central Kamchatka. <br>  The climate picture is complemented by winds.  In winter, they rush over Kamchatka from the north, in summer they change to southern ones, therefore the average annual wind speed is quite moderate: from 1.3 to 8.8 m / s.  In the winter season in the south of Kamchatka and on the Commander Islands wind speed reaches 40 m / s.  The amount of precipitation depends on cyclones, and the maximum precipitation in this case is 1100-2600 mm per year. </blockquote><br><br>  When implementing a wireless network project, the following technical requirements were imposed on the equipment: <br><ul><li>  minimum operating temperature of the device is -55 ¬∞ C </li><li>  wind resistance up to 200km / h </li><li>  the enclosure tightness of the radio router is as good as IP67 </li><li>  durability of the device, KPU and AFT to salt fog </li><li>  high output power of the radio transmitter and high sensitivity of the receiver </li><li>  high antenna gain and low feeder path loss </li><li>  mechanical resistance of body elements to damage (birds, animals, insects) </li><li>  lightning protection device </li><li>  operation of equipment in radio broadcasts actively used by other radio equipment </li><li>  stable operation of the equipment for a long time due to the inaccessibility of client points </li></ul><br><br>  The following diagram shows the overall wireless network topology: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef9/4cb/a94/ef94cba945205631b67489419189344c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The scheme includes several extended sections using the Rapier radio equipment: <br><ul><li>  Lighthouse Petropavlovsk - Nalychevo (51km) </li><li>  Petropavlovsk Lighthouse - Russkaya Bay (54km) </li><li>  IEC Tsunami - Petropavlovsk lighthouse (21km) </li><li>  IPC Tsunami - Avachinsky Volcano (24km) </li></ul><br><br>  The table presents the main parameters of the links: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/432/d2e/576/432d2e576945cc6ddc1fa37354ce5342.jpg"><br><br>  Two routes pass over the city (21km, 24km) and two above the water (54km, 51km). <br><br>  As a basis for building the network, the Rapier radio routers were selected both as separate <a href="http://www.nporapira.ru/catalogues/21/products/13">RS3-AP1-F5060-PTP</a> blocks and as radio routers combined with <a href="http://www.nporapira.ru/catalogues/21/products/21">RS3-AP1-F5060-PTP-TH</a> antenna (monoblocks), providing all the technical requirements . <br>  In the described topology, all radio links are configured in the "router" mode. <br>  Each remote point has a separate IP subnet at 8 addresses for connecting scientific equipment. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Consider the option of organizing a wireless connection on the example of the Mayak Petropavlovsky link - Russkaya Bay (54 km). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/311/19f/04d/31119f04dc2f8296e0ad2ced097feb14.jpg"><br><br>  The base station is installed on a stationary mast not far from the Petropavlovsk lighthouse. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/557/1df/79b/5571df79b82b657536bcddc8fccf62ea.jpg"><br><br>  Installation of a client data transfer station on a support structure made of pipes of various diameters, the coast of the Russkaya Bay. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efe/ca8/4cf/efeca84cf5c0cfd43c27f7a60cdb2b9e.jpg"><br><br>  A winter view of the same station from a different angle, a little further to see the shelter for a block of scientific equipment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08a/6cf/c8e/08a6cfc8e86b39bbf341eda870d2b16a.jpg"><br><br>  Planar antennas of the Mars Antennas <a href="http://www.nporapira.ru/catalogues/32/products/48">MA-WA55-30</a> company were chosen as antennas.  Taking into account the climatic conditions / wind loads, the antenna design had to be slightly modified, having strengthened the planar web along the perimeter with additional hardware. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Host structure: <br><br>  For the permanent functioning of the system it was necessary to provide: <br><br><ul><li>  mechanical resistance of the elements of the node to wind loads </li><li>  guaranteed autonomous power supply node </li></ul><br><br>  The first task was solved with the help of a standard set of fasteners for radio equipment; the planar antenna housing was additionally reinforced with hardware. <br><br>  The task of providing guaranteed power supply was solved according to the following scheme: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/079/efc/5cc/079efc5cc8b66e2e29328e06e070194a.jpg"><br><br>  The autonomous item included: <br><br><ul><li>  a block of 3 solar panels, with an output voltage of 24V and a maximum output power of 600W (model KGM195M-72) </li><li>  radio block based on Rapier radio routers with external antenna </li><li>  24V 350MH AGM battery packs based on 12 2Vx350Ah cans </li><li>  scientific instrument block </li><li>  battery charge control unit (manufactured by MorningStar) </li><li>  battery discharge control unit (manufactured by MorningStar) </li><li>  converter unit (DC / DC24-24 and DC / DC 24-12) </li></ul><br><br>  Solar panels provide recharging of the battery pack, the operation of which is controlled by the battery charge control unit. <br>  Stabilization and power supply of radio equipment and devices is provided by converter units. <br><br>  The use of solar panels and batteries with a large capacity allows you to charge the batteries during the day and provide power to the equipment at night.  For a guaranteed battery charge throughout the year, 3 solar panels are used. <br><br>  The battery pack is based on batteries with absorbed electrolyte and has the following characteristics: <br><br><ul><li>  the battery requires almost no maintenance </li><li>  battery design is sealed and valve-controlled, which prevents acid leakage and corrosion of the marks </li><li>  subject to the rules of charging the battery eliminates the emission of gases and the risk of explosion </li><li>  works at low temperatures </li><li>  vibration resistant design </li></ul><br><br>  The radio equipment of the Rapier RS3-AP1-F5060-PTP with the output power of 600 MW in tandem with the external antenna MA-WA55-30 is installed as radio equipment. <br><br>  The block of scientific equipment includes seismic recorders (accelerometer and velocimeter). <br><br>  Despite the limited availability, the network has been successfully operated for several years, starting in 2009.  It should be noted that most of the remote points are not easily accessible; some of the points can only be reached in summer or winter;  The point located in the Russkaya Bay is mainly accessible in the summer and only by helicopter. <br><hr><br><br>  We express our gratitude to the IT department of the CF GS GS RAS, in particular, the senior engineer of the department Artem Sumakov for help in preparing the material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167403/</a></p>
