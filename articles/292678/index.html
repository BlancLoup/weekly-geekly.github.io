      Headlines such as ‚Äú5 rules for successful advertising‚Äù are more suitable for articles than for educational videos.  The user is ready to spend on an average of 7‚Äì10 minutes to view one lecture, and 1‚Äì2 minutes to read an article.  Therefore, the topic for the course should be chosen more capacious.  It is good if the topic reflects the process and / or the result of training, for example: ‚ÄúFrom model aircraft to aircraft‚Äù, ‚ÄúCinderella's slipper: design of useful things‚Äù.  Ideally, the title should be no longer than 50 characters. <br><br>  <b>2. Duration of one lecture - 7‚Äì10 minutes</b> <br><br>  If your video course consists of several video clips, break them into semantic subtopics.  At the same time, the duration of one lecture completed within the meaning of the lecture should not exceed 15 minutes.  Ideally, it should be 7-10 minutes, including a small screen saver for 5-10 seconds.  Each sub-topic should be self-contained in content; it is also convenient because within the framework of your course's promo you can post individual lectures in open access. <br><br>  <b>3. Imagine you are shooting a video</b> <br><br>  No, I, of course, do not urge to take the microphone in my hands and put two backing vocalists (although I am sure that such a course will not go unnoticed), just in the age of increasing information, the brain is forced to erect barriers, which led to the appearance of ‚Äúclip perception‚Äù as main form of information consumption.  It is easier for the modern consumer of e-learning to perceive cutting from separate bright images, rather than fundamental reasoning.  Of course, in such a presentation of information there are drawbacks: the concentration and the ability to analyze are reduced.  At the same time, one of the advantages is the development of multitasking (viewing a lecture, chatting, performing tests), which must be taken into account and used. <br><br>  <b>4. Beginners choose ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù courses.</b> <br><br>  The course description should contain the following information: name, launch date (if the start of the course is tied to a specific date), duration and / or daily workload, information about the course author, a summary (preferably a description of each specific lecture / module), the target audience of the course, minimum requirements for students (do not be afraid to set them, as many users prefer courses for ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù, even if their level of knowledge on this topic is minimal), the result of training on the course, user feedback  second, if the course is repeated, reviews (if available). <br><br>  <b>5. The picture is no less important than the content.</b> <br><br>  Even if your course is a ‚Äútalking head‚Äù against the background of a pale wall, no one bothers you to pour it into a beautiful pattern, make a headband at the beginning and end of each lecture, and impose background music.  Now there are lots of tools that even a user who is far from video production can easily handle.  You can dilute the video sequence with slides from the presentation or simple infographics.  Audio-visual perception contributes to the selection in the media text of semantic, figurative relationships between units of audiovisual narration.  It should be remembered that someone will use your material as a podcast, so the main semantic part should be voiced by the author. <br><br>  <b>6. Use elements of gamification</b> <br><br>  The simplest variant of gamification is the inclusion of tests in the video course.  They can also be in the format of flash games.  In addition, all sorts of ratings and points awarded to students in the course of courses also contribute to more motivated learning. <br><br>  <b>7. Encourage users to chat</b> <br><br>  Practice shows that the stronger the communication between users, the more students will reach the end of the course.  The task of the author is to encourage user interaction online.  One of the basic ways is to tie a chat to the video course, where students will be able to share experiences and help each other.  A lecturer can also communicate with his virtual group.  The MEP format also uses the method of checking the users' homework of other users, when each student must check and evaluate the homework of three / five other students.  One more plus of such collective work is the best memorization of information. <br><br>  <b>8. Encourage your students.</b> <br><br>  Paradoxically, but only about 40% of students take a course in order to obtain new knowledge.  The rest are divided into those who pass the course ‚Äúfor the company‚Äù or for obtaining a diploma.  Even after the end of the course, you will send an electronic certificate of the name of yourself to users' emails - this is an additional plus for choosing your course.  By the way, this certificate can be of quite appreciable value, providing, for example, a discount / bonus for the next infoproduct with you or on partner resources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292678/</a></p>
