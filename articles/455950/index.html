Part II</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, for Habr readers, I conducted a small <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452186/">study</a> of programming languages, such as Rust, Dart, Erlang, to find out how rare they are in the Russian IT market. <br><br>  In response to my research, more comments and questions about other languages ‚Äã‚Äãfell.  I decided to collect all your comments and conduct another analysis. <br><br>  The study includes languages: Forth, Ceylon, Scala, Perl, Cobol, as well as some other languages.  In general, I analyzed 10 programming languages.

      To make it convenient for you to perceive information, I conditionally divided the languages ‚Äã‚Äãinto two groups: rare (there is no demand and low supply) and popular (the language is in demand on the Russian IT market). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The basis of my analysis, as well as last time, included data taken from the Headhunter portal, from the social network LinkedIn, and also the personal statistics of my agency.  For a more accurate analysis of rare languages, I used the Amazing Hiring service. <br><br>  For those who do not know what is Amazing Hiring - I tell.  This is a special service that ‚Äúparsit‚Äù all the information about specialists from all over the Internet.  With it, you can find out how many specialists indicate a particular language in skills. <br><br>  <i>Let's start with popular programming languages.</i> <br><br><h2>  Popular languages </h2><br><h3>  Verilog, VHDL </h3><br>  These main hardware description languages ‚Äã‚Äãare quite popular on the Russian IT market.  1870 experts pointed to Headhunter that they know Verilog.  The VHDL request will drop 1159 resumes.  613 specialists write in both languages.  In the title of the summary knowledge of VHDL / Verilog was carried out by two developers.  Verilog is known separately as the main one - 19 developers, VHDL - 23. <br><br>  68 companies are offering job to developers who know VHDL, and 85 are from Verilog. Of these, 56 are vacancies. There are 74 vacancies posted on LinkedIn. <br><br>  Interestingly, languages ‚Äã‚Äãare popular among young professionals aged 18 to 30 years. <br><br>  Since VHDL and Verilog often go together, I show an approximate ratio of the number of summaries to the number of vacancies on the example of the VHDL language.  For clarity, I singled out separately the developers who indicated knowledge of VHDL in the title of the resume, which can be seen in the figure: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/967/004/18d/96700418d313f709c24e0f660c689c34.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>The image shows the ratio of the number of vacancies to the number of published resumes.</i>  <i>The developers of the VHDL hardware description are marked in red.</i> <br><br><h3>  Scala </h3><br>  Perhaps one of the most popular and sought-after languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom the list.  The language fell into all sorts of ratings <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stackoverflow</a> .  It occupies the 18th line in the list of the most popular languages.  It is also one of the favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãamong developers, ranking 12th and, moreover, Stackoverflow ranked Scala among the most expensive programming languages.  The language is located immediately behind the Erlang programming language, occupying the 8th position.  The average world salary for a Scala developer is $ 67,000.  Most Scala developers get paid in the USA. <br><br>  At Headhunter, 166 specialists carried Scala knowledge into the title of the resume.  Total posted on Headhunter 1392 resumes.  This language is very popular among young professionals.  Scala usually goes alongside Java.  Linkedin has 2593 resumes, of which 199 are Scala developers themselves. <br><br>  If we talk about demand, that's all over well.  Active vacancies on Headhunter - 515, of which 80 Scala is indicated in the title of the vacancy.  LinkedIn is looking for 36 companies directly to Scala developers.  In total, 283 companies offer jobs for children who know Scala. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7e/b9e/5fa/d7eb9e5fa393d3c2b8a6f99f2cb2c36c.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>The image shows the ratio of the number of vacancies to the number of published resumes.</i>  <i>Scala developers are directly marked in red.</i> <br><br>  In addition to the fact that Scala developers are in demand in the Russian market, they receive a high salary.  As the statistics of my agency shows, Scala developers are more expensive than Java developers.  Now we are just looking for a Scala developer for one Moscow company.  The average salary offered by employers to middle + level specialists starts from 250 thousand rubles. <br><br><h3>  Perl </h3><br>  Perl was the ‚Äúmost frequent‚Äù on my list of rare languages.  More than 11,000 IT professionals indicated Perl's knowledge of key skills, 319 of them included knowledge of the language in the title of the resume.  On LinkedIn, I found 6585 professionals who know Perl.  Active vacancies on Headhunter - 569, on LinkedIn - 356. <br><br>  There are fewer developers who made Perl knowledge of the title of the resume than there were published vacancies.  Perl is not just a popular language, it also applies to popular in the market.  Here is the statistics: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47a/76e/5e6/47a76e5e69b7b970c86e8d4db839f2cb.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">Stackoverflow</a> statistics show that Perl is one of the most expensive programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(world average - $ 69,000) and one of the most popular in the world.  More than 4% of developers own Perl. <br><br>  Despite the high prevalence of the language, Perl offers IT projects that have long been on the market for developers.  Over the past three years, my agency has never received a request to search for Perl developer in a new IT project or startup. <br><br><h2>  Statistics: </h2><br>  If you compare the demand for all popular programming languages, you get something like this: the most popular language used is Perl.  There are a total of 925 job offers for Perl-aware HeadHunter and LinkedIn.  Scala is not far behind Perl.  On portals hanging 798 sentences. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc7/044/2d6/cc70442d6f88f3912d0f1c783ab54d72.png" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b4/a9a/89f/8b4a9a89f0abb506c8afe7f680ddafe9.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>The presented diagrams show the number of published vacancies for programming languages: VHDL, Scala, Perl.</i> <br><br><h2>  Rare programming languages </h2><br><h3>  Fororth </h3><br>  The programming language Forth appeared in the 70s.  Now in the Russian market is not in demand.  There are no vacancies on Headhunter or LinkedIn.  The summary indicated the knowledge of the language of 166 specialists on Headhunter and 25 on LinkedIn. <br><br>  The absolute majority of applicants have experience of more than 6 years.  Salary specialists with the knowledge of Forth request the most diverse from 20 thousand rubles and up to 500 thousand rubles. <br><br><h3>  Cobol </h3><br>  One of the oldest programming languages.  Most of the developers are representatives of the older age group (over 50 years old) with an impressive work experience.  This also confirms the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">latest Stackoverflow</a> rating, which mentions that the most experienced programmers write in Cobol and Perl. <br><br>  I found a total of 362 Headhunter resumes and 108 LinkedIn resumes.  They brought in the title of the resume knowledge of Cobol 13 experts.  As in the case of Forth, work for those who know Cobol is not currently offered.  On LinkedIn, there was only one vacancy for Cobol developers directly. <br><br><h3>  Rexx </h3><br>  Developed by IBM and peaking in the distant 90s, Rexx today turned out to be one of the rarest languages ‚Äã‚Äãon my list. <br>  186 developers indicated Headhunter knowledge of Rexx and 114 on LinkedIn in their summaries.  However, on none of the portals I could not find a job for those who know Rexx. <br><br><h3>  Tcl </h3><br>  There is a demand for a language, but I would not attribute the language to the sought-after ones.  There are 33 vacancies on Headhunter and 11 on LinkedIn.  The salary is offered to the guys with the knowledge of ‚ÄúTikl‚Äù not very high: from 65 thousand rubles to 150 thousand. They indicated that they know the language, 379 developers on Headhunter and 465 on Linkedin.  In the title of the summary ownership of Tcl made only one developer. <br><br>  This is how the ratio of the number of vacancies to the number of resumes in which the skill of Tcl is encountered looks: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/143/333/d2e/143333d2ed69766a01c3a325e2661f94.png" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Clarion </h3><br>  I have not met a single active job that requires knowledge of Clarion.  However, the proposal is.  162 people indicated on LinkedIn that they know this language, and Headhunter 502 specialists, of whom three learned the skill in the title of the resume.  Amazing Hiring found 158 specialists who are somehow familiar with the Clarion language. <br><br><h3>  Ceylon </h3><br>  Developed by Red Hat in 2011.  Based on Java.  Hence the name of the language: the island of Java is known as a supplier of coffee, and the island of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, is a global supplier of tea. <br><br>  The language is really the rarest.  There are no vacancies and almost no resume.  At the Headhunter managed to find just one resume.  The Amazing Hiring service issues only 37 specialists throughout Russia. <br><br><h2>  Statistics: </h2><br>  If you compare all the rare languages ‚Äã‚Äãby the number of summaries, you‚Äôll get interesting statistics: LinkedIn most of the experts indicated knowledge of Tcl, and Headhunter Clarion was the most popular language on the list.  The least popular language among developers was Cobol. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c47/548/231/c475482315502170784b33f58f066b14.png" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/113/f13/0bd/113f130bdf14edf866267e45cb678bf2.png" alt="image"></div><br>  My small analysis showed that Ceylon turned out to be a really rare language, there is no demand or offers on the Russian IT market.  Also among the rare languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude Forth, Cobol, Clarion, Rexx.  Perl and Scala turned out to be very popular and popular languages.  They can be safely removed from the list of rare programming languages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455950/</a></p>
