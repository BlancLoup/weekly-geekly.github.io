  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The introduction of PR: a scandal in the American blogosphere</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The authors of the blog <a href="http://walmartingacrossamerica.com/">Wal-Marting Across America</a> , spouses Laura and Jim, went on a journey across America - from Las Vegas to Georgia.  At the same time, they stayed for the night exclusively in the parking lots of the Wal-Mart supermarket chain, where parking is even free for sleeping trailers.  The virtual journey began on September 27, 2006. It was on this day that the first blog entry was published.  Now, when a <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/Walmarting%2BAcross%2BAmerica">real scandal has erupted</a> in the blogosphere, all previous entries have been erased from the site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Laura almost every day published new photos and impressions about her journey, which was thoroughly imbued with optimism.  Every employee of the Wal-Mart supermarket, whom they met on their way, from a regular clerk to a nice manager, was absolutely satisfied with his work and eternally grateful to his beloved employer. <br><br>  This is an important detail, because in fact, as many Americans know, Wal-Mart employees receive low wages (about $ 10 per hour, almost like at McDonalds) and do not treat their employer very well.  Such an implausible description of supermarket employees immediately caused suspicion among readers of the blog - wasn‚Äôt it an advertisement?  Too similar to publicity on the part of Wal-Mart.  Perhaps Laura and Jim are virtual personalities, and all blog entries are published at Wal-Mart headquarters. <br><br>  A few days later, the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/oct2006/db20061009_579137.htm">facts floated out</a> .  It turned out that Laura and Jim are real Americans, 58 and 42 years old.  True, they are not spouses, but live together.  Jim is a professional photographer, and Laura is a freelance writer.

      Laura says that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtraveling around America with free parking in Wal-Mart supermarkets came to them in the winter.  Six months later, they turned to the organization <a href="http://forwalmart.com/">Working Families for Wal-Mart</a> , who were happy to financially support travelers. <br><br>  The fact is that Working Families for Wal-Mart is a special organization created in December 2005 by Edelman, which is engaged in public relations with Wal-Mart.  Its goal is ‚Äúwhite PR‚Äù and the fight against the negative image of Wal-Mart.  The PR people covered all the travel expenses of Laura and Jim, and also changed their route to make it more interesting.  The fact of sponsorship while hiding from readers of the blog.  Only now, after the scandal, the logo of patrons of art appeared on the site. <br><br>  How can you assess this situation?  In fact, Laura and Jim traveled to order.  We can say that they deceived their readers, seeming to be not who they really are.  On the other hand, any blog can have a sponsor and advertiser - there is nothing reprehensible in this. <br><br>  Probably, for a moral assessment of the act of Laura and Jim, you need to know whether they wrote the truth in their blog or not.  Did they sincerely express their thoughts or tried to please the sponsor?  In general, these are the same problems that have long been known in professional journalism.  Now these problems have reached blogs. <br><br>  This story is very revealing.  She clearly demonstrates that advanced PR people have begun to use the blogosphere for their own purposes.  It is possible that very soon such methods of public relations will be considered in the order of things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4544/</a></p>
