And I had a desire to shout about this information resource and its contents!  So much useful information is in vain! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec7/262/5db/ec72625dbc801c3a065aa0b95ee058ca.png" alt="Picture 2"><br>  I am not an Intel employee, but I actively participate in the life of the ISN community.  The community unites both Intel programmers and us, mere mortals.  Anyone can become a member of the ISN, having passed a simple registration.  However, for acquaintance with blogs, articles and other materials, registration is not required.  They are open and anyone can meet them. <br><br>  You will think: "Anyone can read the articles, I, too, an achievement!".  Well, of course not an achievement, but as a programmer it's a pleasant thing.  Here, try to read articles on the site AMD.  Open the page <a href="http://developer.amd.com/documentation/articles/Pages/default.aspx">http://developer.amd.com/documentation/articles/Pages/default.aspx</a> .  And now we try, for example, to go to the section " <a href="http://ad.amddevcentral.com/archive/documents-articles/articles/Pages/default.aspx">See archived 64-bit Computing articles</a> ".  "FigVam" is called, none of my password is suitable.  Same with " <a href="http://ad.amddevcentral.com/archive/documents-articles/articles/Pages/default.aspx">See archived Parallel Programming</a> " and so on. <br><br>  Site navigation is best to start from the main page <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/">http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/</a> .  If you get to the site for the first time, it is reasonable to delve into the sections "Blogs", "Forums", "Tools", which are accessible from the main page.  If you regularly visit the site, then on the main page you can immediately get acquainted with a list of fresh articles, blog entries and news.  In general, the developers of the Russian-language version of the site very successfully implemented the main page, collecting all the links to the main sections, but did not overload it with excesses.

      Sections that the ISN contains: <br><br>  1. Articles of Russian and foreign authors on programming, code optimization, searching for errors, using various tools.  Articles of foreign authors, respectively, translated into Russian.  For articles, as well as for many other materials, you can leave your comments and even enter into a discussion with the author.  Here are a few article titles for example: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-parallel-composer/">Intel Parallel Composer - extension for debugging parallel programs</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/multicore-enabling-the-n-queens-problem-using-cilk/">Solution of the problem N queens on Cilk ++</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/visualizing-floats/">Visually about floating point numbers</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/intel-parallel-inspector-secrets/">Secrets of using Intel Parallel Inspector to find threading errors</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/potential_opportunities_of_cache_optimizations/">A tool for finding potential cache optimizations</a> </li></ul><br>  There are not only technical articles, but also articles about Intel‚Äôs life and members of the ISN community: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/contests-list">ISN contests for software developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/email-the-intel-software-network-support-team">Email Intel Software Network Support</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/mtl_articles_about_projects">Manycore Testing Lab - member projects</a> </li></ul><br>  2. Blogs.  As far as I know, blogs are maintained only by Russian ISN members and entries are not translated from other languages.  I am sure that the blog section benefits from this.  I will explain my opinion.  The blogs often present humor and jargon.  And when translating to save these components is extremely difficult and interesting live text turns into a strange article, incomprehensible to the reader.  Naturally, Russians see the humor of Russian authors as completely understandable and you can safely read blogs without fear of meeting something obscure.  Here are some sample entries: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/02/24/2003198/">I am younger and again live in the USSR 90s?</a>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/02/24/2003198/">(Postfestive nonsense)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/02/18/2003109/">Reminder for 1000 cu</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/02/17/vs2008/">Installing VS2008 custom components</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/02/15/2003084/">Programmatic sex change</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/01/28/rise-of-flight/">Rise of Flight, or Goodbye Piracy!</a> </li></ul><br>  3. Forums.  On the ISN forums I can notice one important detail.  Although they are (for the time being) an order of magnitude less popular than, say, RSDN.ru, they do have Intel employees.  And this can be a significant help in resolving some issues.  Here are some examples of forums: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/82/">Software for mobile systems</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/90/">Graphics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/95/">Parallel programming</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/64-bit-programming/">64-bit application development</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/forums/85/">Academic Community Forum</a> </li></ul><br>  4. <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/author/vilianov/">Sergey Vilyanov</a> maintains his column in the ISN.  Perhaps you already know his name.  At one time he was the editor-in-chief of Computerra-Online (Computerra.Ru).  He is now a leading analyst at <a href="http://3dnews.ru/">3DNews.Ru</a> .  His column is on the title page of the ISN and you can regularly see fresh notes with a considerable amount of humor in it. <br><br>  Of course, not all that you find on the ISN website is listed.  It regularly publishes information on various contests held by Intel, provides a description in Russian of various tools, laid out presentations, webinars, and much, much more. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d20/caf/f93/d20caff93341906ead16bcfabc34d431.png" alt="Picture 3"><br>  The soul of the Russian software development community at ISN is <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/profile/19920/">Dmitry Oganezov</a> .  It is he who heads the support and development of the Russian part of ISN.  At the same time, he is not an abstract leader, but a living person who is easily accessible for communication.  This I declare on the basis of personal experience.  With him you can easily discuss any questions, ask for help in publishing materials and get it.  So, joining ISN you can be sure that you can always get real support from people, and not encounter the soulless mechanisms of the site, as unfortunately often happens. <br><br>  Yes, the most important thing.  ISN is not a closed, so to speak ‚Äúread-only‚Äù community, but an open one.  You can keep your blog here, publish articles, discuss issues with developers from Intel and just with specialists from other companies and your colleagues. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aae/6f5/57e/aae6f557e65323932b9a7214d3c34835.png" alt="Picture 4"><br>  The ISN has its own counterpart of karma.  Here it is called "status points."  Depending on the number of points, participants are divided into how many ranks, each of which corresponds to a <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/blackbelt/">belt of a</a> certain color.  There are green, brown, blue and black belts.  Participants who have reached the highest level become the owners of the black belt, are placed in the hall of fame and are awarded a high-performance laptop from Intel. <br><br>  Once again, I invite you to the <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/">ISN</a> website and not just as observers, but as participants and authors!  Isn waiting for everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104641/</a></p>
