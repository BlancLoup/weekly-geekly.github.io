Speed ​​up the loading and reaction of Windows and programs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When the computer with the entire set of programs in autoload started loading for 4 minutes, I thought about speeding it all up. <br>  I had Windows XP and the Aster extension, which allows you to work at a computer together, so some of the programs and services were loaded in duplicate. <br><br>  Once I had a third hard drive and there was enough space to redistribute partitions on the hard drives into a more convenient option, and I decided that you can prepare the first three partitions on different hard drives and scatter system folders on them. <br><br><h5>  Acceleration method for Windows XP with three hard drives: </h5><br>  1. Transfer the “Documents and Settings” and “Program Files” folders to the first partitions of other hard drives.  Thus, on the boot disk from the main folders, we only have the “Windows” folder. <br>  2. Create on the disk with “Windows” file system links (junction-link) to the transferred folders.  More will be below.

      It turns out that the folders "Windows", "Documents and Settings" and "Program Files" are on different hard drives. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Advantages: </h6><ul><li>  Independent work with these folders, which greatly affects the download speed. <br>  For example, without changing the list of software, I reduced the download speed of my computer twice from 4 to 2 minutes. </li><li>  Such an effect as redrawing icons on the desktop, I think familiar to all users of Windows XP, has disappeared almost completely.  Those.  this either does not occur, or it is not noticeable. </li><li>  The system after the start also begins to react to your actions much faster. </li><li>  You can simultaneously or selectively do defragmentation of these sections. </li><li>  The Windows and Program Files folders usually fragment the disk much less, so they will rarely need to be defragmented.  The result is the same - great speed. </li><li>  You can simultaneously or selectively do a virus scan of linked partition folders. </li><li>  It's easy to get the sizes of the “Documents and Settings” and “Program Files” folders - just subtract the amount of free disk space from the size of the disk. </li></ul><br><h6>  Disadvantages: </h6><ul><li>  Not all antiviruses work correctly. <br><br>  Only Kaspersky 2010 detected an attempt to install it into a link folder and forbade it.  After which he was put directly on the C drive and worked correctly.  This was the version that finally changed my negative attitude to the Kaspersky Lab product.  Because besides the correct work in this situation, I finally saw that their product began to work quickly and well.  Up to blocking phishing links coming through ICQ. <br><br>  The rest were put in the linked “Program Files” and something did not work correctly.  For example, Eset and Drweb did not start services. <br><br>  It was impossible to work with Eset at all, he “hung” the system even if it was installed directly on the Windows disk.  Those.  it works out file system links very badly. <br><br>  Drweb is a little better.  After installing it on the C drive, it functioned relatively correctly, but its interface, in my opinion, is not very friendly and convenient, so it did not last long. <br><br>  Comodo did not work correctly when installing it into the “Program Files” link, but after installing it on a Windows disk it works quite correctly. <br><br>  Those.  In this configuration, you can use Kaspersky and Komodo antiviruses.  I did not check others.  I used the Eset product for several years, now I still have Comodo. <br><br></li><li>  There is no way to simply turn off one of the hard drives.  Now they are a bunch and work in a group.  Although I found out that if you physically disconnect disks with the folders “Documents and Settings” and “Program Files”, then Windows “loads” normally and allows you to work. </li></ul><br>  I shoveled my Windows XP last summer, for 6 months of using it in this configuration, there was nothing special about antivirus problems. <br><br><h5>  How to do it all for Windows XP </h5><br>  <b>Be careful and understand that the consequences of your actions may be the loss of important information.</b>  <b>So before you take it, consider whether you can handle it.</b> <br><ul><li>  Prepare partitions (preferably at the beginning of the disk) on the hard drives. </li><li>  Download the command line utility <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/sysinternals/bb896768">Junction</a> from Mark Russinovich. </li><li>  Boot from an external system such as WindowsPE, ERD Commander, or another Windows installation. </li><li>  Move the “Documents and Settings” and “Program Files” folders to the necessary sections.  And the names of the folders in these sections can be any. </li><li>  Start the console (cmd), go to the folder with Junction and perform something like: </li></ul><br>  I linked the “Program Files” folder to the “WinXP Program Files”, because now I have Windows 7 x64 in parallel, which I switched to in the new year.  For three factors coincided - it became 4 Gigabytes of RAM, Aster earned with Windows 7 x64 and a new year arrived. <br><br><h5>  How to do it all for Windows Vista and Windows 7 </h5><br>  Similarly, with the exception of some features. <br><br>  With Windows 7, I did the same trick, linking the “Program Files” and “Program Files (x68)” folders to another section. <br><br>  But with the folder “Users” I have not done this yet, because it is full of links to its internal folders and there is a link “Documents and Settings” on it.  Later I will consider the option of transferring the “Users” folder, possibly using a script, so that you do not have to manually recreate a lot of links. <br>  And it is also desirable to transfer the “ProgramData” folder. <br><br>  In Windows 7, it was not possible to simply delete the “Program Files” and “Program Files (x86)” folders.  Therefore, after copying to a new section, on the old one, I first renamed them, so as not to interfere with creating links. <br>  Then he created links and loaded into the working system. <br>  After that, in the folder properties, I changed the owner, making him my account.  This allowed me to delete almost all files.  The remaining files can be renamed and after rebooting they can be deleted. <br><br>  This recipe is for those who know * nix, something completely natural, but despite this, I did not hear that it was used in Windows systems until I decided to do it myself.  The search showed that some people also try to do this, but the messages are very rare and from foreign forums. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1</b> : Aster for XP does not allow to use sleep or standby. <br>  <b>UPD 2</b> : I haven't used the swap file for a long time.  And the transfer of folders TEMP does not apply to this article, because you can transfer simply by changing the settings of Windows. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111769/</a></p>
