      Yandex <s>sucks</s> much inferior to Google usability (also see above).  Why?  First of all, because, opening the services, Yandex, none of them brought to the state of "best in class."  We will understand in turn: <br><br>  <b>Search</b>  What I do not like?  Let's try to find a giraffe <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25E6%25E8%25F0%25E0%25F4">in Yandex</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26safe%3Doff%26q%3D%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26lr%3D">Google</a> .  Taking into account that Yandex has found anything but a giraffe.  Now let's get to Lynch!  In no particular order: first, stupid numbers of results.  Taking away a solid part of the screen from me, a former user, they absolutely do not give anything in return.  <i>Why</i> do I <i>need</i> to know that this result is the 14th, and this one is the 18th?  And this informational garbage is laid out in such a way as to be evident in every possible way and take attention away.  Once again: <i>why</i> ?  Next: a bunch of ads on the right and above.  And this is on request "giraffe"!  (here is a very correct <a href="http://mihalich.habrahabr.ru/blog/12415.html">comment</a> on this, by the way).  Image search results are hidden under this pile of ads.  Also pay attention to the standard Yandex footer: ‚ÄúRequests per month‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuy this word‚Äù - as much as you can!  Even in the footer: it is proposed to go to the mysterious page <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3F%26q%3D552960440%26p%3D8%26text%3D%25E6%25E8%25F0%25E0%25F4">"..."</a> . <br><br>  <b>An idea with navigation through Ctrl</b> .  I don‚Äôt know who invented this, maybe the brilliant Lebedev Studio (or even the Greatest Designer?).  Again: <i>why</i> ?  For example, I (I think that not only me) use only the mouse for navigation, the keyboard - only the address to enter.  Why now wherever possible, shove this miracle?  Yes, not so much space takes, but again - this is noise!  A little here, a little there - it turns out hell knows what. <br><br>  <b>News</b>  It's a quiet um ... well, you understand.  (Those on the <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">main page</a> are completely nothing, I'm talking about <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/">these</a> ).  You can again compare: this is what's new in the life of giraffes <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Frpt%3Dnnews%26grhow%3Dclutop%26text%3D%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584">according to Yandex</a> .  (I can‚Äôt refer to Google, because the link leads <a href="http://news.google.ru/nwshp%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584">here</a> , so, who cares, enter "giraffe" <a href="http://news.google.ru/">here</a> ).  Again, close our eyes to the relevance of the results.  What do I see in Yandex?  First, the left column is useless in this case (almost 20% of my screen).  Clicking on the "Accidents", I do not know about incidents with giraffes, of course.  The right column is even worse: almost 25% (!) Of my screen is occupied by <s>idiotic</s> useless links that would easily fit on one line at the bottom of the page.  Well, the main disadvantage: <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/">news.yandex.ru is</a> absolutely impossible to use as a "Tape", and <a href="http://news.google.ru/">news.google.ru</a> - more than. <br><br>  <b>Maps</b> .  First of all, Yandex loses a lot just technically, of course.  No panoramic photos or satellite images of the entire planet - you can continue for a long time.  Google‚Äôs cards are just sweet.  But let's move on to &lt;a href= pasta.yandex.ru&gt; UI.  Again: what do I see useful in the right column?  The weather  I went to see the map, they tell me the weather.  Yes, it may be useful, but give a quarter of the screen to it?  Let's try to move the map with the mouse.  This is the last century - why does it only load when I release the mouse?  Let's go to the search on the map.  Since neither Google nor Yandex can find giraffes, we will look for a ‚Äúcafe‚Äù: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3aws9g">in Yandex</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/35u2o2">in Google</a> .  Yes, while the Russian Google finds little (compare with <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3xwpnf">pizza NY</a> ).  It is the matter of time.  But pay attention to the visualization of the results: Yandex offers me just a list of addresses (in what interesting way is it sorted?)!  And how can I find a cafe near work?  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2vete8">"VO cafe"</a> does not give anything at all. Update: see also <a href="http://pgregory.habrahabr.ru/blog/13843.html">this comment</a> . <br><br>  <b>Mail</b> .  This is one of the few services of Yandex that I like externally.  (I'm talking about the <a href="http://mail.ya.ru/">new mail</a> with the ‚ÄúRevolutionary" interface).  Indeed, pretty done.  But usability!  Why is the number of letters in the discussion written <i>after the date</i> ?  When I look through the list, I glance over the headlines, not <i>somewhere else</i> .  In Google, this is simple and natural: the number of letters in the title of the discussion in brackets.  Next: tags.  Why do they consist of two letters?  What label should I make ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù: pink ‚Äúli‚Äù?  And how about ‚Äúpython‚Äù and ‚Äúpirates‚Äù?  By the way, the window for creating these labels (and not only it) is incorrectly displayed in firefox.  This, sorry, moveton.  Okay Opera, but FF!  After all, mail is not the first month of work, and such bugs!  Next: in the "addressees", selecting several contacts and clicking "write", I see, oh, a miracle, a pristine letter!  Why are these people not in the addressees ?!  (On this occasion, I even wrote a letter, but the creators do not care about such trifles).  Let's see what spam.  I see spam.  I want to remove it.  I select all letters, click on "delete".  First I see a confirmation request: do I really want to <u>move spam to remote</u> ?  (Very useful interface feature: confirmation for reversible actions, yes?).  After that, my spam is in the "deleted" folder.  We go there, choose everything again, confirm once again ... But is it possible?  Have you guys ever used your mail?  Or <a href="http://gmail.com/">Gmail</a> seen?  There is a simple ‚ÄúDelete all spam‚Äù link. <br><br>  I can not compare further, just tired.  Where are such rave <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/feedbacks/">reviews about Yandex</a> on Habr√©?  Yes, something is done well, <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">‚ÄúBlog Search,‚Äù</a> for example.  Maybe something else.  But what is happening with key services!  Comrades from Yandex, where are you looking for giraffes?  And what mail do you use?  Is what I wrote about, I see one?  Is the difference in approaches not striking: Yandex - ‚Äúit is stressed by the user-friend, that's how I look all convenient from myself‚Äù, and Google - ‚Äúthat's what you wanted;  I hope you did not notice that I even have an interface? ‚Äù <br><br>  In conclusion, once again, I'm sorry if someone was hurt by a harsh tone.  Just boiling already.  I really want Russia to be proud of anything other than natural resources.  I really want Russia to be proud of Yandex, for example.  I believe that a lot of really smart people work there.  But with such an approach, this (I mean pride), alas, is impossible.  It is impossible, having borrowed most of the market in Runet, to rest on our laurels.  Do not think about money and endless advertising - think about those who are looking for elephants and giraffes!  Use your own products, and bring them to a state where it is pleasant to work with them!  You have a huge credit of trust from the Russians - do not lose it! <br><br>  Strive to be the best in everything! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9344/</a></p>
