At all.  Previously, there were three of them in the house, and then somehow it turned out that he sold everything and, according to the law of meanness, an urgent need was a mobile device for working from a workplace from a distance. <br><br>  I have long been staring at the tablets, stuck in the keyboard dock.  I thought it was a great idea.  Sometimes I just need to work on the keyboard, because  I have to write quite voluminous texts, but I really like tablets, especially in the subway - to play, to read books.  I read reviews, I thought to come in to touch, but there was no time. <br><br>  Therefore, when the roasted rooster pecked, I quickly ran through the Internet, read five recent reviews and decided to order Asus Transformer Infinity with this dock.  Issue price - 31500r, plus 500r.  for urgent delivery.  At the time of purchase it was exactly 950 US dollars.  What came of it?  Nothing good.  Read on.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, let's start with. <br><br><h5>  operating system </h5><br><br>  Out of the box, I got the 4th android, thoroughly made out by the manufacturer.  The darkness of some kind of left software, changed icons, etc.  But most of all I was outraged by the fact that he lags.  No, not so - LAGA. <br>  I was just at a loss.  How so, I thought.  This is a mega-tricked Tegra3!  Everything must fly here!  But no.  Lags, and how.  Therefore, I went to xda-developers and downloaded the first firmware on JB.  It is based on the base one, but all the trash that Asus crammed out of it was used, and little things like root were added, some video patches and stuff like that.  It seems to let go.  At least, now at least turning the pages in the reader happens without lags. <br><br>  Wi-Fi.  It slows down so that it really seems to me that it is locked to the standard a / b.  See rip thicker than 1.4GB is simply unrealistic via Wi-Fi, because it does not have time.  And to write it inside is also impossible, because FAT.  Charming, what else to say! <br><br>  The Asus screen keyboard is something non-transferable.  I saw such artistic misery only in Chinese Yon-TVs about three years ago. <br><br>  The photos on the left are Asus, and on the right is the standard Android keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2b/07d/dfe/f2b07ddfe4a215085335ef29e1e704f0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/514/da2/29d/514da229d4467c493a90762fff52f034.jpg"><br><br>  Though kill, I do not understand why it was repainted.  Well, okay, the fourth row with numbers - approx.  But typography and inverted colors are made as if for old people. <br>  In this case, in a horizontal position, the keyboard is flattened to accommodate the fourth row of buttons, which makes it extremely inconvenient to use. <br><br><h5>  Exterior </h5><br><br>  Again, I ordered the tablet in the ‚Äútrain has already given the third dial tone‚Äù condition, so I had to rely on reviews from the network.  When the tablet was brought, I just opened it, checked that the glass was whole, the screen was not exposed, the android was loading, I didn‚Äôt find any obvious jambs and left the contents of the box in my backpack. <br><br>  Flog, we will start immediately on the ass.  Literally. <br>  See the illustration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/781/9a4/755/7819a4755905d9c98634b46628199789.jpg"><br><br>  On the bottom of the tablet, we see three huge holes.  Extreme holes for dock hooks, medium - dock connector. <br>  I can not say that something is heavily clogged in them, because  my bag is clean enough.  But aesthetically, these holes look like ... I don't even know.  They look as if the engineer was too lazy to think, or the engineer‚Äôs head is a stupid idiot.  Why it was impossible to make the mount on the magnets, and make the connector contacts flush with the case?  Why it was impossible to make small grooves in the back cover, so that the iron clasps would snap into it?  I will never believe that it was impossible to come up with a solution that is more elegant than piercing holes of this size in this case. <br><br>  Especially annoying when these holes fall under the arm.  You hold on the one hand - the tablet is smooth, pretty and all from itself with such a "mi-mi-mi", and on the other - something full of holes. <br><br>  We go further.  Controls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93f/1f5/7f8/93f1f57f8b97af35c77ff8c33233a3b6.jpg"><br><br>  The power button on the left, the volume rocker on the right.  For additional illustration, front view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df6/04c/5e1/df604c5e130d9cbe41fadd491aa808f6.jpg"><br><br>  The power button is exactly above the Asus logo, the rocker is on the opposite side. <br><br>  It really is very interesting to me, which crank with the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù decided to arrange these controls exactly like this. <br>  Let me explain why I consider that person an idiot: when the tablet is in portrait orientation, it is almost inevitable that either the volume rocker or the on-off button gets under the palm of the hand.  It feels particularly good when you type in portrait orientation with two hands.  Then the volume starts to be "adjusted", then the tablet simply turns off.  Right soul rejoices! <br><br>  Well, of course, everyone has already noticed the ‚Äúmirror‚Äù.  Yes, this tablet is the most natural mirror when turned off.  Girls will like it.  It is a clear, contrasting, just a sight.  Not covered with a single nanometer of some of the very filthy Chinese oleophobe from a can.  Every touch on it leaves an incredible sharp spot.  Even if you just got out of the shower and washed your hands with pumice.  Twenty minutes of play in Auralux turn the screen into a dull-dull something.  It is necessary to swell like a fish-ball and rub with a tablet on the belly, which is usually very happy for the neighboring metro passengers. <br>  But, of course, there is a plus - better than this solar hare tablet, only a real mirror lets go. <br><br>  Speaking of the sun.  Forget about seeing something on the tablet in direct sunlight.  Anril.  You can spin for as long as you like, trying to catch a corner at which you will see at least something, but it will end up anyway so that you will rush somewhere away from your route to go into the shadows. <br><br>  Assembly. <br><br>  Honestly, Ainol Fire is better built.  When I discovered this assembly cant, I just did not believe that this is possible from a world-class manufacturer.  But Asus - stubborn guys, they proved that it is possible, and not only to me.  The upper left corner of the screen is significantly squeezed inside when you just take the tablet in your hand for it.  It turned out that this is a <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1903521">very common problem</a> in humans, which even leads to glass breakage.  I gave only one link, but there are dozens of them in Google.  Hold it different or use a case, as they say. <br><br>  Pictures as visual evidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e53/b5f/266/e53b5f26694dff952c1afdc1bacd24cc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/a56/e6a/a80a56e6ab2ad716be60066dacbf675a.jpg"><br><br>  I did not check it for twisting, sorry.  Something I fear to twist it when people just break glass under their fingers. <br><br><h5>  Dock keyboard </h5><br><br>  Actually, this appliance was difficult to spoil.  Just need to assemble in one case the keyboard, touchpad, battery, card reader and USB-port.  But Asus managed.  They were able to fill up and this elementary exercise on usability. <br><br>  I tell in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/597/629/c86/597629c86262d65ecec513b605b914e3.jpg"><br><br>  See how the connector looks when the tablet is not inserted into it?  He sticks to a good centimeter and clings to everything that is possible.  Which is not surprising, since it has the shape of a great metal hook.  If I put the tablet assembled in the morning in a bag, then to play / read in the subway, I need to get it, disconnect, and then try to remove the keyboard back and not drop the tablet itself.  Given the hook, this becomes a non-trivial task. <br><br>  USB connector.  There are no complaints about the connector itself and its position.  But the stub!  It's just a piece of gum complex shape, inserted into the connector.  There is no fixation to the body.  Since this is a rubber band, it is constantly, really once in a while, at the moment of its removal from the connector, the rubber band says ‚Äúbzdink!‚Äù And flies away in an unknown direction.  What provides a good pixel quest for her search for about five to ten minutes.  Moreover, it can be inserted upside down into the connector.  After that, it can only be removed from the connector with a needle or knife.  But you will not lose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/433/671/36e/43367136ea9c05c71e3c898288e29ddf.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard was designed by exactly the same eccentric on the same letter ‚Äúm‚Äù (well, or his twin brother), who made the layout for the UX31a ultrabook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/550/733/0e2/5507330e257dab3ef678c9e26cf81aa9.jpg"><br><br>  Do you see a small cool button on / off the computer on BackSpace?  This moronically located button deprived Asus of hundreds, if not thousands of buyers.  Because to place the power button on the computer in the immediate vicinity of the button, on which they hammer without looking, and moreover they usually take out the evil for a typo on it - the height of idiocy. <br><br>  But in Asus persistent boys sit.  They come on a rake at least several times.  My keyboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45f/039/50e/45f03950ee2a32a6ca927f396ad1861e.jpg"><br><br>  See that funny little lock on BackSpace?  Guess what he does?  That's right, he puts out the tablet.  Charm, right? <br><br>  And now, the most wonderful.  So to speak, for dessert.  Switch layouts!  I can not describe it, it must be seen. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tT70qHQgb0Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhWCT3LGq0zLXT4KGhK7PLaEsrPiA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Nutrition </h5><br><br>  This is, of course, just a masterpiece.  No, masterpiece!  Asus, my dears, tell me - why was this poor, miserable, nonstandard connector built?  Oh, there are several devices in the dock clave?  But what, was it not destiny to shove a small USB hub into this clave and connect everything through it?  So that in the tablet itself and in the dock-clave there was a small, neat micro-USB connector?  Look at your poverty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e5/132/aeb/6e5132aeb390b1a7d226d527b053fac5.jpg"><br><br>  You obliged me to carry with you a charging cable, which you will not find anywhere with fire during the day.  Thank you so much for this human ‚Äúthank you‚Äù!  I will develop my frugality skills in relation to a half-meter piece of plastic with copper threads inside.  All my life I dreamed of. <br><br>  Special thanks for charging this tablet exclusively from its own power supply unit.  And all because the charging current he has 15 volts.  I tried to charge from a 12-amp 5-volt power supply via USB (using a native cable).  Sew.  Only native BP, only hardcore! <br><br>  <i>* Separately, I want to warn those who think of charging both the tablet and some other device from this power supply via some USB-multiplier.</i>  <i>As soon as the power supply unit recognizes the laptop on the other side, it delivers 15 volts and a copper basin may come to your second device.</i> <br><br>  And now the movie! <br><br>  Let's start with the demonstration of download speed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYz8JJZFDFE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCTYH1l1PQHcRnwpDx7CaDFcMDpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The TF700 boots for a minute longer than my working home computer with Windows 7 and a lot of software in autoload.  Just handy. <br><br>  We continue the demonstration of the sound of this tablet. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwB7lfxE2jc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4E0wiSOtD3B0zOtNantOc0u_0Mw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  From the audio comments, I believe, it is clear that I think about the engineering qualifications of Asus employees.  Well, the Chinese - they do not think about anything at all, just copy.  But in Asus could and strain the gyrus.  Well, or copy from Samsung, if you think yourself broke. <br><br>  Next we will have a test for smooth video playback.  Ainol Fire will be the opponent.  Test sample - a piece of Iron Sky at the very beginning of the film.  The file is heavy, large - 200 megabytes.  The sample was recorded on the tablets and played. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Do6cexM2Dek%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgv3UrPIdXDlOtEZ2GWAajZkpnYoQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I was not even surprised that the Chinese did not lag behind Asus one iota.  They slowed down and lagged in the same places, despite the fact that Asus was twice as powerful in parrot tests. <br><br>  Lord of Asus, I give you a solid deuce.  I would put a count, but the screen saved you one point.  You are a world class company.  Pretend to compete with Apple in the tablet market and generally position this product as a premium class for businessmen, not hipsters with ipad.  So why the hell did you release such a lousy product? <br><br>  If you have at least a drop of pride and elementary honesty, you will contact me and buy this trash from me at the price for which I bought it. <br><br>  And finally, I would like to say only about one real and huge plus of this tablet.  This is the screen resolution.  FullHD on the tablet is great.  Reading, watching the Internet, working with a remote desktop - just great.  Especially when the sun does not shine on it. <br>  But I will look at another FullHD-tablet.  When he comes out and will like me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153671/</a></p>
