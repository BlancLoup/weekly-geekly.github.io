Home desktops;  on which only they did not work: both on Win and Linux.  And occasionally, a working laptop MacBook Pro with OS X on board came to visit.  Yes, I immediately focus my attention on the fact that there are other inhabitants in my house (less IT-savvy) - members of my close-knit family.

      I, like any other person of our time, need access to information (very often operational) with the further possibility of its processing / archiving / transfer.  And do not forget about the family, which also needs IT!  Well, to build something you first need to deal with the basic question: ‚ÄúWhy do I need it, what IT needs exist in our house?‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  When entering the operational survey, we highlight the basic needs: </h4><br>  1. access to more or less high-speed Internet - a source of information; <br>  2. access to work / home mail; <br>  3. the ability to view video both on the monitor and on the widescreen screen; <br>  4. the ability to listen to music with a block CU; <br>  5. replenish the media library for p.3 and p.4; <br>  6. the ability to work with graphics / photographic materials and the subsequent transfer / viewing in galleries online; <br>  7. ability to work with office applications - keeping home documents; <br>  8. printing of documentation, photo. <br><hr><br><br><h4>  Macbook pro </h4><br>  It all started with MacBook Pro (15 '', 2.33 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) and home Internet.  If there is a laptop with Wi-Fi in the house, it‚Äôs a sin not to have a wireless connection.  Everything is simple, we use a Wi-Fi router (D-link DIR 300 is a classic). <br><br>  Homeworkers periodically poked at desktops in their familiar Win, then they learned to work in Linux and finally got to OS X. MacBook Pro fell in love with everything from big to small.  And once the question was raised: "How much does a Mac cost? We want it!"  After the voiced price, the desires subsided, but from time to time the issue of acquiring a home Mac was raised ... The process has begun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a9/2e4/235/0a92e4235791bd812296cafc33459538.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - mobility; <br>  - power that allows you to solve any tasks we set; <br>  - HD display and the ability to view video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - high price; <br>  - DIR 300 does not support the IEEE 802,11n standard (max - 54 Mbps) - this is a drawback of the router, but still; <br>  - heating the laptop, making it difficult to watch the video (for example: lying in bed). <br><hr><br><br><h4>  Apple TV </h4><br>  Let's go further - video.  We use the Transmission torrent client to fill your home library.  Yes, there are still disks, flash drives and other media, but to be honest, we haven't used them for a year.  To view this very media library, a 32-inch LCD panel with an Apple TV set-top box (16 GB + minor surgery) was chosen.  We get several opportunities at once: watching videos from public folders of MacBook Pro, as well as flash drives, the ability to connect the keyboard to facilitate surfing, browsing online galleries, the ability to enjoy music through syncing MacBook Pro and Apple TV through iTunes.  With all this, the number of wires is minimal, which is an indisputable advantage in small spaces, especially in residential areas. <br><br>  You will probably think: ‚ÄúHere, I said that the Mac price bites, and he bought Apple TV ...‚Äù, but everything is simple, I got the prefix for a symbolic $ 100 and I could not miss this opportunity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f8/369/ab3/4f8369ab376489be1607fe4a7ec25782.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - plug &amp; play (Apple devices work with each other simply with a bang) - home ones especially appreciate this item; <br>  - quick video viewing from flash drives; <br>  - the ability to show family photos / videos on the big screen - guests are delighted; <br>  - minimizing wired networks; <br>  - stylish design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - still had to "file" Apple TV to its normal state; <br>  - heating the media box (you have to turn off Apple TV periodically) - by the way, it has the highest heating coefficient (burned varnish on the old nightstand); <br>  - lack of HD-module with its consequences (there is a solution, but it will have to lose the Wi-Fi-module, which is more critical for me, non-HD at the moment). <br><hr><br><br><h4>  Mac mini </h4><br>  Everything is wonderful, we live.  But the laptop is one, and there are three of us.  Yes, there is another platform, but its lowest demand and desktop are constantly in the dust and without work;  but for the Mac constant "fights".  Are you following up how Apple is slowly climbing into our consciousness?  The glowing apple of the laptop does its marketing business ... <br><br>  Everything finally has no power, the drug has begun to act - we choose a home desktop and stop at Mac mini (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) with a 19 '' Benq monitor, which was developed specifically for Mac mini.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhonestly <s>spioneren</s> borrowed from one Japanese geek, yes, it was the Japanese.  On his site, I looked only at his home workplace and partially translated the hieroglyphs with a dictionary for Google sites. <br><br>  Install all the necessary software and enjoy.  Regarding software: office applications were selected from the open source software series, namely: OpenOffice and NeoOffice, Aperture 3.0 was purchased for photo processing, most of the rest of the software comes bundled with Mac ‚Äî this is an iLife package, so I did not complicate his life.  Do not forget that all the software is installed depending on the needs and to your taste. <br><br>  <i>* By the way, the Mac mini liked the family more than the MacBook Pro, despite the lack of mobility.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b34/53d/773/b3453d7736fa90c48041af8ef5d16ad2.jpg"><br><br>  The monitor stand has a recess to fit your Mac mini.  Immediately, as a digression, the question arose: ‚ÄúWill Benq change the design of this monitor under the new Mac mini?‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c33/a2a/f0a/c33a2af0a965c46b8c5893eadd246266.jpg"><br><br>  We connect the hp 5443 photo printer to Mac mini. For photo processing and partial design, select the Wacom Bamboo Fun graphic tablet - cheap and cheerful - what you need for home use.  It turns out a mini-design workshop for mini-marginal funds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f24/6fb/ef4/f246fbef479b059e30a85bcd14f009f8.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - low price (compared to other Apple solutions); <br>  - high performance - talking about household tasks; <br>  - stylish design (no words, some emotions - this is important for home interior); <br>  - the ability to print photos / documents; <br>  - another dose of the drug Apple, which hit the flame of the desire to "Buy us a Mac!". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - lack of mobility; <br>  - it is inconvenient to insert plugs - this is more a lack of a stand for Benq, but we consider it as a minus of the solution. <br><hr><br><br><h4>  Airport express </h4><br>  Not so long ago, another young geek started up in our family - we had a daughter.  There was a new task - to make a child to classical music, which soothes the baby great.  Yes, there are still children's songs and mass, the mass of everything for children, which is worth portions to issue for listening. <br><br>  And here, I remember about the gadget, which I had been thinking about for a long time - Apple AirPort Express.  What is his ‚Äúbun‚Äù for me is the presence of an audio output (3.5 mm minijack), through which you can connect the speaker system.  In addition to the audio output, the point enhances the Wi-Fi signal, that is, in places where the signal from the D-link router is low (claims are taking place in a concrete house), the AirPort Express signal reaches.  Sync via iTunes and the ability to control both MacBook Pro and Mac mini. <br><br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1007/99/c9e63d989e1c.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - the possibility of simple installation of the audio system; <br>  - Wi-Fi signal gain; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - not seen. <br><hr><br><br><h4>  iphone </h4><br>  The wife is tied to the child, but nevertheless needs IT.  Going to a Mac mini workstation is almost impossible, and a laptop <s>shakes</s> with me to work!  At this point, there is no sense in the audio system, which is controlled from one of the workstations.  The solution to this problem was found in the acquisition of iPhone 3GS (16 GB).  I will not describe the delight of the device, but it is better to go straight to the benefits.  Yes, it was also a kind of gift from the boom to his wife for his daughter - I did not even think about saving!  :) <br><br><img src="http://i068.radikal.ru/1007/bf/bf32b251786e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>* There was a great desire to purchase an iPad, but with 3G, which at that time were not yet on sale, therefore - an iPhone.</i> <br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - Surfing: sitting, lying, standing, outdoors, etc .; <br>  - quick access to mail; <br>  - quick access to Skype; <br>  - the ability to view the video (this wife needed the last 6 months); <br>  - the ability to remotely access MacBook Pro, Mac mini and Apple TV (App. VNC - free); <br>  - the ability to control the entire iTunes audio system (App. Remote - free); <br>  - the ability to watch a happy wife is her exclusive dose of Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - price; <br>  - brand screen / case; <br><hr><br><br><h4>  Mobileme </h4><br>  Having already available a small fleet of Apple equipment, it was difficult to refuse MobileMe paid service.  Yes, I use other services (for example: Google), but they don‚Äôt have plug &amp; play features.  And so, what did we get? <br><br>  First, the synchronization.  Synchronization of all devices through the MM cloud is probably the most important function for us.  To keep two or three notebooks in the same format is a very laborious process. <br><br>  Secondly, remote data storage.  I currently have no need to keep a server for information storage at home, so the MM (iDisk) repository fell into everyone's taste.  According to my humble beliefs in the near future, few people will have devices for storing information in large volumes - everyone will use clouds of various data centers with dedicated virtual servers for storage. <br><br>  Thirdly, we received stylish galleries, the ability to create a website (iWeb) and its hosting in the Apple data center, etc. <br><br><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/1007/2d/fcf5dbe6d472.jpg"><br><br>  <i>* You can argue about the need for a long time, but who will help me send a photo from Aperture (to which I was already used) by email in one click?</i>  <i>- So far, no one ...</i> <br><br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1007/fa/a8b52f009bfa.jpg"><br>  - synchronization of master data from all Apple devices; <br>  - fast and convenient access to data; <br>  - remote storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8f/cf9/678/a8fcf9678f15469bb496ddd38d90e08d.jpg"><br>  - price; <br>  - connection speed is not always high. <br><hr><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br><img src="http://i069.radikal.ru/1007/15/a66781ecb214.jpg" align="left">  The output was a home mini-infrastructure consisting of: a Mac mini workstation, a MacBook Pro mobile workstation, an Apple TV-based media center, an iTunes-based audio system and AirPort Express running on iPhone, connected via a Wi-Fi wireless network. IEEE 802.1g protocol (in the near future plans to switch to ‚Äún‚Äù) and synchronized via MobileMe service.  All needs are met - the task is completed! <br><br><h4>  In the plans: </h4><br>  - iPad 3G (32 GB), abandoned the laptop for home use in favor of the tablet - this is its niche; <br>  - transition to wireless protocol IEEE 802,1n - AirPort Extreme; <br>  - HD module in the Apple TV media console; <br>  - Time Capsule. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And then I realized that Apple‚Äôs strategy is working - they were able to penetrate the brain of my family and by giving one portion of the apple <s>drug</s> cause the subsequent attraction to this fruit.  It is in such an amazing way that the love of Apple technology has appeared in the life of our family, and Apple has its fans and customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95490/</a></p>
