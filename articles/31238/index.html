Maybe you want an investment.  Sometimes you need an alliance for marketing or sales organization.  From time to time you need the permission of a large company to do something.  Or, maybe, a big company came to you and offered to buy your startup. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most important thing you need to know at the beginning of any conversation and relationships with a large company is that you are Captain Ahab, and a large company is a white whale Moby Dick [the metaphor and all quotes in the article on the <a href="http://www.lib.ru/INPROZ/MELWILL/mobidik.txt">text of the</a> novel Herman Melville ‚ÄúMoby Dick or White Whale ‚Äù- approx.  trans.].

    <blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúAnd we didn‚Äôt spend two days in swimming, when one day at dawn we saw a great many whales and other sea monsters.</font>  <font color="gray">Of these, one had a truly gigantic size.</font>  <font color="gray">He approached us, holding his mouth open, raising waves on the sides and churning the sea in front of him. ‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Tuk</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Translation of "True History" by Lucian</i></font> </blockquote><br>  When Captain Ahab went in search of Moby Dick, a big white whale, he had absolutely no idea whether he would find Moby Dick or Moby Dick to allow himself to be found;  or Moby Dick will try to immediately knock over the ship, or instead will play like a cat with a mouse;  or Moby Dick is generally engaged in marriage games with his giant white girlfriend. <br><br>  What happens is up to Moby Dick.  And Captain Ahab will never be able to explain to himself or to anyone else why Moby Dick did this or that.  You are Captain Ahab, and the big company is Moby Dick. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚Äú- Look at Captain Ahab, young man, and you will see that he has only one leg.</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">- What do you want to say, sir?</font>  <font color="gray">Did he lose his second leg because of a whale?</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">- Because of the whale ?!</font>  <font color="gray">Come closer, young man;</font>  <font color="gray">He devoured this leg, chewed up, gnawed at the most terrible of the sperm whales who had ever whipped a whaleboat!</font>  <font color="gray">ABOUT!</font>  <font color="gray">ABOUT!"</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Moby Dick"</i></font> </blockquote><br>  And that's why.  The behavior of any large company is highly unpredictable for an outside observer. <br><br>  I always laugh when someone says: ‚ÄúMicrosoft is going to make X‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoogle is going to make Y‚Äù, or ‚ÄúYahoo is going to make Z‚Äù. <br><br>  Most likely, even <i>inside</i> Microsoft, Google or Yahoo, no one knows what Microsoft, Google or Yahoo is going to do in any circumstances on any issue.  Of course, maybe the CEO knows if the question is really important, but you hardly deal with issues of this level, so it doesn‚Äôt matter. <br><br>  Within each large company there is a very, very complex system of many thousands of people, of whom at least hundreds, and probably thousands, are in leadership positions and think that they have a certain authority in making decisions. <br><br>  On any issue, many people within the company take part in a kind of voting - it can be eight people, ten, fifteen, twenty, sometimes much more. <br><br>  When I worked at IBM in the early 90s, they had a formal decision-making procedure called ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù (concurrence) - a written list of fifty or so managers from all departments of the company on whom this decision can influence, no matter how strong, and collected their opinions.  In this case, absolutely any manager could impose a veto on the final decision.  This is an extreme case, but even a non-extreme version of the procedure ‚Äî and all large companies have it, they must have it ‚Äî is incredibly difficult to understand, even from inside the company, not to mention an outside observer. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">"... and whale breathing often has an extremely strong smell, from which there can be a clouding of the brain."</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Ulloa</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"South America"</i></font> </blockquote><br>  You can imagine this as a point of collision of opposing forces that influence the dynamics of decision making on any issue within the company. <br><br>  Consensus, concessions, nettings, politics, alliance, arguments, educational work, revenge for past mistakes, control over spheres of influence, development groups, product managers, marketing specialists, sales managers, corporate marketing, finance, Eychary, legal, strategic departments, business development, foreign divisions, investors, Wall Street analysts, market analysts, good press, bad press, articles you didn‚Äôt even know about, customers, potential clients, former clients, potential  competitors' clients, partners, financial statement numbers for this quarter, schedule for this quarter, rating of securities, scheduled meeting last week, scheduled and canceled meeting this week, bonus programs, new employees in the company, employees leaving the company, falling for promotion, promotion, reduction, transferring to another job, who is sleeping with whom, what CEO CEO went to yesterday, and the guy who prepared your presentation in PowerPoint and typed the name of the startup too small  kim font so that it is not visible from the back row. <br><br>  You cannot even identify all those factors that will influence the decision of a large company, especially to understand them and even more so try to influence them. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúOn those whales that are bigger, they rarely dare to attack.</font>  <font color="gray">Other whales inspire them with such horror that they are afraid to even utter their names at sea and carry manure, lime, juniper and other objects with them in their whaleboats to scare them away. ‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Hugo von Troil.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Letters on the voyage of Banks and Soander to Iceland in 1772"</i></font> </blockquote><br><br>  Back to Moby Dick. <br><br>  Moby Dick can secretly track you for three months, and then suddenly jump out of the water and make a giant noise, and then disappear for six months, then go back and throw your boat stranded or, on the contrary, give you the exact tip that you need, to harpoon his gigantic carcass. <br><br>  And you will never understand why. <br><br>  A big company can study you for three months, then come to you and declare your plans for investment or partnership with you, or buying you, then disappear for six months, and then come up again with a directly competing product that will kill you, or, on the contrary, acquire you and make you and all your employees fabulously wealthy. <br><br>  And you will never understand why. <br><br>  The positive side of the relationship with a large company is that in front of you is a potential mountain of whale meat as a trophy. <br><br>  Sorry, confused metaphors.  The right relationship with the right big company can have a <i>huge</i> impact on the success of a startup. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">"And no matter what else the object may appear in the chaos to graze this monster, be it a beast, a ship or a stone, it instantly disappears in its huge fetid throat and perishes in the black abyss of its belly."</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  Holland translation of "Moralia" Plutarch </blockquote><br>  The negative side of the relationship with a large company is that it can knock you over - by hitting you in one way or another, and completely destroying you, but more likely involving you in a partnership on bad conditions that ends up in loss for you or just a waste of gigantic the amount of time at meetings that will detract from the main goal. <br><br>  So what to do? <br><br>  <b>First</b> , do not base startups who need to have relationships with large companies to achieve success. <br><br>  The risk to never achieve the desired deal is too great, no matter how hard you are willing to work to achieve it. <br><br>  And even if you get the right deal, everything will probably not work the way you want it to. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúTaban!</font>  <font color="gray">Cried the senior mate of the captain, when, turning round, he saw, over the very nose of the boat, the wide open mouth of a sperm whale threatening them with inevitable death.</font>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúTaban, to whom life is dear!‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Wharton - Death to the Whales"</i></font> </blockquote><br>  <b>Second</b> , never assume that the transaction with a large company is completed until you have signed and / or the money has not been credited to your bank account. <br><br>  There is always something that makes a deal that looked final, shatters or disappears without a trace. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúAt dawn, the sentinel again took posts at the tops of the masts.</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">- See it?</font>  <font color="gray">- shouted Ahab, as soon as the light spilled over the waves.</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúNothing, sir!‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Moby Dick"</i></font> </blockquote><br>  <b>Third</b> , be supremely patient. <br><br>  Big companies are always playing the hurry and wait game.  Over the past few years, I had to deal with one large technology company from the East Coast who played the game ‚Äúhurry up and wait‚Äù for me at least four times - they even made me immediately and hurriedly fly out across the country for lunch with a second face the companies that were called a prerequisite - and at the same time they never promptly did in turn what was necessary. <br><br>  If you want to get along with a big company, it will take much longer than you think. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúFor God's sake, Mr. Chace!</font>  <font color="gray">What happened? "- I replied:" The ship collided with a whale, and the hull was broken. "</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"A description of the death of the whaler" Essex "from Nantucket, who was attacked in the Pacific Ocean by a large sperm whale, was compiled by Owen Chasse of Nantucket, the senior mate of the said ship."</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>New York.</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>1821</i></font> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Fourth</b> , beware of bad deals. <br><br>  Right now, I recall one high-ranking startup from San Francisco, who gave extremely great hope, had excellent technology and a unique market offer, and at the very beginning of his activity concluded two partnership deals with large, reputable companies, after which he completely lost all ability to carry out his main business. <br><br>  <b>Fifth</b> , never in your life assume that a big company will make what you consider obvious. <br><br>  What is obvious to you - or to any outside observer - is probably not obvious to those inside the company, if you take into account all the other factors that will have their effect. <br><br>  <b>Sixth</b> , you need to be aware that big companies are more concerned about what other big companies are doing than about what any start-ups are doing. <br><br>  What can I say, they think about other big companies even more than about their own clients. <br><br>  Moby Dick thought more about other big white whales than about annoying little people on a funny boat. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúAnd let's say you even managed to whale the harps;</font>  <font color="gray">Imagine how you would manage with a frisky wild three-year-old with just one rope tied to the tail of his tail. ‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Bones and rags."</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Head of the whaling business</i></font> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Seventh</b> , if transactions with large companies intend to become a key part of your strategy, then be sure to hire a professional who has done this before. <br><br>  Only the best and most experienced whalers had a chance to take down Moby Dick.  That is why senior sales and business development managers pay so much money.  They are worth it. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚Äú- O Ahab!</font>  <font color="gray">- Starbek cried, - and even now, on the third day, it‚Äôs not too late to stop.</font>  <font color="gray">Take a look!</font>  <font color="gray">Moby Dick is not looking to meet you.</font>  <font color="gray">It is you, you pursue him in madness! ‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Moby Dick"</i></font> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Eighth</b> , do not let the obsession to get hold of you.  Do not become captain Ahab.  Of course, talk to big companies about anything, but always be ready to end the conversation and return to your core business. <br><br>  You will rarely find such a startup for which a deal with a large company leads to success, and the absence of a deal leads to a huge defeat. <br><br>  (However, look at Microsoft and Digital Research around 1981. A really big whale was swimming there). <br><br>  Last for today. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="gray">‚ÄúAnd the whale dived under the collapsed hull of the vessel and sailed along the shuddered keel;</font>  <font color="gray">then, turning under the water, again flew out to the surface, but from the other side, in the distance, and, finding himself a few yards from Ahab's boat, for a while stood motionless on the waves.</font> <font color="gray"><br><br></font>  <font color="gray">‚Äú... I am sailing right to meet you, oh everything that is crushing, but not all the beating whale;</font>  <font color="gray">until the last I fight with you;</font>  <font color="gray">from the very depths of hell I strike you;</font>  <font color="gray">in the name of hatred I belch my last breath on you.</font>  <font color="gray">Let all the coffins and all the hearses drown in one pool!</font>  <font color="gray">Even if none of them get to me, then let me be torn to pieces, still chasing you, though chained to you, oh damn whale!</font>  <font color="gray">That's how I throw a weapon!</font> <font color="gray"><br><br></font>  <font color="gray">A harpoon whistled through the air;</font>  <font color="gray">the whale whipped off;</font>  <font color="gray">tench ran in a chute with a burning speed - and caught.</font>  <font color="gray">Ahab leaned over to set him free;</font>  <font color="gray">he freed him;</font>  <font color="gray">but the sliding loop managed to twist it around the neck;</font>  <font color="gray">and silently, as the Turks in a serale squeeze their victim with a string, he was carried away from the whaleboat before the crew managed to catch their captain.</font>  <font color="gray">A moment later, a fat fire at the free end of the line flew out of the empty tub, knocked down one rower and, lashing along the water, disappeared into the bottomless depths.</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray"><i>"Moby Dick"</i></font> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31238/</a></p>
