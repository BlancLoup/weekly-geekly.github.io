For example, it was used to detect the ocean on Enceladus and the seas from liquid methane on Titan.  Now experts are preparing the device for one of the last missions - the study of the rings of Saturn.  Starting November 30, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582)">Cassini</a> will embark on his "ring journey." <br><br>  From November 30 of this year to April 22 of next year, the apparatus <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php%3Ffeature%3D6681">will move</a> from the pole to the pole of the gas giant, passing along the path, every seven days, through the outer region of the main rings of the planet.  In total, he will make 20 such "shuttle" passes.  The probe is equipped with several scientific instruments that will be used to select particles of matter and gases from different areas of Saturn's rings, followed by analysis of the samples obtained. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first two "dive" Cassini through one of the thinnest and weakest rings of Saturn, formed by tiny meteors hitting the two moons of the planet - Janus and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA)">Epimetheus</a> .  In March and April, the probe will study the outer regions of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">ring F</a> , which is characterized by a large amount of dust.

There is practically no dust threat here, ‚Äùsaid Earl Maze, project manager for Cassini at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> . <br><br>  According to experts, this ring is the outer boundary of the main ring system.  In addition to them, Saturn has a few more weaker rings that are farther from the planet.  Ring F, whose width is about 800 kilometers, is constantly changing.  The most dense is its central part, the width of which is about 50 kilometers.  Photos from Cassini show the various structures inside the ring, the configuration of which varies within an hour. <br><br><h3>  Why was Cassini sent to the rings of Saturn? </h3><br>  The fact is that now the probe has <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-11-cassini-ring-grazing-orbits.html">an unprecedented opportunity</a> to study in detail the structure of the rings of the planet of the gas giant.  In addition, the device "sees" and small moons that are close to the edges of the rings, including such Saturn's moons as Pandora, Atlas, Pan and Daphnis. <br><br>  In addition to ring F, Cassini will be able to study rings A and B. Scientists expect that the pictures of Cassini sent to them in a short time will show us all this in maximum quality from the time the probe arrived at Saturn in 2004.  The resolution of the images will be 1 kilometers per pixel.  Experts hope to receive a large number of photos that will allow you to fully see the structure of all the rings. <br><br>  In particular, astronomers are planning to look closer at the small elements of ring A, which are called ‚Äúpropellers‚Äù because of their shape, similar to the propellers of an aircraft.  Photos and additional data from Cassini‚Äôs scientific tools will help to understand or at least clarify the origin and structure of the rings.  In March, while in the shadow of Saturn, Cassini will study the rings when they are illuminated by sunlight.  It may be possible to see clouds of dust - a consequence of the passage of meteors through the rings or their stresses on the shallow moons of Saturn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/339/bcb/95a/339bcb95a709080401bec0bb5b92151b.gif"><br>  <font color="gray">Gas giant rings were called as they were discovered.</font>  <font color="gray">They are not placed in order.</font>  <font color="gray">Source: NASA / JPL-Caltech / Space Science Institute</font> <br><br><h3>  And then what? </h3><br>  During his mission, Cassini will move closer to the upper limit of the clouds of Saturn to a minimum distance of about 90,000 kilometers.  In April 2017, Cassini will begin the final phase of his mission. <br><br>  After nearly 20 years in space, the probe spent almost all of its fuel.  The project team carefully prepared for this moment by developing a script that will help Cassini to gain valuable information for science before the probe is hidden in the dense atmosphere of Saturn.  In September, the device will pass at a distance of only 1600 kilometers from the upper boundary of the clouds, after which the planet‚Äôs atmosphere will dive.  It will happen on September 15th.  Now scientists are preparing for the final. <br><br>  On December 4, the device will turn on the main engine to reach the calculated trajectory.  This maneuver will help clarify the movement of the probe and establish the correct course along which Cassini will move to the very end.  ‚ÄúIt will be the 183rd in a row turning on the main engine.  We will still have the opportunity to turn on the engine again, but according to the plan we need to complete all the maneuvers after this switch-on, ‚ÄùNASA officials said. <br><br>  After receiving all the data sent by the probe to Earth, experts will be able to understand exactly where the outer boundary of the atmosphere of Saturn is located. <br><br>  Last year, Cassini flew past Enceladus for the last time, with only 49 kilometers to the surface of the gas giant‚Äôs satellite.  In addition, Cassini flew through the material ejected from under the surface of Enceladus, and this made it possible to obtain confirmation of the existence of water under a thick ice sheet. <br><br>  The fact that "sees" Cassini, being next to Saturn, will help to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe video, collected from thousands of photos.  Video quality - 4K. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgxWkOXcdZU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is a pity that everything will soon cease when Cassini is crushed by the dense atmosphere of Saturn during his last journey. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369911/</a></p>
