Berkun <br>  Annotation: unlike many works devoted to the management of projects and teams, in this book, new teachings are not preached and great theories are not extolled.

The practical part is devoted to business modeling, requirements management, requirements analytics, team management, time estimation, risk management, engineering development practices (mostly from extreme programming), quality control and assurance, Scrum implementation and scaling.

Fowler <br>  Annotation: in this book you will not find descriptions of specific technologies, algorithms and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã- its value is not in this.  It is a collection of practical advice and recommendations regarding situations that any developer sometimes encounters: lack of motivation, choice of priorities, programming psychology, relationships with management and colleagues, and many others.  Such knowledge usually comes only as a result of many years of real work experience.  By and large, there is a bright and fascinating guide that will help you quickly make a career in the software development industry to anyone who has set such a goal for themselves.
