      The last point is especially important - it is a rather invariant thing: people both searched and will look for services and products for a well-defined set of keywords.  Cost, audience size (number of potential customers) - all this changes.  A list of keywords can only be corrected, slightly supplemented, adapted to the new proposals on your site and so on.  And if you are thinking of applying SEO, this list should be the basis for the TK on the structure and content of the site.  Under each keyword you need to organically and gracefully create a separate page with unique, readable and useful content for the visitor.  Having such landing pages for each word from the list, but also connected by a logical internal hierarchy and structure (categories, transfer of reference weight from pages with the least important keywords to pages with the most important and competitive), you get a site 90% ready for optimization. <br><br><h5>  Internal optimization </h5><br>  It is possible to bring readiness for advancement up to 100% due to competent internal optimization.  Megatons of articles are written about her, including our <a href="http://seopult.ru/subscribe.html%3Fid%3D33">check list</a> .  Go through all the points, eliminate the found flaws.  Another important tip is to look at how the pages of current issue leaders look and feel for the queries you need.  Obviously, they are the best indicators of current search engine preferences. <br><br><h5>  First year </h5><br>  It would seem that it is time to start the battle for the TOP on the most attractive and bold HF-words, but then the factor of the age of the site comes into play.  In order to resist black hat SEO (‚Äúblack‚Äù methods forbidden by search engines - from doorways and cloaking to synonymized content to cheat up behavioral ranking factors) and tireless experimenters in this genre, search engines had to introduce a filter for new sites.  If it were not there, conscientious website owners who have invested a lot of money and time in the development of their websites would constantly fly out of the dozens under the pressure of resources made yesterday that exploit a particular hole in the search engine algorithm.  Actually, the filter almost blocks the search for holes.  Therefore, the impossibility for a young site to go out in the first year and a half to the TOP by highly competitive inquiries is not such a big price for the lack of debris generated automatically. <br><br>  From this it becomes clear that to get serious traffic from the natural issue in the first year will not work.  But visitors are needed, so you have to attract them in a different way - primarily with contextual advertising.  She also uses a keyword list, so she can test the site and make sure that it successfully converts visitors into buyers, gives good indicators of behavioral ranking criteria (number of refusals, viewing depth and time spent on pages), and so on. <br><br>  But to completely forget about SEO in the first year is not the best choice.  On the contrary, gradually and carefully increasing the reference mass, you can quickly get into the top ten for all the necessary words when the search engine removes the filter.  The strategy is very simple: in the first months, start with a minimum budget for the lowest frequency and low competitive inquiries.  When they come out in the TOP, go to mid-frequency, and a year later (or earlier, if lucky) - to high frequencies. <br><br>  The criterion for increasing the budget is the movement in issuance to the TOP10.  But do not try to break through at any cost - if the site stops within TOP50 or doesn‚Äôt enter the top ten, it‚Äôs better to wait, check the internal optimization, try to make the link mass more natural due to links from authoritative resources that people will really come to, and etc.  It is possible that you already have a sufficient link budget, just a search engine believes that the site is still too young for the best places to issue. <br><br>  By the way, when buying links, do not show excessive zeal - if hundreds of links appear on a new site from nowhere for a couple of weeks, the search engine may consider this a ‚Äúreference explosion‚Äù and impose the appropriate filter.  A gradual increase in the reference mass in an optimal (certain empirically) way can only be performed by automated systems. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  The better and better to perform completely standard site development operations, an increase in the number of pages and unique interesting content, increasing the volume of links and internal optimization, the sooner you can get to the top 10 best places.  Yes, in the first year the site will not be able to compete with the leaders for any bread requests, but during this time, if you wish, you can turn the resource into an ideal machine for turning visitors into buyers and pull all significant ranking factors to a competitive level.  And visitors can be obtained from more expensive than SEO, but also with the unique advantages of sources such as contextual advertising. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169263/</a></p>
