      It seems to me that the only thing that is really important to know about Facebook (hereinafter - FB): it represents an excellent environment for the viral distribution of small programs. <br><br>  <strong>How it works?</strong> <br>  The user installs the program and uses it.  In the process, he usually interacts with his FB friends.  For example, you need to invite a friend in order to play with him in the game, or to give him a virtual postcard, write something on his "wall" and so on. <br><br>  In addition, applications leave notifications about user actions in special feeds in the profiles of his friends.  For example, logging on to FB, I see that some of my friends have installed a new program and can also install it myself.  Or I see that one of my friends sent something to another ‚Äî by becoming interested, following the link ‚Äî and now I have unobtrusively connected to the next application. <br><br>  This approach leads to the fact that the daily audience of users of popular applications is hundreds of thousands and even millions of users.  True, impressive?  Moreover, creating applications on the Facebook platform, as it turned out, is not so difficult. <br><br>  Much more difficult (and more interesting) question: How to make your application popular? <br><br>  Any (even offline) virus needs to overcome a certain minimum threshold, after which its spread will increase in progression.  But how to overcome it? <br><br>  <strong>The standardly used means of promoting</strong> applications on the following applications are as follows: <br>  <strong>1. Placing your application in a general listing.</strong>  At the moment, there are a little more than 11,000 applications in it, of which only about 100 were added yesterday ... It‚Äôs hard enough to swim into this crowd of zinger, each of whom wants to hit the target. <br>  <strong>2. Send an invitation to install a new application to your friends.</strong>  The relevance of the saying ‚ÄúDo not have a hundred rubles, and have a hundred friends‚Äù applied to the FB goes to a new level.  But if you do not have these hundred friends, then the matter will not move forward ... Trying to get crowded with strangers as "friends" and immediately offer to install your application very quickly are stopped by complaints to the Abuse Team and your account will be blocked without warning. <br>  <strong>3. Spam in personal messages or on bulletin boards groups.</strong>  It causes the same consequences in the form of an account lock (in my opinion, even automatic, judging by the latest reports on the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/11/facebook-stirring-up-anger-for-disabling-accounts/">Techcranche</a> ).  At the same time, spam is still present: after all, it is not at all difficult to create a new virtual Persian, quickly slip through - and not be afraid for his tomorrow.  But first, the effectiveness of such spam is still extremely low, and we will not descend into such a commonplace?  :) <br>  <strong>4. Advertising on the internal network <a href="http://www.facebook.com/business/%3Fsocialads">Social Ads</a></strong> .  Pay for the promotion of the application, which does not necessarily bring you money ... Perhaps for some it is an option, but unlikely for many. <br><br>  I‚Äôm writing about all these options not from idle interest - at the moment I have to solve the problem of promotion on the FB of our application.  The application is called <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/giftoscope/">Giftoscope</a> and is used for non-standard selection of gifts to your friends and relatives.  In short, the essence of the ‚Äúnon-standard‚Äù is that the Gyftoskop gives the opportunity to choose a gift not only by age, price and other standard parameters, but also by color, originality (from ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen the world‚Äù to classics), by utility (from trinkets to things make life easier), soft (from down to metal) - and so on. <br><br>  If the user enters his friend's name in the FB, GiftScope analyzes the friend's gender and age, as well as the interests that the friend indicated in his profile.  Based on this data, the NailScope offers various gift options, among which you can choose by applying different filters and introducing additional conditions. <br><br>  So, the application is ready and functioning normally.  Therefore, the question of its promotion is currently quite acute.  A legal tool for promotion, to put it mildly, is small, and I used it completely: <br>  1. Placed the application in the Application Directory. <br>  2. Invited all friends to connect to the application, but there are very few of them on FB. <br>  3. Placed an offer to try GiftScope in action and send a few gifts to your friends in your regional network.  I asked my friends to do the same in their networks. <br><br>  The result for this morning is 19 connected users, of which 7 are my friends.  That is, not at all thick. <br><br>  Hence the questions: <br>  1. Perhaps someone has experience in promoting applications on the FB?  Share pliz. <br>  2. Habr's bright heads will surely be able to come up with a new way of promotion - legal and effective.  Let's talk? <br><br>  <em>PS Well and, of course, I ask all Habralyuds who have accounts on FB to install the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/giftoscope/">Gyftoscope</a> to select and present virtual New Year gifts to their friends.</em>  <em>That alone will be a great help.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17533/</a></p>
