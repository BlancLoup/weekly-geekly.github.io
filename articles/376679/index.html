      <b>Design and ergonomics</b> <br><br>  Externally, the Z3 Tablet Compact is very much like the flagship smartphone Xperia Z3, so if you use two devices at once, they will perfectly harmonize with each other.  The body of the ‚Äúpill‚Äù is noticeably thinner than that of a smartphone, and it weighs only 270 grams. <br><br>  On the left side there is a connector for magnetic charging and a docking station, right next to it are slots for micro-SD and nano-SIM-cards, covered with an inconspicuous plug.  The MHL connector did not show up right away - it is hidden by the same subtle plug and is not in the most usual place - at the bottom end on the left.  The right side boasts a traditional round unlock button, a volume control rocker and a headphone jack, which does not need a plug (however, it is recommended that you do not turn on anything for a while after swimming).  The back wall is made of fairly rough plastic and the only noticeable element on it is the eye of the camera.  Compared to the Z3 glass back, the plastic wall of the tablet looks a bit more modest, but it prevents the device from slipping from different surfaces than the smartphone sins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ae/87f/2f8/7ae87f2f82d742cf80676bbd4e0545d5.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8d/12d/6ef/f8d12d6ef02148658c4507d663c1695c.JPG"><br><br>  The tablet is really very thin and light.  you can hold it with one hand without any problems, and if necessary (and having a SIM card slot), even use it as a phone, since the microphone and the corresponding application are available here. <br><br>  Despite the small thickness, the body is quite strong and well protected from deformation.  The ‚Äúcompact‚Äù, which many people like the inhuman tests for twisting and bending, endure with honor, without stains on the screen, backlash and squeak (although it should not be misused, of course). <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  The eight-inch display format 16:10 and a resolution of 1920x1200 provides a very decent image density - 280 ppi, which allows you to see the smallest details in movies and games, as well as not have any problems reading the text written in small print.  High-quality IPS matrix provides the widest viewing angles - when tilting, colors do not change, brightness and contrast are almost not lost.  It feels like the display is very similar to the one installed in Z3, and the lower image density doesn‚Äôt catch on your eyes and you can only notice pixelation if you look at it very, very closely.  A polarizing filter and the absence of an air layer between the glass and the matrix reduce the intensity of glare and make the image well visible even in bright light.  The display has a good margin of brightness and a comfortable level of illumination for any conditions can be called 60-70%, which has a positive effect, including, on saving battery.  The sensor is responsive, detects up to ten simultaneous keystrokes and has an increased sensitivity mode for working in gloves, and it reacts to wet fingers adequately.  The films on the screens are no longer glued - the oleophobic coating perfectly copes with its tasks, and the tempered glass is not so easy to scratch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/305/da1/14f/305da114f58843e7bb10e3f3a764f92b.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/152/2f0/d77/1522f0d77eec4a3eb6faa959d5cc3c86.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor with an Andreno 330 video accelerator and with the support of 3 gigabytes of RAM can provide lightning-fast operation of any modern applications and games.  Any actions are performed instantly without any delay, the interface, despite the large number of trendy graphic effects, also does not have the slightest tendency to slow down.  The tablet perfectly copes with the most "voracious" games like Asphalt 8 and Full HD videos.  With the settings you can not mess around and feel free to put everything to the maximum. <br><br>  The test results, as usual, you can see below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c68/2f1/874/c682f1874d114edd8032f13a18d598b9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  Taking pictures with a tablet is not very convenient, so developers, as a rule, choose inexpensive modules with a modest resolution for them.  The Z3 Tablet Compact received a younger Exmor RS model with an 8-megapixel matrix and a maximum ISO 1600 and a small set of additional functions such as panoramic shooting, Timeshift Burst, real-time graphic filters, augmented reality or, for example, the possibility of live broadcast on Youtube.  More advanced background blur effects that are familiar to Z2 and Z3 owners are unfortunately not available here.  The flash is also not provided, and, in principle, is not needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/567/d6b/0f4/567d6b0f49d3406baf19598afde7e09e.JPG"><br><br>  The front 2.2-megapixel camera without autofocus copes with its task and allows you to make video calls in any light and without noticeable graphic artifacts, although in the dark, of course, the picture turns out to be somewhat noisy, but the overwhelming majority of "frontalok" have this drawback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/192/51d/48f/19251d48f893432b94fa3997f29e398c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae5/770/4eb/ae57704eb1744d3280aa17952cce77c7.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/116/e5e/8a3116e5eb5b4aaf8d51bac208484a16.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/467/53b/382/46753b382c1e4e69afd09ec45fc3556b.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b9/1ba/1c0/1b91ba1c0c0947969d03ca30abdef357.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Connection</b> <br><br>  The Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact comes with both a 4G / LTE module and without it, so if you don‚Äôt intend to use the tablet in places where there is no Wi-Fi, you can save money.  A tablet with a SIM card slot can be used not only for accessing the Internet, but also as a phone - you can receive and send SMS and make calls, although there is no speaker here, so you have to use a headset or speakerphone.  In the extreme case, you can rearrange the card from the phone in it, so as not to be completely unconnected (although it should be a nano-SIM card). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/2bb/a22/8102bba22bee4a4bb369e7043adfe98f.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/f39/a3c/b0df39a3c014471e8484d92aaea48a52.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/5d5/f7b/8615d5f7b9364147b827f4094f82dfb1.JPG"><br><br>  We have no complaints about the quality of communication.  The device perfectly connects to any available wireless networks, works very well through LTE and 3G, copes well with geolocation, is friendly with all kinds of wearable electronics that require the latest Bluetooth and NFC, supports sports equipment using the ANT + protocol and allows you to connect external drives and other devices via OTG. <br><br>  Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact can be used in conjunction with the PlayStation 4 game console - the Remote Play feature allows you to broadcast the image directly to the tablet screen. <br><br>  <b>Multimedia features and software</b> <br><br>  Like the Xperia Z3, the ‚Äútablet‚Äù has significantly increased the volume of the speakers, which makes it quite comfortable to watch movies and play games with stereo sound without using headphones and external speakers.  The music also sounds quite intelligible, although at maximum volume certain distortions and unpleasant resonances arise.  The tablet installed in the docking station can be used as an unpretentious radio or a radio receiver, if the presence of swinging bass is not a prerequisite for you. <br><br>  Walkman player is exactly the same as on smartphones, so we will not describe its functions for the thousandth time.  In principle, it is possible to use the tablet as an audio player, but for this it would be nice to get wireless headphones with a remote control or smart watches like Smart Watch 3 to switch tracks and adjust the volume without removing the tablet from the bag. <br><br>  Tablet cheers copes with videos, regardless of format and resolution.  A regular player is friends with almost all media containers, and if something does not open, you can always use an alternative player. <br><br>  The operating system uses Android 4.4 with the possibility of an early upgrade to the fifth version (we are waiting for this just like you!).  Office Suite, Socialife social network aggregator, Deezer music service, TrackID music ID, AVG antivirus, Lifelog life tracker (SmartBand bracelet required) and navigation application from the famous company Garmin are offered as pre-installed software.  Through the application Xperia Lounge, you can access various free content - TV shows, books and games. <br><br>  <b>Autonomy and protection</b> <br><br>  The battery capacity of the Z3 Tablet Compact is 4500 mAh - this is not so much, by today's standards, but quite enough, considering not the highest voracity of the device, moreover, in practice, the Z3 Tablet Compact surpasses many competitors with more capacious batteries.  At maximum load with maximum brightness of the screen, the tablet works without interruption for about six hours, respectively, with daily use without turning on the power saving mode and a full set of services such as geolocation, 4G and Bluetooth, the ‚Äútablet‚Äù works from one charge for about two days, using the STAMINA mode can extend this period to six days. <br><br>  Like other Sony flagship devices, the Z3 Tablet Compact is protected from dust and water in accordance with the IP68 standard, which means complete protection against dust and the ability to work in water to a depth of 1.5 meters for half an hour.  I can not imagine who might need to lower the tablet under water, but watching the series in the bathroom can be without unnecessary precautions.  It is highly recommended to explore the magnetic charging or docking station, so as not to open the plug once again. <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  Extremely comfortable, practical, lightweight and thin tablet with an excellent screen, enviable performance, clear stereo sound, decent autonomy and maximum protection.  Perfectly copes with all its functions, and in the presence of additional accessories it can be used as the main and only means of communication.  The only minor drawback is the simplest camera, but, as practice shows, most tablet owners do not care at all. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics</b> : <br>  <b>Processor</b> : 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, 2.5 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot (up to 128 GB) <br>  <b>Video accelerator</b> : Adreno 330 <br>  <b>Display</b> : 8 inches, IPS, 1920x1200 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 8 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 4500 mAh <br>  <b>OS</b> : Android 4.4.4 KitKat <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP68 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376679/</a></p>
