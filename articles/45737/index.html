      This week it was going to happen in Mumbai, the Indian business capital: On the evening of November 26 " <i>militant groups infiltrated the city from the sea ... All Thursday military reports came from the financial capital of India ... 143 people were killed - <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/20081128131117.shtml">RBC</a> ), about 500 were injured</i> .  In general, <a href="http://www.zagolovki.ru/article/28Nov2008/gates">fear and horror gripped</a> Mumbai. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The attacks spurred an already strained relationship between India and neighboring Pakistan (the organization that assumed responsibility was supposedly based in Pakistan). <br><br>  The Europeans strained - the terrorists released (according to rumors) from the seized hotels citizens with Russian passports and held rich foreigners, Americans, for some reason there was practically no. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Perhaps Indo_Bzhizhnevochnye_gangsters want to show the West that it has no place in Eastern business ?!‚Äù</i>  - screamed the media. <br><br>  In addition, this is not the first carefully crafted terrorist attack in the past few years - ‚Äú <i>specialists have suspicions of the involvement of state structures of some countries</i> ‚Äù (the same ‚ÄúGazeta‚Äù, No. 227 of November 28, 2008, and Kommersant, No. 217 ( 4034) of 11/28/08). <br><br><h5>  What is the matter? </h5><br><br>  Who and why did it take to cut white businessmen in the economic heart of the Peninsula Dean?  Obviously, this is not a local religious-class disassembly.  It is also clear that the ‚ÄúMumbai Nightmare‚Äù is a thick batch of geopolitics and economics, flavored with a thick aroma of Togo_Samogo_Crisis. <br><br>  Let's see who hand to strangle the Indian economy.  This "one of the fastest growing on the planet."  This is an imposed <a href="http://www.centrasia.ru/newsA.php%3Fst%3D1043520960">Indian miracle</a> (India never ceases to amaze world analysts with the pace of its progress in the field of information technology. Aha.) <br><br>  In terms of GDP, India is in fifth place in the world, ahead of countries such as France and the United Kingdom.  This, in principle, means little.  But Indians who live on American (mostly) money have the audacity to oust America from their own domestic markets. <br><br>  Indian companies sell medicines to Americans, water them with tea, assemble cars and smelt steel. <br>  The company Tata <sub>(market value of $ 70 billion / Ford - about $ 30 billion, Google - 157 billion)</sub> , engaged in the production of electricity, steel business, software development (yeah), growing tea.  I bought a Ford (!!) Jaguar with a Land Rover. <br><br><h5>  Now it </h5><br><br>  In the United States, 60% of Indian IT outsourcing companies operate, which is about 1/3 of the US IT market.  And they gradually expanded their presence in America.  Until Obama. <br><br>  During the pre-election race, the current US president promised to stimulate the American IT industry.  He talked about the abolition of tax breaks for foreign outsourcing companies and the support of the "native" IT-industry, promised an increase in the size of public investment in science and high-tech research.  By reducing them for foreign IT-outsourcers. <br><br>  Representatives of the Indian custom software company Infosys Technologies <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news146117233.html">suggests</a> that the election of Barack Obama as president will slow down or completely stop the growth of the outsourcing market in America. <br><br>  Indian hackers - the thunderstorm and horror (along with the Chinese) of the American / British intelligence agencies - hack into the servers of hotels, banks and government organizations. <br><br>  America is losing control over its domestic markets, in particular, over one of the most promising - IT.  What can the States oppose to Indian monopolists / outsourcers / hackers besides asymmetric responses? <br><br>  Probably one of those are the Mumbai terrorists. <br><br>  _______________________ <br><br>  few numbers <br><br>  In 2007, India bought $ 5 billion worth of weapons from Russia and exported IT services for $ 28.7 billion. This includes both the export of IT services and the outsourcing of business processes (IDC data). <br><br>  Russian software exports (according to RUSSOFT) amounted to $ 2.2 billion. <br><br>  Here's another <a href="http://www.for-leader.com/rus/article_page1_theme68_item67.html">link</a> on <a href="http://www.for-leader.com/rus/article_page1_theme68_item67.html">www.for-leader.com/eng/article_page1_theme68_item67.html</a> <br>  ___________ <br><br>  upd <br><br>  The computer systems of the US Central Command, which is monitoring the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, have undergone an unprecedented hacker attack, Interfax reported, citing the Los Angeles Times. <br><br>  <a href="http://interfax.ru/news.asp%3Fid%3D48385">cyber response</a> (?) to Mumbai massacre </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45737/</a></p>
