The principle of operation is the same: the user, by selecting the appropriate category, creates a message, including in it a brief description of the problem, the exact location and, if desired, a photograph;  then the message is checked for compliance with the selected category and clarity and sent to the appropriate department, which, in turn, must give an answer within the stated period and solve the problem.  Services for receiving reports of violations in the field of traffic and parking work on the same principle, but are presented exclusively in the form of applications for wearable devices and the use of photographs for them is mandatory. <br><br><h2>  Government services </h2><br><h3>  Moscow </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af8/b7c/9ba/af8b7c9badc440cfa12498885f1d55a4.jpeg" alt="image">  The Moscow government was the first in the country to create a service of this kind, calling it " <a href="http://gorod.mos.ru/"><b>Our City</b></a> ".

Applications can be saved as drafts and sent after witnessing a violation, since all photos receive electronic stamps about the time they were created.  The service operates in all regions of the country, for which it requires registration with the indication of the name, surname and e-mail address, however, the applications indicate the automatically created address in the mail.spoutapp.org domain.  Although the applications themselves look and work flawlessly, it is impossible to say this about the department to which they are sending user requests, the traffic police: statements can not only <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/59293/">remain unanswered</a> by the inspectorate (this problem is especially acute in Moscow and St. Petersburg), but it can also <a href="http://paperpaper.ru/spot/">prevent them from being sent</a> .  For this reason, fines are issued <a href="https://vc.ru/p/spot">in a quarter of cases</a> .  Like ‚ÄúBeautiful World‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpot‚Äù works on the basis of 59 FZ, as well as <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2014/01/17/mvd-dok.html">707 edicts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> , which makes it possible to bring the traffic police departments violating this law to responsibility. <br><br>  Also, the <a href="http://rosyama.ru/">RosYam</a> and <a href="http://rosyama.ru/">RosZhKH</a> services created <a href="https://fbk.info/">by the Anti-Corruption Foundation</a> , which never had applications for OS of wearable devices, as well as the <a href="http://www.angrycitizen.ru/">Angry Citizen</a> project headed by the former Nashi Commissioner of Nashi movement, won the <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/own_business/27/10/2014/5447a1b5cbb20f46875b2428">tens of millions of rubles of state orders</a> , but already curtailed their applications for wearable devices.  Several <a href="http://yodnews.ru/2014/10/15/appsparkovki">other applications</a> created by non-governmental developers to solve the problem of traffic violations were abandoned by their creators. <br><br>  <i>See also:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271846/">Computer user corner: the secret of correspondence</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271814/">Computer user corner: melatonin and screens</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391895/</a></p>
