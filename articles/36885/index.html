  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How important it is not to recycle or professional combustion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The term ‚Äú <i>professional combustion</i> ‚Äù (burnout) originated in 1974 with the filing of the American psychiatrist Freidenberg HG.  This term has many interpretations and transcripts.  I combined them a little bit.  Professional combustion syndrome is a psychological defense in the form of complete or partial elimination of emotions in response to unresolved stress in the workplace. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The <i>risk group</i> includes people who are emotionally involved in the profession - insurers, teachers, doctors, journalists, psychologists, sales managers, managers, etc. <br>  It can also be people who are prone to pedantry and perfectionism in their work. <br>  Remember the remark from the movie ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù: ‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm Mr. Wolfe.  I solve your problems?  People whose problem solving is a profession are most susceptible to burning.  Interesting fact: women are more prone to mental exhaustion than men, but they recover faster than men. <br><br>  <i>The causes of</i> professional combustion are personal characteristics.  For example, low self-esteem, workaholism and, as mentioned above, pedantry and perfectionism.  Another reason: you work in a team, and the joint efforts are not coordinated and / or there is no clear understanding of the task, and the result depends on the coherence of actions.  Most often, managers themselves provoke professional combustion of employees by placing more responsibility and responsibilities on company stars.  Achieves, as a rule, a strong discrepancy in the words and actions of the leadership.  Here you can add the "nervous" atmosphere in the company, work in a constant work-up job, the conflict of a group of people in one company. <br><br>  Let's look at the <i>symptoms</i> .  First of all, the symptoms appear on the physical level: you begin to feel causeless fatigue, suddenly suddenly drop or gain weight, and the sleep is not the same.  Some may have breathing problems, nausea, dizziness, sweating, tremors, heart palpitations, etc. <br>  At the same time, along with the physical level, the emotional background collapses: pessimistic moods, deadly cynicism, along with a feeling of helplessness.  You begin to annoy the little things, there is poorly controlled aggression.  In the load may appear: anxiety, inability to concentrate, guilt, mood swings: from tantrums to complete apathy. <br>  Because of the uncomfortable state, you begin to change your working habits: increase or decrease the working day, give preference to standard processes, rather than looking for beautiful solutions.  The decision making process becomes more complicated for you, the results of work no longer concern you.  Most of the time is spent on routine or automatic action.  Removal from colleagues, friends, clients, increasing inadequate criticality.  And completes this bleak picture of the increase in the consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and stimulants. <br>  By the way, everything in the personal zone, too, to put it mildly, is not very: you are not interested and boring with your relatives.  There is a desire to buy a T-shirt with the words ‚ÄúI went into myself.  I will not be back soon. ‚Äù  Favorite until recently, football (macrame, a start-up - you need to insert it) ceases to please and you find more and more excuses not to go to the gym.  At some point, you notice that you celebrate the new year and your birthday at work, in a circle of colleagues.

      Found some symptoms in yourself?  This is a reason to think seriously and understand what <i>stage of</i> combustion you are.  Maslach says professional burnout syndrome goes through three stages. <br>  The first stage.  It begins by muffling emotions, smoothing the sharpness of feelings and freshness of experiences.  You know such a slight tingling inside: something is disturbing, but what exactly you cannot determine.  At the same moment self-blame begins and uncertainty about one's competence appears.  All this leads to a decrease in self-esteem.  Positive emotions disappear, a certain detachment in relations with family members appears. <br>  Second stage  Apathy and irritation.  You are starting to irritate any little things, customers bring to white heat, and the authorities want to knock on the liver.  Such behavior is an unconscious manifestation of a sense of self-preservation during communication, exceeding the level that is safe for the body. <br>  The third stage.  You completely let go.  And there comes complete devastation and indifference.  About such a person they usually say that he is a biorobot. <br><br>  But not everything is as bad as it may seem: ‚Äúsaving the drowning handwork of the drowning themselves‚Äù. <br>  First, it is best to prevent the third stage, and see the impending storm at the very beginning. <br>  Listen to yourself, watch your reactions and well-being.  Review your attitude to work: set realistic goals, do not take on yourself more than you can do, do not forget to rest.  It is very important to learn how to disconnect from work, even if it is the meaning of your whole life. <br>  If you are a team leader or a company, then it is necessary to pay attention to the distribution of working time of ‚Äúburnt‚Äù employees.  Saturated communication is recommended to compensate for periods of complete loneliness.  Your colleague must understand his role in the common cause.  Do not forget to keep track of the states of your employees and timely switch or send them on vacation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36885/</a></p>
