    <h4>  Simple users: </h4><br><br>  <b>"DoubleGIS"</b> <br><br>  DoubleGIS, <a href="http://www.2gis.ru/">www.2gis.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Reference information system covering 22 cities of Russia and Ukraine.  The package is implemented at a high technical level, there are versions for PCs and communicators (based on Windows Mobile).  The data and the shell are updated using a convenient specialized module.  Navigation subsystem allows you to lay routes, and taking into account local transport. <br>  <i>Comments: It is a pity that so far there is no Moscow and St. Petersburg.</i>  <i>Really convenient and very useful program that lives on each desktop in these cities.</i>  <i>Able to count routes on transport and on cars (more recently), and offers a choice.</i>  <i>As a directory of phones - simply indispensable.</i>  <i>So, everyone who drives on business trips is a must have.</i>  <i>Important: it is absolutely free!</i> <br><br>  <b>"Gogul"</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúNew Generation‚Äù, <a href="http://gogul.tv/">http://gogul.tv</a> |  Windows Web <br>  The world's first Russian browser designed for children and adolescents ... Many people care about the topic of protecting children from the Internet today.  Not having the opportunity to protect a child from the negative of real life, parents are trying to at least protect the gentle "flowers of life" from the Internet.  ‚ÄúGogul‚Äù provides parents with the opportunity to thoroughly inspect the behavior of their offspring on the Internet, registering and visiting sites, and attempts to open forbidden pages.  The project is controversial, but undoubtedly indicative. <br><br>  <b>AKVIS Sketch</b> <br><br>  AKVIS, <a href="http://www.akvis.com/">www.akvis.com</a> |  Windows <br>  Original utility that allows you to turn digital photos into realistic drawings.  Very useful development, which will be appreciated by all who dreamed of learning to draw, but did not work out in life.  With the help of AKVIS Sketch, photos can be transformed into sketches, as if made with a pencil or charcoal, as well as get the effect of drawing with watercolor. <br><br>  <b>Winrar</b> <br><br>  RARLab, <a href="http://www.win-rar.ru/">www.win-rar.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The famous archiver.  From year to year this utility only gets better.  In 2009, WinRAR, in particular, began to work in 64-bit versions of Windows, increased compression speed when creating RAR archives in systems with multi-core processors (especially noticeable in Vista and Windows 7). <br><br>  <b>The Bat!</b> <br><br>  RITLabs, <a href="http://www.ritlabs.com/">www.ritlabs.com</a> |  Windows <br>  The Bat! .. This email program is loved and hated with the same passion.  Fans cannot imagine how to work with mail using a different system, opponents wonder how you can work with a mouse, slyly playing with its name (Kill The Bat!). Be that as it may, this is one of the most famous Russian programs. , and in 2009 it was significantly updated. <br>  <i>Comments: About two years ago, Bath became uncomfortable, non-functional and in general.</i>  <i>The new version has not tried yet.</i>  <i>Probably, in connection with the updates, I will try to return to the good old Muschepoch :)</i> <br><br>  <b>"Maps@Mail.Ru"</b> <br><br>  Mail.ru, <a href="http://maps.mail.ru/">http://maps.mail.ru</a> |  Windows mobile <br>  Free navigation software.  Today, "Maps@Mail.Ru", perhaps the best among the free.  Convenient interface, efficient routing algorithms, relatively high scrolling speed of the map, consideration of traffic jams, good compatibility with the communicators  zoo‚Ä¶ commercial software products related to GPS navigation. <br><br>  <i>Comments: Maps are not always relevant.</i>  <i>Traffic jams are generally always by.</i>  <i>There is no point in buying a GPS card, and there is no point in buying - there is both a mailbox and DoubleGIS (for which, for example, you don‚Äôt need access to the Internet).</i>  <i>Everything said concerns the regions</i> <br><br>  <b>Mobile Macros</b> <br><br>  ArtePlus, <a href="http://www.artelplus.com/">www.artelplus.com</a> |  Windows mobile <br>  A small program for Windows Mobile.  Its main purpose is to record macros.  The user can automate frequently performed operations by once writing the actions as a complete application script and subsequently running it with a single command. <br>  <b>Imtec Battery Mark</b> <br><br>  Imtec Software, <a href="http://www.imtec.org.ru/">www.imtec.org.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The program for testing laptop battery.  Unlike analogs (BatteryMark.Ru and Battery Eater), Imtec Battery Mark not only shows how long the laptop runs on battery at maximum load, but also gives a general estimate of the power system. <br><br>  <b>"Autosputnik"</b> <br><br>  Navigation Systems, <a href="http://www.autosputnik.com/">www.autosputnik.com</a> |  Windows mobile <br>  Car navigation is one of the few niches that are actively developing, despite economic difficulties.  Navigation software developers are constantly improving their systems, adding to them more and more new functions.  This race, in our opinion, is still won by the Avtosputnik package. <br><br>  <i>Comments: I do not use it myself, but my colleague has it installed on the navigator in the car.</i>  <i>Satisfied, works well.</i> <br><br>  <b>Google Docs</b> <br><br>  Google, <a href="http://docs.google.com/">http://docs.google.com</a> |  Web <br>  Google Docs is perhaps the first SaaS package that has gained widespread popularity.  Millions of users got acquainted with the concept of SaaS because of it.  Not so long ago, the Google Docs system was integrated with the Google Translator, it had the means of creating macro commands ... You can say that Microsoft Office Live has a serious rival. <br><br>  <i>Comments: Yes, yes, yes!</i>  <i>Extremely useful service even for girls spending time on the internet in the internet.</i>  <i>Keep any general lists, share useful information, lay out patterns and other very useful information.</i>  <i>For development is available to all.</i> <br><br>  <b>Spb tv</b> <br><br>  Spb Software House, <a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/">www.spbsoftwarehouse.com</a> |  Windows mobile <br>  A package that allows communicator owners to watch online TV broadcasts.  In operation, the system is simple and convenient: just select a channel, touch its icon with a pen (or finger).  As a result, a video player is launched that receives a digital tele-stream.  The choice of programs is large enough, there are both free TV channels (from business like ‚ÄúRBC‚Äù to music) and commercial ones.  In the system shell, of course, there is also a heat transmission program for tomorrow or for the whole week. <br><br>  Movavi Media Octopus <br><br>  Movavi, <a href="http://www.movavi.ru/">www.movavi.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The program for managing media collections on mobile devices.  It solves a very painful problem of compatibility of formats of various systems when transferring video or DVD content to them.  The utility is extremely easy to use, it provides automatic recognition of the device type (iPod, Sony Playstation, iRiver Lplayer, Samsung and Nokia USB players, Archos and other players, flash drives, external hard drives) and the choice of optimal settings. <br><h4>  Corporate: </h4><br><br>  <b>"1C: Enterprise 8.2"</b> <br><br>  "1C", <a href="http://www.1c.ru/">www.1c.ru</a> |  Windows, Linux, Web <br>  The version number of the new generation of the 1C: Enterprise 8.2 system differs from the previous one only by one digit ... But in fact, version 8.2 is perhaps the most significant change in this product since the release of the 1C: Enterprise 8 platform.  The new version implements a wide range of new features and mechanisms, including the ability to work in thin and Web client modes, the ‚Äúmanaged application‚Äù mode, a failover cluster of servers with dynamic load balancing. <br><br>  <b>FastReport Server</b> <br><br>  Fast Reports, <a href="http://www.fast-report.com/">www.fast-report.com</a> |  Windows <br>  Powerful and functional report generator.  It has long been turned from a small utility into a full-scale system for developing and organizing corporate reporting.  In the modern versions of this package, the functions of displaying information in browsers, PDF, XML formats, graphic files, etc. are provided. <br>  <b>IPI.Manager PRO</b> <br><br>  IPI, <a href="http://www.ipi-manager.ru/">www.ipi-manager.ru</a> |  Windows, Linux, Web <br>  Task management system is one of the most mature products of this type in the Russian market.  This development has come a long way; many technological innovations and ideas were implemented in the PRO version.  It is worth noting the tools for combining tasks into composite projects (with the possibility of integrated tracking of the percentage of completion). <br>  <b>Naumen "One Window"</b> <br><br>  Naumen, <a href="http://www.naumen.ru/">www.naumen.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The concept of "one window" in the domestic government structures is taking root with difficulty.  And not only because too much in the measured life of the officials changes the existence of clear rules of work, there are also purely technical problems.  It is impossible to automate only one stage of work, a complex solution is inevitably required, and this is exactly what the developers of this system propose. <br>  <b>Parallels Desktop Switch to Mac Edition</b> <br><br>  Parallels, <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">www.parallels.com</a> |  Windows, Mac OS X <br>  A bundle consisting of Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac and accessories.  It is intended for a quick transition to the Mac OS X platform. Whether it is worth ‚Äúmaking a switch‚Äù is a separate issue, Mac OS X is also not a panacea and is not free from problems, but this kit simplifies the transition anyway. <br><br>  <b>Linter</b> <br><br>  RELEX, <a href="http://www.linter.ru/">www.linter.ru</a> |  Android <br>  One of the first serious DBMS adapted for the Android platform.  Linter was originally designed to work in conditions of limited computing resources with the ability to process data in real time.  Adaptation of Linter for this mobile OS opens up new possibilities for creating application software - after all, the first full-featured SQL server for Android mobile phones. <br><br>  <b>ABViewer 7</b> <br><br>  CadSoftTools, <a href="http://www.cadsofttools.ru/">www.cadsofttools.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  A utility for quick viewing and even some editing of drawings in popular CAD formats.  Solves the eternal problem of viewing drawings received from external sources, providing an extremely thoughtful set of functions and capabilities (up to the commands ‚ÄúBreak‚Äù, ‚ÄúConjugation‚Äù, ‚ÄúChamfer‚Äù, etc.).  Compatible with DWG / DXF, AutoCAD DWF and DXF binary files. <br><br>  <b>LEXPRO</b> <br><br>  LEXPRO, <a href="http://www.lexpro.r/">www.lexpro.r</a> u |  Windows <br>  Reference and legal system, characterized by very affordable pricing policy and very good quality.  Implemented hypertext analytical processing, intelligent search, rubricator and dictionary.  The positive consequence of the crisis that broke out at the end of 2008 was a slight revival among the background developers. <br><br>  <b>"EVFRAT-Document"</b> <br><br>  Cognitive Technologies, <a href="http://www.cognitive.ru/">www.cognitive.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The system of electronic document management "EVFRAT-Document" and in itself is one of the best software products.  But in 2009 an event occurred that puts it in a special place.  The developers have implemented the ‚ÄúUnderstanding of Documents‚Äù subsystem - it provides literally an understanding of the meaning of documents.  The system itself is able, without human intervention, to parse the contents of the document, recognizing semantic parts, such as company name, date or outgoing number. <br><br>  <b>DocsVision</b> <br><br>  DocsVision, <a href="http://www.docsvision.ru/">www.docsvision.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  DocsVision document management system is one of the most popular in Russia.  On its base, thousands of enterprises and tens of thousands of jobs have been automated.  The system provides the ability to implement process management in accordance with ISO 9001: 2000 (GOST R ISO 9001: 2001), automate workflow and archive documents, synchronize business processes and workflow in branches and offices, etc. <br><br>  <b>SuperMag MiddleOffice</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúService Plus‚Äù, <a href="http://www.servplus.ru/">www.servplus.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  SuperMag MiddleOffice is an industry-leading retail automation solution.  This product allows you to solve all the problems of automation of work with the product, does not require a fully functional corporate IP in each store, allows you to "bring" to the level of the office of the manager non-store functions (making decisions about purchases, pricing, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Reg Organizer 5</b> <br><br>  Chemtable Software, <a href="http://www.chemtable.com/">www.chemtable.com</a> |  Windows <br>  Windows has a weak point - and it is called the Registry.  This controversial place in terms of system architecture for many years brings considerable trouble to users.  And there was a whole industry developing software optimizers.  One of the best is Reg Organizer. <br><br>  <b>ABBYY Business Card Reader 2.0</b> <br><br>  ABBYY Software House, <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/">www.abbyy.ru</a> |  Symbian <br>  A program for quickly adding contact data from business cards to the phone book.  Foreign software of this type has long been known, but many foreign programs, unlike the ABBYY Business Card Reader (BCR), are not able to recognize the Cyrillic alphabet.  In work, the utility is extremely simple - just take a picture of a business card, after which the data from it will automatically fall into the address book.  For an OCR system operating under the most severe shortage of computing resources, the recognition results are quite acceptable. <br><br><h4>  Information Security: </h4><br><br>  <b>Data control</b> <br><br>  InfoWatch, <a href="http://www.infowatch.ru/">www.infowatch.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  There are quite a few information leakage prevention systems on the market today, but most of these developments are aimed at large corporate structures, while the SMB sector falls out of the view of developers.  InfoWatch Data Control is an example of the opposite approach.  The system provides monitoring and filtering of data transmitted outside the company by e-mail, HTTP channels or IM and prevents unauthorized communication sessions. <br><br>  <b>USB Safely Remove</b> <br><br>  Crystal Rich, <a href="http://www.safelyremove.com/">www.safelyremove.com</a> |  Windows <br>  Another program to correct the flaws of Windows.  Organization of management of USB-devices in this OS, to put it mildly, is not very thought out.  There are many problems - and USB Safely Remove solves them.  The presence of this utility greatly simplifies life and fans of "portable" programs, eliminating them from system shamanism, if Windows for some reason changed the drive letter assigned to the media when connected. <br>  <b>Devicelock</b> <br><br>  Smartline, <a href="http://www.devicelock.com/">www.devicelock.com</a> |  Windows <br>  One of the oldest developments that prevent leaks.  In 2009, this software product celebrated a kind of anniversary - 4 million installations in tens of thousands of organizations from the credit and financial sector, the energy complex, etc. <br><br>  <b>Safe'n'Sec Enterprise Suite</b> <br><br>  SN Safe &amp; Software, <a href="http://www.safensoft.ru/">www.safensoft.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The security complex built on the basis of proactive technologies: behavioral analysis and VIPO (Valid Insider Permitted Operations, profiling of the information system and differentiation of privileges when a computer is running).  The Safe'n'Sec Enterprise Suite is a continuation of a series of personal products adapted to work in the network environment of large companies. <br><br>  <b>Atlansys Bastion Pro</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúConceptual Systems‚Äù, <a href="http://www.atlansys.ru/">www.atlansys.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Package Atlansys Bastion Pro is designed to protect sensitive information on a PC.  The data is placed in encrypted container files or on disks, which, when connected to the system, are displayed as regular logical disks. <br><br>  <b>Handy phoneguard</b> <br><br>  Epocware, <a href="http://www.epocware.com/">www.epocware.com</a> |  Symbian <br>  A small program that acts as a bodyguard for smartphones based on Symbian Series 60. For all sorts of excesses, Handy Phoneguard automatically sends an SMS to the owner of the smartphone with the number of the new SIM card that the intruder inserted into it. <br><br>  <b>IVK Jupiter Identity Manager</b> <br><br>  IVK, <a href="http://www.ivk.ru/">www.ivk.ru</a> |  Windows linux <br>  The IVK Jupiter platform is little known to the general public.  This is a technological development designed to solve special problems, first of all - the organization of highly reliable and fully transparent network environments based on virtually any channels.  In 2009, it was supplemented by the ‚ÄúIVK Jupiter Identity Manager‚Äù subsystem, a tool for managing the identification of officials when working in geographically distributed automated computing systems. <br><br>  <b>Drive Backup 9.0 Free Edition</b> <br><br>  Paragon Software, <a href="http://www.paragon.ru/">www.paragon.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Infrequently, system utility developers delight users with free - and efficient!  - tools.  We can not fail to note the package Drive Backup 9.0 Free Edition.  This program provides all the basic features that you should expect from a backup program.  Make backup copies in a timely manner! <br><br><h4>  Networks: </h4><br><br>  <b>Remote office manager</b> <br><br>  Aledensoft, <a href="http://www.aledensoft.ru/">www.aledensoft.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  PC remote control program.  Despite the presence in Windows of a built-in subsystem of a similar purpose, many prefer the utilities of independent developers.  This system is a promising rival to the current leader, the Radmin package. <br>  <b>Printer Activity Monitor</b> <br><br>  Red Line Software, <a href="http://www.redline-software.com/">www.redline-software.com</a> |  Windows <br>  The old slogan of the Soviet period today can be reformulated as follows: "the press must be economical."  To establish the account and control of loading of printing devices is helped by the program like Printer Activity Monitor.  Such tools provide the administrator with the ability to centrally monitor printing on all printers in an organization, suppress attempts to use office printers for personal use, reducing printing costs. <br>  <b>UserGate Proxy &amp; Firewall</b> <br><br>  Entensys Corporation, <a href="http://www.usergate.ru/">www.usergate.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  One of the most popular Russian systems for organizing access to the Internet and protecting the local network from external threats.  In 2009, Entensys expanded the range of software products (releasing, in particular, UserGate Mail Server and UserGate Parental Control), but UserGate 5.2 Proxy &amp; Firewall remains the flagship. <br><br>  <b>Ideco ics</b> <br><br>  Aydeko, <a href="http://www.ideco-software.ru/">www.ideco-software.ru</a> |  Linux <br>  Internet gateway designed for small and medium businesses.  The package provides the ability to limit the effect of the rules for using the Internet by the time of day, session speed and interface numbers.  For example, it is possible at once, to the entire office, to prohibit visiting entertainment sites during working hours - and to allow after 18:00 (there are statistics that, with this approach, employees are more willing to work overtime). <br><br>  <i>Comments: All-in-one product.</i>  <i>From unchecked - for home network can be used for free, along with the mail server and gateway antivirus.</i> <br><br>  <b>Radmin</b> <br><br>  Famatech, <a href="http://www.radmin.ru/">www.radmin.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  The Radmin program withstands the onslaught of young and aggressive rivals year after year.  This utility has long become an indispensable tool for administrators in many companies and remains so to this day.  The main innovation implemented in 2009 by the creators of the program is compatibility with Windows 7. <br><br><h4>  Antivirus software: </h4><br><br>  <b>Internet Security Pro 2010</b> <br><br>  TrendMicro, <a href="http://ru.trendmicro.com/">http://ru.trendmicro.com</a> |  Windows <br>  Trend Micro antivirus solutions, in particular the Internet Security Pro 2010 package, have gained a lot of supporters in the past year or two, both among individual users and companies.  Software products for SMB and corporate market are renowned for ease of administration and reliability of protection;  Internet Security Pro 2010 package enjoys a reputation as one of the most advanced anti-virus systems covering virtually all areas of cyber-attacks. <br><br>  <b>Norton 360 4.0</b> <br><br>  Symantec, <a href="http://www.symantec.ru/">www.symantec.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Norton 360 is a unique system.  This security complex was created for inexperienced users, and Symantec programmers brilliantly solved the task.  This antivirus can be put on the computer of an elderly matron and not be afraid that it will call its grandchildren in a panic when each dialog box appears.  In this case, the system provides reliable protection, in the beta version of the package Norton 360 4.0 implemented the "cloud" technology Symantec Quorum. <br><br>  <b>McAfee SiteAdvisor</b> <br><br>  McAfee, <a href="http://home.mcafee.com/">http://home.mcafee.com</a> |  Windows <br>  The plug-in for Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers provides analysis and evaluation of sites that users visit during surfing.  There is something similar today in almost all antiviruses, but the implementation of McAfee is perhaps the most successful.  We can say that he turned out to be the first of the packages we tested, where the hand does not try to turn off this function immediately after installing the system. <br><br>  <b>Kaspersky Internet Security 2010</b> <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab, <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/">www.kaspersky.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Kaspersky Lab has always been at the forefront of the anti-virus movement - and the release of Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 has once again proved this.  There are a lot of innovations, from a powerful proactive defense system to the proprietary function ‚Äúsafe environment‚Äù.  The company's achievements have recently been appreciated by the President of Russia D. A. Medvedev.  We also can not fail to note such a wonderful product. <br><br>  <b>CureNet!</b> <br><br>  Dr.Web, <a href="http://www.drweb-curenet.com/">www.drweb-curenet.com</a> |  Windows <br>  With special feeling we award the title of the ‚Äúbest network antivirus program‚Äù to Dr.Web CureNet! .. During the year, the editorial computers were saved several times by the free utility CureIt !, which always took the place of the best of the free antivirus utilities, but it was difficult to use on the network .  Dr.Web CureNet!  solves this problem by providing automatic treatment of workstations in the office network. <br><br>  <b>Outpost Network Security</b> <br><br>  Agnitum, <a href="http://www.agnitum.ru/">www.agnitum.ru</a> |  Windows <br>  Network anti-virus complex addressed to companies from the SMB sector.  The system protects local networks from external attacks and internal sabotage (excessive traffic, virus infection, sending spam or intercepting data on internal channels), protects PCs in the organization's network from viruses and other types of malware, regulates access to the Internet, etc. <br><h4>  Sites: </h4><br><br>  <b>Sypex Dumper 2</b> <br><br>  "BINOVATOR", <a href="http://www.sypex.net/">www.sypex.net</a> |  Web <br>  Many site administrators will agree that the author of this utility would like to erect a monument ‚Äî it saved and rescued so many times.  A very simple and convenient program that performs essentially one function - the management of dumps (backup copies) of MySQL DBMS databases.  But doing this is not just good, but great.  In the second version of this wonderful package, a number of cosmetic flaws have been fixed, work with language files has been improved, a number of subtleties related to the latest versions of MySQL 5.1.20 have been taken into account. <br><br>  <b>"1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal"</b> <br><br>  "1C-Bitrix", <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/">www.1c-bitrix.ru</a> |  Web, Windows, Linux <br>  We marked this system among the best Russian developments for business last year and celebrate this.  The reason is simple: the developers of 1C-Bitrix again made a small revolution by creating the Business Processes module.  The genius (a rant, but it is justified) of the Corporate Portal system as such is that it does not require any forceful introduction.
