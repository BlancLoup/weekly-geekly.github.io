      <br>
      <acronym>PHP</acronym> continues to be the dominant programming language for web projects (at Freelancer.com), accounting for about 40 percent (61813 projects) in 2010.  This is the most popular category of outsourcing on Freelancer.com, which shows the largest absolute growth in terms of the number of requests.  There is also an increase in interest in the <acronym>PHP</acronym> frameworks which display the following figures: Zend Framework, the increase in the number of requests by 875%, CodeIgniter 980%, and CakePHP 551%, <nobr>i.e. the</nobr> increase is described by hundreds of percent, but they still do not mean the top 50 insufficient total number of projects. <br><br>  Often, <acronym>PHP</acronym> is a replacement for other languages, such as <acronym>Perl</acronym> (a decrease of 39% with 1,466 projects), ASP (less by 22% with 4,060 projects) and C (less by 31% with 5,297 projects).  However, the surprise of 2010 was the lack of growth of its potential rival Ruby, whose interest remained virtually unchanged (more than 3% to 825 projects).  Javascript, being the main client-side language for <acronym>PHP</acronym> , increased demand by 42% to 13,678 projects. <br><br>  Popular off-the-shelf software (out of the box) such as Wordpress or ZenCart continues to use <acronym>PHP</acronym> as the main basic language and it is likely that it also helps him to maintain his position at the top of the list for a long time. <br><br>  <i>Further, statistics on other technologies are considered, despite the fact that in this article the main topic is PHP, I think the rest of the information will be interesting.</i> <br><br>  Mobile technology has also grown very rapidly throughout 2010.  Suddenly, Nokia emerged from the grave with a growth rate of 8,700%, with 880 projects, it did not make it to the top 50 just <nobr>because of the</nobr> total insufficient number of projects. <br><br>  Objective-C applications (iPhone + 182% with 6890 projects, and the iPad debuted immediately with 2656), achieved a significant increase of 647% with 1472 projects, undoubtedly instigated by the output of the iPad and iPhone 4. Android from Google with an increase of 501% has 2813 projects, the expected release of a wide range of Blackberry RIM mobile phones also contributes to an increase in projects for this platform + 446% with 1702 projects. <br><br>  The demand for Adobe's Flash company is gradually decreasing (by 5% to 13,748 projects), apparently due to the fact that Apple blocked it on its mobile platforms.  Based on the growth dynamics considered, it can be predicted that the number of projects for Android will exceed the number of them for the iPhone in 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f7/43/f743507a01cc179219f566417040b19b.png" align="right">  The share of Microsoft projects has fallen dramatically in all areas, the demand for Windows applications for applications has fallen by 47% to 1994 projects and ASP by 22% to 4060 projects.  Interest in Visual Basic and .NET remained almost unchanged, showing an increase of 6% (to 12687) and 3% (to 3660), respectively.  Windows Mobile, Active Directory, MS Exchange, and Expression showed an increase in the number of projects, but did not make it to the top 50 <nobr>due to a</nobr> not very large number of projects.  The only bright spot was programming in C #, with an increase of 204% to 5,786 projects.  Azure volumes are not significant (35 projects). <br><br>  Searching on the Internet has never been such an important industry requiring high quality products and services, and good search engine positions have never been so valuable.  That's why more and more attention is paid to search engine optimization ( <acronym>SEO</acronym> ) to ensure high ranking and maximum coverage of search query options in the results of popular search engines.  As a result, we see an increasing number of projects in this area at an enormous rate: the demand for writing articles increased by 410%, having received a whopping 35,853 projects in 2010;  writing technical documentation by 138% to 6278, writing freelance articles by 269% to 9507, creating blog entries by 126% to 11394, creating review records by 444% to 6419, and rewriting articles by 845% to 20129 projects. <br><br>  Of course, interest in social networking applications continues to grow.  Facebook applications are leading (an increase of 364% to 11,585 projects), followed by Twitter (by 85% to 3066), YouTube (by 276% to 2836), and for the social networking engine SocialEngine (by 279% to 1224 projects) .  The general section ‚ÄúSocial Networks‚Äù as a category also experienced an increase of 75% to 8572 projects. <br><br>  Online sales are alive and well.  The number of projects for eBay increased by a serious 791% to 3,983 in 2010.  The number of projects for other online stores led by Magento increased by 182% to 3679 projects, for osCommerce the increase was 312% to 3473 projects, for Zen Cart up to 377% with 1444 projects and eCommerce up to 169% with 8618 projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114354/</a></p>
