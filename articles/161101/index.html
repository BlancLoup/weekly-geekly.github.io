  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And nerds do business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr saw many success stories when a huge company grew out of youthful maximalism and fun.  For us, they are divorced from life - another country, another time, other opportunities. <br>  But do you know a lot of failure stories that would inspire you to act, infect you with confidence and power? <br><br>  We love all sorts of motivational things and stories of people who have achieved everything with their zeal and perseverance.  Now you will learn about the amazing experience of an almost simple Russian guy - Fedor Ovchinnikov.  He is a former archaeologist who looks 20 years maximum and does not give the impression of an experienced businessman. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/728/bfc/cca/728bfcccade63f2513d725765191dc9b.jpg" align="right">

      He has not yet exchanged 4th dozen, but two books have been written about him, he was with Tinkov in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DcLtQHtS2W8k">Business Secrets</a> , became the hero of an innumerable number of articles and meetings, leads his column on slon.ru and has launched the second business. <br><br>  But why Fedor such an interesting person, especially for habravchan?  He is just one of many talented offline businessmen. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I believe that the book <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6109556/">‚ÄúAnd the Botanists Do Business,‚Äù</a> which Maxim Kotin wrote about the ‚Äúinnovative businessman‚Äù Fedor, should be read by everyone.  Spend five evenings to relive an explosion of inspiration.  It evokes special emotions in people with big ambitions, but who for one reason or another are afraid to get down to business seriously. <br>  During the reading, the name constantly worried me - Fedor does not at all look like a classic nerd, but what he thinks about it himself: <br><br><blockquote>  At first the name ‚Äúnerd‚Äù jarred me.  I never considered myself and was not a ‚Äúnerd‚Äù in my understanding.  I was an archaeologist, drank vodka, went to punk concerts, organized an NBP cell in the first year of university, I burned the American flag in the central square ... <br><br>  But then I realized that I was always a real ‚Äúnerd‚Äù for my business environment.  I was a ‚Äúnerd‚Äù in glasses for an Armenian landlord, for salesmen, porters, experienced businessmen and local tyrants, for thugs and reputable entrepreneurs, and even for my former boss, the owner of ‚ÄúCity of Master‚Äù Ivan Degtyarev, I was a talented ‚Äúnerd "(Marketer).  I was different.  We spoke different languages, we had a different culture, we grew up in different eras, but I needed to find understanding with them and not give in to them. <br><br>  I realized that the best word is simply not found.  Yes, I am a nerd.  "Botanist" in business. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>Why is this interesting?</b> <br><br>  With the complete lack of money, experience and dating, archaeologist Fedor was able to open his first intellectual bookstore in Syktyvkar. <br>  He was not afraid of high taxes, bribe takers, corrupt officials, authorities.  He was not convinced by the words of loved ones that it is not necessary to stick to it, that nothing will come of it.  He just took it and did it. <br>  It seems to me that the words ‚Äúyou will fail‚Äù should be heard by everyone in his life.  This is also a kind of incentive to prove to someone that you are capable of more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0d/6d4/482/c0d6d4482ce04168b039ea50322804d9.jpg" align="right"><br><br>  At 25 years old (2006), he took out a loan of 400 thousand.  He was denied a loan for business, so he took on consumer needs.  This was given easily.  He added his 150 thousand to them and opened ‚ÄúThe Power of Mind‚Äù.  At that moment, it seemed to everyone that the store on the 6th floor of a shopping center that sells intellectual literature in Syktyvkar will go bankrupt very quickly. <br>  But in spite of all the winds the store lived and even began to flourish, the truth from Fedor and his family it required huge sacrifices.  In a sense, this is similar to the American model: working for 18 hours all my life, not sparing myself, but getting rest and freedom in old age. <br>  Fedor freaked out a bunch of inexperience mistakes.  He managed to level many of them with cunning (in a good sense), deft moves and strict discipline. <br>  For example, when opening a stationery store, he sold office paper for the same price for which he bought, without reimbursing even the delivery price, working at a loss.  But it helped attract a huge number of customers to a new, seemingly uncompetitive store. <br>  Other mistakes, such as selling 50% of the business, were fatal, which slowly but surely led to the sad end of the first undertaking. <br>  For three years he has been balancing on the verge of bankruptcy, cultivating his own business, each time finding a way out in one move before the mat. <br>  He is an idealist and did not make money, but business.  He did not give a bribe, tried not to sell vulgar pop music like boulevard novels, he participated in all stages, from delivering and sorting books to placing them on the shelves. <br>  In general, a person with such principles must still be searched. <br><br>  <b>Why is it interesting to us - ITshnikam?</b> <br><br>  Ovchinnikov is a new generation businessman who uses information technology in his business. <br>  In the book business, it was not so bright - almost all IT was limited to his blog. <br>  After the store opened, Fedor did not have any money for advertising at all - he put everything in and the goods, having received the widest choice in Syktyvkar.  And he made a bet on the Internet.  On his website <a href="http://sila-uma.ru/">silauma.ru,</a> he decided to publish absolutely all the information about his undertaking: all expenses, incomes, decisions.  He pointed out how much his salesmen earn, how much he gets himself, the price of rent, furniture. <br>  Whether it played a role in the profits of the store or not is difficult to say, but it certainly brought fame to Fedor, provoked many offers from potential partners and invitations for interviews.  And this is despite the fact that his business was not at all large and barely balanced on the border of profitability. <br>  At the same time, the documentation he led in Excel tables, there was no trace of 1C, it led to a bunch of errors and problems. <br>  At this stage, the depth of IT penetration into the business was almost zero. <br><br>  The next three years were very intense.  Reading about his adventures, I myself was filled with emotions and excitement.  Despite all the difficulties that he had to face, I want to take and open my own business. <br><br>  After reading the book remains a slight bitterness.  Having gone through fire, water and copper pipes, Fedor leaves his book-writing business with nine stores with almost nothing.  And he made a titanic effort, saving stores a myriad of times.  Only his personal money Fedor invested several million.  After numerous betrayals and supporters, the partners practically ousted him from the work he himself had created.  Ovchinnikov sold his last 25% for only 600,000. Practically for the amount with which he started. <br>  But the extraordinary story of Fedor Ovchinnikov does not end there.  He is now 30 years old and he has found a use for his raking experience.  Given all the mistakes and vast experience gained, he took on a new business - more reliable - a pizzeria.  By the way, the name (DoDo-Pizza) was chosen for reasons: a sonorous and free domain name. <br>  Now he is still not retreating from his idea.  His blog is lively and almost all the details of doing up-to-business are published in it. <br>  Before plunging into creating a pizzeria, Fedor went to Moscow and worked in almost all fast-food restaurants as an ordinary worker.  He studied how the kitchen works, recipes, regulations, instructions, how the rules of the institution are followed, how the staff cheat their superiors.  For this, he endured exhausting hours in a hot kitchen, smoke in the face, monotonous work, uncomfortable shoes and separation from family. <br>  But I must admit, all this was not in vain.  After only a year of work, he sells 5% of his business for 10,000,000 rubles (I remind you that he sold 25% of his past business for 600,000).  His DoDo Pizza restaurant is considered one of the best in Syktyvkar and he actively promotes franchising. <br>  This time, the integration of Information Technologies into his business is much deeper. <br>  In June 2011, at the very beginning, they allocated substantial funds to finance the development of their own system for automating business processes and Dodo IS workflow, where the client is a web application accessible from any browser.  They continue to invest in her strength and money now.  Today this development is one of the main competitive advantages of the company. <br><br>  <b>Why is this story on Ivideon's blog?</b> <br><br>  Fedor is very important in matters of discipline and cleanliness.  He himself saw the attitude of employees to the standards in those pizzerias where he had a chance to work.  He could not allow this to happen at his place and brought almost perfect order in the kitchen.  The next wish was that the client could see in real time how his pizza was made. <br>  About a year ago, Fedor Ovchinnikov wrote a letter to Ivideon asking for help in organizing video broadcasting from the kitchen to the blog site. <br>  Ivideon always meets these undertakings and now on <a href="http://sila-uma.ru/web-camera/">silauma.ru</a> you can watch as cooks, prepare pizza and dodsters. <br><br><video>  http://www.ivideon.com/tv/camera/100-59a79692434867d7fa9d26f8bae1531a/0/?lang=ru </video><br><br>  Such a decision has caused many disputes on the part of readers, but we will set aside ethical issues and note that it is very exciting to follow the refined actions of chefs. <br><br>  By the way, it was after this small request that the <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/kak-vstroit-zhivoe-video-v-vash-blog-ili-sajt/">video embedding</a> service <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/kak-vstroit-zhivoe-video-v-vash-blog-ili-sajt/">using Ivideon on other websites or blogs appeared</a> .  We wanted to know how much it would be in demand and implemented it first for Fedor, and then for all our other users.  And a year later we can say that the benefits of this service exceeded all our expectations. <br><br>  Frankly, while reading up Kotin's book, I felt a bitter feeling of hopelessness from the fact that a major political player had almost taken his business, it seemed to me that it would easily break a person, send him into depression or hard drinking.  But the hero of our article is, rather, spurred on to the next steps. <br>  This is how the story of failure led to the story of good luck, which can be traced a bit with <a href="http://ru.ivideon.com/">Ivideon</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161101/</a></p>
