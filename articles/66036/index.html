  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Workaholic notes, or how I was looking for work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day everyone. <br><br>  I want to tell you about my work experience at different periods of my life and about what things I had to face.  Perhaps it will be useful to someone when looking for work and help to avoid mistakes at the initial stage of the career.  And so, let's go! <br><br><h4>  1. Work in student years.  Starpersky softdev. </h4><br>  While still a student, I decided to get a job.  The search for vacancies in newspapers and on websites with ads did not bring results.  However, I did not despair and once the work literally found me.  I sat in the Internet chat (html-chat of the old sample) and someone wrote to the obshchak that a Delphi programmer is being looked for for a permanent job.  I responded and after a short chat in private chat I received an email address where I sent my resume. <a name="habracut"></a>  The requirements for the future employee of the firm P (let's call it that) were much higher than my modest possibilities, but I didn‚Äôt lose anything anyway.  To my great joy, they soon called me and invited me for an interview.  In the end, after two interviews and a test assignment, they took me to work.  I was in seventh heaven!  I was not even embarrassed by the meager salary, I was ready to plow for nothing, just to work.  Work days began ...

      Here is the most unpleasant.  As it turned out, the average age of an employee in a company is well over 30. There were few young people, and there were uncles at the helm who were already over 40, and who didn‚Äôt understand how to manage a team of developers.  Terrible bureaucracy reigned.  The working day began at 8.00 and ended at 17.15.  The arrival at 8.00 was regarded as a delay, and this is the payoff and reprimands.  The dinner lasted 45 minutes and this despite the fact that there was no kitchen at all, I had to walk 7 miles to the dining room.  As a result, the entire break essentially consisted of going there, eating and returning to the workplace. <br><br>  But the worst was different.  After they took me to work, for 2 months I could not find a workplace and a computer.  I moved somewhere every week (usually to the place of a colleague who was on vacation at that time).  Accordingly, each time the computer changed, sometimes replaced by a laptop (this is so that I do not miss, probably :)). <br><br>  Another challenge was asking for work.  I didn‚Äôt want to sit idle, but I was in no hurry to hang up tasks (although weekly and monthly reports had to be regularly written).  As a result, I begged at least something and each time received completely diverse tasks from different people, which did not affect the results of the work in the best way.  Fortunately, then a bright streak went, they gave me a workplace, a computer, and a pack of work in which I dipped my head and didn‚Äôt want to climb out - it was so interesting, until ... <br><br>  The financial side of the issue began to be felt.  At questions about raising, the boss first pretended that he didn‚Äôt know such a word ‚Äúsalary‚Äù, and then when I persistently repeated that I wanted to raise he said a completely ingenious phrase: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre young, you don‚Äôt need money yet‚Äù (great sense of humor: )). <br><br>  Having worked in this office until the pre-diploma period, I took leave at my own expense, and after passing the diploma I left it.  No regrets. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b> <br>  <i>Beware of companies where people of old school are at the helm, prone to bureaucracy and accustomed to do everything the old way.</i>  <i>Carefully watch how quickly and efficiently you will be provided with a workplace and loaded with work.</i>  <i>If there is a hitch in this process, then rest assured that the rest of the company has a mess.</i>  <i>This option is suitable as a first job, but no more.</i> <br><br><h4>  2. A breath of fresh air.  Freelance. </h4><br>  Refusing to return to the P company, I again began to wool newspapers looking for work and found a vacancy for a technical translator.  As it turned out, it was a distant work, the essence of which was to translate technical texts from English into Russian.  I had everything in order with English (in spite of the fact that it was a little stupefied at the university) and I decided to try it.  Successfully completed the test task and I was hired. <br><br>  The employer got cool.  He paid not so much, but he was not a greedy one.  Always rounded up the amount in a big way.  And the work at first pleased - it was interesting - all the same, a new direction for me!  And the most important advantage is a flexible schedule and the ability to work just at home at the computer.  It was ecstasy!  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Ecstasy did not last long.  Soon monotonous work began to bother.  Orders were not consistent.  That they did not exist, it was a complete blockage.  Sometimes I was out of work for a week, but on weekends a pack of orders came - a weekend down the drain.  Quarrels with households have become more frequent - it‚Äôs a joke all the time looming before each other.  This is how the new fresh wave was replaced by the stuffiness of the apartment, boredom, lack of communication.  And when I suddenly received a new job offer, I jumped at it, like sinking at a straw. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b> <br>  <i>Freelance work from home is what many people dream of.</i>  <i>Free schedule, non-limited income, a kind of romance.</i>  <i>Do not build illusions.</i>  <i>You have to pay for everything.</i>  <i>In this case, the price of the issue is the lack of live communication, income instability, unofficial work, the need for tough self-discipline.</i>  <i>I do not argue - someone liked this approach, but not me.</i>  <i>So then decide for yourself.</i>  <i>And I shake hands with all freelancers (how did they fight on the same front :)) and we move on.</i> <br><br><h4>  3. Great outsourcer. </h4><br>  Having accepted the offer, I got a job in a large western outsourcing company in which I work to this day.  A young team, a good salary, business trips, a modern office with all the necessary infrastructure.  I like it here and I‚Äôm not going to change jobs soon.  One way or another, there are shortcomings and various kinds of shoals in the working process (the youth of colleagues affects), but on the whole, everything is not even bad. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b> <br>  <i>At the moment, a lot of Western companies open their branches in the regions of the CIS countries.</i>  <i>Do not miss this moment, until you have snapped up the most delicious jobs.</i> <br><br>  Well that's all!  Thank you for reading to the end.  I hope it was interesting and useful. <br>  Good luck with your job search! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66036/</a></p>
