      Mail.ru works much worse than, say, Yandex.  But people are stereotyped in their perception: they started a mail to Meil.ru for a long time (they say, at first it worked well when Andrei Yudin worked there as a technical director), so they decided to stay there.  And in vain. <br><br>  I would like someone to start a campaign, so that everyone would switch from Mail.ru to Yandex or other resources! <br><br>  Why? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And because on Mail.ru a lot of rudeness.  And indifference.  And indifference. <br><br>  We occasionally send out messages to our students. <br><br>  A third of letters, of course, go to the addresses of Mail.ru.  And the robots on their mail server put our letters in the spam list, and the mail is cut off. <br><br>  We call in Mail.ru.  We want to talk.  We are not connected to any of the employees - write letters ... But, first, how to write letters to the addresses to Mail.ru?  They are blocked right there ... And secondly, they will answer your letters, at best, with a formal reply in five days, at worst, they simply won't notice. <br>  And when you ask their secretary Katya (iron Katya spoke with me!) To connect with one of the employees, you hear: it‚Äôs impossible, it‚Äôs not allowed, I said, write letters. <br><br>  So previously responded to the party organs. <br><br>  The absolute majority of students passing <a href="http://school.ergosolo.ru/">‚ÄúSolo on the Keyboard‚Äù</a> ask us to always report all the news.  And now, when the <a href="http://narod.premiaruneta.ru/">voting</a> for the best draft has begun, they ask us to remind about this vote.  I want to go towards our students, but it does not work. <br><br>  For me personally, Mail.ru is associated with bureaucracy and complete indifference to everyone for whom (and for whom) they work. <br>  My advice: who has a box on Mail.ru - go to Yandex and other servers. <br><br>  We, the Internet users, must be active people. <br><br>  Of course, what can we demand from technical support to Mail.ru?  It also says in black and white that Mail.ru reserves the right to terminate the user‚Äôs account and any of its messages without giving a reason.  And Mail.ru is not responsible for the termination of user access to your mailbox. <br><br>  And many other interesting points.  But they are behind the times.  It seems to them that they will be the largest mail service.  But everybody is fighting for the user.  While the Mail.ru does the opposite ... That will remain with the nose. <br><br>  And there is one high-ranking employee on Mail.ru.  Her party name is ‚ÄúCho?‚Äù  The nickname was born when she asked%: ‚ÄúWhat do you think about social networks?‚Äù - answered, like Rabinovich, with a question to the question: ‚ÄúCho?‚Äù <br><br>  I saw this employee, as they say, live at one of the conferences.  Jolly sight.  Blondes to her far.  I know the surname, but I don‚Äôt want to speak. <br><br>  I will be honest.  With Meil.ru we still wrote off.  And they said that everything will be fine.  And we believed.  And repeated the newsletter.  And exactly 30 minutes later we learned that our letters would not reach the owners of the boxes on Mail.ru again. <br><br>  Maybe sue? <br><br>  We reply to every letter.  And when students ask us for advice, we cannot answer them on Mail.ru boxes.  We get tricksters. <br><br>  Your Vladimir Vladimirovich Shakhidzhanyan <br><br>  PS A link to your LiveJournal, which I recently started, I do not give.  That is, I am glad both those who treat me well and those whom I annoy. <br><br>  PPS I just received another message from Mail.ru (I quote with spelling preservation): <br><br>  <i>We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Unfortunately, in order for the recipients to receive this letter, it must be sent again!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sincerely, Tatiana N.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer support service mail system Mail.ru</i> <br><br>  This applied to the first newsletter.  We did so, by intuition.  But nothing helps. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75192/</a></p>
