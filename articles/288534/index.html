  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 24</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut text="  #24">  Finally, I can show my love for the readers of ‚ÄúKV‚Äù!  After all, only this high feeling could tear me away from the matches of the World Cup and sat me down by the keyboard and monitor.  Football, of course, is a good thing, but it should not deprive you of another review.  Although, I can‚Äôt do without the World Cup, so today's article is entirely devoted to him.  By the way, do you also fill out hand-drawn tables with match results? <br><br>  Americans are strange people (and for some reason they consider us strange).  They call football something that rugby is considered the rest of the world.  There are, of course, some differences (much smaller than between baseball and lapta), but the essence does not change because of this.  For some reason, they call normal football the offensive word Soccer and generally pay little attention to it.  In Jagg's blog, an attentive blog lover <a href="http://17ur.livejournal.com/145474.html">will find a wonderful parody of</a> the Americans' opinion about the World Cup.  The link can be read already translated version, and the original is in another wonderful blog - <a href="http://intheholynameofgod.blogspot.com/">In the Holy Name of God</a> (Caution! Severe English!).  I will allow myself a small quote: " <em>It seems to me that in this way liberals fill television screens around the world with unholy man-friendliness and are trying to convince people that Brazilians are good at anything else than living in slums and voting for the communists</em> ." <br><br>  We continue our tent.  What am I all about good yes about light?  It would be necessary to think about death.  How, for example, did it.  In his grim note " <a href="http://ffix1975.livejournal.com/545832.html">World Cup 2006 - Mortality during the championship,</a> " the inquisitive reader will be able to find several blood-disturbing references.  There, apparently, for the sake of the balance of the universe, links to the first beautiful goals.

      Literally for a moment, let's digress from the World Cup.  I understand that it is difficult, but still.  Artem Gerasimovich (pr-manager, cultural analyst, Belarusian and just an interesting person) wrote a wonderful, but small <a href="http://art23.livejournal.com/78020.html">article about blogs</a> for Baybanner.  Artem in his note answers two questions: 1. Why are blogs so popular?  2. Blog marketing.  Yes, the second point is not a question, but Artem, nevertheless, answers it!  The main result of the article is that blogs are useful.  I also join this conclusion. <br><br>  Armaturich shares with us the <a href="http://armaturich.livejournal.com/81728.html">vision of football from the point of view of Freud</a> .  I was particularly pleased with the comparison of the commentator with the talking impotent voyeur. <br><br>  Surprisingly, even women can not resist the charm of football battles.  Elena Sveshnikova decided to run a blog called " <a href="http://blogs.mail.ru/community/fussball2006live">Football Labyrinth</a> ".  On the pages of this community, Elena will inform you and us not only the myths about the World Cup, but also the latest results, as well as the statistics of the football festival.  It's amazing what people only do not get sick with football. <br><br>  Only seven teams in the history have become world champions in football.  I think it makes no sense to list them on the pages of the newspaper, but it‚Äôs worthwhile to acquaint you with one of them - Italy.  Of course, I‚Äôll introduce not me, but the blogger hiding behind the realcorwin pseudonym.  In general, he created a whole series of articles about Italy, but I give a link to the last part, which refers specifically <a href="http://realcorwin.livejournal.com/112191.html">to football Italy</a> .  Links to the previous parts you will also find in the article. <br><br>  And again we will distract from football and take a look at people.  " <a href="http://rualev.livejournal.com/225933.html">Epochs, people, deeds, destinies</a> " - under this name in LiveJournal you can read a note about epochs, people, deeds and destinies.  After reading the article, it becomes a shame for the past years.  Although there is still an option to die so that people remember me for centuries.  For example, Portia, the wife of Brutus, after the defeat of the supporters of the republic, committed suicide by typing a mouthful of red-hot coals. <br><br>  Not for me to tell you that the fans are different.  That is, someone likes to worry about their team, and someone - to excite the fans of other teams with their fighting qualities.  On Sunday evening (June 11), on the outskirts of Rostov-on-Don, the long-awaited fundamental intersection of the Wild Legion (180 people) on the one hand and Dynamo (St) + Rotor + SKA (140 people) fans on the other took place.  Photos from the party <a href="http://sholademi.livejournal.com/234911.html">are attached</a> . <br><br>  On this football review is complete.  Further simply interesting notes. <br><br>  Dimka "Meatball" once worked as a taxi driver.  Now he works as an unknown person, but he keeps a blog and tells how he <a href="http://freekadelka.livejournal.com/538626.html">mocked the passengers</a> .  I was particularly pleased with the phrase: ‚ÄúNah, for 200 I‚Äôm not lucky - a lot.‚Äù <br><br>  And we recently had a Miss Belarus contest!  In general, our blue-eyed has always been famous for beautiful women, but here competitions are held somehow not very often.  Maybe the climate does not have?  But Igor Karev decided to make a <a href="http://cheremis.livejournal.com/100491.html">hit parade of beauty contests of</a> all times and peoples.  Naturally, it begins with the dispute of three ancient Greek goddesses, which was resolved by Paris and the golden apple.  Well, as allowed ... Aphrodite became the winner for the promise to Paris Helen beautiful, but for some reason she kept silent about the Trojan War. <br><br>  Well, I conclude today's review of epigraphs, although they all start.  Thanks to Reverend Satanov, <a href="http://satanov.livejournal.com/399683.html">anyone can</a> begin their work with some obscene epigraph stylized as ancient Greek classics.  Resolve without quotes. <br><br>  <b>KHALETSKY A.A.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/177020.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/177020.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006250604.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 24, 2006)</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288534/</a></p>
