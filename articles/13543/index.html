  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to keep motivation?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No matter what we do, design or text, food <br>  or by math, everyone wants to be creative.  But often, <br>  that we are losing motivation to work, it becomes difficult to focus on <br>  project.  How to keep motivation throughout the project? <br>  Of course, people are very different, and each has its own formula for entering the creative <br>  rage.  In this article I want to offer some tips based on my <br>  experience, they may be useful to you, but to constantly support <br>  high-level motivation you need to pay attention to your habits, <br>  instincts and behavior, and think about how you can help strengthen your <br>  motivation. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Phase 1: Initial <br></h2><br>  Starting a project from scratch is the most difficult part of it, and the reward for it will come not <br>  soon, but if you want to reach the stage where your work will be <br>  rewarded, start with something you need. <br>  Here are some tips to help you get started: <br><h3>  Identify goals </h3><br>  It is much easier to keep motivation if you see where you are going.  If you not <br>  you know what you strive for, then how do you understand that you have achieved success? <br><h3>  Move progressively </h3><br>  Keeping interest and motivation directly depends on the likelihood of achieving <br>  goals.  Set realistic goals, start small.  As <br>  achieve your goals, and feel more and more successful, <br>  set more ambitious goals. <br><h3>  Create a creative lair </h3><br>  You need a place where you can work with maximum efficiency, whether <br>  dark cave, hotel room, or company headquarters.  Once defined <br>  this place, try to use it to the maximum, than great success you <br>  achieve this workplace, the more it will encourage you to <br>  creativity.  When I enter my office, I feel an influx of creative energy, <br>  Of course, to get such an effect you need to get used to your lair for what <br>  It may take a lot of time, but trust me this time will not be wasted. <br><h3>  Back down but don't give up </h3><br>  Never dwell on projects or problems.  If you immediately find a solution <br>  does not work, postpone the problem for some time, but then be sure <br>  go back to it, problem solving develops confidence, expands knowledge, and <br>  promotes portfolio growth. <br><h3>  Determine the optimal time for work </h3><br>  Just as the body has an optimal time for sleep and nutrition, the mind <br>  there is an optimal time for creativity (unfortunately this means that there is time <br>  not very suitable for creativity).  For me, a super creative time is morning <br>  but I know a lot of people who are more productive late in the evening. <br>  Try to determine the time when you are most productive and enjoy <br>  this less successful time try to use for administrative <br>  aspects of work. <br><h3>  Use the best tools </h3><br>  To work creatively is quite a difficult task, do not create yourself <br>  additional obstacles.  Calculate your requirements and necessary <br>  opportunities and choose the best tool you can afford. <br><h3>  Follow your progress </h3><br>  Seeing how far you have come is a great way to motivate.  If you rarely <br>  look back, start doing it, you might be surprised at how <br>  Much has already been done, and how much they have advanced.  At worst you <br>  see what you have done is not enough and it will make you work harder.  In any <br>  case, look back and try to objectively evaluate their achievements. <br><h2>  Phase 2: support </h2><br>  I hope that by following the above tips, you will successfully achieve your <br>  goals  But when this happens, sometimes from the initial stock of interest and <br>  zeal nothing remains.  In such cases, it is worth trying, something new, <br>  set a new obstacle or take a step back to return the old <br>  level of motivation. <br>  Here are some tips to try if you feel like you hit <br>  in a rut. <br><h3>  Do not set any goals </h3><br>  In the early stages of an idea‚Äôs development, or if you have found an opportunity <br>  experimenting, setting goals will prevent the spontaneity that makes <br>  experiments are so helpful.  Let the idea grow naturally, and when it <br>  be ready, start planning. <br><h3>  Make goals unreal </h3><br>  Sometimes it helps to lay out much more than in the case of working for <br>  visible benefits.  Unfortunately, there is a big risk of not achieving these goals, or <br>  burn out completely by the time they reach them. <br><h3>  Leave your lair </h3><br>  Despite the fact that creative lair contributes to productivity, <br>  sometimes it‚Äôs worth working elsewhere, maybe it‚Äôs not so <br>  suitable and comfortable, but can have a positive impact on your ideas <br>  and as a result for all the work. <br><h3>  Learn from colleagues </h3><br>  See what other people in your industry do sometimes <br>  is useful.  It can inspire new ideas, or at least give <br>  understanding of the quality of your competitors so you know what <br>  demand from yourself. <br><h3>  Ignore colleagues </h3><br>  Although observing colleagues can be very helpful, <br>  misuse of these may cause you to focus on their <br>  achievements and forget about their goals.  Worse, you can start <br>  doubt your work if it differs from generally accepted standards, <br>  whereas in reality they may just be completely unique and <br>  fresh.  Be careful and focused primarily on your work. <br><h3>  Look for external stimulants </h3><br>  We are surrounded by many examples of the creative approach of people and nature.  Pay <br>  close attention to everything that surrounds you, many of these things can be <br>  sources of creative ideas. <br><h3>  Look for internal stimulants </h3><br>  As it may sometimes be helpful to surround yourself with incentives, sometimes it can be <br>  useful and eliminating all external stimuli to enable the mind to <br>  self-stimulation.  Often running helps me find solutions to problems and new ideas without <br>  because I like to run, but because running is probably the most boring <br>  a lesson in the world, it allows you to concentrate on creative tasks, <br>  because the brain has nothing more to do. <br><h3>  Get a notebook </h3><br>  I can not express how important this is.  Ideas - whether they are bad or good - <br>  must be recorded.  No one can remember all of their ideas, and, writing them down <br>  future, you can free up some of the memory for new ones.  Stock ideas is good <br>  insurance in case the project deadlines are approaching, and inspirations are all <br>  not. <br><h3>  Work no matter what </h3><br>  It seems to some that it is impossible to make yourself work creatively, but <br>  in fact, it is possible and sometimes very useful.  At first it may seem <br>  difficult, but when you practice a little, you will be able to return motivation <br>  and inspiration when they are needed.  Even if it does not, continue <br>  work, often the results of work will seem disgusting, but not <br>  Hurry up with conclusions, maybe next time you will have a good <br>  Job. <br><h3>  Create an obstacle </h3><br>  Set a time limit, discard some tools, select <br>  more difficult direction, sometimes such obstacles lead to excellent <br>  results. <br><h3>  Eliminate unnecessary obstacles </h3><br>  Sometimes we set extra restrictions for projects that prevent you <br>  use the full potential.  If in solving any creative problem, you <br>  feel too limited in action, sometimes it is worth reviewing <br>  conditions and get rid of the least important restrictions. <br><h2>  Find your way </h2><br>  I hope that some of my advice will help you strengthen your motivation, or <br>  at least give a little enthusiasm.  Of course, in this area can not be <br>  universal solutions, if you think that my methods are right for you, <br>  great, but if not then luck, patience, experimentation and perseverance <br>  help you find your way to maintain motivation and inspiration. </div>
