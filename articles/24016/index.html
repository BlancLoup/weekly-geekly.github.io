Its release endlessly transferred - never the next version of Windows did not have to wait that long.  And when the system was finally ready, many of the new functions promised at the time were put on the back burner, and the scale of the changes appeared to be less significant than previously thought. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the result can hardly be called a failure, although it was also not possible to satisfy the overestimated expectations of the public.  Perhaps the promises will be fulfilled at least in the next version of Windows?  When the first rumors about the leaked Windows 7 alphas appeared at the beginning of the year, they were met with understandable interest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>When?</b>

      Microsoft confirms that the development of a new version of Windows has really begun.  But when will it come out?  On this account there are a variety of opinions. <br><br>  Usually between releases of a custom version of Windows, it took two to three years.  Windows 95 was released in 1995, three years later it was followed by Windows 98, and another three years later - Windows XP.  Slender picture spoils only the appearance in 2000 of unsuccessful Windows Me, but this system is not widespread.  Then, as many as five years passed until, at the turn of 2006 and 2007, Windows Vista was finally released. <br><br>  According to some reports, Windows 7 will be ready at the earliest in three years, and it is possible that later.  As one of the Microsoft executives mentioned, the system will appear on store shelves only when it is really brought to mind. <br><br>  There are also opposite information: judging by the published plan of the project, the goal of the developers is to release the product next year.  The rush is understandable: Microsoft probably wants to smooth out the effect of the ambiguous reception of Vista. <br><br>  Anyway, there is hope that Windows 7 will not have to wait another five years. <br><br>  <b>Screenshots and interface</b> <br><br>  In January of this year, an image of a DVD appeared in file-sharing networks, ostensibly Windows 7 Milestone 1. ‚ÄúAllegedly‚Äù because Microsoft, as usual, did not confirm that the uploaded files are not fake.  Naturally, enthusiasts immediately made screenshots, judging by which Windows 7 M1 is almost indistinguishable from Vista.  This, of course, does not say anything about anything - early XP or Vista builds also did not differ much from the previous version of the system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites//win7.jpg" title="Windows 7"></div><br><br>  Eyewitnesses, however, note that the gadgets in the leaked alpha are integrated into the "Explorer", and are not a separate application.  The "Add" or "Hide" keys also appeared on the gadget panel.  In the start menu, in turn, added ‚Äúpins‚Äù, allowing to ‚Äúpin‚Äù a specific menu item. <br><br>  As far as we know, Jensen Harris deals with this, having previously put his hand on the Microsoft Office 2007 interface. If the Windows 7 interface is as radically redone as the Office application interface, then it will be the most significant changes since the release of Windows 95. <br><br>  <b>Less is better?</b> <br><br>  All popular operating systems are cumbersome, and this undoubtedly applies to Windows.  Microsoft realized this problem to the full extent, but the train has already left - the measures necessary for noticeable ‚Äúweight loss‚Äù require too great efforts.  But it is possible to make some parts of Windows easier, and Microsoft decided to start with the kernel. <br><br>  According to Eric Trout, one of the leading developers of Windows, the kernel components in the new version of the system will occupy only 25 MB. <br>  Video: <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/352637/">Eric Traut talks Windows 7 and MinWin</a> <br><br>  In the name of the same goal, most likely, Microsoft will not include the new DirectX in Windows 7.  In addition, it will simplify the task for equipment manufacturers. <br><br>  It is also known that the OS is planned to be released in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  Windows 7 will be the latest 32-bit version of Windows. <br><br>  <b>What will happen?</b> <br><br>  It is reasonable to assume that the new version of Windows will finally implement the features that were announced for Vista.  For example, we can expect the emergence of WinFS - an innovative file system based on a relational database. <br><br>  Already in the leaked alpha, there are signs that work is underway on the ‚Äúhome group‚Äù function, which will complement the traditional ‚Äúwork groups‚Äù.  It will simplify access to media content (for example, music or photos) scattered across different computers on your home network.  It is also one of the unimplemented features of Vista. <br><br>  It is also expected that a feature called Location Awareness will be built into the OS, which will allow you to send information about the physical location of the computer based on network settings. <br><br>  But, of course, all this fortune telling on the tea leaves.  The history of the development of Vista has proven that the developers themselves cannot predict what functions the finished system will have. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/online/349407/">www.computerra.ru/online/349407</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24016/</a></p>
