It is far from the web, but close to its subject.  He wants the thing that he needs.  He has his own ideas. <br><br>  <b>How is he met?</b> <br>  He is greeted with a slight sense of superiority.  Immediately before the client‚Äôs visit, the manager with the designer, giggling, read freshly on ‚ÄúHell Customers‚Äù sites.  All morning they polished the layout and thought about transparent png in IE6. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What does the customer say</b> <blockquote>  I want a beautiful website and that there are banners, and in Yandex right away on the first line, and here I also saw classmates there a flash game. <br>  And of course with a twist. <br>  And I also need to write down the tags, I was here at the conference, they were talking about titles and tags. </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the manager feel?</b> <blockquote>  Here is an idiot God sent again ... </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the manager think?</b> <blockquote>  that we do not know, it is unreliable, 5 banners on the main one are trash, but we can do this, schA I will explain everything to him, let him not flinch and take what he has. </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the manager say</b> <blockquote>  Well, first we will do the design.  In the design you want it to be: <br>  nice with illustrations or vice versa just vebdvanol style? <br>  Here we will not do banners, so now they do not.  Flash game on your site is not needed, people play to go to other sites.  We will do internal optimization, and promotion is a separate service.  Kms we have our own, so do not worry. </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the client feel</b> <blockquote>  This pimple keeps me an idiot.  Okay tolerate </blockquote><br>  <b>What the client thinks</b> <blockquote>  I don't understand anything.  It can be seen very professional guys, earring in the ear even.  This is a designer, I saw this on TV.  You need to ask him in Photoshop what sites they do or how </blockquote><br>  <b>What does the customer say</b> <blockquote>  Well, show me what you did.  Yes, beautiful, yes ... But tell me, will I have a catalog on the site?  And orders immediately with payment in 1C go? </blockquote>

      <b>The conversation of the deaf with the blind</b> ends with the signing of the contract.  After all, they said "do not worry."  Lottotron is running, a ticket with the result will be pulled out soon. <br><br>  <b>The client will be shocked</b> by how the site looks, will forget all previously known meanings of the word ‚Äúrubber‚Äù, will poke at Kmsk's own design at night, and will try to read TK for the hundredth time.  Understand that all the same designers are very cool.  He learns that there are many paid services that he seems to need, but did not immediately say about them.  It seems inexpensive, but unpleasant. <br>  The customer will pay, but the sense of inferiority will increase. <br><br>  <b>A manager with a designer will</b> post a couple of quotes on funny websites, beg for payment, make scary eyes during a conversation with a client on the phone and sigh languidly.  The client will remain in their memory good-natured stupid.  Not evil in general, but stupid.  "Oh, our people are dark." <br><br>  <b>The next client</b> will <b>again</b> be told the magic words: <br><blockquote>  so now they don‚Äôt do it, design, optimization, hosting, another service, webdvanol, this is you <br>  did not order </blockquote><br><br>  <b>And the client killed the dream</b> <br>  He came for a short simple service.  He did not want to learn, he wanted a cool useful thing. <br><br>  No person would want to be listened to, spoke in an incomprehensible language, made an idiot and demanded to pay for work on the basis of a piece of paper. <br><br>  <b>After all, talking with a client in his language is another service.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118199/</a></p>
