  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jelastic - distributed Java Hosting Cloud Platform in ServInt and HostEurope</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://api.hivext.ru/xssu/cross/download/AWUCXVkBCE4wBGhAS0YNFlRNTERfFj8ZKHhwUhZHQAIPAQBCY1VLQEg%3D/view" align="left">  I am glad to share news, about the next achievements in the <a href="http://jelastic.com/">Jelastic</a> project - Java Hosting Cloud Platfrom.  Now Jelastic is available in a data center in the United States.  This is one of the last most important events for us.  Our new partner is the company <a href="http://www.servint.net/">ServInt Corporation</a> .  The official press release on this subject can be found on <a href="http://www.servint.net/pr-100411.php">their website</a> .  Now we are officially launched in 2 geographically separated data centers.  The first is <a href="http://www.hosteurope.de/">HostEurope</a> (in Germany), the second is ServInt (in North America).  We are very pleased that now our users have the opportunity to deploy their applications on different continents, closer to their customers.  Why do we cooperate with HostEurope and ServInt? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The biggest factor that influenced the decision-making about cooperation with one or another partner is the understanding of the technologies we develop and the great interest in the field of Platform as a Service.  In truth, when choosing the first partner (HostEurope), the list of potential partners was not very large, because  being the first is always scary.  However, HostEurope is the third largest hosting provider in Europe.  In addition, they are very progressive and loyal people, which in principle is a key factor for us at the current stage. <br><br>  After attending the <a href="http://www.hostingcon.com/">HostingCon 2011</a> conference, those wishing to deploy the Jelastic platform in their DC were already an order of magnitude larger.  We selected three of the most potentially correct partners.  As a result, it was decided to cooperate with ServInt.  The advantage in favor of ServInt was due to the high activity of people who work in this company.  After intensive work, during the integration of the platform, this moment manifested itself even more.  Very active and very smart workers.  Professionals in their field.  Quick response to every question or problem.  After that, we found out that the availability of ServInt according to statistics for the last 5 years is 99.999%.  This is a very high degree of quality services. <br><br><h4>  Other partners </h4><br><img src="http://www.parallels.com/files/landingpage/apac2011/GrandPrix4-small.jpg" align="left">  A few weeks ago, we came with <a href="http://www.parallels.com/summit/apac/2011/formula-1-grand-prix/">APAC SUMMIT 2011</a> , which was held in the Asian region and brought together the majority of Asian hosting service providers.  We have demonstrated the work of the Jelastic platform.  After this summit, we received contacts with the following potential partners in the Asian region.  Therefore, after a while, we plan to expand our territorial presence even more.  What is good for the end user (for developers and application administrators)?  Naturally, first of all, it is the freedom to choose between different data centers, so that it will be possible to choose identical services, work on the same tool in different regions.  The plans include the implementation of the ability to migrate applications between different data centers and the possibility of conveniently distributing the same application to different data centers, while ensuring the redirection of application users to the nearest data center.

      Everything else, we visited <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html">JavaOne 2011</a> .  We met with competitors such as Heroku, CloudFoundry, OpenShift, CloudBess face to face.  It was a very interesting event.  If an opportunity comes up, next time I will share my thoughts and conclusions in preparation for such events, as well as tell about new horizons in the development of the project. <br><br><h4>  How to choose a data center for the application? </h4><br><img src="http://api.hivext.ru/xssu/cross/download/BGBRBghTXUswUWxERkUBF1MZEEEBGz9DKHRwVEJEFQQPAQBCY1VLQEg%3D/view" align="left">  Returning to the current partners. <br>  If you are already registered in Jelastic, you can log in to any of the DCs you need without the need to re-register.  To do this, you just need to select the corresponding control panel. <br><br>  ServInt - <a href="http://jelastic.servint.net/">jelastic.servint.net</a> <br>  HostEurope - <a href="http://app.jelastic.com/">app.jelastic.com</a> <br><br>  Or select the desired data center at the entrance to the control panel on our website. <br><br><h4>  A little about future plans </h4><br>  The next release will contain an important update, it is the ability to build applications right in the cloud.  In other words, the git-push-deploy mechanism, loved by many.  This very important functionality will allow an order of magnitude to simplify the mechanism of deployment and redeploy applications. <br><br>  You can follow the news in our <a href="https://twitter.com/JelasticCloud">twitter</a> or on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Jelastic">facebook</a> page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130302/</a></p>
