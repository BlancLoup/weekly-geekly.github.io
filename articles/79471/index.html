How did the readers take the news, which news was interesting and which was not?  PC World spent enough time to analyze the statistics and found that readers were most attracted by violent video games, as well as readers were much more interested in the strange sights of Google Street Views than in Google OS. <br>  Well, without further ado, let's go to the list. <br>  Here he is: <br>  (descend from 10 to 1):

The article emphasized the importance of their new products (for example, ‚Äúridiculously large icons‚Äù that appear in both axes; ‚ÄúWindows 7 preview panel‚Äù, and ‚ÄúApple improved window management‚Äù).  A quick glance reveals that Apple and Microsoft borrowed ideas from each other for several years, and their newest operating systems continued this tradition. <br><br>  9. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/158850/the_ten_greatest_pc_games_ever.html">Ten of the greatest computer games.</a> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/158850/the_ten_greatest_pc_games_ever.html"><br></a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 500 thousand <br><br>  Nostalgia conquers all of us - ‚ÄúI remember when my mobile phone was more than my real phone.‚Äù  "Mom, what is a regular phone?" <br>  And PC World offers as exhibits - the 10 best games in history.  This is a nostalgic list of the top ten games to which we owe the most extensive coverage of the PC platform (which is why Tetris did not make the list).  The list of immortals opens the text of Trade Wars 2002, continues the list of the tangled world of Myst, the real-time strategy StarCraft, the builder of the megapolis SimCity ... <br>  And completes the list of burner-time, allowing you to renounce the world - MMORPG World Of Warcraft. <br><br>  8. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/169112/40_fantastic_timewasting_web_sites.html">40 best sites, time killers.</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 600 thousand <br><br>  Internet users are known for their diligence, hard work and endless hours spent sitting at the monitor. <br>  And the eighth place was taken by the list of the best sites where you can gladly kill time. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/167229/20_games_that_changed_gaming_forever.html">20 games that changed the industry forever</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 650 thousand <br><br>  Of course, this was not done without WoW. <br>  A list compiled by the GamePro publisher with over 650,000 opinions. <br>  The list includes: Dance Dance Revolution, Bioshock, Final Fantasy VII, Call Of Duty 4, Super Mario 64. And the number one of the most innovative games was taken - the greatest of the greatest - who do you think?  Of course, Doom! <br><br>  6. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/166000/worlds_most_outrageous_pc_cases.html">Best PC Cases</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 700 thousand <br><br>  Since the creation of the first Tower PC, people have come up with modding to redesign the computer in accordance with their aesthetic tastes.  They are probably the same people who install neon lights on cars and stickers. <br>  Perhaps they often asked themselves the question: ‚ÄúWhy should I settle for a boring black tower when I can have a charming Wall-e on the table?  ".  The result is impressive mods examples. <br>  In particular, R2-D2, Bender and even a bottle of whiskey. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/165546/the_10_dumbest_tech_products_so_far.html">10 most incomprehensible gadgets</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 750 thousand <br><br>  Have you ever tried to look at some wild gadgets?  Probably everyone asks, who, actually, who invents it in reality? <br>  PC World, of course, in its slide show presents a collection of gadgets that make you think: ‚ÄúWhat were they thinking at all?‚Äù Singing deer head, Nitendo VirtualBoy, strange keyboard with hot keys for phrases like ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù And ‚Äúclear‚Äù ?!  Get to know these crazy products that have ever appeared on the market. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/156388/best_products_of_ces_2009_let_us_introduce_you.html">Let me introduce you: The best products of CES 2009.</a> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/156388/best_products_of_ces_2009_let_us_introduce_you.html"><br></a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 750 thousand <br><br>  The International Consumer Electronics Show is held annually in early January in Las Vegas.  Most of the hot new products of the year - from concepts to rumors - let me introduce.  Among the hot points, it was announced about the Palm Pre Boxee (open source, designed for streaming to your TV) and the Kodak ZX1, as well as many other handheld HD video cameras, ready to compete with the HD Flip Mino. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/162166/facebook_pages_wed_like_to_see.html">Who is missing on Facebook</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 800 thousand <br><br>  Every now and then, PCWorld does without a direct evaluation of products and instructions (How-To) on articles that make them known - for a funny story.  This is one of those cases.  It displays Facebook, if famous characters had got on it.  Starting with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, ending with H. Clinton with Satan. <br>  Although all of these pages (sketches) are jokes, some of the heres have their own real Facebook pages. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/161392/strangest_sights_in_google_street_views.html">Strange sights of Google Street Views</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> 829,891. <br><br>  Since Google presented its maps with the Street View function, people all over the world began to look for strange things and interesting sights (no one doubted how much free time they had).  Of course, a certain number of people (829891, to be precise) cannot afford to spend long hours running the streets of the virtual city of Futyu, Japan, to search for unusual images. <br>  In this article, you can see all sorts of crazy things, such as a car hung with stickers or a dinosaur running from a museum. <br><br>  And in the first place ... drum roll ... <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/161180/the_most_violent_video_games_ever_made.html">The most violent games in history.</a> <br><br>  <b>Number of views:</b> over 1 million <br><br>  It seems that video games are in special demand among readers - and what can make a hot topic even hotter?  Gratuitous violence, of course!  Here are 15 of the most brutal video games that ever hit the shelves - rated "M" (18+).  Games in which bloody sprays and kill zombies simply abound.  The list compiled using GamePro includes Doom (again!), As well as the increasingly popular franchise Grand Theft Auto, and the incredibly atmospheric Silent Hill. <br><br>  PS: blots and inaccuracies of the translation will be happy to correct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79471/</a></p>
