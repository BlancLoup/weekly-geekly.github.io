He himself hinted at this at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/95420/">the D8: All Things Digital Conference</a> - Steve said a few interesting things about the future of the Apple iPad: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Äú... the device is already almost perfect now, because you can do anything on it.  The software is getting better and better, in the near future it will be possible to edit videos, photos and do things that were previously available only for desktop systems ... " <br>  ‚ÄúWhen we were an‚Äú agricultural ‚Äùnation, all the cars on the continent were trucks.  However, over time, people began to move to the cities and change to cars.  I think the PC is now like a truck.  Fewer people will need them. ‚Äù

      And it can be assumed that Apple itself persuaded Microsoft to release Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with support for Apple iPhone OS developers (just like Apple persuaded Microsoft to release MS Office &amp; MS Internet Explorer for Apple MacOS in 1997) - possibly paying decent prices. money - after all, Microsoft is clearly not interested in Microsoft in the release of Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with support for the Apple iPhone OS. <br>  Well, Microsoft, in the case of a concession for Apple, could of course begin to demand from Apple (except money) the signing of a partnership agreement, and of course - the integration of its Microsoft Bing services into the iPhone OS - as a mutual concession. <br>  (It is possible that Microsoft doesn‚Äôt even realize that Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with support for Apple iPhone OS developers may be a ‚ÄúTrojan‚Äù horse for the Microsoft Windows platform - since the more professional software will be transferred to the Apple iPhone OS, the smaller end users will need the Microsoft Windows platform ...) <br><br>  Microsoft has already denied rumors about the participation of Steve Ballmer in the conference developers WWDC `10.  But it‚Äôs quite possible that the head of Microsoft, but the head of the Microsoft Developer Network, may speak at WWDC. <br>  And with this, Microsoft can alleviate the sensation somewhat by showing its not very strong interest in supporting Apple, and perhaps even disguising the strategic alliance of Apple &amp; Microsoft against the adversaries from Google (promoting Google Android - a clearly strong competitor for the Apple iPhone OS). <br><br>  In my opinion, the rumors about Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 with Apple iPhone OS support and about the integration of Microsoft Bing services into iPhone OS appeared obviously not without reason, and some negotiations between Apple and Microsoft can go at full speed (perhaps very difficult negotiations). <br>  Whether they will result in the signing (or renewal) of a non-advertised (secret) partnership agreement between Apple and Microsoft, as was the case in 1997, is unknown ... <br><br>  PS: This is just thinking out loud - I ask for indulgence (with patience and love) to take my thoughts and thirst to hear your comments on this topic :) <br>  - Unfortunately, we, most likely, will never know about behind-the-scenes relations (negotiations) between Apple &amp; Microsoft, well, actually, exactly the same details of the former "partner" relations of Apple &amp; Google. <br>  - The XXI century is in the courtyard and modern global business involves close cooperation and collusion with partners and enemies, and who is who is sometimes almost impossible to define :( </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95665/</a></p>
