We, Yandex.Taxi and Uber, decided to combine our services and businesses in Russia, as well as in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan.  Together we will build a ‚Äúpersonal public transport‚Äù - an alternative to a private car, bus or subway. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f41/e68/95e/f41e6895e31bad5f519b8836545502ef.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Here is the combined platform in June figures: <br><br><ul><li>  127 cities, 6 countries; </li><li>  35 million trips per month; </li><li>  7.9 billion rubles the total cost of travel per month. </li></ul><br>  Experts estimate the total cost of travel of legal carriers in Russia at 501 billion rubles in 2016 ( <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3299840">VTB Capital</a> ).  At the same time, the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù segment was <a href="http://ac.gov.ru/files/content/8176/issledovanie-ac-taksi-pdf.pdf">estimated by the</a> Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation at 116 billion rubles in 2015.  Thus, the share of the combined company in Russia in 2016 would be about 5-6% for this indicator.

      Taxi consumption is constantly growing, and we are witnessing this process.  It seems to many of us that everyone took a taxi a long time ago, but in fact we are only at the very beginning.  Our goal is to create a platform, the convenience and accessibility of which will be comparable to both private cars and public transport.  Now how it will look. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After merging, nothing will change for the users of both taxi services: both applications, Yandex.Taxi and Uber, will still be available for ordering trips.  Drivers will be combined into a single platform.  This will allow them in one application to receive orders from both Yandex.Taxi and Uber.  Such a combination will significantly increase the number of available cars, reduce the waiting time and idle run.  All this will allow drivers to receive more orders per hour, and passengers - to keep the affordable cost of the trip. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUnder the hood‚Äù our order distribution algorithms and Yandex navigation and cartographic technologies will work.  Over the past year, we have made several qualitative leaps in technology that ensure optimal machine utilization.  For example, now at rush hour drivers make 30% more trips than before.  Combining platforms will provide an opportunity to make another breakthrough in the quality of service and efficiency of drivers. <br><br>  In addition, we have agreed with Uber on a roaming agreement for all countries where companies operate.  For example, arriving in London or Bangkok, you can order Uber from the Yandex.Taxi application, and tourists from Paris can order Yandex.Taxi from the Uber application. <br><br>  We will also continue to develop the technology of an unmanned vehicle, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/yandexs-on-demand-taxi-service-debuts-its-self-driving-car-project/">first successes of</a> which were published a few weeks ago.  We use many years of accumulated experience of our engineers, their knowledge in computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning.  I hope that soon there will be something to boast :) <br><br>  UberEATS will continue its development in the new company.  This is the most complex logistics service, in which the international experience of UberEATS and the pedestrian routing technology Yandex. Map will help us. <br><br>  Uber and Yandex decided to invest in the new company 225 and 100 million dollars, respectively, valuing the combined company at 3.725 billion dollars.  At 59.3%, the company will be owned by Yandex, by 36.6% - by Uber, and by 4.1% - by employees of the combined company.  Our teams will be merged.  I become the CEO of the combined company. <br><br>  I would also like to thank the Yandex.Taxi team for building an incredible service and successful business.  This is one of the strongest teams I've ever worked for.  Now we are joined by a talented and equally successful Uber team - and we are very happy about it!  An important task for me and for all of us after unification will be to unite two teams into one, combining our experience and the best ideas. <br><br>  The deal, which will result in a new company, still has to go through a process of regulatory approval. <br><br>  Welcome to the new company, friends!  :) <br><br>  Tigran Khudaverdyan <br>  CEO <br>  Yandex.Taxi </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332988/</a></p>
