About ten of them invent and design applications for customers and have a normal portfolio.  The rest of the developers are rented out "for rent" or have not done the work yet. <br><br>  Imagine yourself in the place of the customer.  Where should he turn?  All ten studios operate in approximately the same price range and have developed a ‚Äústrong‚Äù portfolio.  Who better to cope with the task?  Studios should answer this question themselves.  Understand what and how to do best and tell how they differ from others.  Then the customer will compare the studio specialization with his task and turn to the right place. <br><br>  Read more about positioning in the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/terekhovandrey/ss-15189743">presentation by</a> Andrei Terekhov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/terekhov/" class="user_link">Terekhov</a> ).

      And I will tell you about the positioning of three mobile studios: GALS Coft, e-Legion and Touch Instinct. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90d/f0f/8f7/90df0f8f7c9c755db00885497b3cd3e0.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57f/d3e/317/57fd3e31710ff690a58b27dfad11ceac.jpg" alt="GALS Soft - filming movies"></div><br>  <b>DO NOT work with</b> <br><ul><li>  private individuals; </li><li>  companies with clear technical specifications; </li><li>  budgets less than 1.5 million rubles; </li><li>  on project support. </li></ul><br><br>  In <a href="http://galssoft.ru/">GALS Soft,</a> to describe their positioning, they invented their own coordinate system.  So there are three types of projects: <br><br>  1. Innovative projects.  Come up with a solution that was not there before. <br>  2. Typical solutions and products (banking applications, media, cms like <a href="http://www.octopod.com/">octopod</a> ).  The customer does not need a specialized solution. <br>  3. Support and clean work on the TC.  Conveyor, low cost, many novice developers. <br><br>  Working on each type of project requires completely different people and processes, so the mobile studio is good at doing only one type of project. <br><br>  GALS Soft does projects of the first type only.  And doing the model filming the movie.  There is a budget for it going "star" experts, make a cool project and diverge.  Although there is a difference.  Not random people are recruited to the project, the ‚Äúactors‚Äù either have already worked on other projects or ‚Äúare casting‚Äù on a small task from a real project. <br><br>  It is difficult to imagine Brad Pete, who would be sitting on the salary in the company.  So in GALS Soft for each project recruited the most appropriate team.  The studio itself employs several key people: a technical architect, product managers, designers. <br><br>  Project support is not provided, it is the task of the third type of companies.  The development of projects takes place in large blocks with a mandatory redesign. <br><br>  The project is divided into two stages: design and development.  Until the design is completed, the development cost is unknown, only the order.  The project in GALS Soft is led by the product manager and technical manager. <br><br>  The product manager interacts with the customer, comes up with the idea, designs the application and monitors the work.  Products are mobile applications bison, GALS Soft abandoned close-up girls accounts, they reduce the company's professionalism in the eyes of the client to its level. <br><br>  The technical master breaks the designed application into tasks, cuts into the basecamp and controls the work of the contracting developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/002/efd/5d4/002efd5d4d3e5c91883762b44a124823.png" alt="structure GALS Soft"><br><br><h4>  Example: <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/9fe01cfb-741f-40cf-a430-8e1389756029">MVideo for Windows 8</a> </h4><br>  GALS Soft has developed an application architecture, designed an interface.  For the design, they attracted a designer who draws only Windows Phone / Windows 8 applications, for development - the company Sly Lamb (http://slylamb.com/).  Sly Lamb is one of the first in Russia to start developing for Windows Phone / Windows 8 and specializes exclusively in these platforms. <br><br>  Another example is the <a href="http://galssoft.ru/Project/11/">development of the Kommersant application</a> . <br><br>  GALS Soft constantly updates the list of potential contractors for projects: designers, technical architects, server developers, mobile outsourcers.  If you want to get there, write to <a href="">job@galssoft.ru</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22a/2a2/4a6/22a2a24a67f8261e3921629f2f09228e.jpg" alt="e-Legion - corporate apps"></div><br>  The strength of the <a href="http://e-legion.ru/">e-Legion</a> is the development of applications for the largest companies.  Where coordination processes are complex and responsibility is blurred.  Where 20 people from 5 departments participate in the color matching of the button.  State customers, a bad dream for many studios, do not frighten e-Legion at all. <br><br>  The ideal customer is a bank, airline, government agency or large holding that requires at least annual development and application support.  e-Legion works with Yandex, Mail.ru, Raiffeisen-bank. <br><br>  Secret Sauce - project managers grown within the company on large and difficult customers.  They are stressful, calm, able to bypass the bureaucracy, smooth down shoals and difficult situations. <br><br>  Experience is important for working with large customers.  The bank is more willing to order development from a mobile contractor with experience in developing banking applications.  Such a contractor knows where complications can arise and warn the customer and the team. <br><br>  70% of customers work with e-Legion on Time &amp; Material.  First, the project is designed, then developed.  The customer is given a rough estimate, payment is taken according to the time actually spent by the staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41c/e58/2e9/41ce582e987c61f3dec6ef15f5be20e6.png" alt="e-Legion structure"><br><br>  Much attention in the e-Legion is given to work with the expectations of the client.  The development process is the most transparent and comfortable for the client.  It helps to build long-term relationships and avoid conflicts when working on t &amp; m. <br><br>  To become even closer to customers, e-Legion itself becomes a corporation.  He teamed up with the <a href="http://dz.ru/">Digital Zone</a> .  The holding has offices in 5 cities and plans to absorb a couple more companies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f27/a3a/fab/f27a3afab23c16d29a6ae5ed6eccb085.jpg" alt="Touch Instinct - our applications work"></div><br>  <a href="http://touchin.ru/">We</a> believe that the success of an application depends not only on the design and development of the application.  Employing profitable applications in Russia can be counted on fingers: Litres, Alfa Bank, Lingua Leo, Delivery Club.  Behind success is not development, but a strong team of mobile products, marketers and analysts.  As our experience shows, other companies are not able to assemble such a strong team.  Therefore, we decided to collect it from us and rent it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/6cf/5fc/8396cf5fc7d7ef5654af2c845244594c.png" alt="Touch Instinct structure"><br><br>  Each client is assigned a product manager.  It does not change until the end of the work with the client and oversees all project activities.  Products understand mobile strategy, user behavior, analytics, promotion and other things necessary for success.  In addition, the product is the person who <b>cares</b> , the carrier of the vision of the project. <br><br>  Work process: <br><ol><li>  market research; </li><li>  formulation of company application strategies and KPIs; </li><li>  design and development; </li><li>  content filling (if required); </li><li>  project promotion; </li><li>  analytics (flurry, heatma.ps, user reviews); </li><li>  goto 2. </li></ol><br><br>  After analytics, we return to the mobile strategy, either we understand that it is correct, or we change it and try it first. <br><br>  KPI (or performance indicators) is the guiding star of the project.  Design, development and promotion strive for the same goal to increase performance indicators.  KPIs depend on mobile strategy and can be completely different: profit from the application, number of active users, user satisfaction, virality ... <br><br><h4>  Technosila Example </h4><br>  After research, it turned out that it was impossible to sell refrigerators through an iPhone application.  Therefore, we decided to collect and grow in an application loyal to the brand audience.  The application will be frequently-updated items at a discount, auction and unusual products.  All positions are cheaper than 3,000 rubles.  KPI - the number of active audience and the conversion to spontaneous purchases. <br><br>  This is a hypothesis, it needs to be checked.  <a href="http://touchin.ru/">Touch Instinct</a> designed and developed an iPhone application.  After the release, we will start the promotion, not to get into the tops or to buy cheap installations, but to get an active audience with a good conversion to spontaneous purchases. <br><br>  After receiving a statistically reliable number of installations, we analyze the conversion at each stage, the behavior of users, the volume of sales (for each client, their own performance reports are developed).  If the result of the analysis is encouraging - we will continue to develop the application, conduct a / b tests, port it to new platforms, refine the functionality.  If not, we will think about a new idea. <br><br>  The work of the product and analysts is paid monthly, the work of designers, developers and testers on actually spent hours. <br><br><hr>  Thanks to Vadim Mityakin and Anton Krokhmalyuk for help in preparing the article.
