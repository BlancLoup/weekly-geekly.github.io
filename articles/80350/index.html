Which world to choose?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I live in an imperfect world and want to talk a little about it.  And then offer to help choose a more perfect world. <br><br>  Here are two people talked and exchanged contacts.  They will either exchange paper business cards or everyone will get a communicator with a kilobax price and ... <br><ul><li>  The first will dictate your phone number </li><li>  The second one will drive it into your phone and call the first one. </li><li>  The first will reset the call and save the defined number as a contact. </li><li>  Profit! </li></ul>  Very advanced is to make a photo of the interlocutor. <br>  Although the opportunity to transfer the business card from the phone was still in the era of IRDA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here are a number of Internet users actively use mail.  They were told that theBat \ Thunderbird is better and simpler.  They once set up an account through POP3 + SMTP and enjoy life ... Most of them do not use mail programs at all.  Web interface solves.  Well, from whom the mailer checks mail every five minutes, that is already an advanced user. <br><br>  But we know that a letter in the mail program on the computer can appear a second after the letter appears in your inbox.  And on the phone \ communicator, laptop, netbook, in the office, at home the contents of folders can be absolutely identical.  Without any "Sync."

      Organizers, Calendars, tasks for them are generally empty. <br><br>  Instead of using rss, they visit the same sites day after day. <br><br>  And much more ... And now these people choose their phone.  Yes, such that not "just called" ... <br><br>  So that the photos taken on it could be tagged and the photos turned out to be in a web album, on a social network, on the right computers. <br><br>  So that music, podcasts, mail, photos, books, TV shows, organizer, meetings, sms, captured video and much more, once configured, can be easily and transparently synchronized. <br><br>  rss, microblogging, finding the right place in the city and much more. <br><br>  Sociality  If this is a film, then where they show how much it costs, reviews looked, ratings.  And all this from the phone, including the reservation. <br><br>  Whose choice of device is not for marketing digits (there are so many programs, but they need to be set with pens, there are so many, and there are so many)? <br><br>  I would like to discuss in the comments the information world created by the giants described and undescribed in the title. <br><br>  For example, I like the movement in the direction that I specified to Google, but I don‚Äôt know anything about Apple products, services and solutions.  (I heard that it is more convenient for someone to copy music to the player, sorted by folders, than to use iTunes, but this is all my knowledge) <br><br>  It would be great to hear something like this in the comments: <br><br>  Here I have a device X from the company Y. I am walking down the street.  I see a cool event.  I shoot a video.  Two button presses and it is already on YouTube. <br><br>  And I have a new series of Dr. House will be on the home media server, immediately after its appearance, and I get a notification about this, since I use this and that. <br><br>  That is, to talk about the pleasant opportunities to save time and what giants provide opportunities to the users of their services / their products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80350/</a></p>
