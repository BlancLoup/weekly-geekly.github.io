Mikhail Lysyansky with the report ‚ÄúHow to GameDev in Java‚Äù <br><br>  Every developer probably at least once thought about creating his own game.  However, many obstacles stand in the way to the cherished goal, one of which is the choice of technology stack.  To date, there are many game engines and libraries.  It is not surprising that beginning game developers have a number of questions: ‚ÄúWhich library (engine) to use?  Why use libraries at all?  Can I write my game without using libraries? ‚Äù. <br>  The search for answers to these questions and will be devoted to this report.  Also you will learn: <br><br>  - how to write your first game without using anything other than the Java language; <br>  - with the study of which libraries should start when developing games; <br>  - Advantages and disadvantages of Java technologies when developing games. <br><br>  2. Maxim Zubov from Naumen with a report on the topic ‚ÄúPlay with integrations on Play Framework‚Äù <br><br>  When developing the new version of the Information System for Educational Activity Licensing (ISLOD) on the Play Framework, it was necessary to integrate it with the complex of Rosobrnadzor systems.  All integrations must be based on the SOAP protocol.  ISLOD must be a consumer of the services, as well as act as a supplier.  In the Java world, there are a huge number of frameworks for working with SOAP.  However, their application in practice in the framework of the project on the Play Framework has a number of problems.  The report will discuss what problems we encountered when developing integrations using Apache CXF;  why we chose this framework;  as a result, it was possible to solve the arising problems. <br><br>  3. Maxim Vetrenko from Naumen with a report on ‚ÄúControl of the codestyle in real conditions‚Äù <br><br>  I think that many people know about the tools for automatic verification of software code such as PMD, FindBugs, Checkstyle.  Many companies use certain tools, and Naumen is no exception.  Our projects actively use both PMD and FindBugs.  Many articles have been written about them on the Internet, however, most are just setup instructions and nothing more.  A year ago, a new project started inside the company, and from the very beginning we decided to keep the code clean.  Checkstyle was chosen as a tool.  Therefore, in my report I would like to share the experience of using Checkstyle in a real project, to tell about the positive aspects of implementing this tool from the very beginning of its development. <br><br>  4. Maxim Konovalov from BPC Banking Technologies with the report ‚ÄúJava Messaging with AMQP and RabbitMQ‚Äù <br><br>  Recently, asynchronous, event-oriented application architectures, microservices, etc. are gaining popularity.  On this wave, such frameworks and services as Akka, Rx4Java, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc. are developing. In the stream of rapidly developing technologies, it is necessary to periodically overestimate the established traditions in the use of standards, protocols and products.  It is proposed to discuss the approach to the organization of message flows in Java Middleware (and not only), retreating from the JMS standard (blessed by JCP) towards AMQP.  We will get acquainted with the AMQP protocol and its implementations.  Consider the fundamental differences from JMS, let's talk about the areas of applicability - classes of tasks, when to use, for example, RabbitMQ would be a good idea, and when - not very.  Let's review the RabbitMQ features, how to use it through Spring, and discuss a couple of examples of using technology for specific tasks. <br><br>  5. Lightning talks <br><br>  Lightning talks is a series of five-minute reports, you can apply for them at any time, at least 5 minutes before the start.  The presentation is optional but desirable.  The topic of the report is limited only to Java, you can talk about, for example, a newly discovered framework or a problem that you have recently solved. <br><br>  Lightning talks is a great way to try yourself as a speaker.  Therefore, we are waiting for your application for a report on lightning talks. <br><br>  6. Afterparty - kebabs and wine <br><br>  Participation is free, <a href="https://jug-sev.timepad.ru/event/313723/">do not forget to register!</a> <br><br>  We are waiting for you on April 16 at 12.00 in the hotel ATRIUM - King's Way (Geroev Stalingrada av., 47). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280942/</a></p>
