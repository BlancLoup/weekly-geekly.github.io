  <section class="page js-page"><h1>2GIS for iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What happened was what we were so often asked about, what we had been waiting for and what we worked so hard on.  Meet: <b>2GIS mobile version for iPhone</b> .  We promised that it will appear before the end of the year - it appeared.  The greatest mobile omission is finally fixed, and the favorite directory is now available on all major platforms, including iOS.  The application is already in the Apple App Store - hurry to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/2gis/id481627348%3Fmt%3D8">download</a> and share feedback.  What's new and why so long - read on. <br><br><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/19/9f99c8b7259a19f26666328f611d04da.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>What's new?</b>  Almost all.  We could not just take and adapt the old mobile version for the iPhone.  It was necessary to develop it separately.  New design, new interface, new 3D maps.  We tried to make everything as beautiful, stylish and functional as possible - in general, especially for the iPhone.  The map now displays 3D buildings that can be viewed from all angles.  The size of the map file that needs to be downloaded to work with a particular city has significantly decreased (in the case of Novosibirsk, more than 2 times). <br><br><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/19/7ef649fea33c8c9f5656b342899fa95d.png"><br><br>  <b>Why so long?</b>  Of course, the wait was stretched - some even doubted that the iPhone version would be released altogether.  But given the volume of tasks that we had to perform, it took not so much time.  Development for the iPhone began in late February 2011.  Much has been written from scratch, as the schemes of the previous mobile version for the iPhone were simply unacceptable.  For example, the interface was completely rewritten (organization cards, icons, screen views, design, code structure).  In general, we tried to take into account everything that is already in the current mobile version, as well as provide the ability to add other useful features in the future.  It's safe to say that the iPhone version is a new, significantly reworked application. <br><br><img src="http://pix.academ.org/img/2011/12/19/29e4bbddf323a9ee8bcef8015eb28787.png"><br><br>  <b>What's next?</b>  We will certainly modify the original version, both in terms of map display, and in terms of functionality.  We have big plans for 2GIS for iPhone, and we are already working on their implementation.  Of course, the new design and 3D map will extend to the other versions that were released earlier: we recall, this is 2GIS for Android, Symbian OS and Windows Mobile. <br><br>  The current version is beta, which will soon become better and better.  At this stage, your comments are very important to us, so please feel free to share ideas, comments and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134859/</a></p>
