  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Unveils New Container Technology for Next-Generation Cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the modern world, when cloud technologies come out on top, the business industry especially relies on applications that will foster innovation and productivity.  With the development of the cloud, containers are becoming an attractive way for developers to quickly and efficiently create and deploy applications at the speed they need for business.  Offering developers and IT professionals the ability to deploy applications from a workstation to a server in a matter of seconds, containers take application development to a whole new level. <br><br>  Due to the desire of developers to use the capabilities of containers for a wider range of applications, new requirements arise.  For example, for corporate systems or for hosted environments, you may need increased levels of trust.  In addition, developers often deploy applications in mixed environments where they may not be able to control the platform on which the application is hosted.  Virtualization has historically provided a significant level of isolation that allowed such scenarios, but now there are possibilities for combining the efficiency and density of a container model with the correct level of isolation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/a0d/16c/1afa0d16c29f446aabbac8cf1cf5ccaa.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last October, Microsoft and Docker Inc.  <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/10/15/new-windows-server-containers-and-azure-support-for-docker/">jointly announced plans</a> to provide containers for all developers in the Docker and Microsoft ecosystems using Windows Server containers, which will be available in the next version of Windows Server.  We will hold the first open demonstration in a few weeks, starting with <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">the BUILD conference</a> .  Today we move containerization one step further due to the expansion of scenarios and workloads available to developers through the use of containers: <br><ul><li>  Hyper-V Containers is a new, highly isolated container deployment option powered by Hyper-V virtualization. </li><li>  Nano Server is a minimal installation of Windows Server that is optimized for the cloud and ideal for containers. </li></ul>

    <h4>  First of its kind: Hyper-V containers </h4><br>  Leveraging our in-depth virtualization experience, today Microsoft offers containers with a new isolation level previously reserved only for fully dedicated physical or virtual machines, while supporting a flexible and efficient experience with Docker's full cross-platform integration.  Through this first-of-its-kind offering, Hyper-V containers ensure that code running in one container remains isolated and cannot affect the guest operating system or other containers running on the same host. <br>  While Hyper-V containers offer additional deployment options between Windows Server containers and Hyper-V virtual machines, you will have the opportunity to deploy them using the same development, programming, and management tools that you would use with Windows Server containers. .  In addition, applications developed for Windows Server containers can be deployed as Hyper-V containers without any additional modifications, providing greater flexibility for operators, who need to choose the degree of density, flexibility and isolation in a multi-platform and multi-application environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/97e/29b/9ca97e29bb4d4658bff100d12bb70a9c.png"><br><br><h4>  Our containers in the Docker ecosystem </h4><br>  Docker plays an important role in providing the container ecosystem on Linux, Windows and upcoming Hyper-V containers.  We worked closely with the Docker community to evaluate and expand container innovations in Windows Server and Microsoft Azure, including the presentation of the development of the Docker engine for Windows Server containers, taking part in the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/docker">development of the Docker repository on GitHub</a> .  In addition, we have simplified the deployment of the latest Docker engine using <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-docker-vm-extension/">Azure extensions to install a Docker host into Azure virtual machines running Linux</a> and to deploy virtual machines managed by <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/01/08/introducing-docker-in-microsoft-azure-marketplace/">Docker directly from the Azure Marketplace</a> .  Finally, we added integration for <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/02/26/sunny-and-swarmy-in-azure/">Docker Swarm, the Docker Machine, and the Docker Compose in Azure and Hyper-V</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúMicrosoft has been an excellent partner and participant in the Docker project since the joint announcement in October 2014,‚Äù said Nick Stinemates, head of business development and technical alliances.  ‚ÄúThey made a number of enhancements to enhance the Docker developer experience in Azure, contributing to all aspects of the Docker platform, including the Docker client for Windows and the Docker orchestration tools.  Microsoft also demonstrated its leadership in the community by providing completely new content, for example, dockerized .NET for Linux.  At the same time, they were working to extend the benefits of Docker containers ‚Äî the ability to transfer applications to any infrastructure and speed up the development process ‚Äî for the Windows developer community. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Presentation Nano Server: The core of modern applications and the cloud </h4><br>  Operating systems have changed dramatically with the transition to the cloud.  Today, most customers need their operating systems for a primary purpose: launching their applications created in the cloud.  Using years of experience creating and launching hyper-scale data centers, Microsoft is in a unique position to create an operating system designed to run modern applications and containers. <br><br>  The result is Nano Server, the minimum installation option for Windows Server, which is optimized for the cloud, including containers.  Nano Server provides only those components that are needed - nothing superfluous, which means a smaller server image size, which, in turn, reduces sweep time, reduces network bandwidth consumption, and improves security and availability.  This minimalism makes Nano Server an ideal addition to Windows Server and Hyper-V containers, as well as to other cloud-optimized scripts.  The preview version will be available in the next few weeks, and you can read more about the technology in the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2015/04/08/microsoft-announces-nano-server-for-modern-apps-and-cloud.aspx">Windows Server blog</a> . <br><br>  In the modern world of cloud technologies, containers take speed and scalability to a new level.  Microsoft is in a unique position to move organizations forward, into the next era of containerization, offering flexibility and choice between Windows Server containers, Linux containers and Hyper-V containers both in the cloud and locally.  Today's announcement is just the beginning of what follows next, because  We continue to develop the growth of containers in the industry, as well as new levels of innovation in applications for developers. <br><br>  Stay connected to learn more about innovation, starting with the BUILD conference in a few weeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255453/</a></p>
