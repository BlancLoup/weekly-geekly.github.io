  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fintech: adapt or die</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For bank employees, life is dynamic: almost every month, leading banks announce restructuring, rebalancing or globally changing strategies.  Sound boring?  Maybe, but at the same time, banks continue to explore new technologies and invest in the development of IT specialists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/600/250/acf/600250acf9a34bcfb5dfc29d8faddf8c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Changes in the market affect the requirements for developers, analysts and IT-auditors: it is not enough to be a professional only in one‚Äôs field.  To remain in demand, it is worth mastering additional professions in related fields and developing the skills of product presentation and teamwork.  Do not waste your time in vain and try yourself in the FINTECH field: a set of <a href="https://go.open.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrfintech%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr_open3">internships at the bank is</a> now open, where you can start a career in one of the IT departments or create your own startup with support. <br><br><h3>  We share tips on how an IT specialist can survive in the Fintech market: </h3><br><h4>  Suck soft skills </h4><br>  Today, banks are looking for employees who can work together easily.  And to joke with the developer, and with the manager from the sales department to think about the approach to customers, and still will not be annoyed even when they hear strange questions from colleagues.

      According to the latest <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/hubfs/content/2017_Global_Developer_Hiring_Landscape.pdf%3Ft%3D1490979180195">Stackoverflow</a> study, most IT specialists (not HR specialists, but IT!) <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/hubfs/content/2017_Global_Developer_Hiring_Landscape.pdf%3Ft%3D1490979180195">Are</a> confident that communication skills are more important than other personal qualities that should be evaluated when applying for a job.  So to hell with the silly myths about the closeness of developers, system administrators, backendors, and so on - you will find the skills of presentation, team management very useful, and the general erudition will not hurt. <br><br><h4>  Get used to work on Agile </h4><br>  If, to fix bugs, your team still redraws the entire architecture of the product, and a small error in the database costs you a week of lack of sleep - exhale and wean.  It's time to work on a new flexible methodology.  Everyone talks about Agile now.  But there is a reasonable excuse for this - this kind of methodology, a way of organizing the work of teams, especially technical ones, works.  This is a horizontal hierarchy, sprints and rapid changes of the product without loss of time, it is the work in the mode of constant discussion and feedback.  Try it, then you can not return to the usual chaotic way of work. <br><br><h4>  Grow in related areas to be ready for challenges </h4><br>  Artificial Intelligence (AI) automates many processes and kills professions.  Even if for now AI is used more as an attractive marketing step, in the future we will face it more and more often.  And if for some specialties this is the end, then for you definitely not.  Be prepared for future career challenges and professionally master not one, but two specialties.  If now your work is more connected with logic, analytics and facts, pay attention to specialties and skills that use the right hemisphere of the brain: creativity, imagination and visualization - go through the sphere of marketing, programmatic advertising, try yourself in design.  In general, do not focus on one product, language, and even one line of business.  With examples, we will show. <br><br><h3>  Let us examine by examples which areas are worth exploring in order to become a cool candidate for fintech: </h3><br>  A <b>front-end developer is</b> often required not only to code well, but also to understand UX well.  For an additional specialty suitable digital marketing, graphic design, game development and video production. <br><br>  <b>IT infrastructure is</b> no longer limited to databases and system administrators.  Understanding of working with cloud data warehouses, working with internal architecture.  And the understanding and knowledge of the basics of DevOps makes a simple sysadmin 2 times more useful and adds 100 points to piety! <br><br>  <b>Data Scientists</b> are expected to gain in-depth expertise in technical analytics, which often refers to marketing or risk management ‚Äî these areas should be dived in first. <br><br>  <b>Quanta</b> , which are usually the link between developers and analysts, will benefit from knowledge in asset management. <br><br>  <b>Information security is</b> very close to IT auditing and operational risk management - professionals in these areas should think about pumping skills in auditing and risk areas. <br><br>  We advise you not to delay with an additional profession and be determined rather: if you prepare for changes in the financial sector in advance, artificial intelligence will definitely not be terrible for you.  Well, unless he captures the planet. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Already on April 10, a series of <a href="https://events.webinar.ru/1984811/374041%3Futm_source%3Dhabr_webinar%26utm_content%3Dvebinar_invest">free webinars</a> will start; they will be led by top managers of the largest commercial bank in Russia.  The first will be devoted to the topic of asset management, join. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325902/</a></p>
