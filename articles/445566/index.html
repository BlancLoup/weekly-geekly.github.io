It is indicated that in cases stipulated by the legislation of the Russian Federation, the consent of a citizen to receive information about them using the digital profile infrastructure is <b>not required</b> .

      Information about citizens and legal entities stored in the digital profile infrastructure is provided to it and updated automatically by state bodies, organizations exercising certain public authorities in accordance with federal laws, through a unified system of inter-agency electronic interaction. <br><br>  Digital profile infrastructure provides the following functions: <br><br><ol><li>  Identification and authentication of individuals and legal entities. <br></li><li>  Access to the digital profile and the provision of information included in the digital profile in electronic form to individuals and legal entities. <br></li><li>  Providing and updating upon request of state bodies, local self-government bodies, organizations exercising separate public authorities in accordance with federal laws, and other organizations, information on a natural or legal person contained in a digital profile, including those contained in state information systems, information systems organizations exercising separate public authority in accordance with federal laws. <br></li><li>  Receiving and withdrawing consent for the processing of personal data of citizens and information about legal entities in cases involving the receipt of information about a citizen or legal entity using a digital profile infrastructure. <br></li><li>  Providing information for the formation of requests for state and municipal services or the performance of state and municipal functions. <br></li><li>  Storage of information about citizens and legal entities, including the results of the provision of state and municipal services in electronic form, in the manner established by the Government of the Russian Federation. </li></ol><br>  State bodies, organizations exercising separate public authorities in accordance with federal laws are obliged to provide the digital profile infrastructure and update this information on an ongoing basis for a period not exceeding <b>15 seconds</b> from the date of the introduction of changes to the relevant information. <br><br>  Organizations' requests for obtaining information about citizens and legal entities using the digital profile infrastructure are carried out both on a grant and on a reimbursable basis.  The cases, the amount and the procedure for making payments for sending relevant requests are entitled to be established by the government. <br><br>  A person who confirms the correctness of the identifier or a previously performed identification and authentication of a person can only be: <br><br><ul><li>  credit organizations, mobile radio telephone communication operators, communication operators occupying a significant position in the public communication network, who have the right to independently provide communication services for data transmission; <br></li><li>  operators of state information systems; <br></li><li>  other organizations established by the government. </li></ul><br>  The draft law also introduces amendments to the federal law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù.  It is supplemented by the following paragraph: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú5.1 When processing personal data using the digital profile infrastructure, if consent of the personal data subject to personal data processing is required, the personal data subject agrees to their processing in the digital profile infrastructure in the form of an electronic document signed with a reinforced qualified electronic signature or a simple electronic signature, the key of which is obtained by personal attendance in accordance with the rules for using a simple electronic signature when applying for obtaining state  impact and municipal services in electronic form, established by the Government of the Russian Federation.  The withdrawal of such consent is carried out by the subject of personal data in the infrastructure of a digital profile. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Several changes mentioning electronic identifiers are also being made to the laws ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn the Basics of Citizen Health Protection in the Russian Federation‚Äù. <br><br>  A month ago, the government reported that by 2021, Russians would be able to use the digital provision of socially important public services.  <a href="https://iz.ru/844262/2019-02-11/v-rossii-vvedut-elektronnye-pasporta-v-2024-godu">Digital profile platform</a> will be created by 2023. <br><br>  It is likely that by this time a platform will also be developed for electronic voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections, which will increase the voter turnout.  Estonian experience has shown that voting via the Internet increases the activity of young voters. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause conflicting feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write offensive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445566/</a></p>
