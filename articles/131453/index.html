  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign trainees in Moscow startups - is it interesting?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working in a project that attracts young foreign specialists to Moscow startups implies constant communication with the leaders of Russian companies and representatives of business incubators.  Many of them often ask us: why all this?  Frankly, I myself ask the same question.  What can a foreign intern give a young company, apart from additional worries and expenses?  As shown by my previous post in Q &amp; A on Habr√© (http://habrahabr.ru/qa/12873/), many see in the employee only a specialist, and where he comes from - it does not matter.  On the other hand, the co-founder of one business incubator asked a similar question (https://www.facebook.com/pro4pro/posts/253267384694752), and this caused a rather lively discussion.  In this post I want to tell my prevailing vision of why startups are a young foreign specialist, and also ask a similar question to all readers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>1. Other education</b> </h5><br>  The formation of Moscow, London, New York, Beijing, New Delhi is different.  Point.  Without holivars and other things, it is clear that somewhere something is taught with other approaches, techniques and practical exercises.  The difference in education should contribute to the work of the team: a fresh look at the problem, new ways to solve the set tasks. To this can be added the fact that many specialties that were long mastered and became common among foreign students came to Russia a little later, so that the foreign The trainee in this regard is more savvy and experienced. <br><br><h5>  <b>2. Another mentality</b> </h5><br>  Chinese is different from Russian or Indian.  It seems obvious, is not it?  This is manifested, above all, in relation to the work, to the goals and objectives set, to their team and leadership.  In this regard, I believe that it will be interesting for the team members to adopt some positive features of another culture. <br><br><h5>  <b>3. Language</b> </h5><br>  In this case, many may be frightened by the language barrier, which, quite possibly, will arise.  But for a startup, even focused on the domestic market, it is useful to know the same English.  If a startup is international, then other languages ‚Äã‚Äãalso do not interfere.  In this case, a foreigner by his presence in the team will be able to give the necessary and effective language practice to the project members, which is so important for learning and improving the language.

      <br>
    <h5>  <b>4. Foreign markets</b> </h5><br>  Every startup wants to enter the international market, isn't it?  A foreign expert will talk about the specifics of his country's market, and can also share his already formed business contacts. <br><br><h5>  <b>5. Experience in an international team</b> </h5><br>  If you are going to bring your startup to an international level, then it would be good for your team to have work experience in an international team.  Such an experience will further solve the problems of communication, respect for other cultures and moral values ‚Äã‚Äã(I don‚Äôt want to use the fashionable word ‚Äútolerance‚Äù, I emphasize the word ‚Äúrespect‚Äù), will increase the stress tolerance of the team. <br><br><h5>  <b>6. High motivation</b> </h5><br>  An intern sometimes pays money for the opportunity to work in a foreign company, from which it follows that his main goal is not to earn more money, but to gain experience, and international experience.  A person‚Äôs desire to improve, can often be a strong motivation to fulfill his or her duties efficiently and work not for the ‚Äúgolden mountains‚Äù, but to achieve the goals and objectives. <br><br>  This, in my opinion, is the main positive aspects of international cooperation.  I really look forward to your comments on this issue.  Adequate criticism of my arguments is welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131453/</a></p>
