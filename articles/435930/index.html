Riyke tube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Thermoacoustic effect</b> was discovered by glass blowers several centuries ago.  When glass-blowers blew a glass ball heated to a high temperature, located at the end of the tube, a monotonous sound appeared spontaneously from the open end of the tube.  The first scientific work in this direction held Higgins in 1777. <br><br><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/rn/yr/ojrnyrs0_kuqqop_akf6_ixmulg.jpeg"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/wf/v9/wqwfv9rbyivlus1m2rl6uxejp3y.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1. The singing flame of Higgins on the left and the Rijke tube on the right</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He created a slightly different device than the glassblowers, namely the ‚Äúsinging flame,‚Äù placing the flame of a hydrogen torch approximately in the middle of a metal pipe open at both ends.  Later in 1859, Paul Rijke continued these experiments.  He replaced the flame on a heated metal mesh.  He moved the grid inside the vertically positioned pipe and found that when the grid was placed 1/4 of the length of the pipe from the lower end, there was a maximum sound volume. <br><br>  You can see how this looks in this video:

It is seen that while the burner heats the grid in the tube, no oscillation is observed.  Fluctuations begin only after Valerian Ivanovich removes the burner to the side.  That is, it is important that the air under the grid was colder than above the grid.  The next important point is that the oscillations stop if you rotate the tube horizontally.  That is, for the occurrence of oscillations, upward convective air flow is needed. <br><br>  How does the air hover in the tube? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="70%" height="70%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/gd/ey/lygdeytrnbtzfiskalcoptptk0s.gif"></div><br>  <i>Gifka 1. Acoustic component of air movement</i> <br><br>  Gifka 1 shows the movement of air in the tube, due to the presence of an acoustic wave.  Each of the lines represents the movement of a conditionally separated thin layer of air.  It can be seen that in the center of the tube the value of the vibrational velocity of air is zero, and on the edges of the tube, on the contrary, is maximum. <br><br>  The pressure oscillations are opposite, maximal in the center of the tube and close to zero along the edges of the tube, since the ends of the tube are open and there is atmospheric pressure, and pressure fluctuations are possible in the center, since there is no place for air to escape. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/0x/dv/8p0xdvt1twns7irjlhxe-keopns.png"></div><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2. The pressure distribution at the time of maximum pressure in the center of the tube and the distribution of the oscillatory velocity at the time of maximum speed at the ends of the tube</i> <br><br>  Thus, it can be said unequivocally that the acoustic wave that occurs in the Rijke tube is standing, with pressure nodes at the edges of the tube and a vibrational velocity node in the middle.  The length of the tube is equal to half the length of the acoustic wave.  This means that the tube is a half-wave resonator.  Pay attention to fig.  2. It is shown that the optimal position of the hot grid in the tube is in the place where the product of pressure and velocity is maximal.  This place is approximately 1/4 the length of the tube from the lower end.  That is, for the process, the presence of both velocity oscillations and pressure oscillations is important. <br><br>  For the occurrence of oscillations, as it turned out from the video, you need not only a resonator, but also a continuous stream of air directed upward of the tube.  That is, here is the movement of air: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n_/4t/om/n_4tomyjgjeiwftisah1zjwxcme.gif"></div><br>  <i>GIF 2. Convective airflow</i> <br><br>  In the vertical position of the tube, a constant air flow occurs due to the fact that the air heated by the mesh rises up.  There is a convective flow. <br><br>  Air oscillations and convective flow in reality exist simultaneously.  These two processes overlap, and it turns out about the following movement: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bo/zo/ze/bozozeitmefk4spqlqm8gisiyqm.gif"></div><br>  <i>Gifka 3. The combined movement of air - fluctuations + convective flow</i> <br><br>  Air movement described.  Now we need to understand how the acoustic wave arises and is maintained in the tube. <br><br>  The Rijke tube is a self-oscillatory system in which the attenuation mechanisms of an acoustic wave are naturally present.  Therefore, to maintain the wave, it is necessary to continuously feed it with energy in each oscillation period.  To better understand how energy is fed into the wave, consider hypha 3. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/hv/n8/m1hvn8n-4tviht2bpunouhgs6wa.gif"></div><br>  <i>Gifka 3. Thermodynamic cycle in the tube</i> <br><br>  The movement of air is very similar to the movement of a caterpillar that crawls up the tube. <br>  On gifka 3. presents the ideal case in which the effect is maximum.  Consider it in more detail.  It is seen that the air in this tracked its movement is compressed in the cold zone under the heated grid, and then expands already in the hot, passing through the grid.  Thus, during expansion, the air takes energy away from the heated grid and it gradually cools.  A thermodynamic cycle is realized with positive gas work.  Due to this, the initial infinitely small oscillations are amplified, and when the power of the wave feed becomes equal to the wave attenuation power, a balance occurs, and we begin to hear a constant, monotonous sound. <br><br>  Such an ideal case is realized only with a certain convective flow rate and with a certain grid temperature.  In most practical cases, the movement of air in the grid zone is slightly different, but this only worsens the efficiency of the tube, but does not change the principle of operation. <br><br>  After the principle of operation of the Rijke tube became clear, the question immediately arises: why then does the Higgins flame sing most strongly when placed in the center of the tube?  The thing is that the flame is much stronger than the grid warms the air below it and therefore the optimum point for its location is higher than that of the grid.  So whether it is necessary to place the flame in the center of the tube, or closer to the lower end, essentially depends on the flame and on the length of the tube. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAwUW8EIpmg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435930/</a></p>
