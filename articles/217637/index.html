Some time ago I ran into a certification issue. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a4/46b/7d6/1a446b7d616aef34c54fedc96647de9e.png"></div><br><br>  One day we decided that for the development of the project (which I will tell about in my time in another hub), it would be nice to organize our own supplies of equipment.  We contacted the manufacturer of the product we were interested in (namely, it was a certain mobile phone model) and ordered a sample for the test.  At this stage, of course, there were no problems, since  It looked like an ordinary private order from an online store.  We were pleased with the quality and decided to order a little more devices so that we could show them to our customers and assess the degree of interest.  And then, as they say, rushed. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Level 1 </h3><br>  At that time, we still did not understand the legislation and did not know that such a game could not be done as devices for personal use.  At the post office, we were given a notice that we needed to come to the customs office of the city N and decide whether the goods comply with sections 2.16 and 2.19 of a single list of goods that are subject to prohibitions or restrictions on the importation or exportation by states parties to the customs union within the Eurasian economic community in trade with third countries. <br><br>  Gathering our strength, we went to the customs department (let's call it ‚ÄúA‚Äù).  What have we been told there?  Nothing.  Local workers reported that they did not encounter similar cases and sent us to another department (let's call it ‚ÄúB‚Äù). <br><br>  It's nice, you know, sometimes feel like a soccer ball. <br><br>  In the department ‚ÄúB‚Äù we were met by people whom our case was no longer surprised.  It‚Äôs a pity they didn‚Äôt really know what to do with us.  Thus, we were sent to the third customs office (‚ÄúC‚Äù), asking us to prepare a printed page from the site where we ordered the goods and a statement of money transfer. <br><br>  In the department ‚ÄúC‚Äù we were told that such a quantity of goods does not fall under the category ‚Äúfor personal use‚Äù and we need to declare the goods.  But for this you need to contact the central customs post. <br><br>  It should be noted that the central customs post of the city of N is located 30 km from the city of N!  We realized that, probably, and this is not the end.  Since  we didn‚Äôt have a desire to travel for 30 km with or without us, we decided to ask for a consultation all in the same department in order to immediately understand what needs to be taken with us. <br><br>  Consultation is held at a certain time in the customs office by internal phone (!).  Yes, yes, you need to come to the office, so that a local employee sitting somewhere in the same building will consult you by local telephone.  It was only the third time that we managed to persuade the employee to come down to me and advise live.  The consultation itself lasted about an hour.  During the discussion, other experts were invited, and together we discussed the characteristics of the equipment and what documents are necessary for customs clearance.  Unfortunately, consultants also could not fully understand what documents and certificates are necessary for our phones, but we were able to make at least an approximate list of what is already a result.  We have determined that in order to issue a declaration it is necessary to prepare the following: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of customs duties; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of customs taxes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of customs duties. <br><br>  What kind of customs duties and taxes needed to be paid, experts could not say, because  we must know it ourselves, ‚Äúbecause this is your product‚Äù.  In general, I had to independently determine the HS code and pay all fees and charges according to this code. <br><br>  When we finally arrived at the customs post, it turned out that we did not prepare all the documents.  Since  we made out the parcel as goods for non-commercial use; you had to have with you a tax certificate stating that the recipient is not an individual entrepreneur (the tax certificate is made within 5 days). <br><br>  Next you had to write a statement.  There are no templates.  There is a law that states how this statement should look, and then go on and on as you wish.  Interestingly, they asked me to provide imei devices that I hadn‚Äôt even received at that time.  I wrote another statement in which I set out in detail how difficult it is to guess the imei of the phone from a distance.  The guys got angry, but surrendered. <br>  As a result, we provided: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ application; <br>  ‚Ä¢ receipts for payment of customs duties and taxes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ tax certificate; <br>  ‚Ä¢ a listing of the seller‚Äôs site page with features and price, <br><br>  took the package and full of happiness went home. <br><br>  There was no limit to our jubilation.  For a week I walked with a smile that never left my face, proud of my perseverance. <br><br><h3>  Mission Completed.  Boss !!! </h3><br>  We showed the phones to customers.  All were satisfied.  It is time to make a large order and, of course, arrange it for the company as a commercial party.  It turns out that up to this point there were flowers! <br><br>  So, the task: there is a certain model of a cell phone that needs to be legally imported and sold on the territory of the Russian Federation.  Question: what documents and certificates are needed for this? <br><br>  Frankly, we still have no solution to this problem.  I very much hope that maybe someone from the Habravchan experienced in this field will help us to comprehend Zen and, finally, to achieve our goal. <br><br>  I spent a lot of time searching for any information on this topic and - this is a paradox - the more I read, the less I understood.  Absolutely different, and sometimes directly opposite, things are written on various websites and forums.  Try to figure it out in legal acts too!  In our country, after all, how: an act was issued, then another was released, its complementary, then another one, to emphasize something there, and then a new one was released, which cancels everything that was written before it.  And then another.  And also, so that life does not seem like honey.  As a result, you are left alone with dry stationery words that contradict each other and contribute to the loss of hair in the reader. <br><br>  Desperate, I decided to contact the certification center.  Fortunately, there are many of them in our country.  I decided to call several companies and thus determine at least which papers I need (not to mention how to issue them).  In several places I was told that for the sale of such products are necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãthe Ministry of Communications certificate, PCT certificate and notification.  Thank God, the notification is ready.  So, I think you need to issue the Ministry of Communications and the PCT.  I decided to call in several places to request prices and find out with whom it would be more profitable to work.  What was my surprise when I was informed at the next certification center that PCT certification is no longer mandatory, but a new-fashioned EAC or a certificate of conformity of the CU TR (technical regulations of the Customs Union) took its place.  A little googling, I discovered that the PCT is really no longer relevant.  Could those certification centers that assured me of the need for a PCT live in a parallel universe ??  I would understand if they, in pursuit of money, imposed on me a bunch of unnecessary certificates.  I basically expected this from them.  But why give me an unnecessary certificate and keep silent about the one I need? <br><br>  Update the list of required documents: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The certificate of conformity of communications (Ministry of Communications); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Declaration of Conformity TR CU. <br><br>  I remember somewhere I read that the certificate of the Ministry of Communications is not obligatory for devices manufactured outside the Russian Federation.  I saw it all once, so I tend not to believe it. <br><br>  The next interesting thing: in the certification center I was told that the registration of the certificate of the Ministry of Communications will cost 70,000 rubles (!).  At the same time, having walked through the website of the Ministry of Communications, I found an online form for obtaining their certificate.  If I draw up this certificate on my own, according to my preliminary calculations, the price will be about 30 thousand (up to 5,000 for the state fee, the rest - for testing the sample in the laboratory).  The numbers are very approximate, but still 70 thousand and close does not work. <br><br>  According to a specialist from one of the firms, the declaration and certificate of the CU TR are 10 and 18 thousand rubles.  accordingly, that is not so scary. <br><br>  Friends, a minus is that, after so long a time, I still have no confidence that I am on the right track and I know everything that is needed.  I suggest everyone to join us in solving this problem and defeat the bureaucratic monster.  Who has experience of passing such procedures, you are welcome in the comments.  If we still manage to figure out together and comprehend the essence of being, we will assemble a step-by-step guide for future generations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217637/</a></p>
