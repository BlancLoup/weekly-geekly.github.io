He is particularly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/systemed/deriviste"><em>Deriviste</em></a> , a concept created by Richard Fairhurst. </li><li>  The OSM community of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to <a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/5601">map the</a> Congo to help combat the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu.  On Twitter, Pierre B√©land <a href="https://twitter.com/pierzen/status/1072282951210147840">calls on</a> experienced cartographers to help improve data quality. </li><li>  Toutelatitudes <a href="https://twitter.com/touteslatitudes/status/1067430961434963968">wrote a</a> tweet about three wonderful trees that they added to OpenStreetMap in the department of Loire, France. </li><li> The dktue member <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-December/041393.html">offers</a> an <code>emergency=control_centre</code> for places where emergency calls are answered.

The distinction between the disputed boundaries is an important but complex and sensitive issue for many reasons.  After John received feedback on his proposal, he <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-December/041387.html">wrote</a> that he would rework it again and add new proposals. </li><li>  Have you ever encountered the problem of mapping a walking route and the need to check whether it was previously mapped?  Many communities use wiki pages to provide lists of routes and their relationship numbers.  The participant Cascafico <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Cascafico/diary/47177">describes</a> in his diary tools for automating data collection from OSM and converting to wiki format. </li></ul><br><h2>  Software </h2><br><ul><li>  Martijn van Exel has <a href="http://blog.improveosm.org/en/2018/12/getting-started-with-openstreetcam/">written an</a> illustrated guide on how to get involved and use OpenStreetCam, a free and open platform for street photography, created by Telenav. </li><li>  Jiri Vlasak <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/josm-dev/2018-December/008181.html">introduced</a> the LiveJOSM distribution.  LiveJOSM is a Debian-based Linux system with JOSM and some pre-installed JOSM plug-ins that can be used at various events, such as mapping. </li></ul><br><h2>  Programs </h2><br><ul><li>  The iD editor recently received two updates.  <em>Mega Update</em> v2.12.0 includes a seemingly <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/rails-dev/2018-December/014760.html">endless list of</a> new features, enhancements and fixes, including two-finger trackpad gestures for Mac users, drawing paths indicating directions, such as rocks and coastlines, and the ability to resize the sidebar or hide it completely.  Upgrading to 2.12.1, just one day later, includes some minor <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/rails-dev/2018-December/014762.html">bug fixes</a> . </li><li>  The update to the task manager (HOT Tasking manager) was <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/updates/tasking-manager-update-new-version-released/">released</a> after almost 60 different commits were received.  Improvements include new layers for the mapping and task history panel, support for the markdown format in the task description and task card, as well as the implementation of a new function called <em>Expert Mode</em> , which will cover more complex mapping and verification functions. </li><li>  Simon Poole released the first beta version of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SimonPoole/diary/47174">Vespucci version 12 of</a> OSM for Android <br><ul><li>  It has a new <em>simple mode of action</em> , which adds a large green button to add new functions, instead of a <em>long tapa</em> . </li><li>  Supports Maproulette. </li><li>  Adds an <em>intent</em> , which means that any geo: URLs can be opened directly using the OSM application of your choice. </li></ul><br></li></ul><br><h2>  Do you know ‚Ä¶ </h2><br><ul><li>  ... about the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/BuildingsTools">BuildingsTools</a> plugin for the JOSM editor created by the Upliner member, which improves the quality of OSM data?  You can draw ordinary rectangular or round buildings by simply pressing <code>b</code> and 3 or even 2 mouse clicks!  Accurate and fast! <br>  The <code>Ctrl-Alt-B</code> combination opens the settings panel with parameters for changing the shape, type of buildings, and more. </li><li>  ... about the <a href="http://streak.osmz.ru/">OSM Streak</a> website?  OSM Streak is a game contest that motivates you to complete small OSM tasks every day and earn points for completing them.  The goal is to motivate cartographers to edit OSM as often as possible. </li><li>  ... about a list of <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">quality tools</a> that you can use to improve data in OSM? ... how can you fill in the missing addresses in your area with MAPS.ME?

The following subjects were studied for 3 days: OSM, QGIS and open data. </li><li>  Jennings Anderson (Jennings Anderson) <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Jennings%2520Anderson/diary/47133">wrote</a> in his blog about the seminar on data analysis, which he and Seth Fitzsimmons (Seth Fitzsimmons) held at the conference <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_Of_The_Map_U.S._2018">SotM US 2018</a> .  Jupyter Notebook used for quick, interactive analysis and visualization of OSM data.  In the article, he explains the preparation of datasets using <a href="https://github.com/osmlab/osm-wayback">osm-wayback</a> and <a href="https://github.com/azavea/osmesa">osmesa</a> , creating CSV files, and loading data into Jupyter. </li><li>  After Mapbox hired the Valhalla command from Mapzen, most, if not all, OSRM kernel developers seem to have <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Project-OSRM/people">quit</a> their jobs.  However, <a href="https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/5209">there are no official statements</a> from Mapbox about whether they plan to support both projects in the future. </li><li>  Tim Couwelier blogged about <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Tim%2520Couwelier/diary"><em>the road categorization - OpenStreetMap versus Flemish planning documents</em></a> , where he explains the differences between the categories in OSM and the categorization of public roads.  He points to generally accepted categories based on the originally intended road designation and differences in OSM, with its underlying principle based on actual use. </li></ul><br><h2>  OpenStreetMap Foundation </h2><br><ul><li>  Nicolas Chavent <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2018-December/005627.html">believes</a> that HOT US Inc.  wants to gradually dominate the OSMF board of directors.  Severin Menard (Severin Menard) <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2018-December/005643.html">continues to</a> remark that the two directors of OSMF had previously served on the HOT council, another current director of OSMF was the executive director of HOT, and another candidate for the current election is working for HOT and also a candidate for the current election of the OSMF is a voting member of HOT US.  Inc. </li><li>  The OSMF Council revised the decision of the Working Group on the data on the change of the borders of Crimea on OSM and <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/osmf-talk/2018-December/005577.html">canceled the</a> DWG resolution.  Accordingly, Crimea is included in the borders of both Russia and Ukraine: thus, returning to the mapping that has existed since 2014.  As was to be expected, there is a certain amount of comments on this decision: Ilya Zverev writes about this <a href="http://shtosm.ru/all/net-podozhdite/">in his blog</a>  SHTOSM.  Others believe that the way the decision was made did not meet the stated objectives of transparency.  Richard Fairhurst connects this with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openstreetmap/comments/a4yjo9/the_osmf_reversed_the_decision_of_the_data/ebk0d7l/">his perception</a> that for many years the OSMF Council has often not supported the Data Working Group volunteers. </li></ul><br><h2>  Humanitarian OSM </h2><br><ul><li>  The HOT humanitarian team <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/updates/building-disaster-resilient-countries-slash-cities-through-open-spatial-data-and-exposure-analysis/">wrote</a> about how OSM data will help determine the susceptibility of a region to natural disasters.  The model will be developed based on collected data and will improve the resilience of cities to disasters in more than 46 countries. </li><li>  <sup>1 The</sup> Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) suffers from an Ebola outbreak, rebel attacks and refugee movements.  According to the latest satellite images, the OSM DRC community is activated in North Kivu, and they also prepared the tasks of the HOT Task Manager.  In a letter from the HOT mailing list, Pierre B√©land <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/hot/2018-December/014662.html">summarizes the work</a> in terms of quality and recommends steps to correct problems and improve the quality of future cartographic work. </li></ul></li></ul></div>
