  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Imhofoto - socially recommendable photo service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/180/64a/e3b/18064ae3bb2f10df930e2d260185b663.jpg" alt="Imhofoto" align="left">  Good day, habra people! <br><br>  I want to draw attention to the newly opened service Imhofoto ( <a href="http://photo.imhonet.ru/">photo.imhonet.ru</a> ).  It would seem that what else can be offered on the toptan-melted glade of photo sites?  But in Imhofoto there are several important and quite new differences from similar resources.  First I will try to explain the essence of the problem that many have already encountered and are facing, which the service should help solve and is already solving! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We all know that a photo is easy to take.  A good photo is much more difficult to make (although I may be mistaken, someone takes great photos quickly and easily).  But among the whole variety to find something interesting and significant for oneself is practically impossible, or it will take a lot of time.  Yes, and simply weed out all the trash - is quite difficult.  Nevertheless, Imhofoto aims to solve exactly this problem.  I will tell about other important features below. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The principle laid down in Imhofoto is similar to the principles on which the entire Imkhonet project - collaborative filtering is built. <br><br><h4>  How does this work specifically in Imhofoto? </h4><br> <a href="http://photo.imhonet.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dda/fbe/9e9/ddafbe9e9ba2dd35815d3dd75e08cd34.jpg" alt="Imhofoto" align="left"></a>  First of all, all photographs are evaluated, and this is customary for many, including Imkhonet‚Äôs audience.  However, at once I will make a reservation that many photos are such that the hand simply does not rise to evaluate them)))) Therefore, indeed, those photos that are worthy of attention are evaluated.  And secondly, our recommendation engine is included in the work, which each registered user selects what he most likely will like. <br><br>  As a result, putting just a couple of dozens of ratings (this is done in a few minutes) - you can already go and enjoy the result :) For example, someone likes to watch pictures of girls (and this, by the way, is absolutely normal!), And, if he will evaluate them actively and a lot, and the landscapes are low and few, then girls will be recommended further ... :) You do not need to choose rubrics, suitable tags, wander around the authors, trying to find something similar, and so on.  Well, since everyone knows that users are lazy and a large percentage of them do not want to categorize and tag their pictures, and even more so to call them normally, such a selection mechanism works extremely efficiently !!! <br><br>  <em>Further, then nothing came up ...</em> oh :) (well, I like this phrase!) <br><br>  But still more ... On other innovations. <br>  It is important to note that it is on Imhonet that each user, in addition to the usual information (name, age, and other not always useful information), also has an evaluative, taste or so-called consumer profile.  And knowing who appreciates, how he evaluates your photos and works, you can very quickly and easily create a portrait of your admirers.  And what is most interesting is that through photos you can easily and quickly find interesting people.  So, Imhofoto is closely associated with the users themselves, whose rich background (count profile) allows them to more subtly recognize them. <br><br><h4>  What will happen to this section in the near future? </h4><br>  Imhofoto will be an important entrance to other related and unrelated sections.  Through photos you can easily find not only interesting people, but also places where you can go, what you can read or listen to!  Or all together: where, with whom and what to go to have a great time as much as possible!  :) And all this is only due to the evaluation of photos;) <br><br>  Your opinions, wishes, ideas are interesting :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69713/</a></p>
