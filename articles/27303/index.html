  <section class="page js-page"><h1>License for justice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Studying the details of the new law on copyright and related rights, the discussion in various forums came across his sharp rejection.  Yes, in principle, it can be understood, our people have been brought up for a long time in an atmosphere of "public domain".  Here, the polemicists could be divided into two groups: a large group ‚Äî those who oppose the adoption of such a ‚Äúraw‚Äù law, and a smaller one ‚Äî those who believe that now you can accept anything, and in due course the corresponding amendments will be made and all of us will be happy. <br>  My opinion here is a bit ambiguous, but no more than that, that is, the adoption of a more severe law is <strong>necessary</strong> ( <em>which is one of the conditions for joining the WTO, which, by the way, is a very dubious event</em> ), but I believe that the <strong>pirates "</strong> , Owners of <strong>questionable</strong> points of sale DVD, CD and videotapes (if they are sold somewhere else :) <br>  In our country, everything is still done through the place where the back loses its noble name.  And it will be that they wanted the best, but it will turn out as always.  <strong>"Pirates"</strong> and those who profited from <em>counterfeit</em> will remain on the sidelines to count the profits, and people who have spent the money to buy it (yes - yes, they also have to pay for it) will go to court, and if they are lucky they will get off with a fine. <br>  In general, this is a very slippery topic, I would even say <em>‚Äúholivarnaya‚Äù</em> , I will not continue to breed demagogy here, after all, this is not a legal forum, everything written above is like an introduction to a story I dug up on the net, <a name="habracut"></a>  . <br><h2>  License for justice </h2><br>  I finished the rest of the coffee, opened the electronic wallet, dialed the personal identification code and clicked the dial icon with his little finger.  It turned out that before the anniversary evening of the alumni meeting of our class, there were exactly fourteen minutes left.  There was a jerky signal, and a warning window popped up on the screen: ‚ÄúThe license for using the solutions of the exact time service expires in two hours and thirty-eight minutes.  Would you like to register a payment now ([Y] / n)? ‚ÄùI did not want to, and slam the lid on.  The feeling of impending danger only injected an extra dose of adrenaline. <br><br>  The transparent doors of the information room smoothly parted, and Anna Petrovna appeared on the threshold. <br><br>  Most of all she looked like that bitch, whom I managed to remember her.  Those predatory lips.  The same look piercing to the bladder.  The same hair gathered on the back of the head in a cow cake.  The same dismissive-haughty gait dried roach from the board of trustees.  Only aged ten years, of course.  In her hands she held a big brown box.  Out of habit, I jumped to my feet.

      ‚ÄúSit down, don't get up,‚Äù the teacher nodded me back in place with a nod.  - How nice that you still wrote a letter and announced his desire to come.  This, - she put the box on the table, - cake.  Chocolate, your favorite.  I baked it myself. <br><br>  I thought that the last sentence she could not pronounce.  If it were not so, damn it for two, I would now waste time. <br><br>  She sat down next to her, tilted the coffee pot over my empty cup and asked: <br><br>  - Did you notice how our school has changed? <br><br>  ‚ÄúYeah," this time came to nod to me. <br><br>  - Four last-generation internet classes.  Escalators on all floors.  Three-dimensional anatomy room.  Gym gymnastics brain.  And all this, of course, solely due to subsidies received from the sale of licenses for intellectual property. <br><br>  I said nothing.  In general, over the past ten years I have become less talkative. <br><br>  - In vain you pout on me.  It was made for your own good.  I hope now you understand that? <br><br>  I sat with coffee in my mouth. <br><br>  - Observance of the rights to use intellectual products is the greatest achievement of our time.  The law on licensing gave the future to our children.  Without its introduction into the public consciousness thousands of factories would be closed.  Millions of people would lose their jobs.  There would be no money left for medicine, the solution of environmental problems, social programs.  Failure to follow the basic rules of honesty ... <br><br>  She did not succeed in agreeing - the electronic board flared up, heated up, and on her seemed the joyful face of a young woman with a face of amazing freshness. <br><br>  - My God, Light Demushkina!  - Anna Petrovna rehearsed her hands.  I was ready to swear on the ‚ÄúRoad to the Future of Russia‚Äù that all of its morning was devoted to memorizing the names of former students in front of a digital mirror.  - How did we all miss you!  Well, how are you? <br><br>  The woman's face on the screen was distorted with a dazzling smile: <br><br>  - Everything is fine.  But I have long been Shikin, not Demushkin.  Since my husband and I have acquired a license to marry.  We moved to Paris, we have four children, a wonderful house and a well-paid job.  Thank you so much for the wonderful upbringing.  Hi, Nick!  - the woman winked in my direction. <br><br>  I waved a limp hand and looked at Anna Petrovna.  It seemed another millisecond - and tears of emotion the size of an ostrich egg would fill her eyes. <br><br>  A new window appeared on the screen with a strong-willed, tanned physiognomy of a young man.  Without a doubt, it belonged to Zhenya Malyavin. <br><br>  - Zhenya!  - Anna Petrovna choked with happiness.  - Where are you from? <br><br>  - Hello, dear our teacher!  I'm from Oxford.  Congratulate me: just that, just yesterday, I extended the license to write poems!  If you will allow, I will gladly send you something new. <br><br>  - Of course!  - followed by another bout of joy.  - Are you still asking ?! <br><br>  And at this very time, in the third window, another white lady showed white teeth. <br><br>  - Nadya Yudin!  Oh, and in fact has not changed at all! <br><br>  - And I was afraid that you would not find out!  Thank you, I have all the best!  - the speakers burst out giggling.  - Imagine, I won a lottery license for ... <br><br>  I did not listen to this nonsense anymore.  I was sick.  I poured two aspirin tablets into my palm, washed them down with cooled coffee, and went to the window. <br><br>  Twenty minutes later, when the performance finally ended, I turned around.  The screen went out.  Anna Petrovna pressed a snow-white lace scarf to her eyes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù she sniffed, ‚Äúthey are fine.‚Äù  Understand, I just could not do otherwise.  On the day when I found you in the toilet, playing unlicensed Tetris.  I was forced to call the Morale Squad for Operational Punishment.  And the court sentenced you to ten years of correctional work.  Do you think I was pleased?  No, you tell me, I really need to know your opinion. <br><br>  The corners of the lips themselves formed some sort of bitter smile. <br><br>  - Anna Petrovna!  The problem is that you are not well informed.  Sveta Shikina can not currently be in Paris.  Three years ago, she did not have enough money to purchase a license to raise a fourth child.  As a result, the entire family was deported to the compilation camp near Redmond.  Without the right to use e-mail, of course - I enjoyed watching the bulging of her eyes.  ‚ÄúMore ... Zhenya Malyavina was caught reading a newspaper in a public place last fall.‚Äù  Without a license, of course.  And, of course, beaten to a pulp.  In the hospital it turned out that he had become a complete idiot.  The only thing he can do is to use the latest version of our wonderful operating system, the teacher froze with her mouth open.  - Nadezhda Alexandrovna Yudina was arrested at the moment when she used a brush, canvas and paints to make a pirated copy of the image of the monument to Yury Dolgoruky.  That is, directly at the foot of the monument.  Now, by the verdict of the intellectual tribunal, Nadezhda Aleksandrovna will draw banners for the needs of the government, the people and the happiness of the next generations to the end of her days. <br><br>  Anna Petrovna tried to rise from the table. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSit down, don't get up,‚Äù I tried to put in the gesture all the sarcasm I was capable of. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut ... But ...‚Äù she diligently picked the right words.  - But they committed a crime in the end!  They robbed us all!  A thief should ... <br><br>  - Absolutely!  - I enjoyed demonstrating the masterpiece of my dentist.  - A thief is the main enemy of society at the present stage.  Here we come close to the second problem.  The government, the people and every honest person believe that at the present stage the enemy is not worthy to be in prison.  The enemy must be destroyed.  That's why I came to you, dear Anna Petrovna, - I pulled out the service "Walter PC" from the inside pocket of my jacket and aimed at the teacher's nose.  Knowing that five hundred million people will see me in the ‚ÄúUser and Law‚Äù program, clearly, as it was once taught, recited: <br><br>  - Your license to make homemade cakes for non-commercial use expired a month and a half ago. <br><br>  And, holding his breath for a second, he carried out the sentence. <br><br>  A balding boss hologram appeared on the board: <br><br>  - Great job, congratulations.  We observed the whole department here - aerobatics.  In addition, this is your twentieth successfully completed task.  And if so, then I immediately sign a license for the right to hold the position of a certified justice engineer.  With the submission to the award of the Order of St. Olga.  Hope you understand what that means? <br><br>  Of course, I understood.  This means that no bastard now dares to send me proposals to extend the license to use the solutions of the time service.  Because from today I work for society officially. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Rus/Antipiracy/TellAStory/Stories/license.mspx">Source of this grafomansky creation</a> <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> I still think that there is a sense in it.  It's funny, but still somehow cold in my heart: "God forbid this will be !!!" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27303/</a></p>
