      10. <b>Splatterhouse</b> (PS3, Xbox 360) <br><br>  We waited a long time for the retro-rebirth of the Splatterhouse game.  She was detained many times and postponed her release date, but this fall we will get the opportunity to play it.  If you have not heard of the original <b>Splatterhouse</b> , then you should know: it was one of the very first games that was saturated with blood and violence!  Get ready to crush your enemies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5b46632e/c4c4361f/1a634e77/16320d96.jpg"><br><br>  9. <b>Vanquish</b> (PS3, Xbox 360) <br><br>  San Francisco was crushed by a laser from space, and only you, with the help of your cybernetic costume, can save everyone from the hands of terrorists and take away their weapons of mass destruction.  From the developers of <b>Bayonetta</b> , Vanquish comes to us - a third-person shooter with "classic madness from <b>SEGA</b> " throughout the game! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f821f7df/dea8b8b6/b0a06993/6cbfb961.jpg"><br><br>  8. <b>Enslaved</b> (PS3, Xbox 360) <br><br>  Why does everyone make the post-apocalyptic worlds dark?  Enslaved changed this by making the ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù bright and saturated.  From the developers who gave <b>Heavenly Sword</b> to the world comes the story of the brutal Monkey and the pretty girl Trip who are trying to survive together in a shattered world.  The game is beautiful enough to attract the attention of players, we hope that the plot from <b>Ninja Theory</b> will correspond to high frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a27e53a3/5b9c5f38/7d788096/9eeec357.jpg"><br><br>  7. <b>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2</b> (PC, Xbox 360, PS3, Wii) <br><br>  In the first part of Force Unleashed, the player received tremendous opportunities with a lightsaber!  But, nevertheless, something was missing ... In the sequel there will be an opportunity to chop off the limbs!  You will be able to destroy enemies with the most legendary weapons in the whole genre of science fiction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4b876ca9/ec5c709d/ee054b8c/bc8c6ba3.jpg"><br><br>  6. <b>Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit</b> (PC, Xbox 360, PS3) <br><br>  Remember how cool <b>Burnout was</b> ?  So, its developers took up the next part of the game <b>Need For Speed</b> .  These guys know how to entertain a player by including different modes in the game.  You really feel the thrill of the chase!  For this series, where there are first-class games in the racing genre, Hot Pursuit is not just a ‚Äúnext game‚Äù, but perhaps the best of all previously released.  We really hope so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/65140b05/9387483f/bbada613/56f03c91.jpg"><br><br>  5. <b>Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</b> (PS3, Xbox 360) <br><br>  If you are looking forward to the next part of the Castlevania series, then you should know that the Lords of Shadow developers took the best moments from <b>God of War</b> and <b>Shadow of the Colossus</b> games, mixed them together and got one big, interesting game.  As the game progresses, Gabriel Belmont will fight with various kinds of evil spirits, including werewolves and orcs.  Also, he will have to engage in battle with 30-meter giants who cannot be amazed without quick movements and deliberate actions.  Konami want to revive the game Castlevania, and most likely they will succeed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c85712aa/c85735cb/3ea15b6d/67f87dff.jpg"><br><br>  4. <b>Fable III</b> (Xbox 360, PC) <br><br>  Fable II was a great and memorable game, but Fable III will be much better than its predecessor.  This time, players will see the changes of Albion in accordance with their actions during the game.  It can remain a beautiful place with blooming fields and wildlife, or you can bring an industrial revolution into it with all its dirt and debris.  Also, the game will have the opportunity to have children and even marry any of your friends in multiplayer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5d8e4f99/673ee35a/a7b3b47f/988b37fb.jpg"><br><br>  3. <b>Call of Duty: Black Ops</b> (PC, Xbox 360, PS3) <br><br>  This is really a video game that simply can not disappoint.  Black Ops has already managed to hit us with some large-scale additions in the multiplayer game mode.  This is a detailed Theater Mode, and a comprehensive system of levels, and a radio-controlled car with a bomb fixed on it.  If you still do not have time to spend your best years playing <b>Call of Duty</b> , then get ready to do it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/49ad95ca/314ba4b0/684fe805/1d6f6450.jpg"><br><br>  2. <b>Gran Turismo 5</b> (PS3) <br><br>  How long have you been waiting for Gran Turismo 5?  This game is so expected that it is difficult to believe that it can finally be held in your hands.  Since the days of the <b>PlayStation One,</b> this series has become a phenomenon not only for gamers, but also has become famous in a more global automotive world.  What other game can boast of the fact that it has an impact on the industry with a turnover of billions of dollars?  Gran Turismo is not just a racing game, it is a real work of art. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/783b5600/d875ae73/cdcc980c/56e4934d.jpg"><br><br>  1. <b>Medal of Honor</b> (PC, Xbox 360, PS3) <br><br>  Medal of Honor is trying to establish primacy among all the war games that take place in modern times.  With the multiplayer developed by <b>DICE</b> studio (the very same pros who did <b>Battlefield</b> ), and the single player mode that looks like a real blockbuster, we can only tear the hair on the head in anticipation of this miracle. <br><br>  How nice to be a gamer.  For ordinary people, autumn is always slush under your feet, a gray sky and drizzling rain.  And for us, gamers - this is probably the best time of the year, because so far everyone is cold and complaining about the weather, we have real heat! <br><br>  <i>Worked on Release:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- text: Sergey Koryagin (Mr_SK) and Vladimir Saenko (Tahakaro)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- voice: Listentome</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- installation: Vladimir Saenko (Tahakaro)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Acknowledgment: Mikhail Rusakov for help in creating.</i> <br><br>  <b>We ask you to leave comments, it is important for us to know your opinion.</b> <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106442/</a></p>
