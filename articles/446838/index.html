We have at hand a ready-made system that provides the necessary flexibility and responsiveness to quickly solve measurement and <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanning-quality-control">quality control</a> problems as they occur. ‚Äù(Jon Gunner, Technical Director of Koenigsegg). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Cars Koenigsegg: Swedish design and bold technical solutions </h3><br>  The Swedish company Koenigsegg Automotive AB is the market leader in the niche of elite <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/bugatti-3d-brake-caliper">hypercars</a> .  Since 1994, she has been engaged in the development and manual assembly of ultramodern and high-class cars. <br><br>  The path traveled by Koenigsegg since its inception is truly incredible.  It all started on August 12, 1994, when a 22-year-old young man set out to realize his childhood dream.  Passion, ingenuity and inflexible will pushed him forward.  On this day, Christian von Koenigsegg decided to open his own car company.  All the circumstances were against him, but at that moment it was necessary to decide: now or never.  The idea was to create a sports car, which at that time did not exist and which (he was convinced of this) would be in demand.  Both of these factors, according to Christian, became the key to success.

It should also have a windshield that provides all-round visibility and good aerodynamics, short overhangs and two large air intakes of the cooling system on the sides, which will be located behind the center of mass to increase stability at high speeds.  The car will look spectacular and will be comfortable with a raised roof, and in the form of a roadster.  The transformation will take a few minutes, while the hard top gently fits inside the car.  As planned by Christian, the car should have a timeless appearance, which, like good wine, would only get better over the years.  Analogs of the concept of the car with a mid-engine layout at that time was not yet.  So the model was born CC8S. <br><br><blockquote>  HandySCAN 3D metrological 3D scanners capable of producing up to 480,000 measurements per second with an accuracy of up to 0.030 mm </blockquote><br>  Each subsequent Koenigsegg model carries this simple and effective proprietary code based on Christian‚Äôs original intent. <br><br>  Then there were five production models and the same number of Guinness records in the category of production cars - the Koenigsegg company quickly broke into the international arena and is not in a hurry to leave.  When Christian is asked what he considers his greatest achievement, he answers without hesitation: ‚ÄúFulfilling a dream!‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Measurement tasks and equipment </h3><br>  Before contacting Creaform specialists, Koenigsegg solved measurement problems with the help of leased equipment.  A four-meter Romer Arm manipulator with scanning and probe heads or a Leica Tracker tracker was used in combination with PolyWorks software.  Measuring and scanning systems were mainly used for: <br><br><ul><li>  analysis of the root causes of problems on the production line; </li><li>  comparison of physical parts with nominal CAD-models; </li><li>  equipment, commissioning and <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/reverse-engineering-3d-scanning">reverse engineering</a> settings to replace manual parts based on CAD data obtained using Catia V5R19 software for tooling and manufacturing. </li></ul><br>  Frequent malfunctions of rented equipment, significant costs and time constraints, as well as the intention to carry out 3D measurements on its own - all this led Koenigsegg to start searching for alternative solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0e/1b/no/0e1bnosufnouvwwllxy9xenmfui.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>HandySCAN 3D metrological 3D scanners capable of producing up to 480,000 measurements per second with an accuracy of up to 0.030 mm</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAfter comparative testing of all available measuring systems, we realized that Creaform products and solutions best fit our stringent requirements and operating conditions.  Being less sensitive to movement during scanning and measurement, Creaform solutions are better suited to the conditions of the production line, ‚Äùexplains Jon Gunner, Technical Director of Koenigsegg.  ‚ÄúWe decided to invest in HandySCAN 3D 3D scanner and Creaform HandyPROBE handheld optical CMM and PolyWorks computer-aided design and quality control software.‚Äù <br><br>  HandySCAN 3D <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/creaform-handyscan-3d-video">hand-held laser 3D scanners</a> provide an unprecedented level of accuracy and resolution along with a very high measurement speed - all in one portable device.  They can be used at all stages of the product life cycle: from concept and design to production, documentation, maintenance and repair. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOur investment in Creaform solutions was half paid off six months after purchase.‚Äù <br>  <i>Jon Gunner, Technical Director, Koenigsegg</i> </blockquote><br>  The HandyPROBE portable CMM measuring system, which does not require the use of a manipulator, is an alternative to traditional measuring manipulators.  HandyPROBE is a wireless CMM based on the principle of triangulation, which gives complete freedom of movement and can be used for both single and multiple <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/creaform-smeral-case">measurements of various parts</a> .  Tracking for this CMM is provided by the C-Track optical tracker.  C-Track tracker sensors also provide accurate HandyPROBE CIM positioning, continuous image acquisition and transmission, as well as data exchange with a computer and saving sensor parameters. <br><br>  Both systems benefit from the integration of TRUaccuracy technology, which is characterized by high measurement accuracy when operating under actual operating conditions - regardless of vibrations, instability or temperature drops in a production environment. <br><br><h3>  How 3D-measurement technology from Creaform helps a car company </h3><br>  The HandySCAN 3D 3D scanner and HandyPROBE portable CMM are now used in a Swedish company mainly to <a href="https://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanning-automotive-industry">monitor the quality of cars</a> , measure components and components and compare them with the CAD model, as well as identify root causes of problems, reverse engineering and tool calibration.  For example, when calibrating a tool at Koenigsegg, they use the HandyPROBE system to precisely adjust the nominal coordinates of the reference points.  Then, after fixing the parts in a snap, the operator scans them with a HandySCAN 3D scanner to compare their sizes with the CAD-model data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/_f/xo/me_fxohwk73h7d5xd5g4jb-0zhw.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>HandySCAN 3D helps reduce overall operator time and increase profitability in quality management or engineering projects.</i>  <i>Pictured: 3D scanning of the body of the Koenigsegg Regera</i> <br><br>  Jon Gunner is pleased with the investments in the Creaform system: ‚ÄúAccording to my calculations, our investments have already paid off half six months after the purchase, if we take into account the cost of renting equipment and improving product quality.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446838/</a></p>
