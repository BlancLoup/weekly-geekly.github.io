Although officially the products of this company are not sold here, but fans and users simply actively try to get a wooden Moto X or a two-part Moto G. The Moto line has so far been rich in only two models, but more recently another interesting device appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/66c/b9f/f2366cb9f10d9f28a32211b64d83843b.jpg"><br><br>  Motorola proposed a budget option that did not spoil the Android ecosystem, but on the contrary, even perfectly optimized it.  With the latest updates and guaranteed after sales service, Moto E attracts a lot of attention.  Motorola did what Samsung, HTC, LG and Sony could not do - release an Android device that would be pleasant for a new Android user. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  Moto E has a Snapdragon 200 dual-core processor, including an Adreno 302 video adapter, with a clock speed of 1.2 GHz and 1 GB of RAM, and also runs on Android 4.4.3 KitKat operating system without any add-ons.  The amount of internal memory is 4 GB, but there is support for microSD memory cards.

Here and in the box with Moto E there is nothing but booklets and charging.  There is neither a separate cable (it doesn‚Äôt unfasten from charging), or a headset.  And if the lack of a headset can be welcomed, since it would surely play disgustingly, as is often the case, then I would be happy to have a separate cable.  However, looking at the price, you should not complain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e2/9ad/726/3e29ad7263bc545446456f3b159a74ad.jpg"><br><br>  Noticed the absence of the inscription "a Google company"?  Yes, yes, now the company no longer belongs to the search giant, but was bought by its Chinese company, Lenovo.  But believe me, this did not affect the quality of the smartphone. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  Sam Moto E appears before the user tightly knit bar - with its size, it has a rather rather small thickness.  The case of the smartphone is a classic "boat" with a flat front surface, completely covered with protective glass Gorilla Glass 3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/163/f43/b61/163f43b616fd07a5edb87123c74380c7.jpg"><br><br>  In the lower part under the screen there are no familiar hardware buttons, almost 2 cm of free space is allocated there.  There would obviously be enough for a much smaller place, since the buttons of the Motorola Moto E are located on the screen itself.  Below is the main speaker in the form of an aluminum insert, although most likely it is just painted plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/792/30d/c18/79230dc18298064b06dc96737e68ddb7.jpg"><br><br>  On top of the distance and light sensor, as well as an indicator of notifications and missed calls.  Unfortunately, there is no front camera, even the most unpretentious.  Slot conversational dynamics is almost the same as above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a49/9a6/33a/a499a633af8f7036059b3749a2b33abe.jpg"><br><br>  The back of the smartphone is rough and very hard, all corners, edges and edges of which are rounded and beveled.  On the white cover will not be visible or fingerprints, or any divorce. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/342/72b/3f0/34272b3f002eaacfdce1feaa7eb5eddd.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover, as you already understood, is removable.  But the battery - no.  More precisely, removable, of course.  But with difficulty, with a screwdriver, etc.  And you definitely do not need it.  So the only thing you have to remove the cover is to install a SIM card and a memory card.  The lid is removed, well, not so hard, but not so easy.  Even the instructions advise to apply force when removing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caf/ac0/620/cafac062070cacd4e10400ccd8926bd8.jpg"><br><br>  The body itself is a classic "boat".  On the back of the camera window is located without flash.  And just below the branded sexual dimple, it is quite convenient to rest against her index finger during a conversation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcf/ead/f43/dcfeadf4311675db9c2bd7b50c8210f0.jpg"><br><br>  Near the headphone jack, the body is slightly sloping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9d/93f/8ca/d9d93f8ca0c036cd629436c9afedd110.jpg"><br><br>  And the entrance itself is located in the middle of the top face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/095/5e1/c8b/0955e1c8b45187a642c2ee15ac1dfede.jpg"><br><br>  The left side is completely empty.  There are no buttons or slots here.  The case is a bit thick, probably, the smaller dimensions of the case simply would not allow to fit such a battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ab/e54/7be/7abe547be7ee50b7c2b5bfc82def12c7.jpg"><br><br>  Controls traditionally located on the right side.  Here, next to each other are the lock key and the volume key.  The buttons are small, chrome-plated, they stick out quite noticeably beyond the body, and therefore they are easily touched blindly - there are no problems with this.  The keys move is quite elastic, pressing is distinct, besides the lock key is located not on the top, but on the side, which is much more convenient to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/696/6e3/596/6966e3596b23564e0c90a9af5f3da900.jpg"><br><br>  MicroUSB port, designed to connect to a computer and charger, is located on the bottom of the case.  This means that in the process of charging on Moto E speak conveniently - the cable does not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/189/33a/02f/18933a02ff426fe1769e223bf58a218b.jpg"><br><br>  Assembling all the details does not give rise to cavils: no gaps, irregularities, crunching or poking - the smartphone is felt in your hand as a small monolithic block without any hint of backlash and creaks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aff/671/5a7/aff6715a7ac79054b3c9e8d79cffbd9b.jpg"><br><br>  As for the customization of the appearance, covers are sold in different colors - black, red, green, blue or turquoise.  There are also options with a black front panel. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  Moto E has a 4.3-inch screen with a resolution of 960 by 540 pixels, pixel density of 256 ppi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/061/e87/0ed061e87c367236d90d8f58258f0834.jpg"><br><br>  The display brightness has both manual and automatic adjustment.  Multitouch allows you to handle 5 simultaneous touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57f/06e/18a/57f06e18a753569387d10f8aecb8c8b5.jpg"><br><br>  I would not say that the screen is really super cool, just a nice and pleasant display.  Viewing angles do not fail, the sensor is pleasant, the screen is slippery, there is an oleophobic coating, and the display remains readable in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2d/064/f8b/f2d064f8b3bfbed1415f09cb55371817.jpg"><br><br>  Motorola itself does not specify the type of matrix, but apparently the IPS display is used. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  Just want to say that you should not expect wonderful pictures from a smartphone.  Here the manufacturer really saved on the quality of the camera, and removed the front one with the flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c7/8ea/24e/0c78ea24e0ed0f559fa412a54a3f8665.jpg"><br><br>  But it quickly takes photographs with the ‚ÄúTouch Focus‚Äù function: you can click on a portion of the screen, after which the camera will focus on it and take a picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b5/348/c77/9b5348c776dd520685934fb79bf06bd9.jpg"><br><br>  The camera allows you to record videos 30fps in HD quality. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  On the device that came to me, Android 4.4.2 was originally installed.  However, I immediately turned it into Android 4.4.3 KitKat (the official update "over the air").  Soon, an update to version 4.4.4 should come, but in the future, and to Android L!  The phone is now Russified out of the box, you no longer need to put all sorts of patches and custom firmware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b46/c9f/301/b46c9f301b9e1bdb389b9dec73230e73.jpg"><br><br>  In general, pure classic Android, nothing particularly interesting, no heap of pre-installed software or anything similar to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfb/405/6f8/cfb4056f81aedd21ba057c7fca36e67a.jpg"><br><br>  Only there are a few proprietary utilities from the manufacturer.  Motorola Assist is able to transfer the smartphone to the custom ‚ÄúMeeting‚Äù mode (if it is on the calendar) and to the ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù mode (at the set time every day).  Motorola Migrate helps to transfer all messages, contacts, call history, settings and various files from your old smartphone to a new one.  In addition, the application can transfer all data from the iPhone.  A help Motorola contains everything you need to know about the phone smartphone, and in Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a4/ccf/516/5a4ccf5168da2f22cd1cb180bdc04a62.jpg"><br><br>  Alert has become a completely new application: it allows you to transfer your location at regular intervals to selected contacts.  If required, the application will notify you of an emergency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/328/ec8/63f/328ec863f8d9d05a315302d52ef90e74.jpg"><br><br>  The rest of the applications are already familiar to us from the Moto G and Moto X models. This is a gesture-enabled camera for quick access to the gallery and features, as well as an instant click-to-shoot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f9/c65/49c/2f9c6549cd317eda0cbe76b12474a5f4.jpg"><br><br>  And your own camera app with three photo viewing modes (Camera Gallery, Timeline and Albums). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/397/e9e/a67/397e9ea675e748cd7567de54e98030d5.jpg"><br><br>  Pleased with the presence of switching from Dalvik to ART and back.  It is hidden in the developer menu, which, in turn, is not shown in the system initially.  How to call it?  Very simple.  Go to the menu item "About phone" and <s>dance the tambourine</s> seven times <s>with a tambourine and</s> click on the Build number. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone works as standard in modern 2G GSM and 3G WCDMA networks;  there is no support for fourth generation networks (LTE).  The communication capabilities of the device are realized, as they say, without excesses: neither the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band, the NFC technology, nor the connection of external devices to the USB port (USB Host, OTG) are supported here either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a60/22d/f4a/a6022df4aae561464301e82fe090bdfa.jpg"><br><br>  Wi-Fi is single-band and supports 802.11 b / g / n standards, there is also Bluetooth 4.0.  There is a quadband UMTS / HSPA + that supports speeds up to 21 Mbps.  Navigation is done using GPS or GLONASS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/201/9ae/a81/2019aea81d54482cceaf8d6e7fc35d10.jpg"><br><br>  Those who want to buy a cheap smartphone with LTE, I recommend to pay attention to the new version of Moto G, which will cost a little more, but will receive not only LTE support, but also a microSD slot. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The lack of your own ‚Äúvoracious‚Äù user interface can be written into benefits.  Therefore, even a relatively weak SoC is enough for comfortable work under Android.  We did not find any jerks or delays when switching between the Home screens, and the application load time also remained quite acceptable.  In this respect, a Snapdragon 200 processor with two cores is enough.  After all, not always a powerful filling gives greater speed in the operation of the interface.  And here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3P9vDAY0U0A">an example</a> (Moto E vs. Samsung Galaxy S5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cb/fc9/3d9/2cbfc93d923535fc7ecbb82072d52440.jpg"><br><br>  If you do not go into details, you can simply look at the results of the AnTuTu Benchmark test, which says "... General level, but you are doing better and better."  This is the way things are in practice - the smartphone works at the usual level, desktops scroll smoothly, simple applications run well.  But in heavy games on this smartphone will not bring you pleasure.  Below you can see the results of benchmarks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49b/ad6/ed3/49bad6ed39d8c05f3bd8329ac118d73e.jpg"><br><br>  Adreno 302 is not the fastest video adapter, but you can still play games, even three-dimensional ones, if not at maximum settings.  True, the smartphone at the same time noticeably warms up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76f/10e/f4b/76f10ef4b0d728f325fc3e1de4dfd126.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41b/e94/f49/41be94f497461169bfe98e1ec13a9083.png"><br><br>  Simple arcade games are easy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b78/6e3/80b/b786e380b8305c82ec0a2c5d978570bb.jpg"><br><br>  Productivity Moto E is enough for any everyday tasks, and for such money to demand more and can not, with the exception of Chinese devices.  In conjunction with an optimized operating system, everything here works quickly and smoothly, which is not always possible to observe among competitors. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  The capacity of the lithium-ion battery installed in the Motorola Moto E is 1980 mAh.  Smartphone Moto E will easily last all day, and with economical use it can be stretched for a couple of days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9c/f68/a01/d9cf68a01e1e9c7556c5749d66e532fe.jpg"><br><br>  In talk mode, Moto E lasted 16 hours and 38 minutes.  Browsing the web planted the battery after 9 hours.  With continuous video viewing, the device was discharged in 6.5 hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  Moto E as a whole is not much different from other budget devices, but some of its features make it necessary to turn his gaze to this particular model.  The smartphone offers one of the best in its class display, stable operation of an unaffected and modern version of Android, as well as a perfectly assembled durable case.  The device turned out to be very successful, and only the rear camera and the lack of a front camera are saddening only.
