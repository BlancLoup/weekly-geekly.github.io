  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About interesting projects put in a word</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, something has intensified the confrontation of developers who want to leave for free bread and managers, whom life is not nice without staff.  Perhaps, I just began to pay more attention to these dialogues.  Anyway, I would also like to express my opinion on the designated topic, add, as they say, five drops of <a href="http://blog.nekt.ru/topic/19">wisdom</a> in the <a href="http://blog.nekt.ru/topic/19">tincture of wisdom</a> :). <br><br>  Despite the fact that I am a web developer, I will not support my comrades in misfortune that they want to leave their uncles.  Not so much because I am such an individualist of myself, as I do not like the arguments presented by ‚Äúleaving for free bread‚Äù.  But let's get everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What are the developers leaving their work? <br>  What drives them to drastically change their lifestyle? <br>  Why working for another company is not an alternative for them? <br>  All these questions seem to me much more important than questions about where to go.  UFO for a couple with my intuition suggest that the developers are not leaving because of low wages.  Not because of conflicts with the authorities.  And not even because of the tired schedule of work.  They leave from projects.  From the muddy stream of annoying projects. <br><br>  I think everyone here is aware of what feeds the lion‚Äôs share of web developers.  These are sites based on various site management systems.  Maybe with one or two "special" requirements.  To stretch some standard or semi-standard template and trim it.  No flight of fancy.  And even if the space is to think about some non-standard task, the customer will quickly cut off the wings with his weighty ‚ÄúI want‚Äù.  Gloom isn't it

      Does everyone understand what these developers wanted to come to when they chose IT as their professional sphere?  Just do not tell me that they wanted to sit at the assembly line and rivet sites - I never believe in life.  Surely they wanted to create and build.  Explore and invent.  <i>At least that's what still attracts me in IT :)</i> .  Dreams were not at all like reality.  It's sad. <br><br>  Even more sad is what the developer will do, giving up a stable salary and being seduced by independence from his uncle - he will do exactly the same sites, just as all his flights will be cut off ‚ÄúI want‚Äù.  Another thing is that now this ‚Äúwant‚Äù he will hear from the mouth of the customer directly, and not the manager.  I am sure that this kind of work will quickly get sick - you will not get away from annoying projects in this way. <br><br>  What to do?  Strange as it may sound, but I will suggest to engage in interesting projects.  If the project is interesting, it is not so important whose projects it will be - whether it will be your own startup person or someone else's startup.  The only question is how interesting this project will be. <br><br>  It does not matter whether you get a salary for an interesting project, or you hope to make money on this project in the future.  All the same, treat him as his.  And if you work on something your own, then the question ‚Äúfor whom to work?‚Äù Immediately retreats to the background.  In the first place, the question ‚Äúon what to work?‚Äù Comes up with an unequivocal answer - on what is interesting. <br><br>  So, gentlemen comrades.  No need to work on uncle.  Do not work for yourself.  Just work on what interests you. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25051/</a></p>
