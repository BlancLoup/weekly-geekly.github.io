The fact that it should be released a new version was clear at the end of last year, when the company published sales results.  Even then it was clear that in order to maintain such rates and popularity, some kind of novelty is needed. <br><br>  As it always happens when some new devices from Apple come out, now the Internet is full of rumors and all sorts of predictions, 90% of which will eventually turn out to be wrong.  So I‚Äôm already been under the influence of the Western and our Russian-language press writing about the iPhone for a week.  They say very different, in many ways the information contradicts. <br><br>  At first, the version that they would be released immediately seemed somewhat implausible to me, but more and more they are talking about it.  Still, maybe it will.  Several versions are: simple with 4 gig.  memory, less capacious battery, without video support, without 3G;  powerful with 32 gig.  memory, support for 3G more capacious battery.

      There is also information that the first (4 gig.) Will be sold freely, without binding to a specific operator, and the second (32 gig.) Only with reference to the operator (AT &amp; T in the US), but the opportunity to buy cheaper when signing a contract for 2 of the year. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Innovations</strong> <br><br>  A week ago, the most readable Western blog about gadgets Engadget said: they got the data that the new iPhone will support 3G, will have GPS.  Also reported that the phone does not change in appearance.  But just today there was information that the new model will be 2.5 mm.  thinner than the first and change the screen size. <br><br>  And the unofficial, but very popular, Apple publication about Appleinsider yesterday wrote that the second-generation iPhone will weigh 30-40 grams less than the first (158 grams prtiv 120-130 grams).  They also reported that the diagonal of the new device will be only 2.8 inches (the old 3.5). <br><br>  What or who to believe is unclear.  Let's see what they say yet. <br><br>  <strong>release date</strong> <br><br>  There are also several options.  You can say for sure that it will be from mid-May to late June, most likely in mid-June.  One option is June 9th.  Presentation of the new iPhone can be held at the WWDC conference, which will be held in San Francisco on June 9-13. <br><br>  There is also a version that the release of the new apparatus will take place on the anniversary of the release of the first, that is, June 29.  In principle, it is also quite possible. <br><br>  But now it is already known that Apple ordered the production of a new phone from Foxconn, which released its first version.  This was recently written by the newspaper Chinese newspaper Commercial Times.  In addition, they became aware that by the beginning of June, according to the terms of the contract, at least 3,000,000 vehicles should be supplied, and a total of at least 25,000,000. <br><br>  <strong>IPhone 3G Tests</strong> <br><br>  At the end of April, a rumor appeared in the network that Orange France, a French mobile operator, began testing the iPhone with 3G support.  A few days ago, the same news was published about American AT &amp; T. <br><br>  <strong>The name of the new model</strong> <br><br>  At first it was just a Macbok, then a Macbook Pro appeared, then a Macbook Air.  At first there was just an iPod, then the iPod Mini, the iPod Shuffle, the iPod Touch, etc. appeared.  Therefore, it would be logical to assume that the new version of the iPhone will get some name.  On this, too, there are many opinions. <br><br>  For example, the iPhone 3G version seems to be the most plausible (due to the introduction of 3G standard support).  The names of iPhone Black, iPhone White, iPhone Red seem to be less possible (this if there are several variants of different colors).  For the version with improved functionality and capabilities, the names of the iPhone Pro or iPhone Max seem to be the most realistic.  The iPhone Shuffle is supposed to be called a simpler version. <br><br>  But, again, even novelties are unknown now, which will be there, it is unknown how many of them will be and what they will be, or maybe only one new version. <br><br>  <strong>What about prices?</strong> <br><br>  A few days ago, Fortune Magazine announced that it would be possible to buy a new version of the iPhone $ 200 cheaper than the current one with the condition of signing a contract with the AT &amp; T operator.  It turns out that the new iPhone 8 gig.  can be bought for $ 199, the new iPhone 16 gig.  for $ 299 (but if you count at current prices). <br><br>  As for the rest, nothing is yet known.  Most likely, prices will be the same as now, in different countries, different depending on the operator and the new models that will be released. <br><br>  <strong>This is not all ...</strong> <br><br>  One feels that such a large number of different rumors and unconfirmed information every day will go on the Internet until the release of the new iPhone.  This is all his fans are looking forward to. <br><br>  And I will follow all the news and try not to go crazy :) <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.onegadget.ru/og/411">OneGadget.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24596/</a></p>
