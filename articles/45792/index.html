For example, even if a single operator connecting to gas will accept applications through Morse code only, forced consumers will access it. <br><br>  The situation is completely different in a competitive market. <br><br>  If 10-15 years ago an active young man was an active user, today it is almost all age categories.

      Although still, for a large number of people, the usual source of information is the print media and they don‚Äôt fit browsers for a cannon shot - but they are not the goal of the creators of literate websites and online services - the goal is for those who are comfortable with another source, namely the Web. <br><br>  It is not the size of the business that determines the need and desire to order a good ‚Äúadult site‚Äù, but an understanding of how to attract the Internet audience and, most importantly, the understanding that IT is. <br>  It happens that a small production company in the field of small business has a better website than a bank, a factory or an auditing company. <br>  There are a huge number of companies financial, industrial, etc.  sectors where sofas at the reception cost are several times higher than their sites - and all because people who come to them in the office are tangible, and their own Internet audience does not exist for them. <br><br>  Most often this happens when the head of the retrograde itself lives outside the Internet, and there is no employee in the company who has the authority and budget to say - OUR CUSTOMERS USE THE INTERNET They need a good website.  So it turns out that the degree of importance of the Internet audience for the company is directly proportional to the services that are created for it. <br><br>  Customers of ‚Äúadult sites‚Äù, due to the awareness or intuitive understanding that a good product made for them cannot be cheap, more clearly trace the connection between customer needs for obtaining information via the Internet and ways to meet these needs, unlike those who are satisfied. Inappropriate or has nothing at all. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAdult site‚Äù means a different level of ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù and a different degree of integration into the information life of the Customer‚Äôs company.  It is not even about design (there is no friend to the taste and color - although there are still general principles on the perception of aesthetics), but about tools for managing information flows for clients. <br><br>  A website is a logical hub that distributes information flows between your company and customers; the better it is made, the more tangible this two-way communication. <br><br>  And since, upon closer inspection, the discreteness of information is different for everyone, the curators of information in companies are also different, then the implementation of services is also different for different companies. <br><br>  Only an approach to design and development, a set of necessary principles, but not the final implementation. <br><br>  I can be accused of bias and the fact that I, as a specialist, need a website for any company to dream in a dream - this is not so. <br><br>  A site, for example, does not need a small clothing store until it starts selling such a type of clothing that is easy to select via the Internet and does not provide a painless order, payment for delivery and a discount.  For example, it may be children's clothes (sizes by age - the choice is clear).  Those.  for the emergence of an adequate need for a website at such a store, a number of complex tasks must be solved - preparation of materials - good descriptions and photographs, billing, logistics, etc. thought out.  - the site is just a platform for the order - and it is desirable that it was professional.  Otherwise, the Internet will not want to order anything to the consumer, because he will not figure out how to do it, or will not find the right product, or the appearance will not inspire confidence. <br><br>  The absence of a site is not critical for a small cafe, who does not have a budget for a good image site, unlike a luxury restaurant, until it does catering or delivery of dishes to order. <br><br>  The format of the company's services directly determines the ability to satisfy the needs of customers for information, including through Internet services.  And as soon as such a service arises, the need for information access to it should be satisfied by professionals, and not groups of enthusiasts creating ‚ÄúNEDO services‚Äù. <br><br>  There are a huge number of companies whose services have long been subject to internetization, who today have already lost those who use the browser to work with information, and lose those who come to this tomorrow, if they do not bother with their web representation. <br><br>  By itself, the site is cheap or expensive without the full use of the customer is just the address on the network.  You need to know how to work with him.  Just if it is done poorly, it‚Äôs bad to work with it, and in some cases there is simply no even the functional capabilities to do what is necessary. <br><br>  A good driver will come from ‚ÄúA‚Äù to ‚ÄúB‚Äù at the tinted six, but if he is carrying his status clients or investors, and it‚Äôs not about buying a box of Abkhazian tangerines, but about building a cottage village, not a fact that passengers will want to invest in the project, with such transport from the developer. <br><br>  Although a convenient online service does not have to be individual and expensive for the end user. <br>  If it closes the same basic need for a large group of people, but it was initially professionally created, working with it may cost a little or be free at all if developers use alternative ways of monetization. <br><br>  I do not claim that the speed of creation and the price of the service \ product is the most important criterion separating a decent online service \ product from the unworthy. <br><br>  This criterion is important in relation to the final product and the tasks it solves. <br><br>  As an example of a convenient and generally free online service is the creation of an email account - especially for those who even today use only fax (there are still such :-)). <br><br>  Moreover, there are still companies and people (for example, a certain Ivan Ivanovitch) who, within the course of the ‚ÄúEnlightenment of Dummies‚Äù course, get them e-mail, change cartridges, etc.  for a fee. <br><br>  Mail account starts in a couple of minutes in Gmail, mail.ru, mail @ yandex, etc.  - but for this, a large team of professionals worked on the creation of a huge convenient mail system.  And this Ivan Ivanovich from the ‚Äúteapot Peter Petrovich‚Äù can take a couple of hundred rubles for the services of an enlightener. <br><br>  But after all, it does not occur to anyone for these couple of hundred rubles to make, and most importantly, order development, an analogue of Gmail, mail.ru, mail @ yandex, etc.  for the same couple of minutes, well, or days - that‚Äôs a lot of work ... :-). <br><br>  Thus, registering a mailbox on Gmail in a couple of minutes, yourself, or by means of Ivan Ivanovich, you receive a high-quality online product, but if during the same period and price you ‚Äúsupposedly developed‚Äù your personal mail service a la Gmail, then you became honorary holder of "Nedoservice". <br>  A convenient email account is the same for millions of users, and each account is the same.  Just because Petit's account performs the same function as Vasya's account, and their work is managed by the same, previously correctly done, system. <br><br>  In this case, ‚Äúfor free‚Äù, in a matter of minutes, you get a convenient, full-featured service - but this is the result of a HUGE professional work that did not cost a penny. <br>  And here the price (even its absence) and the speed at which you get the service is not at all an indicator. <br><br>  When it comes to any ‚ÄúInadequate‚Äù made in a couple of days or weeks, the principle of competent implementation of all technologies by the team is not being observed - because there is no such competent team, and if it were, then you‚Äôll have a competent service for you it would take much longer. <br><br>  Any "inadequate" is not an example of implementation, what should be implemented at least once from OT and TO, then we can talk about multiple and cheap \ free, fast application of technology, as described in the case of free email accounts. <br><br>  The customer acquiring "Nedosayt" acquires "Nedohotehnologii" and "NEDODrealizatsiyu" forces of "NEDoodalizatorov." <br><br>  Such "non-site" in a hurry, the conveyor method are done in a couple of days - a maximum of weeks.  At the heart of the crooked-working and crooked-expandable "box", disgusting design and even more disgusting programming and layout. <br><br>  The format of information to be universalized, especially for large enterprises, is limited.  Therefore, an attempt to pull the site on any "box" with a "template" that is sculpted for a couple of days at the exit and gives complete darkness. <br><br>  But even websites for younger companies, or even those who have just begun their acquaintance with the network, whose information could well be universalized, with the implementation of such ‚ÄúNEDO-realizers‚Äù gives the same effect - complete darkness. <br><br>  Only repeated use, once created by a complex technology, can reduce the cost of output with constant quality.  But for this, it is necessary that someone at least once make a prototype suitable for replicability. <br>  This is the basis of any industrial production. <br><br>  However, "Inappropriate" is an attempt to reinvent the wheel again and again, in conditions where the budget is only enough for the pedals.  Qualification of inventors, too, often on the verge of fiction <br><br>  A little more detailed thinking out loud in the <a href="http://blog.artsofte.ru/blog/post/id/53">studio blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45792/</a></p>
