  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to drown in a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtenders</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day, Habrasoobschestvo. <br>  Every day, organizations working in the field of state order have to look at hundreds of tenders, save information somewhere, track results somehow, make bids, ask prices from suppliers, etc.  Being one of such organizations, we gradually went through a mess stage and led this process to one remarkable system.  How?  Details under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First let me introduce myself, my name is Andrey aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hongten/" class="user_link">hongten</a> , the article was written in collaboration with Anya aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/anlouc/" class="user_link">anlouc</a> <br>  I would like to submit to your court and just a look at the small project. <br>  I was mainly responsible for its ideological content and the whole implementation and programming lay on Anya. <br>  The whole project is written and implemented in a single company where we work. <br><br>  So.  A couple of years ago, we (the name of the organization, if desired, is not difficult to find) have grown to tenders, and not just tenders, but to participate in tenders throughout Russia. <br>  It turned out that a lot of them, even soooo many.  At first (like everyone else) we printed them out and put prices on the piece of paper, Excel-Word-rate and request from the client.  Problems begin when you put in tenders for the flow.  Don't you remember client xxx honest?  And this client takes the "original"?  And then we participated?  Why did you lose?  And the link to the tender remained?  We had to rely on the memory of specific artists, which is not right.  Such problems are solved in different ways, some leave everything as it is and live in a mess, some are looking for specialized systems, we went our own way and the way turned out to be the right one.

      <br>
      To begin with, we simply structured the documents into folders on the server. <br><br><img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/931/98141099.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Original picture: <a href="">img188.imageshack.us/img188/108/37279860.jpg</a> <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù folder we threw everything for consideration, then those that were of interest to us were transferred to the ‚ÄúDecoration‚Äù, made out and sent.  The uninteresting were simply transferred to the appropriate folders with the regions, while sometimes links to the tenders themselves were lost, counterparties were duplicated and so on.  Gradually, this stage we have grown. <br><br>  Considering that the main work tool for us besides the Internet is 1s, we thought that we should make a ‚Äútender base‚Äù there.  Anya - break your head.  By the way, Anya is a 1c programmer. <br>  We will still consider the final version, which we use now, although you can call it final with a stretch, there are still many ideas. <br>  At once I will make a reservation that this system functions only in one organization and is completely sharpened for its needs.  The organization‚Äôs specialization is very narrow - original consumables, and that‚Äôs it means no computers, stationery, paper and other rubbish.  The rich and happy. <br><br>  Let's start with what we want to see.  The answer is everything!  And no less.  We want to know where, who, when and how buys cartridges.  Initially, the goals were more modest, but now there are no compromises.  Impossible?  Judge for yourself. <br><br><img src="http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4663/38220919.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Original picture: <a href="">img6.imageshack.us/img6/2864/36537517.jpg</a> <br><br>  Let's start with the main window.  Everything is implemented in the form of a directory. <br>  <b>Name</b> - somehow got used to put a month and small notes. <br>  <b>City</b> - this is all clear. <br>  <b>The contracting party</b> is the state customer. <br>  <b>Status</b> - and this is interesting, there are several of them: for review, we do, in the process of pricing, won, lost, track the result, sent a contract, delivery is completed and several others. <br>  <b>Winner</b> - the winner takes it all. <br>  <b>The deadline for submission of applications</b> is the actual date, and with an indication of a specific time, there were nuances that the applications ended up being accepted at 9 am, it is unpleasant because of such nonsense to lose the tender. <br>  <b>Comment</b> - where without them, everywhere its nuances. <br>  <b>Date of dispatch</b> (hidden in the picture) - the majority of customers accept printed applications, they don‚Äôt care about the law and progressive technologies, maybe you have an EDS (digital signature), but we need the paper version because we have half the money to buy cartridges we have, but we don‚Äôt have a system that allows us to verify the accuracy of an EDS for 5 thousand rubles.  Accordingly, the date of sending the application is equal to the deadline for filing minus the delivery time to a particular city.  In general, all the dates we request from the courier service.  We somehow had an attempt to score the delivery time in 1s and even pour the RF card there, the card was flooded, and with the deadlines there was a lot of nuances, yet at the moment it‚Äôs easier to ask them. <br><br>  So - in this general part of the list we can get a fairly decent amount of information. <br>  1) We can sort tenders by specific region. <br>  2) Sort out tenders for a specific customer without having to go to zakupki.gov.ru and other resources. <br>  3) We look at what tenders are relevant, how much to do today, tomorrow and so on. <br>  4) We can see who won specific tenders in a particular region. <br><br>  The main thing here, of course, <b>is the status system</b> .  About her in more detail. <br>  Here we need to understand how we work with tenders.  Initially, they are entered into the database (the client is put down, documentation is saved, deadlines are set) and they are assigned the status ‚Äúfor consideration‚Äù, the individual person responsible for the decision on participation views them and changes the statuses to ‚Äúdo‚Äù, ‚Äútrack the result‚Äù and other .  If the status is ‚Äúdone‚Äù, then the person who entered them into the database has already entered a nomenclature in the tender and changes the status to ‚Äúin the process of pricing‚Äù, as soon as the status has changed, prices are put down and documentation is issued.  Then we give the letter to the courier service and set the status - ‚Äúapplication sent‚Äù.  But this is not the end, most of it is limited, we check if the application reached the recipient (it happens that Aunt Lucy didn‚Äôt give it to Uncle Van, it happens that the documentation is spinning inside the organization for a week, and so on), if so, then we set the status ‚Äú waiting for the result "and not steamed up to the protocol.  Perhaps this will seem to you too sophisticated system, but in fact it is quite simple and easy to use, 2 people interact with each other and we control each stage of the tender preparation. <br><br>  Another caveat, how do these tenders fall into 1c.  At the moment, with pens, there is a person who looks at them and puts them there, since the specifics are narrow and this is possible.  As far as I know, it is possible to automate this stage, but this is quite global and our knowledge at the moment is not enough for this.  By the way, we bring all tenders to the database that we find, and not just those in which we participate. <br><br>  Already not bad, but this is not enough for us. <br>  What happens if you open a tender from the list. <br><br>  On the example of a lost tender: <br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/5097/60623753.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Original image: <a href="">img14.imageshack.us/img14/5614/20278415.jpg</a> <br><br>  <b>Files</b> - here we store the tender documentation, notices, quotation requests. <br>  <b>INN</b> - note that we slaughter state customers on an INN, so as not to duplicate them in the directory and not to score again each time. <br>  To the right of the TIN there is a special status - the <b>status of the Counterparty</b> , based on the history of participation, it can be: honest, dishonest, compatible, and several others.  Yes, yes, now we have a base of all corrupt officials and those with whom they work. <br>  <b>Consignment note SPSR</b> : we drive in the envelope number with the quote application to track the receipt. <br>  <b>Internet address:</b> you can open directly from 1c. <br><br>  <b>Request price</b> .  We put down the nomenclature which appears in those.  assignment.  Next, click "fill prices" and get the current official purchase prices (by the way, they are downloaded from us once every 3 days and change automatically depending on the dollar exchange rate).  Next we put down the sale price.  Additionally, there are visible remnants of goods in stock, how many of them are in reserves and how many have already been ordered.  Data is dynamic and relevant. <br>  By the way, here it would be possible to fasten a button with an automatic margin of 1-2-3-10 percent in order to get prices for a quote, but I just don‚Äôt remember when we last won the tender with a price higher than the purchase price, probably in others industries it is possible ... <br>  <b>Request for prices to the supplier</b> - initially it was planned to automatically send out with the table part of the tender to the specified email addresses, the thing is convenient, but unfortunately we do not use it because of the specifics of the work. <br>  <b>Order of the buyer</b> - if the tender is won, then by clicking on this button we can automatically receive the order of the buyer in 1s (account) where it is already possible to put reserves, from which we continue to push off in orders for goods to suppliers and sales. <br><br>  On the example of the won tender: <br><br><img src="http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/7691/48083542.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Original picture: <a href="">img51.imageshack.us/img51/4531/96376139.jpg</a> <br><br>  The delivery date is filled in here, the invoice for which the contract was sent, and the consignment note for the cargo when the delivery is completed. <br>  Also through the button to go, we see that the goods arrived, that the goods were sold, that the customer paid.  Everything is clear and informative. <br><br>  If you click on the ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù button, you will get: <br><br><img src="http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/4148/66035809.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Original image: <a href="">img100.imageshack.us/img100/6900/21637392.jpg</a> <br><br>  This print form can be directly inserted into the quotation request, almost without editing in Excel (there are some nuances about the fact that the names of the nomenclature must match). <br><br>  By the way, it would be possible to fasten the automatic loading of the nomenclature from the quote application here, but, unfortunately, the customers want what they want, then they write and name what they want. <br>  And still it would be possible to fasten an automatically filled quote application, but everyone has its own form. <br><br>  As a result, information concerning all stages of tender processing is consolidated in one program, always at hand and relevant. <br><br>  Do not judge strictly, I am sure that someone uses similar solutions, someone is better, and someone still writes on papers and wins tenders more than 10 times more than we do.  Thank you for your attention and special thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/akamuza/" class="user_link">akamuza</a> for the opportunity to share with you :) If you have questions, we will be happy to answer. <br><br>  UPD.
