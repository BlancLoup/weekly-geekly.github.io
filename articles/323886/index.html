  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO without happy end</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Alexey Leontyev, head of the website optimization department at Kokoc.com (Kokoc Group), will still have to deal with the site about why, giving the SEO work to the agency. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI know that your project X is progressing and that it has excellent results.  I want at least half of this result, ‚Äùthe climate systems online store addressed us with this phrase.  The project was given to the work of the site X optimizer, since he is already familiar with the subtleties of the subject matter and knows which tools bring results. <br><br>  After the SEO audit, they prepared a significant amount of recommendations on technical optimization, commercial factors, structure, content, and faced a common situation that can be described like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdc/8a3/a76/cdc8a3a768b7aafabaee482edeb9d939.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The client agreed to make minimal changes, completely abandoned the proposed structure and half of the recommendations on the commercial part.  He motivated this by the fact that the structure of the site suits him and is understandable to users.  In addition, the customer was not ready to invest in improvements to the CMS functionality, which were necessary for the formation of content and correct product names using case inclinations. <br><br>  As a result, agreed on the following: <br><br>  - correction of technical errors; <br>  - partial adjustment of the names of the goods; <br>  - small changes in the formation of the menu; <br>  - implementation of content generation without the use of cases and numbers; <br>  - partial adjustment of the price display format. <br><br>  Due to the full optimization, we planned to ensure at least the absence of a drop in traffic during the low season.  However, due to the refusal of the client to make adjustments to the structure and implement most of the recommendations on commercial factors, the changes have had little effect - traffic has increased by only 5-7% and could not level the seasonal decline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/e47/c95/e76e47c95de2bb7c486ee766dd7d5609.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The customer blamed the poor results on our incompetence.  But he gave us a probationary period of three months and a carte blanche for independently making any changes, some of which had to be made at the expense of the agency.  We decided on this experiment, despite the fact that we worked in the minus. <br><br>  And that's what they added: <br><br>  1. Implemented a structure collected according to search demand for all possible variations of search phrases.  For example, the category ‚ÄúElectric EVA floor convectors‚Äù was moved from 2 levels of nesting into the newly created categories: ‚ÄúConvectors‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúFloor convectors‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúElectric floor convectors‚Äù. <br><br>  2. Renamed products in the existing categories and gave the correct names to the newly created ones, according to the analysis of the top 10 competitors and search demand. <br><br>  3. Get rid of duplicates in the paginator. <br><br>  4. Implemented lexical libraries to generate the correct tag and text generation, customized them taking into account the use of keyword declensions in the necessary cases and numbers. <br><br>  5. Completely changed the structure of the navigation menu: removed brands, introduced the principle from the largest to the smallest with the division into general categories. <br><br>  6. Set up linking of categories and pages of the type: ‚Äúcategories + brand‚Äù according to specified rules. <br><br>  As a result, at the time of the primary indexation, traffic increased immediately by 3 times, and six months after making changes and further regular optimization - 6 times.  Naturally, the result satisfied the client and he paid for all the work done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1df/7ce/aac/1df7ceaac17c91b7c8b8a7f041bd9fc6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The story could have ended with a happy ending, but the customer decided to launch a new version of the site.  We have prepared a set of recommendations for the "relocation" so that the redesign does not lead to a decrease in traffic, in the hope that they will be taken into account.  But one day, the optimizer opened the site and discovered a new version, completely devoid of our optimization, with a lot of technical errors.  On the same day, we made recommendations on promptly correcting the situation with the division into priority of submission.  However, the client spread this process for a month, as a result of which the site lost 30% of traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/aa2/54a/adeaa254a08c83303aabd49115674f50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, we had to part in order not to waste time and nerves of specialists.  Naturally, the traffic data has not been known since, but we have not seen this site in the top of Yandex for key requests. <br><br>  What is this story about?  The fact that SEO is a joint work of the contractor and the customer.  Delay and refusal of work are fraught with a delayed result, which in the current economic situation can be fatal for the client‚Äôs business. <br><br>  Source: <a href="https://www.searchengines.ru/seo-bez-heppi-enda.html">SearchEngines</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323886/</a></p>
