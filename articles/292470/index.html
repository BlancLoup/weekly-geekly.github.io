  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do I think when I see certificates in the resume (for programmers)?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I saw a <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/15/07/09/2221211/are-certifications-worth-the-time-and-money">funny text about certificates</a> on slashdot.  The text discusses whether certificates are useful, or whether certification is a waste of resources (I do not discuss the situation when it is necessary because of laws or the harsh organization of corporate life).  But I have a third look at the situation: certificates are evil. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When I see a person with different certificates in a resume, I tend not to call him for an interview.  Since if he had time to deal with this nonsense, and he believes that this nonsense can help in the work, then he is a weak candidate.  About the nonsense in the work: if this is not the first job, then the candidate had experience in passing the interview, and he should know that at the interview <a href="http://2diggers.ru/performance-based-hiring/interview">some very strange, at first glance, things are</a> asked, and these things are not at all certified. questions. <br><br>  I had a story when I conducted an interview for a C # developer position.  Before that, the candidate even took a 3-month break to attend courses.  He and I did not speak very long: everything was rather sad.  When I escorted him to the elevator, he genuinely asked why I did not ask him questions about C #.  I was perplexed: all this time I only figured out how the memory in .Net works, about destructors and dispose, and other things that are really important in life.  The man was waiting for me, I guess, something about the CLR CAS, a very fashionable topic then (without some real use in life).

      The irony of the situation is that if he said he did not know C #, then I would talk to him about the algorithms, data and his past projects: the complexity of the tasks was, of course, not in the field of language.  I, of course, would not have taken it anyway, because, for example, he could not offer an algorithm for garbage collection (an elementary thing).  But the story is indicative of the fact that three-month courses have loaded a person with some kind of husk, and not real knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6a4/8b0/1b9/6a48b01b9abbcf6830baa0dd9647ff3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Probably just the courses were sucks.  I am sure that vigorous people like hipster schools, where everything must be done with their hands and themselves, are different.  But they also speak about their courses, as about the time when students actually make their portfolios for themselves, performing educational, but quite realistic tasks.  It‚Äôs about the difference: take a portfolio (I‚Äôve done a real thing with my hands!) Or a certificate (I was able to take a dubious test). <br><br>  And more about Coursera.  It‚Äôs nice to see such things in the summary: after all, when a person for fun &amp; profit listened in non-Russian language (Russian courses there are terrible) lectures, did homework, understood - this is a dream candidate, a person who teaches new things himself, waits for no one and besides it is efficient and curious. <br><br>  Here, however, it is necessary to make a reservation that it is interesting to me to see at it courses about Machine Learning and about everything that is even more for the outlook, new and around science.  I really really hope that none of the already professional programmers listen to courses on Swift, Rust, Docker or MongoDB, but simply go and read the dock, or am I naive? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292470/</a></p>
