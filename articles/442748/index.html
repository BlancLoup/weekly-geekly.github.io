      IntelliJ IDEA is usually perceived as ‚Äúwhere to code‚Äù, and not ‚Äúwhat can be encoded.‚Äù  But generally everyone can extend the IDE functionality with their own plugin - and Artyom Eroshenko described based on his own experience, which is good in the context of refactoring. <br><br>  Artem is well known by his previous reports about the Allure Framework.  In this case, everything is different: the word ‚ÄúAllure‚Äù can also be heard here, but not as the main topic of the speech, but only as one example (transition from the first version of Allure to the second). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6oryeeFZYc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Zelorochki in Selenium WebDriver </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alexey Barantsev</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/5Vvtbk3Hjyu8CEOcAMgOue/4e3f79436ed620d74049b72f25b2ceba/Aleksey_Barantsev_Zamorochki_v_Selenium_WebDriver.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  There are already a lot of reports, tutorials and texts from various authors about such a popular tool like Selenium.  But one thing is to listen to some speaker who owns this tool, and quite another is Alexey Barantsev, who has been participating in the development of Selenium WebDriver since 2011. <br><br>  When you see any complex project from the inside, you understand a lot of things that are not obvious from the outside: for example, solutions that may seem strange to users show good reasons.  And in this case, Alexei just talks about how the most "confused" situations are seen from within. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hjSu37gBSH4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Recipes for creating from scratch and development of a load testing system </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Anatoly Plaskovsky</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/1R4EZ2wlOUiCiWkmkOYwMo/5e2e65112f9a27f4b6959995f682a995/Anatoliy_Plaskovskiy_Retsepty_sozdaniya_s_nulya_i_razvitiya_sistemy_nagruzochnogo_testirovaniya.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  There are two things in people's ideas about load testing, with which Anatoly does not agree.  One is when this activity is considered to be ‚Äúnailed‚Äù to the subject area: it‚Äôs said that everything is so different with game devs and fintech that experience in one of these areas will be useless in another.  Another is when the words ‚Äúload testing‚Äù and ‚Äúwork on performance‚Äù begin to be used as synonyms. <br><br>  And both of these disagreements are reflected in the report: we are talking here about general techniques that can be useful in very different areas, and from the words ‚Äúworkload‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance‚Äù carefully choose the appropriate context. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0PRYqOP9po" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Testing systems with external dependencies: problems, solutions, Mountebank </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Andrey Glazkov</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/3g71Ubtk1WAu44ucEwKKA0/ff0810069c68bd5788e5772db4a8dc2e/Andrey_Glazkov_Testirovaniye_sistem_s_vneshnimi_zavisimostyami__problemy__resheniya__Mountebank.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Dependencies generally complicate testing, but some cases can be especially intricate.  What if your system must successfully interact with a stranger, which is being developed in parallel, and from a stranger you have neither code nor sufficiently complete data, but does it change in the process? <br><br>  Andrei Glazkov encountered the intricate cases himself and spoke about the experience he had gained: starting with how imitation of the actions of external systems creates a division into ‚Äústupid‚Äù and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù fakes, and the problems that arise at the same time (‚Äúthe code with which we we test, it becomes so complicated that bugs are already arising in it ‚Äù), and moving on to how problems were solved with the help of Mountebank. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kc4wLfBDYfI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Features of visual interface testing </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Anton Usmansky</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/1B5P0DZimME2mMuqWgWKcO/f98b53682d4ee88f54995dfe6a375e29/Anton_Usmansky_Specific_aspects_of_interface_visual_testing.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Tools for comparing screenshots will help you to notice if something went wrong in the interface.  But in search of this difference, they may find the screenshots different as well, where, from the point of view of the interfaces, everything remains the same.  What are these cases and how to learn to reject them right away without wasting time?  And what is the common situation when the automation signals a difference, but for the naked human eye, the screenshots look alike? <br><br>  Anton Usmansky himself is engaged in the development of Gemini and Hermione tools at Yandex, but the report is not specifically about them, but about the general principles of operation of such projects.  Earlier on the software-testing.ru appeared <a href="http://software-testing.ru/library/testing/testing-automation/3014-usmansky">text version of</a> this report. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crbwyGlcXm0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Thousand and one UI-bug, or How to teach the developer to avoid typical errors in the UI </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Ekaterina Mikheeva</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/1FmTUj8CEsEaUscWumEmaM/903d934f2a012196e0f79f9f3b225f75/Yekaterina_Mikheyeva_Tysyacha_i_odin_UI-bag__ili_Kak_nauchit_razrabotchika_izbegat_tipovykh_oshibok_v_UI.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Thanks to a popular <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/badoo/blog/317964/">post</a> about the number of Android devices required for testing, Habraw users can remember <b>Ekaterina Mikheev</b> .  In her new report, Android fragmentation is also mentioned, but the context is different. <br><br>  Sometimes testing UI is fascinating, and sometimes it is a routine fuss with stuffed teeth: the same errors occur again and again, and not so completely incomprehensible, and you spend time trying to fix it for the hundredth time. that "tsya / tsya".  What are these mistakes and what to do to not deal with this anymore?  How does this work affect the fact that sometimes people record someone on the phone as ‚ÄúDo not pick up the phone (deer)‚Äù?  And how can a robo-eye come out of an eyebrow? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7vwAIPaYQg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Rediscover exploratory testing </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Ingo Philipp</b> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHftO_-DEHt4%26list%3DPLsVTVVvrKX9t1xlDqeSHTVwhZvwvDTF7v%26t%3D0s%26index%3D4">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  If the words "automation testing" managers can light up the eyes, then the words "exploratory testing" they can go out: not only can you not transfer the work to robots, it is also difficult to formalize the process, but how can you save company resources? <br><br>  Ingo Philippe begins by asking why without this the company risks losing even more (‚Äúyou can automate the verification of those risks that we know about, but not those that we don‚Äôt know about yet‚Äù), and then move on to how to live with it ( for example, what is done with the same process formalization).  Probably, the audience‚Äôs assessments are partly related to the speaker‚Äôs ironic tone (‚Äútesting software is like washing a pig: a process without a clear beginning and end, where in the end you don‚Äôt understand why you got involved in this‚Äù). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HftO_-DEHt4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Tester Voyeurism, or How User Observation Will Help You </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Antonina Hisametdinova</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/4894wkgz7OqII8KuEqsgII/6528e0349fc5a90e56898c628afb0782/Antonina_Khisametdinova_Vuayyerizm_testirovshchika__ili_Kak_nablyudeniye_za_polzovatelyami_pomozhet_vam.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  This report on interfaces and possible errors in them is already familiar to Habra: we previously made him a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/436196/">text version</a> , so that you can not only watch it, but also read it.  So instead of describing just give a few comments habrapovateley: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúA delightful article.  I don‚Äôt even know to whom it can be more useful - QA or design-representatives ‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúAwesome post, nothing new, of course, but everything is gathered in one place and you can send people straight here, thank you‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúIt seems to me that this should be interesting for all developers who are at least confronted with user interfaces‚Äù </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3jxHyRANY4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  We have DevOps.  Let's fire all testers </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Baruch Sadogursky</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/1El9tLYNcJJLuLu7wu6wBW/390e1873254f226c079f2abb2a33fec0/Baruch_Sadogursky_We_ve_got_DevOps_Let_s_fire_all_testers.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Baruha is well-known to visitors of our DevOops and Joker conferences, but testers saw it for the first time.  Can a speech at the testing conference be good to take the floor, where the words ‚ÄúI'm not a tester‚Äù sound right at the beginning?  As it turned out - more than. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to make an important reservation: it was a keyout, that is, not a regular report in one of the three halls, but a speech that opened the conference for all viewers.  Therefore, it was not about the details of a particular tool, but about industry trends.  If the word ‚ÄúQA‚Äù is not in the word DevOps, then what does the widespread distribution of a devops mean for testers?  Do they need to fear for their jobs, when developers are surprisingly actively writing tests themselves? <br><br>  It is especially important for keyout that not only the material is good, but also the speaker is bright - and this is not to be taken away from Baruch, you will instantly recognize him from a thousand even by a loud voice, even by a colorful hat.  And in the end, he won the love of testers, taking second place in this rating. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8eH3k4BxV6k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  Extreme testing: tricks from the dark corners of mobile interfaces </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/ut4a3ciohj8i/8aNJSlZkLSA6AqMo6K8ce/5f0c6ad5ee5acf4e8fcb14df5832ff86/Vitaly_Friedman_Testing_to_extremes_Dirty_little_tricks_from_the_dark_corners_of_mobile_UIs.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  If the conference began with Baruch, then it ended with this performance, that is, both top lines of the rating were occupied by keynotes.  In this case, like Baruch, the charisma and charm of the speaker play an enormous role, and he is also not a tester: Vitaly is the founder of the famous site for web developers / designers <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> .  When the site teaches others how to properly do interfaces, it is not surprising that he himself has been carefully thought out - so Vitali knows a lot about interfaces. <br><br>  He has previously spoken at Heisenbug in St. Petersburg, and then gathered reviews like "this is not very testing, but it's amazing."  And now I came to Moscow, and this time the material of the speech was different from the previous one - but there was no less enthusiasm. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnmY7-oGnwU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  For those who are dozens few, more videos Heisenbug 2018 Moscow - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLsVTVVvrKX9vLSmWzEP77TSgZG1lZK76p">the link</a> . <br><hr><br><blockquote> If you liked these reports, please note: <b>May 17-18, the</b> next <b>Heisenbug</b> will take place <b>in St. Petersburg</b> .  In contrast to this, it will be possible not only to look at the reports, but also to personally ask questions to the speakers: each of them after his speech answers in detail in a special discussion area.  Already available details about the program - <a href="http://heisenbug-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D442748">on the website</a> .  Closer to the date, the program will become known more fully - but the price of tickets is gradually increasing, so buying them in advance is profitable.  And now the last days of receiving <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/callforpapers/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D442748">applications for the report</a> are coming, if you want not only ‚Äúto see others‚Äù, but also ‚Äúto show yourself‚Äù - respond! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442748/</a></p>
